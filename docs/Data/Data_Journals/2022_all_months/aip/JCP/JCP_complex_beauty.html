  abstract = {In the current study, multiscale simulation approaches and dynamic network methods are employed to examine the dynamic and energetic details of conformational landscapes and allosteric interactions in the ABL kinase domain that determine the kinase functions. Using a plethora of synergistic computational approaches, we elucidate how conformational transitions between the active and inactive ABL states can employ allosteric regulatory switches to modulate intramolecular communication networks between the ATP site, the substrate binding region, and the allosteric binding pocket. A perturbation-based network approach that implements mutational profiling of allosteric residue propensities and communications in the ABL states is proposed. Consistent with biophysical experiments, the results reveal functionally significant shifts of the allosteric interaction networks in which preferential communication paths between the ATP binding site and substrate regions in the active ABL state become suppressed in the closed inactive ABL form, which in turn features favorable allosteric coupling between the ATP site and the allosteric binding pocket. By integrating the results of atomistic simulations with dimensionality reduction methods and Markov state models, we analyze the mechanistic role of macrostates and characterize kinetic transitions between the ABL conformational states. Using network-based mutational scanning of allosteric residue propensities, this study provides a comprehensive computational analysis of long-range communications in the ABL kinase domain and identifies conserved regulatory hotspots that modulate kinase activity and allosteric crosstalk between the allosteric pocket, ATP binding site, and substrate binding regions.},

  abstract = {The promise of self-assembly to enable the bottom-up formation of materials with prescribed architectures and functions has driven intensive efforts to uncover rational design principles for maximizing the yield of a target structure. Yet, despite many successful examples of self-assembly, ensuring kinetic accessibility of the target structure remains an unsolved problem in many systems. In particular, long-lived kinetic traps can result in assembly times that vastly exceed experimentally accessible timescales. One proposed solution is to design non-equilibrium assembly protocols in which system parameters change over time to avoid such kinetic traps. Here, we develop a framework to combine Markov state model (MSM) analysis with optimal control theory to compute a time-dependent protocol that maximizes the yield of the target structure at a finite time. We present an adjoint-based gradient descent method that, in conjunction with MSMs for a system as a function of its control parameters, enables efficiently optimizing the assembly protocol. We also describe an interpolation approach to significantly reduce the number of simulations required to construct the MSMs. We demonstrate our approach with two examples; a simple semi-analytic model for the folding of a polymer of colloidal particles, and a more complex model for capsid assembly. Our results show that optimizing time-dependent protocols can achieve significant improvements in the yields of selected structures, including equilibrium free energy minima, long-lived metastable structures, and transient states.},

  abstract = {Light emitters based on the semiconductor alloy aluminum gallium nitride [(Al,Ga)N] have gained significant attention in recent years due to their potential for a wide range of applications in the ultraviolet (UV) spectral window. However, current state-of-the-art (Al,Ga)N light emitters exhibit very low internal quantum efficiencies (IQEs). Therefore, understanding the fundamental electronic and optical properties of (Al,Ga)N-based quantum wells is key to improving the IQE. Here, we target the electronic and optical properties of c -plane Al x Ga 1− x N/AlN quantum wells by means of an empirical atomistic tight-binding model. Special attention is paid to the impact of random alloy fluctuations on the results as well as the Al content x in the well. We find that across the studied Al content range (from 10\% to 75\% Al), strong hole wave function localization effects are observed. Additionally, with increasing Al content, electron wave functions may also start to exhibit carrier localization features. Overall, our investigations on the electronic structure of c -plane Al x Ga 1− x N/AlN quantum wells reveal that already random alloy fluctuations are sufficient to lead to (strong) carrier localization effects. Furthermore, our results indicate that random alloy fluctuations impact the degree of optical polarization in c -plane Al x Ga 1− x N quantum wells. We find that the switching from transverse electric to transverse magnetic light polarization occurs at higher Al contents in the atomistic calculation, which accounts for random alloy fluctuations, compared to the widely used virtual crystal approximation approach. This observation is important for light extraction efficiencies in (Al,Ga)N-based light emitting diodes operating in the deep UV.},

However, their physicochemical properties, such as the stability and interfacial charge of bubbles, are not fully understood yet. In this study, the kinetics of radii in aqueous microbubble solutions are experimentally investigated, and the results are discussed in the context of Ostwald ripening. The obtained distributions of bubble radii scaled by mean radius and total number were found to be time-independent during the observation period. Image analysis of radii kinetics revealed that the average growth and shrinkage speed of each bubble is governed by diffusion-limited Ostwald ripening, and the kinetic coefficient calculated using the available physicochemical constants in the literature quantitatively agrees with the experimental data. Furthermore, the cube of mean radius and mean volume exhibit a linear time evolution in agreement with the Lifshitz–Slezov–Wagner (LSW) theory. The coefficients are slightly larger than those predicted using the LSW theory, which can be qualitatively explained by the effect of finite volume fraction. Finally, the slowdown and pinning of radius in the shrinkage dynamics of small microbubbles are discussed in detail.},

By including the effects of light scattering, dye diffusion, and adsorption kinetics during sample preparation and the optical response of oxidized dyes, quantitative agreement with multiple transient absorption datasets is achieved on timescales spanning femtoseconds to nanoseconds. In particular, quantitative agreement with important spectroscopic handles—the decay of an excited state absorption signal component associated with charge injection in the UV region of the spectrum and the dynamical redshift of a ∼500 nm isosbestic point—validates our kinetic model. Pseudo-first-order rate coefficients for charge injection are estimated in this work, with an order of magnitude ranging from 10 11 to 10 12 s −1 . The model makes the minimalist assumption that all excited states of a particular dye have the same charge injection coefficient, an assumption that would benefit from additional theoretical and experimental exploration. We have adapted this kinetic model to predict charge injection under continuous solar irradiation and find that as many as 68 electron transfer events per dye per second take place, significantly more than prior estimates in the literature.},

  abstract = {The reactivity and selectivity of bimetallic surfaces are of fundamental importance in industrial applications. Here, we report the first six-dimensional (6D) quantum dynamics study for the role of surface strain and ligand effects on the reactivity of HCl on a strained pseudomorphic monolayer of Au deposited onto a Ag(111) substrate, with the aid of accurate machine learning-based potential energy surfaces. The substitute of Au into Ag changes the location of the transition state; however, the static barrier height remains roughly the same as pure Au(111). The 6D quantum dynamics calculations reveal that the surface strain due to lattice expansion slightly enhances the reactivity. The ligand effect due to electronic structure interactions between Au and Ag substantially suppresses the reactivity of HCl in the ground vibrational state but promotes the reactivity via vibrational excitation at high kinetic energies. This finding can be attributed to more close interaction with Ag atoms at the transition state close to the fcc site, as well as the tight transition-state region, making the vibrational excitation highly efficient in enhancing the reactivity. Our study quantitatively unravels the dynamical origin of reactivity control by two metals, which will ultimately provide valuable insight into the selectivity of the catalyst.},

  abstract = {The generalized Langevin equation (GLE) formalism is a useful theoretical fundament for analyzing dynamical phenomena rigorously. Despite the systematic formulation of dynamics theories with practical approximations, however, the applicability of GLE-based methods is still limited to simple polyatomic liquids due to the approximate treatment of molecular orientations involved in the static molecular liquid theory. Here, we propose an exact framework of dynamics based on the GLE formalism incorporating the energy representation theory of solution, an alternative static molecular liquid theory. A fundamental idea is the projection of the relative positions and orientations of solvents around a solute onto the solute–solvent interaction, namely the energy coordinate, enabling us to describe the dynamics on a one-dimensional coordinate. Introducing systematic approximations, such as the overdamped limit, leads to the molecular diffusion equation in the energy representation that is described in terms of the distribution function of solvents on the energy coordinate and the diffusion coefficients. The present theory is applied to the solvation dynamics triggered by the photoexcitation of benzonitrile. The long-time behavior of the solvation time correlation function is in good agreement with that obtained by the molecular dynamics simulation.},

  abstract = {We investigate the structural relaxation of a soft-sphere liquid quenched isochorically ( ϕ = 0.7) and instantaneously to different temperatures T f above and below the glass transition. For this, we combine extensive Brownian dynamics simulations and theoretical calculations based on the non-equilibrium self-consistent generalized Langevin equation (NE-SCGLE) theory. The response of the liquid to a quench generally consists of a sub-linear increase of the α -relaxation time with system’s age. Approaching the ideal glass-transition temperature from above ( T f &gt; T a ), sub-aging appears as a transient process describing a broad equilibration crossover for quenches to nearly arrested states. This allows us to empirically determine an equilibration timescale t eq ( T f ) that becomes increasingly longer as T f approaches T a . For quenches inside the glass ( T f ≤ T a ), the growth rate of the structural relaxation time becomes progressively larger as T f decreases and, unlike the equilibration scenario, τ α remains evolving within the whole observation time-window. These features are consistently found in theory and simulations with remarkable semi-quantitative agreement and coincide with those revealed in a previous and complementary study [P. Mendoza-Méndez et al. , Phys. Rev. 96 , 022608 (2017)] that considered a sequence of quenches with fixed final temperature T f = 0 but increasing ϕ toward the hard-sphere dynamical arrest volume fraction ϕ H S a = 0.582 ⁠ . The NE-SCGLE analysis, however, unveils various fundamental aspects of the glass transition, involving the abrupt passage from the ordinary equilibration scenario to the persistent aging effects that are characteristic of glass-forming liquids. The theory also explains that, within the time window of any experimental observation, this can only be observed as a continuous crossover.},

We show that the diffusivities conform remarkably well to the Arrhenius law in a wide range of temperature covering both the equilibrium and undercooled liquid regions. The activation energies for all the alloy elements with different bonding energies and atomic sizes are close to each other. The results suggest that the diffusivity in the multicomponent liquid tends to be homogenized by the components with marginal differences. This finding allows us to treat the different elements as a single type of atom, the pseudo-atom, for diffusional and maybe structural and physical properties in multicomponent liquids.},

This study uses classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and quantum chemical calculations, to investigate EFG fluctuations around a Na + ion dissolved in the ionic liquid 1-ethyl 3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate, [Im 21 ][BF 4 ], to provide a framework for future interpretation of NMR experiments. Our calculations demonstrate that the Sternheimer approximation holds for Na + in [Im 21 ][BF 4 ], and the anti-shielding coefficient is comparable to its value in water. EFG correlation functions, C EFG ( t ), calculated using quantum mechanical methods or from force field charges are roughly equivalent after 200 fs, supporting the use of classical MD for estimating T 1 times of monatomic ions in this ionic liquid. The EFG dynamics are strongly bi-modal, with 75\%–90\% of the de-correlation attributable to inertial solvent motion and the remainder to a highly distributed diffusional processes. Integral relaxation times, ⟨ τ EFG ⟩, were found to deviate from hydrodynamic predictions and were non-linearly coupled to solvent viscosity. Further investigation showed that Na + is solvated by four tetrahedrally arranged [ BF 4 ] − anions and directly coordinated by ∼6 fluorine atoms. Exchange of [ BF 4 ] − anions is rare on the 25–50 ns timescale and suggests that motion of solvent-shell [ BF 4 ] − is the primary mechanism for the EFG fluctuations. Different couplings of [ BF 4 ] − translational and rotational diffusion to viscosity are shown to be the source of the non-hydrodynamic scaling of ⟨ τ EFG ⟩.},

  abstract = {The intensity of light scattered by liquids has been studied for over a century since the valuable microscopic information about the molecules can be obtained, such as the anisotropy of the molecular polarizability tensor or preferred orientations of neighboring molecules. However, in modern dynamic light scattering experiments, the scattering intensity is usually disregarded, unlike in dielectric spectroscopy, which can be considered as a complementary experimental method, where the dielectric strength is routinely evaluated. The reason lies partly on the fact that the exact form of the equations relating the macroscopically measured light scattering intensity to the microscopic properties of the molecules is debated in the literature. Therefore, as a first step, we compare anisotropy parameters from the literature, calculated from light scattering intensities using different equations, with quantum chemical calculations for over 150 medium-sized molecules. This allows us to identify a consistent form of equations. In a second part, we turn to the depolarized light scattering spectra of 13 van der Waals liquids and some mixtures thereof, recorded with a combination of Tandem–Fabry–Perót and Raman spectroscopies, giving direct access to the reorientational dynamics of the molecules. We discuss how the strength of the structural α -relaxation is connected to the anisotropy parameter, what implication this has for the shape of the α -relaxation, how the components of a mixture—also for the case of ionic liquids—can be identified in this way, and how orientational correlation parameters can be extracted. Additionally, we point out for the example of n-alkanes that for highly flexible molecules, the reorientational motion might not be the decisive source of the depolarized scattered light. We also show that light scattering might serve as a sensitive tool to check the accuracy of a conformer ensemble obtained by quantum chemical calculations.},

  abstract = {The ability to design catalysis largely depends on our understanding of the electrostatic effect of the surrounding on the bonds participating in the reaction. Here, we used a simplistic model of point charges (PCs) to determine a set of rules guiding how to construct PC-bond arrangement that can strengthen or weaken different chemical bonds. Using valence bond theory to calculate the in situ bond energies, we show that the effect of the PC mainly depends on the bond’s dipole moment irrespective of its type (being covalent or charge shift). That is, polar bonds are getting stronger or weaker depending on the sign and location of the PC, whereas non- or weakly polar bonds become stronger or weaker depending only on the location of the PC and to a smaller extent compared with polar bonds. We also show that for polar bonds, the maximal bond strengthening and weakening effect can be achieved when the PC is placed along the bond axis, as close as possible to the more and less polarizable atom/fragment, respectively. Finally, due to the stabilizing effects of polarizability, we show that, overall, it is easier to cause bond strengthening compared with bond weakening. Particularly, for polar bonds, bond strengthening is larger than bond weakening obtained by an oppositely signed PC. These rules should be useful in the future design of catalysis in, e.g., enzyme active sites.},

Here, we present an efficient quantum-chemical protocol for predicting static 2D IR spectra that does not require any empirical parameters. For the calculation of anharmonic vibrational energy levels and transition dipole moments, we employ the localized-mode vibrational self-consistent field (L-VSCF)/vibrational configuration interaction (L-VCI) approach previously established for (linear) anharmonic theoretical vibrational spectroscopy [P. T. Panek and C. R. Jacob, ChemPhysChem 15 , 3365–3377 (2014)]. We demonstrate that with an efficient expansion of the potential energy surface using anharmonic one-mode potentials and harmonic two-mode potentials, 2D IR spectra of metal carbonyl complexes and dipeptides can be predicted reliably. We further show how the close connection between L-VCI and vibrational exciton models can be exploited to extract the parameters of such models from those calculations. This provides a novel route to the fully quantum-chemical parameterization of vibrational exciton models for predicting 2D IR spectra.},

  abstract = {Quantum mechanics has a deterministic Schrödinger equation for the wave function. The Göttingen–Copenhagen statistical interpretation is based on the Born Rule that interprets the wave function as a “probability amplitude.” A precept of this interpretation is the lack of determinism in quantum mechanics. The Bohm interpretation is that the wave function is a source of a field experienced by the electrons, thereby attributing determinism to quantum theory. In this paper, we present a new perspective on such determinism. The ideas are based on the equations of motion or “Quantal Newtonian” Laws obeyed by each electron . These Laws, derived from the temporal and stationary-state Schrödinger equation, are interpreted in terms of “classical” fields whose sources are quantal expectations of Hermitian operators taken with respect to the wave function. According to the Second Law, each electron experiences an external field—the quantal Coulomb-Lorentz law. It also experiences an internal field representative of properties of the system: correlations due to Coulomb repulsion and Pauli principle; the density; kinetic effects; and an internal magnetic field component. There is a response field. The First Law states that the sum of the external and internal fields experienced by each electron vanishes. These fields are akin to those of classical physics: They pervade all space; their structure is descriptive of the quantum system; the energy of the system is stored in these fields. It is in the classical behavior of these fields, which arise from quantal sources that one may then speak of determinism in quantum mechanics.},

We show that these new terms improve the performance of LRESC as results with this methodology are very close to those calculated at the four-component Dirac–Hartree–Fock (4c-DHF) level. We assess the new corrections in Br Y and At Y di-halogen ( Y = F, Cl, Br, I, and At) and XZY bi-linear molecules ( Z = Zn, Cd, and Hg; X , Y = F, Cl, Br, I, and At). At the 4c-DHF level, we analyze the contributions coming from the large and small components of the relativistic 4c wave function to the electronic part of EFG and compare them with the LRESC corrections to find their electronic origin. For the Hg X 2 ( X = Cl, Br, and I) subset, when the SD correcting terms are included, LRESC calculations match very well with 4c-DHF ones and those from the literature, with differences less than 1\% for molecules containing up to three heavy atoms. We show that LRESC gives accurate values of EFG, allowing the analysis of the electronic origin of relativistic effects in terms of well-known nonrelativistic operators.},

To efficiently perform the calculations, we formulate a spin-unrestricted linear-response Sternheimer approach in a non-orthogonal B-spline basis set using appropriate frequency-dependent boundary conditions. We illustrate this approach on the Li atom, which suggests that TDRSH and TDLRSH are adequate simple methods for estimating the single-electron photoionization spectra of open-shell systems.},

  abstract = {Neural network (NN) potentials are a natural choice for coarse-grained (CG) models. Their many-body capacity allows highly accurate approximations of the potential of mean force, promising CG simulations of unprecedented accuracy. CG NN potentials trained bottom-up via force matching (FM), however, suffer from finite data effects: They rely on prior potentials for physically sound predictions outside the training data domain, and the corresponding free energy surface is sensitive to errors in the transition regions. The standard alternative to FM for classical potentials is relative entropy (RE) minimization, which has not yet been applied to NN potentials. In this work, we demonstrate, for benchmark problems of liquid water and alanine dipeptide, that RE training is more data efficient, due to accessing the CG distribution during training, resulting in improved free energy surfaces and reduced sensitivity to prior potentials. In addition, RE learns to correct time integration errors, allowing larger time steps in CG molecular dynamics simulation, while maintaining accuracy. Thus, our findings support the use of training objectives beyond FM, as a promising direction for improving CG NN potential’s accuracy and reliability.},

We approximate a periodic cell of this system by a circular tube containing a single pillar, derive an exact solution of the underlying Laplace equation, and deduce a simple yet exact representation for the total flux of particles onto the pillar. The dependence of this flux on the geometric parameters of the model is thoroughly analyzed. In particular, we investigate several asymptotic regimes, such as a thin pillar limit, a disk-like pillar, and an infinitely long pillar. Our study sheds light onto the trapping efficiency of spiky coatings and reveals the roles of pillar anisotropy and diffusional screening.},

  abstract = {Although conceptually simple, the air–water interface displays rich behavior and is subject to intense experimental and theoretical investigations. Different definitions of the electrostatic surface potential as well as different calculation methods, each relevant for distinct experimental scenarios, lead to widely varying potential magnitudes and sometimes even different signs. Based on quantum-chemical density-functional-theory molecular dynamics (DFT-MD) simulations, different surface potentials are evaluated and compared to force-field (FF) MD simulations. As well explained in the literature, the laterally averaged electrostatic surface potential, accessible to electron holography, is dominated by the trace of the water molecular quadrupole moment, and using DFT-MD amounts to +4.35 V inside the water phase, very different from results obtained with FF water models which yield negative values of the order of −0.4 to −0.6 V. Thus, when predicting potentials within water molecules, as relevant for photoelectron spectroscopy and non-linear interface-specific spectroscopy, DFT simulations should be used. The electrochemical surface potential, relevant for ion transfer reactions and ion surface adsorption, is much smaller, less than 200 mV in magnitude, and depends specifically on the ion radius. Charge transfer between interfacial water molecules leads to a sizable surface potential as well. However, when probing electrokinetics by explicitly applying a lateral electric field in DFT-MD simulations, the electrokinetic ζ -potential turns out to be negligible, in agreement with predictions using continuous hydrodynamic models. Thus, interfacial polarization charges from intermolecular charge transfer do not lead to significant electrokinetic mobility at the pristine vapor–liquid water interface, even assuming these transfer charges are mobile in an external electric field.},

  abstract = {Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) play key roles in cellular regulation, including signal transduction, transcription, and cell-cycle control. Accordingly, IDPs can commonly interact with numerous different target proteins, and their interaction networks are expected to be highly regulated. However, many of the underlying regulatory mechanisms have remained unclear. Here, we examine the representative case of the nuclear coactivator binding domain (NCBD) of the large multidomain protein CBP, a hub in transcriptional regulation, and the interaction with several of its binding partners. Single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer measurements show that phosphorylation of NCBD reduces its binding affinity, with effects that vary depending on the binding partner and the site and number of modifications. The complexity of the interaction is further increased by the dependence of the affinities on peptidyl-prolyl cis / trans isomerization in NCBD. Overall, our results reveal the potential for allosteric regulation on at least three levels: the different affinities of NCBD for its different binding partners, the differential modulation of these affinities by phosphorylation, and the effect of peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerization on binding.},

  abstract = {Alpha-synuclein (α-syn) is a cytoplasmic protein commonly found in the nervous system. In solution, α-syn adopts disordered unfolded conformations, although it can also form α-helices upon binding to lipid membranes. Under conditions that are not yet fully understood, α-syn can misfold and aggregate, giving rise to β-sheet rich amyloid fibrils, which then tend to accumulate in degenerating neurons. This leads to Parkinson’s disease (PD) and several other conditions collectively termed synucleinopathies. Development of disease-modifying treatments requires detailed understanding of structure and dynamics of α-syn’s misfolded aggregates. We have employed 1000 ns long, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the interaction of monomeric α-syn 38-95 fragments, which contain the most important amyloidogenic regions, with preformed fibrillar seeds composed of staggered, β-sheet rich α-syn chains of matching length. The simulations indicate that α-syn 38-95 monomers tend to form aggregates with the fibrillar seeds, although we have not observed alignment of the monomeric chains with β-strands of the fibril. To analyze the stability of these aggregates, we have employed the essential collective dynamics method, which allows making accurate assessment of dynamical coupling across individual atoms in macromolecules and supramolecular complexes. The analysis revealed extensive dynamical coupling across initially monomeric α-syn chains and the fibrillar seeds including distal regions thereof that did not contact the monomer directly. We have discussed structural origins of these long-range interactions, their impacts for the stability of α-syn aggregates, and potential implications for the development of anti-PD treatments.},

  abstract = {Shear history plays an important role in determining the linear and nonlinear rheological response of colloidal gels and can be used for tuning their structure and flow properties. Increasing the colloidal particle aspect ratio lowers the critical volume fraction for gelation due to an increase in the particle excluded volume. Using a combination of rheology and confocal microscopy, we investigate the effect of steady and oscillatory preshear history on the structure and rheology of colloidal gels formed by silica spheres and rods of length L and diameter D ( L/D = 10) dispersed in 11 M CsCl solution. We use a non-dimensional Mason number, Mn (=F visc. /F attr. ), to compare the effect of steady and oscillatory preshear on gel viscoelasticity. We show that after preshearing at intermediate Mn, attractive sphere gel exhibits strengthening, whereas attractive rod gel exhibits weakening. Rheo-imaging of gels of attractive rods shows that at intermediate Mn, oscillatory preshear induces large compact rod clusters in the gel microstructure, compared to steady preshear. Our study highlights the impact of particle shape on gel structuring under flow and viscoelasticity after shear cessation.},

  abstract = {Both polydispersity and the presence of a gravitational field are inherent to essentially any colloidal experiment. While several theoretical works have focused on the effect of polydispersity on the bulk phase behavior of a colloidal system, little is known about the effect of a gravitational field on a polydisperse colloidal suspension. We extend here the sedimentation path theory to study sedimentation–diffusion–equilibrium of a mass-polydisperse colloidal system: the particles possess different buoyant masses but they are otherwise identical. The model helps to understand the interplay between gravity and polydispersity on sedimentation experiments. Since the theory can be applied to any parent distribution of buoyant masses, it can also be used to study the sedimentation of monodisperse colloidal systems. We find that mass-polydispersity has a strong influence in colloidal systems near density matching for which the bare density of the colloidal particles equals the solvent density. To illustrate the theory, we study crystallization in sedimentation–diffusion–equilibrium of a suspension of mass-polydisperse hard spheres.},

However, microscopic views of the phenomena have not been fully understood. X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) experiments were performed to study the interfacial region of the HIP bonded Fe–Cu sample. XAFS analyses clearly show that the bond distance around Cu is extraordinarily short compared with the bulk fcc Cu. The Cu species in the Fe–Cu HIP bonded sample takes a bcc structure even in the Cu-rich phase at room temperature. This anomalous bcc phase of Cu may derive from the HIP diffusion bonding process, which is performed below the melting points of both the elements. Cu atoms can diffuse into Fe with the bcc structure and settle in the bcc sites.},

  abstract = {The effect of gases on the surface composition of Cu–Pt bimetallic catalysts has been tested by in situ infrared (IR) and x-ray absorption spectroscopies. Diffusion of Pt atoms within the Cu–Pt nanoparticles was observed both in vacuum and under gaseous atmospheres. Vacuum IR spectra of CO adsorbed on CuPt x /SBA-15 catalysts (x = 0–∞) at 125 K showed no bonding on Pt regardless of Pt content, but reversible Pt segregation to the surface was seen with the high-Pt-content (x ≥ 0.2) samples upon heating to 225 K. In situ IR spectra in CO atmospheres also highlighted the reversible segregation of Pt to the surface and its diffusion back into the bulk when cycling the temperature from 295 to 495 K and back, most evidently for diluted single-atom alloy catalysts (x ≤ 0.01). Similar behavior was possibly observed under H 2 using small amounts of CO as a probe molecule. In situ x-ray absorption near-edge structure data obtained for CuPt 0.2 /SBA-15 under both CO and He pointed to the metallic nature of the Pt atoms irrespective of gas or temperature, but analysis of the extended x-ray absorption fine structure identified a change in coordination environment around the Pt atoms, from a (Pt–Cu):(Pt–Pt) coordination number ratio of ∼6:6 at or below 445 K to 8:4 at 495 K. The main conclusion is that Cu–Pt bimetallic catalysts are dynamic, with the composition of their surfaces being dependent on temperature in gaseous environments.},

Simulation results for the CO 2 + H 2 O and hexane + CO 2 + H 2 O systems are in reasonable agreement with the theoretical predictions based on the density functional theory. In general, the interfacial tension (IFT) of the CO 2 + H 2 O system exponentially (linearly) decreased with increasing pressure (temperature). The IFTs of the hexane + CO 2 + H 2 O (two-phase) system decreased with the increasing mole fraction of CO 2 in the hexane/CO 2 -rich phase x CO 2 . Here, the negative surface excesses of hexane lead to a general increase in the IFTs with increasing pressure. The effect of pressure on these IFTs decreased with increasing x CO 2 due to the positive surface excesses of carbon dioxide. The simulated water contact angles of the CO 2 + H 2 O + silica system fall in the range from 43.8° to 76.0°, which is in reasonable agreement with the experimental results. These contact angles increased with pressure and decreased with temperature. Here, the adhesion tensions are influenced by the variations in fluid–fluid IFT and contact angle. The simulated water contact angles of the hexane + H 2 O + silica system fall in the range from 58.0° to 77.0° and are not much affected by the addition of CO 2 . These contact angles increased with pressure, and the pressure effect was less pronounced at lower temperatures. Here, the adhesion tensions are mostly influenced by variations in the fluid–fluid IFTs. In all studied cases, CO 2 molecules could penetrate into the interfacial region between the water droplet and the silica surface.},

Despite the current progress in research, the mechanism of low ice friction is not clear, and especially little is known about the behavior of this surface water film under shear and how the sheared interfacial water film influences ice friction. In our work, we investigated the ordering and diffusion coefficient of the interfacial water film and the friction of ice sliding on an atomically smooth solid substrate at the atomic level using molecular dynamics simulations. There are two layers of water molecules at the ice-solid interface that exhibit properties very different from bulk ice. The ice-adjacent water layer is ice-like, and the solid-adjacent water layer is liquid-like. This liquid-like layer behaves in the manner of “confined water,” with high viscosity while maintaining fluidity, leading to the slipperiness of the ice. Furthermore, we found that the interfacial water exhibits shear thinning behavior, which connects the structure of the interfacial water film to the coefficient of friction of the ice surface. We propose a new ice friction mechanism based on shear thinning that is applicable to this interfacial water film structure.},

In this study, we performed high-pressure x-ray diffraction measurements on the high-pressure phase (up to ∼10.2 GPa) using a He hydrostatic pressure medium to examine the influence of the formation of dihydrogen bonds on the lattice parameters and unit cell volume of NH 3 BH 3 . We observed a unique behavior in the pressure dependence of lattice parameters close to the pressure at which the dihydrogen bond was formed. The lattice parameters demonstrated hysteresis curves under compression and decompression conditions but the unit cell volume did not. Moreover, the pressure dependence of the unit cell volume could not be expressed using a single Birch–Murnaghan equation within an acceptable margin of error, thus suggesting a change in bulk modulus under compression. These results are considered to have originated from the pressure-induced formation of dihydrogen bonds. Moreover, high-pressure Raman scattering measurements and a simulation using density functional theory calculations revealed the vibrational modes of the high-pressure phase of NH 3 BH 3 . The results demonstrated that librational modes were enhanced by forming dihydrogen bonds. Moreover, the intramolecular stretching modes of BN, BH, and NH monotonically shifted with pressure, while the symmetrical in-plane bending modes of BH 3 and NH 3 split irrespective of the formation of dihydrogen bonds.},

In this high-resolution measurement, we used a single-mode UV laser whose frequencies were controlled with reference to an optical frequency comb. The inertial defect is negligibly small, the molecule is considered to be planar, and the obtained rotational constants were well reproduced by the equation-of-motion coupled cluster singles and doubles (EOM-CCSD) calculation. Both a -type and b -type transitions are found to be included in the rotationally resolved spectrum, and the a -type contribution is dominant, that is, the transition moment is nearly parallel to the long axis of the a BA molecule. We concluded that the S 1 state is mainly composed of the Φ (B) configuration. The observed fluorescence lifetime (106 ns) is considerably longer than that of the Φ (A) system, such as anthracene (18 ns). The transition moment for the lower state of mixed states becomes small, reflecting a near-cancelation of the contributions from the parts of the wavefunction corresponding to the two electronic configurations. The bandwidth of the S 2 ← S 0 transition is large, and the structure is complicated. It is attributed to vibronic coupling with the high vibrational levels of the S 1 state.},

  abstract = {Some diarylethene molecular switches have a low quantum yield for cycloreversion when excited by a single photon, but react more efficiently following sequential two-photon excitation. The increase in reaction efficiency depends on both the relative time delay and the wavelength of the second photon. This paper examines the wavelength-dependent mechanism for sequential excitation using excited-state resonance Raman spectroscopy to probe the ultrafast (sub-30 fs) dynamics on the upper electronic state following secondary excitation. The approach uses femtosecond stimulated Raman scattering (FSRS) to measure the time-gated, excited-state resonance Raman spectrum in resonance with two different excited-state absorption bands. The relative intensities of the Raman bands reveal the initial dynamics in the higher-lying states, S n , by providing information on the relative gradients of the potential energy surfaces that are accessed via secondary excitation. The excited-state resonance Raman spectra reveal specific modes that become enhanced depending on the Raman excitation wavelength, 750 or 400 nm. Many of the modes that become enhanced in the 750 nm FSRS spectrum are assigned as vibrational motions localized on the central cyclohexadiene ring. Many of the modes that become enhanced in the 400 nm FSRS spectrum are assigned as motions along the conjugated backbone and peripheral phenyl rings. These observations are consistent with earlier measurements that showed higher efficiency following secondary excitation into the lower excited-state absorption band and illustrate a powerful new way to probe the ultrafast dynamics of higher-lying excited states immediately following sequential two-photon excitation.},

We show that the anisotropic environment provided by the nanotube breaks the inversion symmetry of the chain. This symmetry breaking lifts the degeneracy of the ground state and leads to a splitting between the left- and right-polarized states. In turn, a ferroelectric phase in nanoscopic systems is created, with a polarization that can be switched in a manner analogous to that of a supramolecular qubit. We present results for a few low-lying states and discuss the effect of external electric fields on the energy splitting and the occurrence of a quantum phase transition.},

  abstract = {Liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) in macromolecular solutions (e.g., coacervation) is relevant both to technology and to the process of mesoscale structure formation in cells. The LLPS process is characterized by a phase diagram, i.e., binodal lines in the temperature/concentration plane, which must be quantified to predict the system’s behavior. Experimentally, this can be difficult due to complications in handling the dense macromolecular phase. Here, we develop a method for accurately quantifying the phase diagram without direct handling: We confine the sample within micron-scale, water-in-oil emulsion droplets and then use precision fluorescent imaging to measure the volume fraction of the condensate within the droplet. We find that this volume fraction grows linearly with macromolecule concentration; thus, by applying the lever rule, we can directly extract the dense and dilute binodal concentrations. We use this approach to study a model LLPS system of self-assembled, fixed-valence DNA particles termed nanostars (NSs). We find that temperature/concentration phase diagrams of NSs display, with certain exceptions, a larger co-existence regime upon increasing salt or valence, in line with expectations. Aspects of the measured phase behavior validate recent predictions that account for the role of valence in modulating the connectivity of the condensed phase. Generally, our results on NS phase diagrams give fundamental insight into limited-valence phase separation, while the method we have developed will likely be useful in the study of other LLPS systems.},

For this novel approach to positronium electrochemistry, a suitable cell setup is used, which allows simultaneously both electrochemical measurements and positron annihilation spectroscopy. For the Fe 2+/3+ redox couple, positronium serves as an ideally suited atomic probe owing to the rather different positronium chemistry of Fe 2+ (spin conversion) and Fe 3+ (total positronium inhibition and oxidation). This enabled the precise in situ monitoring of oxidation and reduction by means of positron lifetime upon slow cycling voltammetry or galvanostatic charging. The variation of the mean positron lifetime with the Fe 2+/3+ concentration ratio could be quantitatively described by a reaction rate model for positronium formation and annihilation. An asymmetric behavior of the variation of the mean positron lifetime with applied potential, as compared to the simultaneously recorded symmetric current–potential curve, could be explained by the stronger influence of Fe 3+ on the characteristics of positronium formation and annihilation. The highly reversible galvanostatic charging behavior monitored by positron lifetime underlines the attractive application potentials of positronium electrochemistry for in situ studies of iron-based redox-flow battery electrolytes.},

  abstract = {We demonstrate single molecule conductance as a sensitive and atomically precise probe of binding configurations of adenine and its biologically relevant variants on gold. By combining experimental measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations of single molecule–metal junction structures in aqueous conditions, we determine for the first time that robust binding of adenine occurs in neutral or basic pH when the molecule is deprotonated at the imidazole moiety. The molecule binds through the donation of the electron lone pairs from the imidazole nitrogen atoms, N7 and N9, to the gold electrodes. In addition, the pyrimidine ring nitrogen, N3, can bind concurrently and strengthen the overall metal–molecule interaction. The amine does not participate in binding to gold in contrast to most other amine-terminated molecular wires due to the planar geometry of the nucleobase. DFT calculations reveal the importance of interface charge transfer in stabilizing the experimentally observed binding configurations. We demonstrate that biologically relevant variants of adenine, 6-methyladenine and 2′-deoxyadenosine, have distinct conductance signatures. These results lay the foundation for biosensing on gold using single molecule conductance readout.},

In particular, we argue that the difficulty of estimating the pressure has not been fully realized in the decades-long controversy over the hard-disk phase-transition scenario. We present the physics of the hard-disk model, the definition of the pressure and its unbiased estimators, several of which are new. We further treat different sampling algorithms and crucial criteria for bounding mixing times in the absence of analytical predictions. Our definite results for the pressure, for up to one million disks, may serve as benchmarks for future sampling algorithms.

Here, we introduce a simple, yet general idea that allows one to derive the appropriate boundary conditions self-consistently from the chemical reaction scheme and the geometry of the physical reaction boundaries. As an illustration, we consider two paradigmatic examples, where the known results are recovered by taking specific physical limits.

For the chromophores with zero Huang–Rhys factors and strong couplings to surface plasmon polaritons, we find that the frequencies of Rabi oscillations (the strengths of strong light–matter couplings) are associated with the initial excitation conditions. On the other hand, for the chromophores weakly coupled to surface plasmon polaritons, our numerical calculations together with analytical analysis elaborate on the conditions for the superradiant and subradiant decay behaviors. Moreover, we show that the modified decay rate constants can be explicitly expressed in terms of generalized spectral densities (or dyadic Green’s functions), revealing a relationship between photonic environments and the collective effects such as superradiance and subradiance. For the chromophores with nonzero Huang–Rhys factors and strong coupling to surface plasmon polaritons, the effects of molecular vibrations emerge. We demonstrate that the low-frequency vibrational modes do not affect the excited state population dynamics, while the high-frequency vibrational modes can modify either the period of Rabi oscillation (Franck–Condon Rabi oscillation) or the amplitude of excited state population. Our study shows that the collective effects, including superradiance and subradiance, can be controlled via dielectric environments and initial excitation conditions, providing new insights into polariton chemistry and the design of quantum optical devices.},

We demonstrate the importance of these nonequilibrium forces for an accurate description of the one-body density by numerical implementation of our theory for three-dimensional hard-spheres in a time-dependent planar potential. The relaxation of the one-body density in superadiabatic-DDFT is found to be slower than that predicted by standard adiabatic DDFT and significantly improves the agreement with Brownian dynamics simulation data. We attribute this improved performance to the correct treatment of structural relaxation within the superadiabatic-DDFT.

The approach employs a classical polarizable double electrode model, which enables us to study the QM/MM system in the constant-voltage ensemble. A mean-field embedding approximation is further introduced in order to overcome the difficulties associated with statistical sampling of the electrolyte configurations. The results of applying the method to a test system indicate that the adsorbed molecule is no less or slightly more polarized at the interface than in the bulk electrolyte solution. The geometry of the horizontally adsorbed molecule is modulated by their electrostatic interactions with the polarizable electrode surfaces and also the interactions with cations attracted toward the interface when the adsorbate is reduced. We also demonstrate that the approach can be used to quantitatively evaluate the reorganization energy of a one electron reduction reaction of a molecule in an electrochemical cell.},

While all methods provide a systematic reduction of errors upon extension of the grid sizes, significant differences are observed in the accuracies for similar grid sizes with various approaches. For the tests in this work, the SG-x fixed grids are less suitable to achieve high accuracies in the DFT integration, while our new adaptive grid performed best among the schemes studied in this work. The extra computational time to generate the adaptive grid scales linearly with molecular size and is negligible compared with the time needed for the self-consistent field iterations for large molecules. A comparison of the grid accuracies using various density functionals shows that meta -GGA functionals need larger integration grids than GGA functionals to reach the same degree of accuracy, confirming previous investigations of the numerical stability of meta -GGA functionals. On the other hand, the grid integration errors are almost independent of the basis set, and the basis set errors are mostly much larger than the errors caused by the numerical integrations, even when using the smallest grids tested in this work.},

Besides the most obvious ones, i.e., the quality of the multidimensional potential energy surface and the vibrational wavefunctions, it is the representation of the μ -tensor within the Watson Hamiltonian, which has a significant impact on the desired line lists or simulated spectra. Within this work, we studied the dependence of high-resolution rovibrational spectra with respect to the truncation order of the μ -tensor within the rotational contribution and the Coriolis coupling operator of the Watson operator. Moreover, the dependence of the infrared intensities of the rovibrational transitions on an n -mode expansion of the dipole moment surface has been investigated as well. Benchmark calculations are provided for thioformaldehyde, which has already served as a test molecule in other studies and whose rovibrational spectrum was found to be fairly sensitive.

  abstract = {We derive general bivariational equations of motion (EOMs) for time-dependent wave functions with biorthogonal time-dependent basis sets. The time-dependent basis functions are linearly parameterized and their fully variational time evolution is ensured by solving a set of so-called constraint equations, which we derive for arbitrary wave function expansions. The formalism allows division of the basis set into an active basis and a secondary basis, ensuring a flexible and compact wave function. We show how the EOMs specialize to a few common wave function forms, including coupled cluster and linearly expanded wave functions. It is demonstrated, for the first time, that the propagation of such wave functions is not unconditionally stable when a secondary basis is employed. The main signature of the instability is a strong increase in non-orthogonality, which eventually causes the calculation to fail; specifically, the biorthogonal active bra and ket bases tend toward spanning different spaces. Although formally allowed, this causes severe numerical issues. We identify the source of this problem by reparametrizing the time-dependent basis set through polar decomposition. Subsequent analysis allows us to remove the instability by setting appropriate matrix elements to zero. Although this solution is not fully variational, we find essentially no deviation in terms of autocorrelation functions relative to the variational formulation. We expect that the results presented here will be useful for the formal analysis of bivariational time-dependent wave functions for electronic and nuclear dynamics in general and for the practical implementation of time-dependent CC wave functions in particular.},

The GQME expresses correlation functions in terms of a non-Markovian equation of motion, involving memory kernels that are typically fast-decaying and can therefore be computed by short-time quasiclassical trajectories. In this paper, we study the approximate solution of the GQME, obtained by calculating the kernels with two methods: Ehrenfest mean-field theory and spin-mapping. We test the approaches on a range of spin–boson models with increasing energy bias between the two electronic levels and place a particular focus on the long-time limits of the populations. We find that the accuracy of the predictions of the GQME depends strongly on the specific technique used to calculate the kernels. In particular, spin-mapping outperforms Ehrenfest for all the systems studied. The problem of unphysical negative electronic populations affecting spin-mapping is resolved by coupling the method with the master equation. Conversely, Ehrenfest in conjunction with the GQME can predict negative populations, despite the fact that the populations calculated from direct dynamics are positive definite.},

  abstract = {In a recent paper [A. D. Becke, J. Chem. Phys. 156 , 214101 (2022)], we compared two Kohn–Sham density functionals based on physical modeling and theory with the best density-functional power series fits in the literature. With only a handful of physically motivated pre-factors, our functionals matched, and even slightly exceeded, the performance of the best power-series functionals on the general main group thermochemistry, kinetics, and noncovalent interactions (GMTKN55) chemical database of Goerigk et al. [Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 19 , 32184 (2017)]. This begs the question: how much can their performance be improved by adding power-series terms of our own? We address this question in the present work. First, we describe a series expansion variable that we believe contains more local physics than any other variable considered to date. Then we undertake modest, one-dimensional fits to the GMTKN55 data with our theory-based functional corrected by power-series exchange and dynamical correlation terms. We settle on 12 power-series terms (plus six parent terms) and achieve the lowest GMTKN55 “WTMAD2” error yet reported, by a substantial margin, for a hybrid Kohn–Sham density functional. The new functional is called “B22plus.”},

  abstract = {Machine learning frameworks based on correlations of interatomic positions begin with a discretized description of the density of other atoms in the neighborhood of each atom in the system. Symmetry considerations support the use of spherical harmonics to expand the angular dependence of this density, but there is, as of yet, no clear rationale to choose one radial basis over another. Here, we investigate the basis that results from the solution of the Laplacian eigenvalue problem within a sphere around the atom of interest. We show that this generates a basis of controllable smoothness within the sphere (in the same sense as plane waves provide a basis with controllable smoothness for a problem with periodic boundaries) and that a tensor product of Laplacian eigenstates also provides a smooth basis for expanding any higher-order correlation of the atomic density within the appropriate hypersphere. We consider several unsupervised metrics of the quality of a basis for a given dataset and show that the Laplacian eigenstate basis has a performance that is much better than some widely used basis sets and competitive with data-driven bases that numerically optimize each metric. Finally, we investigate the role of the basis in building models of the potential energy. In these tests, we find that a combination of the Laplacian eigenstate basis and target-oriented heuristics leads to equal or improved regression performance when compared to both heuristic and data-driven bases in the literature. We conclude that the smoothness of the basis functions is a key aspect of successful atomic density representations.},

The phase lines and thermodynamic behavior are calculated at the mean-field level. We find a “surface” critical point that can be shifted to higher or lower temperatures than the bulk critical point. Below this point, the transition from a “gas” phase to a “liquid” phase is first-order, while above it, the transition is second-order. The second-order line is affected by the spatial dependence of the force, while the first-order line is universal. Moreover, the susceptibility may diverge at a finite location r . Several analytical expressions are given in the limit where a Landau expansion of the free energy is valid.},

Complex interfacial reactions have long been a big concern because of the elusive formation/dissolution of Li metal at the solid–electrolyte interface (SEI) layer, which leads to battery degradation under practical operating conditions. To precisely track the reactions at the electrode/electrolyte interfaces, in the past ten years, high spatio–temporal resolution, in situ electrochemical transmission electron microscopy (EC-TEM) has been developed. A preliminary understanding of the structural and chemical variation of Li metal during nucleation/growth and SEI layer formation has been obtained. In this perspective, we give a brief introduction of liquid cell development. Then, we comparably discuss the different configurations of EC-TEM based on open-cell and liquid-cell, and focus on the recent advances of liquid-cell EC-TEM and its investigation in the electrodes, electrolytes, and SEI. Finally, we present a perspective of liquid-cell EC-TEM for future LMB research.},

Understanding the mechanism of allosteric coupling in large multidomain proteins is the most promising route to achieving spatial and temporal control of the system. The recent explosion of CRISPR-Cas9 applications in molecular biology and medicine has created a need to understand how the atomic level protein dynamics of Cas9, which are the driving force of its allosteric crosstalk, influence its biophysical characteristics. In this study, we used a synergistic approach of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and computation to pinpoint an allosteric hotspot in the HNH domain of the thermostable Geo Cas9. We show that mutation of K597 to alanine disrupts a salt-bridge network, which in turn alters the structure, the timescale of allosteric motions, and the thermostability of the Geo HNH domain. This homologous lysine-to-alanine mutation in the extensively studied mesophilic S. pyogenes Cas9 similarly alters the dynamics of the Sp HNH domain. We have previously demonstrated that the alteration of allostery via mutations is a source for the specificity enhancement of Sp Cas9 (e Sp Cas9). Hence, this may also be true in Geo Cas9.},

  abstract = {It has been widely accepted that cancer cells are softer than their normal counterparts. This motivates us to propose, as a proof-of-concept, a method for the efficient delivery of therapeutic agents into cancer cells, while normal cells are less affected. The basic idea of this method is to use a water jet generated by the collapse of the bubble under shockwaves to perforate pores in the cell membrane. Given a combination of shockwave and bubble parameters, the cancer membrane is more susceptible to bending, stretching, and perforating than the normal membrane because the bending modulus of the cancer cell membrane is smaller than that of the normal cell membrane. Therefore, the therapeutic agent delivery into cancer cells is easier than in normal cells. Adopting two well-studied models of the normal and cancer membranes, we perform shockwave induced bubble collapse molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the difference in the response of two membranes over a range of shockwave impulse 15–30 mPa s and bubble diameter 4–10 nm. The simulation shows that the presence of bubbles is essential for generating a water jet, which is required for perforation; otherwise, pores are not formed. Given a set of shockwave impulse and bubble parameters, the pore area in the cancer membrane is always larger than that in the normal membrane. However, a too strong shockwave and/or too large bubble results in too fast disruption of membranes, and pore areas are similar between two membrane types. The pore closure time in the cancer membrane is slower than that in the normal membrane. The implications of our results for applications in real cells are discussed in some details. Our simulation may be useful for encouraging future experimental work on novel approaches for cancer treatment.},

PI having the type-A dipole was the dielectrically active fast component, whereas PC2St was the dielectrically inert slow component whose dynamics can be detected by rheological measurements. To precisely model the phase separation process, it is important to estimate the composition dependence of the mobility, which is needed to describe the phase separation dynamics. For that purpose, we conducted dielectric and rheological measurements to determine the friction coefficient of each component in a homogeneous state sufficiently above the phase separation temperature. The temperature dependence of the friction coefficient of each component was reasonably expressed by the Williams–Landel–Ferry equation. Extrapolating this dependence obtained for blends of various compositions to the test temperature T * below the phase separation temperature, we were able to estimate the friction coefficient of the chain at T * as a function of the composition. This friction coefficient was then used to determine the mobility Λ defined for the material fluxes at T *. The time-dependent Ginzburg–Landau (TDGL) equation incorporating this Λ well described the experimentally observed phase separation dynamics. In particular, the 2D TDGL simulation with this Λ qualitatively captured the phase-separated structure observed with the optical microscope as well as broad dielectric mode distribution of the blend at T *.},

  abstract = {Reaction-diffusion systems involving ionic species are susceptible to an externally applied electric field. Depending on the charges on the ionic species and the intensity of the applied electric field, diverse spatiotemporal patterns can emerge. We here considered two prototypical reaction-diffusion systems that follow activator-inhibitor kinetics: the photosensitive chlorine dioxide-iodine-malonic acid (CDIMA) reaction and the Brusselator model. By theoretical investigation and numerical simulations, we unravel how and to what extent an externally applied electric field can induce and modify the dynamics of these two systems. Our results show that both the uni- and bi-directional electric fields may induce Turing-like stationary patterns from a homogeneous uniform state resulting in horizontal, vertical, or bent stripe-like inhomogeneity in the photosensitive CDIMA system. In contrast, in the Brusselator model, for the activator and the inhibitor species having the same positive or negative charges, the externally applied electric field cannot develop any spatiotemporal instability when the diffusion coefficients are identical. However, various spatiotemporal patterns emerge for the same opposite charges of the interacting species, including moving spots and stripe-like structures, and a phenomenon of wave-splitting is observed. Moreover, the same sign and different magnitudes of the ionic charges can give rise to Turing-like stationary patterns from a homogeneous, stable, steady state depending upon the intensity of the applied electric field in the case of the Brusselator model. Our findings open the possibilities for future experiments to verify the predictions of electric field-induced various spatiotemporal instabilities in experimental reaction-diffusion systems.},

  abstract = {Applying an electric field to polarizable colloidal particles, whose permittivity differs from that of the dispersing medium, generates induced dipoles that promote the formation of string-like clusters and ultimately alter the fluid mechanical and rheological properties. Complex systems of this kind, whose electric-field-induced rheology can be manipulated between that of viscous and elastic materials, are referred to as electrorheological fluids. By using dynamic Monte Carlo simulations, we investigate the dynamics of self-assembly of dielectric nanocubes upon application of an electric field. Switching the field on induces in-particle dipoles and, at sufficiently large field intensity, leads to string-like clusters of variable length across a spectrum of volume fractions. The kinetics of switching from the isotropic to the string-like state suggests the existence of two mechanisms, the first related to the nucleation of chains and the second to the competition between further merging and separation. We characterize the transient unsteady state by following the chain length distribution and analyzing the probability of the transition of nanocubes from one chain to another over time. Additionally, we employ passive microrheology to gain insight into the effect of the electric field on the viscoelastic response of our model fluid. Not only do we observe that it becomes more viscoelastic in the presence of the field but also that its viscoelasticity assumes an anisotropic signature, with both viscous and elastic moduli in planes perpendicular to the external field being larger than those along it.},

  abstract = {We derive a dynamical field theory for self-propelled particles subjected to generic torques and forces by explicitly coarse-graining their microscopic dynamics, described by a many-body Fokker–Planck equation. The model includes both intrinsic torques inducing self-rotation, as well as interparticle torques leading to, for instance, the local alignment of particles’ orientations. Within this approach, although the functional form of the pairwise interactions does not need to be specified, one can directly map the parameters of the field theory onto the parameters of particle-based models. We perform a linear stability analysis of the homogeneous solution of the field equations and find both long-wavelength and short-wavelength instabilities. The former signals the emergence of a macroscopic structure, which we associate with motility-induced phase separation, while the second one signals the growth of a finite structure with a characteristic size. Intrinsic torques hinder phase separation, pushing the onset of the long-wavelength instability to higher activities. Furthermore, they generate finite-sized structures with a characteristic size proportional to both the self-propulsion velocity and the inverse of the self-rotation frequency. Our results show that a general mechanism might explain why chirality tends to suppress motility-induced phase separation but instead promotes the formation of non-equilibrium patterns.},

  abstract = {Polymer density functional theory (PDFT) is a computationally efficient and robust statistical mechanics theory for capturing the interfacial microstructure of grafted polymer brushes (PBs). Undoubtedly, the intramolecular and intermolecular interactions in PDFT (e.g., hard-core interactions and direct Coulomb interactions) are greatly affected by the grafting behavior of PBs. However, the combination of these interactions with the physical constraints on grafting behavior remains unclear and there is a remarkable difference in the density profile of grafted PB between PDFT and simulation. Herein, we propose a PDFT to study neutral and charged grafted PBs by incorporating the physical constraints of end-grafted PBs into the excess free energies due to intramolecular and intermolecular interactions. This PDFT has been successfully validated where the density distributions of neutral and weakly charged PBs predicted by the PDFT are in excellent agreement with the results of the Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations. In addition, the significant contribution of grafting behavior to the free energy of PB systems is presented. Consequently, this work provides a powerful and accurate theoretical method to reveal the interfacial microstructure of grafted PBs.},

Using confocal microscopy and small angle x-ray scattering, we find that the shear near the capillary walls influences the crystallization to result in large random hexagonal close-packed (RHCP) crystals with long-range orientational order over tens of thousands of colloidal particles. We investigate the crystallization mechanism and find partial crystallization under shear, initiating with hexagonal planes at the capillary walls, where shear is highest, followed by epitaxial crystal growth from these hexagonal layers after the shear is stopped. We then characterize the three-dimensional crystal structure finding that the shear-induced crystallization leads to larger particle separations parallel to the shear and vorticity directions as compared to the equilibrium RHCP structure. Confocal microscopy reveals that competing shear directions, where the capillary walls meet at a corner, create differently oriented hexagonal planes of particles. The single-orientation RHCP colloidal crystals remain stable after formation and are produced without the need of complex shear cell arrangements.},

  abstract = {Recent years have seen a rapid increase of interest in dense active materials, which, in the disordered state, share striking similarities with the conventional passive glass-forming matter. For such passive glassy materials, it is well established (at least in three dimensions) that the details of the microscopic dynamics, e.g., Newtonian or Brownian, do not influence the long-time glassy behavior. Here, we investigate whether this still holds true in the non-equilibrium active case by considering two simple and widely used active particle models, i.e., active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particles (AOUPs) and active Brownian particles (ABPs). In particular, we seek to gain more insight into the role of the self-propulsion mechanism on the glassy dynamics by deriving a mode-coupling theory (MCT) for thermal AOUPs, which can be directly compared to a recently developed MCT for ABPs. Both theories explicitly take into account the active degrees of freedom. We solve the AOUP- and ABP-MCT equations in two dimensions and demonstrate that both models give almost identical results for the intermediate scattering function over a large variety of control parameters (packing fractions, active speeds, and persistence times). We also confirm this theoretical equivalence between the different self-propulsion mechanisms numerically via simulations of a polydisperse mixture of active quasi-hard spheres, thereby establishing that, at least for these model systems, the microscopic details of self-propulsion do not alter the active glassy behavior.},

  abstract = {The generalized Langevin equation (GLE) provides an attractive theoretical framework for investigating the dynamics of conformational fluctuations of polymeric systems. While the memory kernel is a central function in the GLE, explicit analytical forms for this function have been challenging to obtain, even for the simple models of polymer dynamics. Here, we achieve an explicit analytical expression for the memory kernel in the GLE for the end-to-end vector of Rouse chains in the overdamped limit. Our derivation takes advantage of the finding that the dynamics of the end-to-end vector of Rouse chains with both free ends are equivalent to those of Rouse chains with one free end and the other fixed. For the latter model, we first show that the equations of motion of the Rouse modes as well as their statistical properties can be obtained under the boundary conditions where the free end is held fixed temporarily. We then analytically solve the terms associated with intrachain interactions in the GLE. By formally comparing these terms with the GLE based on the Rouse modes, we obtain an explicit expression for the memory kernel, along with analytical forms for the potential field and the random colored noise force. Our analytical memory kernel is confirmed by numerical calculations in the Laplace space and is shown to yield asymptotic behaviors that are consistent with previous studies. Finally, we utilize our analytical result to simulate the cyclization dynamics of Rouse chains and discuss the scaling of the cyclization time with chain length.},

This capability is an extension of ZENO in the sense that the existing program is also based on probabilistic sampling methods and involves the same input file formats describing polymer and nanoparticle structures. We illustrate the extension’s capabilities, demonstrate its accuracy, and quantify the efficiency of this extension of ZENO by computing the second, third, and fourth virial coefficients and metrics quantifying the difficulty of their calculation, for model polymeric structures having several different shapes.

  abstract = {Two-dimensional (2D) membranes based on perforated graphene have great potential in the field of separation of chemical species for a variety of applications, including gas treatment. In addition to recent experimental studies, several works simulate the mechanisms of gas permeation through this type of membrane using molecular dynamics, but few combine different techniques to ensure that their method of choice captures all relevant mechanisms. In particular, the re-crossing mechanism leading a gas molecule that has crossed the plane of the membrane to rapidly re-cross it in the opposite direction has never been documented. In this work, we study gas permeation through a simplified 2D membrane model. We combine equilibrium and non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations to quantify the impact of these re-crossing mechanisms on the values of the computed transport coefficients. Using non-equilibrium simulations as reference, we show that the equilibrium simulation techniques commonly used can lead to a significant overestimation of the transport properties of the membrane. We propose a simple method to probe the re-crossing dynamics during equilibrium simulations, making it possible to compute correct values of the transport coefficient without the need for non-equilibrium simulations. Furthermore, by analyzing the phenomenology observed in the simulations, we derive an analytical formula for the permeance that takes the form of an Arrhenius law with a non-trivial temperature dependent prefactor. In excellent agreement with our simulation results, this model provides a simple theoretical framework that captures the main mechanisms involved in gas permeation through 2D membranes, including the effect of re-crossing.},

  abstract = {Birnessite-type MnO 2 plays key roles in scavenging trace elements in numerous natural environments and has also been regarded as a promising energy storage material. The interfacial properties of birnessite are highly pH-dependent due to the presence of various amphoteric groups on its edges, and, therefore, the acidity constants (pKa) of these groups are vital to the understanding of its electrochemical and environmental performances. However, an accurate acidity dataset for birnessite is absent yet. In this study, we employed first-principles molecular dynamics simulations and the vertical energy gap method to calculate the pKas of groups on the birnessite (010) edge. The interfacial hydration structure was characterized with a focus on the hydrogen bonding network. The obtained pKas suggest that MnOH 2 is active while Mn 2 OH remains inert in a common pH range. Based on these results, the incorporation of transition metals on the edge surface was investigated by taking Ni 2+ and Zn 2+ as the model cations. The energy changes associated with the incorporation process of Ni 2+ from the outer-sphere state indicate that incorporation on the edge surface is more feasible than that on the basal surface presumed in previous studies. Overall, the results obtained provide an atomic-scale insight into the acid–base chemistry of birnessite and form a physical basis for understanding the interfacial processes of birnessite.},

  abstract = {The inhibition of the electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) by zinc corrosion products plays an important role in the corrosion protection of galvanized steel. Hence, the electrocatalytic mechanism of the ORR on electrodeposited zinc hydroxide-based model corrosion products was investigated by in situ and operando attenuated total reflection infrared (ATR-IR) spectroscopy, supplemented by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Model corrosion products containing flake-like crystalline Zn 5 (NO 3 ) 2 (OH) 8 were cathodically electrodeposited on germanium(100) electrodes from a zinc nitrate precursor electrolyte. Substantial amounts of the films are non-crystalline, and their surfaces predominantly consist of zinc oxide and hydroxide species, as evidenced by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. ATR-IR spectra show a peak at 1180 cm −1 during cathodic currents in O 2 -saturated NaClO 4 solution. This peak is assigned to a surface-bound superoxide, the only ORR intermediate detected. Absorbance from the intermediate increases with increasing cathodic current, indicating an increase in surface concentration of superoxide intermediates at larger ORR current densities. The zinc hydroxide ages in the experiments, most likely by a transformation into zinc oxide, consistent with the observed decrease in absorbance over time of the OH bending mode of zinc hydroxide at 1380 cm −1 . This aging is a time-dependent chemical process, implying that pure chemical aging is important in actual corrosion products as well. DFT calculations of adsorbed superoxide yield a Zn–O bond length similar to the bond length in Zn–O, thus enhancing superoxide interaction with undercoordinated tetrahedral Zn 2+ sites on the surface. Thus, such active sites catalyze the first reduction step in the ORR.},

The electrochemical mechanism and performance of the symmetrical IT-SOFCs with a single LSFNb x perovskite oxide as electrolyte are investigated. With the Nb doping, the structure stability of the LSFO is improved and the electronic conductivity decreases. La 0.6 Sr 0.4 Fe 0.8 Nb 0.2 O 3−δ (LSFNb20) is the most promising electrolyte of the three candidates as it has the best performance (735 mW cm −2 at 550 °C in a dry H 2 /Air atmosphere) and no short-circuiting problem. The applied voltage-response current curves demonstrate that the interface between the Ni-Ni 0.8 Co 0.15 Al 0.05 LiO 2−δ anode and LSFNb20 electrolyte can block electron conduction more efficiently and has a better promoting effect on protons, which is fundamentally due to the band energy alignment of the interface heterojunction.

The two distinct correlation functions are derived from a single experiment. Because the relaxation time changes only 2\% during structural recovery, no aging model is needed to analyze the results. Although being conceptually different processes, dielectric relaxation and recovery dynamics are observed to be identical for propylene glycol, whereas single-particle dynamics as seen by photon correlation spectroscopy are significantly faster. This confirms the notion that structural recovery and aging are governed by all modes observed by dielectric spectroscopy, i.e., including cross correlations, not only by single-particle dynamics. A comparison with analogous results for other materials suggests that the relation between relaxation and recovery time scales may be material specific rather than universal.},

  abstract = {Recent experiments of chemical reactions in optical cavities have shown great promise to alter and steer chemical reactions, but still remain poorly understood theoretically. In particular, the origin of resonant effects between the cavity and certain vibrational modes in the collective limit is still subject to active research. In this paper, we study the unimolecular dissociation reactions of many molecules, collectively interacting with an infrared cavity mode, through their vibrational dipole moment. We find that the reaction rate can slow down by increasing the number of aligned molecules, if the cavity mode is resonant with a vibrational mode of the molecules. We also discover a simple scaling relation that scales with the collective Rabi splitting, to estimate the onset of reaction rate modification by collective vibrational strong coupling and numerically demonstrate these effects for up to 10 4 molecules.},

  abstract = {A detailed insight behind the structure of absorption bands of the photochromic couple dimethyldihydropyrene (DHP)/metacyclophanediene (CPD) is studied employing vibronic coupling theory. Two separate model molecular Hamiltonians, including a maximum of four electronic states and 18 vibrational modes for DHP and five electronic states and 20 vibrational modes for CPD, are constructed in a diabatic electronic representation. The parameters of the Hamiltonians are estimated from the electronic energies obtained from extensive density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT calculations. Based on these Hamiltonians’ parameters, a detailed analysis of potential energy curves is performed in conjunction with positional and energetic locations of several stationary points in multi-dimensional potential energy surfaces. Based on the results of electronic structure calculations, quantum nuclear dynamics studies on the electronic excited states of DHP and CPD are performed to understand the impact of non-adiabatic effects on the formation of vibronic structures of absorption bands of these photo-isomers.},

  abstract = {The mode selectivity in the prototypical H + CH 3 D reaction is investigated by the initial state selected time-dependent wave packet method within a ten-dimensional quantum dynamics model. The model is a novel reduced dimensional model for the X + YCZ 3 reaction, which allows the CZ 3 to break C 3V symmetry. The calculated reaction probabilities initially from different reactant vibrational states show that the CH 3 stretching modes excitations obviously promote the H-abstraction reaction but have a slight influence on the D-abstraction reaction. In contrast, the CD stretching mode excitation significantly enhances the D-abstraction reaction. For both H- and D-abstraction reactions, the excitation of either the CH 3 umbrella bending mode or the CH 3 rocking mode shows a promotional effect on the reactivity, while fundamental excitation of the CH 3 bending mode has a negligible effect. Impressively, the first-overtone excitation of CH 3 bending mode remarkably promotes the H-abstraction reaction, resulting from the 1:2 Fermi coupling between the CH 3 symmetric stretching mode and the first overtone of CH 3 bending mode. In addition, translational energy is more efficient than vibrational energy in promoting the H-abstraction reaction at low energy, while vibrational energy becomes more efficient for the D-abstraction reaction.},

The generalized spectroscopic cross sections of CO–He/Ar indicate that the Dicke narrowing effect competes with the pressure broadening effect. The pressure broadening can be explained by the dynamic behaviors of intermolecular collisions. The intermolecular inelastic collisions contribute more than 95\% to the pressure broadening in both CO–He and CO–Ar systems at high temperatures. Regarding the state-to-state inelastic contributions to pressure broadening, the maximum contribution out of the final state of a given line is close to that out of the initial state. The Dicke narrowing effect influences the line shape profile significantly at high temperatures, which suggests that it is indispensable for reproducing the spectral line profile. With the Dicke narrowing effect, the calculated pressure-broadening coefficients and spectral intensity distribution are in good agreement with the available experimental observations.},

  abstract = {This paper provides results of dielectric relaxation (DR) spectroscopy of aqueous solutions of tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Tris) covering frequencies of 0.05 ≤ ν /GHz ≤ 89 ⁠ . The DR spectra can be well fit by a sum of Cole–Cole relaxation, assigned to the solute, and 2 Debye modes already observed for neat water. Analysis of the amplitudes reveals that Tris is hydrated by 7 H 2 Os up to its solubility limit. However, the rather high effective solute dipole moment of ≈12 D suggests that H 2 O dipoles in contact with Tris should reorient independently from it. Accordingly, an alternative description of the DR spectra with a superposition of 4 Debyerelaxations was attempted. In this model, the slowest mode at ∼4 GHz arises from solute reorientation and that at ∼8 GHz was assigned to dynamically retarded hydration water, whereas relaxations at ∼18 and ∼500 GHz are again those of (rather unperturbed) bulk water. Analysis of the solvent-related modes shows that Tris indeed slows down 7–8 H 2 O molecules. However, the solute–solvent interaction strength is rather weak, excluding the rotation of an alleged Tris-(7–8) H 2 O cluster as an entity. The now derived effective dipole moment of (6.3 ± 0.5) D for the bare Tris molecule allows speculations on its conformation. With the help of computational methods, we suggest that Tris dissolved in water most likely possesses an intramolecular H-bond between the nitrogen and hydrogen atoms of amino and hydroxyl groups, respectively. In addition, computational results indicate that the seven hydration H 2 Os found by DR bind directly to the Tris OH groups.},

  abstract = {The formation of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and lithium ion intercalation are two crucial processes in lithium ion batteries. Given the complexity and challenges involved in investigating real batteries, a combination of model batteries comprising well-defined ultrathin graphite electrodes with surface-sensitive techniques can provide valuable information on these processes. Here, a comparative study of the performance of batteries using regular- and high-concentration electrolytes (RCE and HCE) is presented, aided by a myriad of correlative surface science techniques. It is found that the SEI formed in HCE possesses a thinner organic layer and more inorganic substances. Such an effective SEI protects the graphite electrode and facilitates the processes of Li + intercalation/deintercalation, thereby improving the reversibility and cycling stability of the battery, superior to those with RCE. Moreover, the battery performance can be readily tuned by switching the electrolytes. The good cycling stability of the battery can still be maintained in RCE after the preformation of a robust SEI on the ultrathin graphite electrode in HCE. This work highlights the importance of electrolyte-modulated SEI formation to battery performance and provides powerful platforms to comprehensively study the SEI formation and ion intercalation processes.},

Here, we describe a method to safely produce detonations and dynamic extreme conditions in high explosives and in inert solids and liquids on a tabletop in a high-throughput format. This method uses a shock compression microscope, a microscope with a pulsed laser that can launch a hypervelocity flyer plate along with a velocimeter, an optical pyrometer, and a nanosecond camera that together can measure pressures, densities, and temperatures with high time and space resolution (2 ns and 2 µ m). We discuss how a detonation builds up in liquid nitromethane and show that we can produce and study detonations in sample volumes close to the theoretical minimum. We then discuss how a detonation builds up from a shock in a plastic-bonded explosive (PBX) based on HMX (1,3,5,7-Tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocane), where the initial steps are hotspot formation and deflagration growth in the shocked microstructure. A method is demonstrated where we can measure thermal emission from high-temperature reactions in every HMX crystal in the PBX, with the intent of determining which configurations produce the critical hot spots that grow and ignite the entire PBX.},

The measurements utilized time-resolved X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure (TR-XANES) spectroscopy and X-ray Solution Scattering (TR-XSS) at the Linac Coherent Light Source x-ray free electron laser in a laser pump/x-ray probe experiment. The XANES measurements around the L 1 -edge of the generated nascent iodine atoms (I 0 ) yield an average electron ejection distance from the iodine parent of 7.4 ± 1.5 Å with an excitation yield of about 1/3 of the 0.1M NaI aqueous solution. The kinetic traces of the XANES measurement are in agreement with a purely diffusion-driven geminate iodine–electron recombination model without the need for a long-lived (I 0 :e − ) contact pair. Nonequilibrium classical molecular dynamics simulations indicate a delayed response of the caging H 2 O solvent shell and this is supported by the structural analysis of the XSS data: We identify a two-step process exhibiting a 0.1 ps delayed solvent shell reorganization time within the tight H-bond network and a 0.3 ps time constant for the mean iodine–oxygen distance changes. The results indicate that most of the reorganization can be explained classically by a transition from a hydrophilic cavity with a well-ordered first solvation shell (hydrogens pointing toward I − ) to an expanded cavity around I 0 with a more random orientation of the H 2 O molecules in a broadened first solvation shell.},

Rev. Mater. 2 , 053801 (2018)]. In the method, the XRD data are assimilated into the simulation by adding a penalty function to the physical potential energy, where a crystallinity-type penalty function, defined by the difference between experimental and simulated diffraction angles was used. To improve the success rate and noise robustness, we introduce a correlation-coefficient-type penalty function adaptable to XRD data with significant experimental noise. We apply the new penalty function to SiO 2 coesite and ɛ -Zn(OH) 2 to determine its effectiveness in the data assimilation method.},

This approach employs the Breit–Pauli Hamiltonian and Wigner–Eckart’s theorem applied to the reduced one-particle transition density matrices, together with the spin–orbit mean-field treatment of the two-electron contributions. We use a state-interaction procedure and compute the SOC matrix elements using zero-order non-relativistic states. Benchmark calculations using several closed-shell organic molecules, diradicals, and a single-molecule magnet illustrate the efficiency of the SOC protocol. The results for organic molecules (described by standard TD-DFT) show that SOCs are insensitive to the choice of the functional or basis sets, as long as the states of the same characters are compared. In contrast, the SF-TD-DFT results for small diradicals (CH 2 , NH 2 + ⁠ , SiH 2 , and PH 2 + ⁠ ) show strong functional dependence. The spin-reversal energy barrier in a Fe(III) single-molecule magnet computed using non-collinear SF-TD-DFT (PBE0, ω PBEh/cc-pVDZ) agrees well with the experimental estimate.},

It is shown that the size of the spin state space can be reduced by half to the subspace described by the site-average Hamiltonian and that the dynamics of the system results in a redistribution of the population between its eigenstates. Analytical expressions for the rates of population redistribution and the line shape are derived for the general case in which the back-and-forth rates are unequal. The EPR signals calculated using these expressions are in very good agreement with those obtained by direct numerical solution of the density matrix rate equations. The model is then used to investigate the influence of exciton hopping on triplet state transient EPR spectra. Using the triplet state of the primary donor of Photosystem I as an example, it is shown that the influence of unequal hopping rates becomes more pronounced in the spectrum at longer delay times after the laser flash.},

To further test this conjecture, we study the realizability problem of the nonequilibrium iso- g 2 process, i.e., the determination of density-dependent effective potentials that yield equilibrium states in which g 2 remains invariant for a positive range of densities. Using a precise inverse algorithm that determines effective potentials that match hypothesized functional forms of g 2 ( r ) for all r and S ( k ) for all k , we show that the unit-step function g 2 , which is the zero-density limit of the hard-sphere potential, is remarkably realizable up to the packing fraction ϕ = 0.49 for d = 1. For d = 2 and 3, it is realizable up to the maximum “terminal” packing fraction ϕ c = 1/2 d , at which the systems are hyperuniform, implying that the explicitly known necessary conditions for realizability are sufficient up through ϕ c . For ϕ near but below ϕ c , the large- r behaviors of the effective potentials are given exactly by the functional forms exp[ − κ ( ϕ ) r ] for d = 1, r −1/2 exp[ − κ ( ϕ ) r ] for d = 2, and r −1 exp[ − κ ( ϕ ) r ] (Yukawa form) for d = 3, where κ −1 ( ϕ ) is a screening length, and for ϕ = ϕ c , the potentials at large r are given by the pure Coulomb forms in the respective dimensions as predicted by Torquato and Stillinger [Phys. Rev. E 68 , 041113 (2003)]. We also find that the effective potential for the pair statistics of the 3D “ghost” random sequential addition at the maximum packing fraction ϕ c = 1/8 is much shorter ranged than that for the 3D unit-step function g 2 at ϕ c ; thus, it does not constrain the realizability of the unit-step function g 2 . Our inverse methodology yields effective potentials for realizable targets, and, as expected, it does not reach convergence for a target that is known to be non-realizable, despite the fact that it satisfies all known explicit necessary conditions. Our findings demonstrate that exploring the iso- g 2 process via our inverse methodology is an effective and robust means to tackle the realizability problem and is expected to facilitate the design of novel nanoparticle systems with density-dependent effective potentials, including exotic hyperuniform states of matter.},

  abstract = {This work develops and illustrates a new method of calculating “chemically accurate” electronic wavefunctions (and energies) via a truncated full configuration interaction (CI) procedure, which arguably circumvents the large matrix diagonalization that is the core problem of full CI and is also central to modern selective CI approaches. This is accomplished simply by following the standard/ubiquitous Davidson method in its “direct” form—wherein, in each iteration, the electronic Hamiltonian operator is applied directly in second quantization to the Ritz vector/wavefunction from the prior iteration—except that (in this work) only a small portion of the resultant expansion vector is actually even computed (through the application of only a similarly small portion of the Hamiltonian). Specifically, at each iteration of this truncated Davidson approach, the new expansion vector is taken to be twice as large as that from the prior iteration. In this manner, a small set of highly truncated expansion vectors (say 10–30) of increasing precision is incrementally constructed, forming a small subspace within which diagonalization of the Hamiltonian yields clear, consistent, and monotonically variational convergence to the approximate full CI limit. The good efficiency in which convergence to the level of chemical accuracy (1.6 mhartree) is achieved suggests, at least for the demonstrated problem sizes—Hilbert spaces of 10 18 and wavefunctions of 10 8 determinants—that this truncated Davidson methodology can serve as a replacement of standard CI and complete-active space approaches in circumstances where only a few chemically significant digits of accuracy are required and/or meaningful in view of ever-present basis set limitations.},

  abstract = {A model of symmetry breaking (SB) charge separation in symmetric excited dyads and dimers is presented. The minimal model should include at least four basis electronic states due to a small energy gap between the locally excited and charge separated (zwitterionic) states of the chromophores. There are electronic couplings between all these states. The model includes the following interactions: (i) the Coulomb interaction between charges on the chromophores of the dyad, (ii) the interaction of the dipole moment of the asymmetric dyad with the solvent polarization, and (iii) the electronic–vibrational interaction. SB becomes possible only if the intensity of these interactions exceeds a threshold value. The threshold vanishes if there is a degeneration of the levels. Unusual resonant dependencies of the dissymmetry degree on the model parameters are revealed. Resonances arise due to the degeneration of energy levels. The ranges of the parameters in which energy level crossings occur are established. The oddity lies in the dependence of the resonance shape on the parameters of the model. A variation in the electronic couplings and the energy gap between the locally excited and ionic states, which leads to a broadening of the resonance, simultaneously leads to an increase in the resonant height. This opens up wide possibilities for controlling the charge separation degree. The predictions of the theory agree with the available experimental data. The charge separation SB is predicted to accompany by SB in the excitation distribution on the branches of dyads.},

For this purpose, we model the molecular system in terms of probable “scenarios,” governed by different potential energy functions, which are separately sampled by classical MD simulations. Reweighting the canonical distribution of each scenario according to specific environmental variables, we estimate the grand canonical distribution, then use the Square Root Approximation method to discretize the Fokker-Planck operator into a rate matrix and the robust Perron Cluster Cluster Analysis method to coarse-grain the kinetic model. This permits efficiently estimating the transition rates of conformational states as functions of environmental variables, for example, the local pH at a cell membrane. In this work, we formalize the theoretical framework of the procedure, and we present a numerical experiment comparing the results with those provided by a constant-pH method based on non-equilibrium Molecular Dynamics Monte Carlo simulations.

  abstract = {Dilute magnetic semiconductors (DMSs) with both charge and spin degrees of freedom have emerged as promising candidates in the spintronic industry. However, the Curie temperature below room temperature and uncertainty about the origin of ferromagnetism hinder the application of DMSs. To address these issues, we explored a better SnO 2 -based co-doped method (Fe, V + V Sn ) using ab initio calculations. The calculation results show that the Sn 13 FeVO 32 (Fe, V + V Sn ) has a high Curie temperature (716 K), good ferromagnetic properties, stronger covalency of bonds, and better optical transparency in the visible light range. In addition, the holes or electrons generated by the complexes in the (Fe, V + V O /V Sn ) co-doped system cause a spin-polarized double exchange effect in the Fe-3d, V-3d, and O-2p orbitals, which leads to magnetism of the co-doped systems. The static dielectric constant ɛ 1 (0) of the system increases after doping. Among them, Sn 14 FeVO 31 (Fe, V + V O ) has the largest ɛ 1 (0), indicating that Sn 14 FeVO 31 has the strongest polarization ability and better photocatalytic properties. In Sn 14 FeVO 31 , the imaginary part of the dielectric function and the absorption spectrum all have new peaks in the low-energy region, which are caused by the jump of electrons from the guide band of the spin-polarized impurity energy level. This paper proposes a new method for preparing dilute magnetic semiconductors in spin electronic devices with high room temperature ferromagnetic properties and excellent optical properties through the (Fe, V + V O /V Sn ) co-doped SnO 2 .},

  abstract = {Living systems are built from microscopic components that function dynamically; they generate work with molecular motors, assemble and disassemble structures such as microtubules, keep time with circadian clocks, and catalyze the replication of DNA. How do we implement these functions in synthetic nanostructured materials to execute them before the onset of dissipative losses? Answering this question requires a quantitative understanding of when we can improve performance and speed while minimizing the dissipative losses associated with operating in a fluctuating environment. Here, we show that there are four modalities for optimizing dynamical functions that can guide the design of nanoscale systems. We analyze Markov models that span the design space: a clock, ratchet, replicator, and self-assembling system. Using stochastic thermodynamics and an exact expression for path probabilities, we classify these models of dynamical functions based on the correlation of speed with dissipation and with the chosen performance metric. We also analyze random networks to identify the model features that affect their classification and the optimization of their functionality. Overall, our results show that the possible nonequilibrium paths can determine our ability to optimize the performance of dynamical functions, despite ever-present dissipation, when there is a need for speed.},

For randomly sampled initial coordinates of small organic query molecules, we report systematic improvement of equilibrium and transition state geometry output as training set sizes increase. Out-of-sample S N 2 reactant complexes and transition state geometries have been predicted using the LBFGS and the QST2 algorithms with an root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 0.16 and 0.4 Å—after training on up to 200 reactant complex relaxations and transition state search trajectories from the QMrxn20 dataset, respectively. For geometry optimizations, we have also considered relaxation paths up to 5’595 constitutional isomers with sum formula C 7 H 10 O 2 from the QM9-database. Using the resulting OQML models with an LBFGS optimizer reproduces the minimum geometry with an RMSD of 0.14 Å, only using ∼6000 training points obtained from normal mode sampling along the optimization paths of the training compounds without the need for active learning. For converged equilibrium and transition state geometries, subsequent vibrational normal mode frequency analysis indicates deviation from MP2 reference results by on average 14 and 26 cm −1 , respectively. While the numerical cost for OQML predictions is negligible in comparison to density functional theory or MP2, the number of steps until convergence is typically larger in either case. The success rate for reaching convergence, however, improves systematically with training set size, underscoring OQML’s potential for universal applicability.},

In this work, we reveal two types of active sites at the nano-sized Cu/ZnO interface, of which only one type is efficient. The efficient active site is characterized by isolated and under-coordinated Zn atoms located at the vertices of the supported ZnO island, thus the density of which is so limited. To anchor such Zn atoms onto other islands on Cu with high density is the key to enhancing the catalytic activity. To replace ZnO with Al 2 O 3 islands on Cu is not favored energetically. However, under reduction condition, Zn single atoms can stably decorate the edges of the Al 2 O 3 islands, resulting in the enhancement of the efficient active sites at the Cu/oxide interface. This could be the mechanism of the synergy effects taking place in the Cu/ZnO/Al 2 O 3 catalyst.},

  abstract = {Graphynes can be structurally envisioned as 2D extensions to graphene, whereby linearly bonded carbon linkages increase the distance between trigonal carbon nodes. Many graphynes have been predicted to exhibit a Dirac-like semimetallic (SEM) graphenic electronic structure, which could potentially make them competitive with graphene for applications. Currently, most graphynes remain as attractive synthetic targets, and their properties are still unconfirmed. Here, we demonstrate that the electronic structure of hexagonal α-graphyne is analogous to that of biaxially strained graphene. By comparison with accurate quantum Monte Carlo results on strained graphene, we show that the relative energetic stability of electronic states in this correlated 2D system can be captured by density functional theory (DFT) calculations using carefully tailored hybrid functionals. Our tuned hybrid DFT approach confirms that α-graphyne has a low energy correlated Mott-like antiferromagnetic insulating (AFI) state, which competes with the SEM state. Our work shows that the AFI-SEM crossover in α-graphyne could be tunable by in-plane biaxial strain. Applying our approach to other graphynes shows that they should also exhibit correlated AFI states, which could be dominant even at zero strain. Calculations using an onsite Coulombic repulsive term (i.e., DFT + U ) also confirm the predictions of our hybrid DFT calculations. Overall, our work strongly suggests that graphynes are not as graphenic (i.e., Dirac-like) as often previously predicted by DFT calculations using standard generalized gradient approximation functionals. However, due to the greater electronic versatility (e.g., tunable semiconducting bandgaps and accessible spin polarized states) implied by our study, graphynes could have novel device applications that are complementary to those of graphene.},

  abstract = {The rotational dynamics of water near the ice/water interface and its relation with the crystal growth of ice are investigated by using molecular dynamics simulations. We find that the dipole-moment profiles of water adjacent to interfaces display an oscillation behavior, which is in contrast to the monotonic decay near the free surface for water films. This dielectric oscillation phenomenon is associated with the strong response to hard solid/water interface. It significantly suppresses the dielectric relaxation and slows down the rotational diffusion near the interface compared to bulk water. We propose that the rotational diffusion determines the active degree of growth sites on interfaces, and its slowdown due to the interfacial dielectric oscillation contributes to reducing the growth rate of ice. With this idea, we predict the crystal growth rate of ice based on the modified Wilson–Frenkel model involving rotational dynamics. The theoretical result agrees well with the simulation.},

  abstract = {Structural modulation of the active site with atomic-level precision is of great importance to meet the activity and selectivity challenges that electrocatalysts are commonly facing. In this work, we have designed a metal (M)–nonmetal diatomic site embedded in graphene-like C 2 N (denoted as Mo–B@C 2 N), where the electrocatalytic N 2 reduction reaction (eNRR) was thoroughly explored using density functional theory combined with the computational hydrogen electrode method. Compared to M–M diatomic sites, the Mo–B site can generate a pronounced synergistic effect that led to eNRR proceeding via a novel quasi-dissociative reaction mechanism that has not been reported relative to the conventional enzymatic, consecutive, distal, and alternating associative mechanism. This newly uncovered mechanism in which N–N bond scission takes place immediately after the first proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) step (i.e., *NH–*N + H + + e − → *NH 2 *N) has demonstrated much advantage in the PCET process over the four conventional mechanism in terms of thermodynamic barrier, except that the adsorption of side-on *N 2 seemed thermodynamically unfavorable (Δ G ads = 0.61 eV). Our results have revealed that the activation of the inert N≡N triple bond is dominated by the π*-backdonation mechanism as a consequence of charge transfers from both the B and Mo sites and, unexpectedly, from the substrate C 2 N itself as well. Moreover, the hybrid Mo–B diatomic site demonstrated superior performance over either the Mo–Mo or B–B site for driving eNRR. Our study could provide insight into the delicate relationships among atomic site, substrate, and electrocatalytic performance.},

  abstract = {Graphene and its derivatives, due to their two-dimensional carbon nanostructures, have provided new opportunities to fortify organic dye-based photovoltaic and photocatalytic assemblies. In this article, we employed organic dyes Rhodamine B (RdB) and graphene oxide (GO) [or reduced graphene oxide (RGO)] to assemble the composite materials RdB–GO and RdB–RGO. It was found that both GO and RGO could strongly quench the fluorescence (FL) intensity of RdB. The mechanisms of FL quenching in both RdB–GO and RdB–RGO have been investigated by using femtosecond fluorescence up-conversion and transient absorption spectroscopy. When RdB was anchored on the GO (or RGO) surface, the solvent relaxation component 3.1 ps of pure RdB disappeared; instead, the ultrafast excited state electron transfer process (1–2ps) in RdB-GO and RdB-RGO was found and originated from the LUMO of RdB to the conduction band of GO (or RGO). We further reveal that the energy level change caused by GO reduction makes the energy levels of RGO closer to those of RdB, resulting in the electron transfer being more effective in RdB–RGO. Therefore, the RdB–RGO composite materials may have higher application values for dye-sensitized solar cells.},

The bound coherent neutron scattering length of the isotope 25 Mg was remeasured, and the value of 3.720(12) fm was obtained from a Rietveld refinement of the powder diffraction patterns measured for crystalline 25 MgO. The diffraction results for the glasses show a broad asymmetric distribution of Mg–O nearest-neighbors with a coordination number of 4.40(4) and 4.46(4) for the diopside and enstatite glasses, respectively. As magnesia is replaced by alumina along a tie-line with 50 or 60 mol.\% silica, the Mg–O coordination number increases with the weighted bond distance as less Mg 2+ ions adopt a network-modifying role and more of these ions adopt a predominantly charge-compensating role. 25 Mg magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR results could not resolve the different coordination environments of Mg 2+ under the employed field strength (14.1 T) and spinning rate (20 kHz).

A statistical analysis is applied on the undercooling distributions obtained from nine different compositions, ranging from the pure semimetal (Ge) to the pure metal (Cu). By considering each undercooling distribution as an inhomogeneous Poisson process, the nucleation rates for every composition are calculated. The Thompson–Spaepen model for homogeneous nucleation in binary alloys is applied, enabling the estimation of nucleation parameters, such as kinetic pre-factors and interfacial energies, as a function of composition. Furthermore, the Turnbull coefficient α , a dimensionless solid–liquid interfacial energy constant, is also calculated as a function of alloy constitution, suggesting a dependence on the liquid composition. The composition-dependent changes of α are of considerable importance, since the α is originally defined for pure systems as a quantity dependent on crystal structure, and is nevertheless used for describing nucleation kinetics of binary and glass forming multi-component alloy systems.},

  abstract = {Nucleation is a key step in the synthesis of a new material from a solution. The well-established lattice-gas models can be used to gain insight into the basic physics of nucleation pathways involving a single nucleus type. In many situations, a solution is supersaturated with respect to more than one precipitating phase. This can generate a population of both stable and metastable nuclei on similar timescales and, hence, complex nucleation pathways involving a competition between the two. In this study, we introduce a lattice-gas model based on two types of interacting dimers representing the particles in a solution. Each type of dimer nucleates to a specific space-filling structure. Our model is tuned such that stable and metastable phases nucleate on a similar timescale. Either structure may nucleate first, with a probability sensitive to the relative rate at which a solute is replenished from their respective reservoirs. We calculate these nucleation rates via forward flux sampling and demonstrate how the resulting data can be used to infer the nucleation outcome and pathway. Possibilities include direct nucleation of the stable phase, domination of long-lived metastable crystallites, and pathways in which the stable phase nucleates only after multiple post-critical nuclei of the metastable phase have appeared.},

Experimental data are compared to theoretical calculations performed at the coupled cluster, restricted active space perturbation theory to second-order and time-dependent density functional levels of theory. We demonstrate (1) that both N and O K -edge XA spectra are sensitive to the amount of dynamical electron correlation included in the theoretical description and (2) that for a complete description of XP spectra, additional orbital correlation and orbital relaxation effects need to be considered. The normal AE spectra are dominated by a singlet excitation channel and well described by theory. The resonant AE spectra, however, are more complicated. While the participator decay channels, dominating at higher kinetic energies, are well described by coupled cluster theory, spectator channels can only be described satisfactorily using a method that combines restricted active space perturbation theory to second order for the bound part and a one-center approximation for the continuum.},

The former involves the release of neutral CN, while the latter involves an intramolecular rearrangement. We find the intramolecular rearrangement takes place on a single picosecond timescale and exhibits vibrational coherence. Density functional theory and coupled-cluster calculations on the neutral and singly ionized species help us determine the driving force responsible for intramolecular rearrangement in CH 3 NCS.

Geometries and vibrational frequencies of reactants, products, and transition states were calculated using density functional theory, with single-point energy corrections determined at the domain-based local pair natural orbital-coupled-cluster single double triple/cc-pVTZ-F12 level. The high-pressure limit rate constants were calculated using the canonical variational transition state theory with the small-curvature tunneling approximation. The vibrational partition functions were corrected by the effects of torsional and ring-puckering anharmonicities of the transition states and cyclopentene, respectively. Variational effects are shown to be relevant for all the hydrogen abstraction reactions. The increasing of the rate constants by tunneling is significant at temperatures below 500 K. The pressure dependence on the rate constants of the addition of OH • to cyclopentene was calculated using the system-specific quantum Rice–Ramsperger–Kassel model. The high-pressure limit rate constants decrease with increasing temperature in the range 250–1000 K. The falloff behavior was studied at several temperatures with pressures varying between 10 −3 and 10 3 bar. At temperatures below 500 K, the effect of the pressure on the addition rate constant is very modest. However, at temperatures around and above 1000 K, taking pressure into account is mandatory for an accurate rate constant calculation. Branching ratio analyses reveal that the addition reaction dominates at temperatures below 500 K, decreasing rapidly at higher temperatures. Arrhenius parameters are provided for all reactions and pressure dependent Arrhenius parameters are given for the addition of OH • to cyclopentene.},

  abstract = {Molecular-scale design strategies for promoting intersystem crossing (ISC) in small organic molecules are ubiquitous in developing efficient metal-free triplet photosensitizers with high triplet quantum yield (Φ T ). Air-stable and highly fluorescent perylenediimide (PDI) in its pristine form displays very small ISC compared to the fluorescence due to the large singlet–triplet gap (Δ E S − T ) and negligibly small spin–orbit coupling (SOC) between the lowest singlet ( S 1 ) and triplet state ( T 1 ). However, its Φ T can be tuned by different chemical and mechanical means that are capable of either directly lowering the Δ E S − T and increasing SOC or introducing intermediate low-lying triplet states ( T n , n = 2, 3, …) between S 1 and T 1 . To this end, herein, a few chalcogen (X = O, S, Se) bay-substituted PDIs (PDI-X 2 ) are computationally modeled aiming at introducing geometrical-strain at the PDI core and also mixing nπ * orbital character to ππ * in the lowest singlet and triplet excited states, which altogether may reduce Δ E S − T and also improve the SOC. Our quantum-chemical calculations based on optimally tuned range-separated hybrid reveal the presence of intermediate triplet states ( T n , n = 2, 3) in between S 1 and T 1 for all three PDI-X 2 studied in dichloromethane. More importantly, PDI-X 2 shows a significantly improved ISC rate than the pristine PDI due to the combined effects stemming from the smaller Δ E S − T and the larger SOC. The calculated ISC rates follow the order as PDI-O 2 &lt; PDI-S 2 &lt; PDI-Se 2 . These research findings will be helpful in designing PDI based triplet photosensitizers for biomedical, sensing, and photonic applications.},

The use of a custom-designed dispersive XAS (DXAS) setup allows us to increase the time resolution over existing fluorescence measurements from ∼15 min to 2 s for a complete absorption spectrum. Hence, we here establish TRIS-XAS as a viable method for studying mechanochemical reactions and sampling reaction kinetics. The generality of our approach is demonstrated through RAM-induced (i) bottom-up Au nanoparticle mechanosynthesis and (ii) the synthesis of a prototypical metal organic framework, ZIF-8. Moreover, we demonstrate that our approach also works with the addition of a stainless steel milling ball, opening the door to using TRIS-DXAS for following conventional ball milling reactions. We expect that our TRIS-DXAS approach will become an essential part of the mechanochemical tool box.},

  abstract = {Hot carriers generated from the decay of plasmon excitation can be harvested to drive a wide range of physical or chemical processes. However, their generation efficiency is limited by the concomitant phonon-induced relaxation processes by which the energy in excited carriers is transformed into heat. However, simulations of dynamics of nanoscale clusters are challenging due to the computational complexity involved. Here, we adopt our newly developed Trajectory Surface Hopping (TSH) nonadiabatic molecular dynamics algorithm to simulate plasmon relaxation in Au 20 clusters, taking the atomistic details into account. The electronic properties are treated within the Linear Response Time-Dependent Tight-binding Density Functional Theory (LR-TDDFTB) framework. The relaxation of plasmon due to coupling to phonon modes in Au 20 beyond the Born–Oppenheimer approximation is described by the TSH algorithm. The numerically efficient LR-TDDFTB method allows us to address a dense manifold of excited states to ensure the inclusion of plasmon excitation. Starting from the photoexcited plasmon states in Au 20 cluster, we find that the time constant for relaxation from plasmon excited states to the lowest excited states is about 2.7 ps, mainly resulting from a stepwise decay process caused by low-frequency phonons of the Au 20 cluster. Furthermore, our simulations show that the lifetime of the phonon-induced plasmon dephasing process is ∼10.4 fs and that such a swift process can be attributed to the strong nonadiabatic effect in small clusters. Our simulations demonstrate a detailed description of the dynamic processes in nanoclusters, including plasmon excitation, hot carrier generation from plasmon excitation dephasing, and the subsequent phonon-induced relaxation process.},

  abstract = {We study the emission spectra of the dissipative Rabi and Jaynes–Cummings models in the non-Markovian and ultrastrong coupling regimes. We have derived a polaron-transformed Nakajima–Zwanzig master equation (PTNZE) to calculate the emission spectra, which eliminates the well-known limitations of the Markovian approximation and the standard second-order perturbation. Using the time-dependent variational approach with the multiple Davydov ansatz as a benchmark, the PTNZE is found to yield accurate emission spectra in certain ultrastrong coupling regimes where the standard second-order Nakajima–Zwanzig master equation breaks down. It is shown that the emission spectra of the dissipative Rabi and Jaynes–Cummings models are, in general, asymmetric under various initial conditions. Direct comparisons of spectra for the two models illustrate the essential role of the qubit–cavity counter-rotating term and the spectral features under different qubit–cavity coupling strengths and system initial conditions.},

  abstract = {The GW approximation is considered to be the simplest approximation within Hedin’s formulation of many-body perturbation theory. It is expected that some of the deficiencies of the GW approximation can be overcome by adding the so-called vertex corrections. In this work, the recently implemented G 0 W 0 Γ 0 ( 1 ) scheme, which incorporates the vertex effects by adding the full second-order self-energy correction to the GW self-energy, is applied to a set of first-row transition-metal monoxide (TMO) anions. Benchmark calculations show that results obtained by G 0 W 0 Γ 0 ( 1 ) on top of the B3LYP hybrid functional starting point (SP) are in good agreement with experiment data, giving a mean absolute error of 0.13 eV for a testset comprising the ionization energies (IEs) of 27 outer valence molecular orbitals (MOs) from nine TMO anions. A systematic SP-dependence investigation by varying the ratio of the exact exchange (EXX) component in the PBE0-type SP reveals that, for G 0 W 0 Γ 0 ( 1 ) ⁠ , the best accuracy is achieved with 20\% EXX. Further error analysis in terms of the orbital symmetry characteristics (i.e., σ , π , or δ ) in the testset indicates the best amount of EXX in the SP for G 0 W 0 Γ 0 ( 1 ) calculations is independent of MO types, and this is in contrast with the situation in G 0 W 0 calculations, where the best EXX ratio varies for different classes of MOs. Despite its success in describing the absolute IE values, we, however, found that G 0 W 0 Γ 0 ( 1 ) faces difficulties in describing the energy separations between certain states of interest, worsening the already underestimated G 0 W 0 predictions.},

We benchmark our QSGW implementation on a set of weakly correlated semiconductors and insulators as well as strongly correlated transition metal oxides, including MnO, FeO, CoO, and NiO. The band gap, band structure, and density of states are evaluated using finite size corrected QSGW. We find that although QSGW systematically overestimates the bandgaps of the tested semiconductors and transition metal oxides, it completely removes the dependence on the choice of density functionals and provides a more consistent prediction of spectral properties than G 0 W 0 across a wide range of solids.

  abstract = {The adsorption of large rod-like molecules or crystallites on a flat crystal face, similar to Buffon’s needle, requires the rods to “land,” with their binding sites in precise orientational alignment with matching sites on the surface. An example is provided by long, helical antifreeze proteins (AFPs), which bind at specific facets and orientations on the ice surface. The alignment constraint for adsorption, in combination with the loss in orientational freedom as the molecule diffuses toward the surface, results in an entropic barrier that hinders the adsorption. Prior kinetic models do not factor in the complete geometry of the molecule, nor explicitly enforce orientational constraints for adsorption. Here, we develop a diffusion-controlled adsorption theory for AFP molecules binding at specific orientations to flat ice surfaces. We formulate the diffusion equation with relevant boundary conditions and present analytical solutions to the attachment rate constant. The resulting rate constant is a function of the length and aspect ratio of the AFP, the distance threshold associated with binding, and solvent conditions such as temperature and viscosity. These results and methods of calculation may also be useful for predicting the kinetics of crystal growth through oriented attachment.},

Rev. B 104 , 035121 (2021) and Sekaran et al. , Computation 10 , 45 (2022)]. In this work, we present an extension of this approach to the more general case of multi-orbital fragments using the block version of the Householder transformation applied to the one-body reduced density matrix, unlocking the applicability to general quantum chemistry/condensed matter physics Hamiltonians. A step-by-step construction of the block Householder transformation is presented. Both physical and numerical areas of interest of the approach are highlighted. The specific mean-field (noninteracting) case is thoroughly detailed as it is shown that the embedding of a given N spin–orbital fragment leads to the generation of two separated sub-systems: (1) a 2 N spin–orbitals “fragment+bath” cluster that exactly contains N electrons and (2) a remaining cluster’s “environment” described by so-called core electrons. We illustrate the use of this transformation in different cases of embedding scheme for practical applications. We particularly focus on the extension of the previously introduced Local Potential Functional Embedding Theory and Householder-transformed Density Matrix Functional Embedding Theory to the case of multi-orbital fragments. These calculations are realized on different types of systems, such as model Hamiltonians (Hubbard rings) and ab initio molecular systems (hydrogen rings).},

  abstract = {We present an efficient method based on an extension of metadynamics for exploring complex free energy landscapes (FELs). The method employs two-step metadynamics simulations. In the first step, rapid metadynamics simulations using broad and tall Gaussians are performed to identify a free energy pathway (FEP) connecting the two states of interest. The FEP is then divided into a series of independent subphase spaces that comprise selected discrete images of the system. Using appropriate collective variables (CVs) chosen according to the FEP, the accurate FEL of each subphase space is separately calculated in subsequent divide-and-conquer metadynamics simulations with narrow and low Gaussians. Finally, all FELs calculated in each subphase space are merged to obtain the full FEL. We show that the method greatly improves the performance of the metadynamics approach. In particular, we are able to efficiently model chemical systems with complex FELs, such as chemical reactions at the air/water interface. We demonstrate the performance of this method on two model reactions: the hydrolysis of formaldehyde in the gas phase and at the air/water interface.},

The algorithm adapts to this nontrivial case, the recently introduced Mass-Zero (MaZe) constrained dynamics. The formalism ensures that full adiabatic separation is enforced between nuclear and electronic degrees of freedom and, consequently, that the exact Born–Oppenheimer probability for the nuclei is sampled. Numerical integration of the MaZe dynamics combines standard molecular dynamics algorithms, e.g., Verlet or velocity Verlet, with the SHAKE method to impose the minimum conditions on the electronic degrees of freedom as a set of constraints. The developments presented in this work, which include a bespoke adaptation of the standard SHAKE algorithm, ensure that the quasilinear scaling of OFDFT is preserved by the new method for a broad range of kinetic and exchange–correlation functionals, including nonlocal ones. The efficiency and accuracy of the approach are demonstrated via calculations of static and dynamic properties of liquid sodium in the constant energy and constant temperature ensembles.},

  abstract = {A statistical emulator can be used as a surrogate of complex physics-based calculations to drastically reduce the computational cost. Its successful implementation hinges on an accurate representation of the nonlinear response surface with a high-dimensional input space. Conventional “space-filling” designs, including random sampling and Latin hypercube sampling, become inefficient as the dimensionality of the input variables increases, and the predictive accuracy of the emulator can degrade substantially for a test input distant from the training input set. To address this fundamental challenge, we develop a reliable emulator for predicting complex functionals by active learning with error control (ALEC). The algorithm is applicable to infinite-dimensional mapping with high-fidelity predictions and a controlled predictive error. The computational efficiency has been demonstrated by emulating the classical density functional theory (cDFT) calculations, a statistical-mechanical method widely used in modeling the equilibrium properties of complex molecular systems. We show that ALEC is much more accurate than conventional emulators based on the Gaussian processes with “space-filling” designs and alternative active learning methods. In addition, it is computationally more efficient than direct cDFT calculations. ALEC can be a reliable building block for emulating expensive functionals owing to its minimal computational cost, controllable predictive error, and fully automatic features.},

Different from the existing water models based on molecular many-body expansion, we adopt a separation scheme that is completely based on distances, which is more convenient for generic molecular systems. The geometry dependence of atomic charges and dispersion coefficients are also introduced to improve the accuracy of the long-range part of the potential. The new potential provides a physically interpretable energy decomposition, and it is more accurate than the conventional physically motived potentials. Most importantly, through this study, we show that the information we learn from small clusters can be extrapolated into larger systems, thus providing a general recipe for the intermolecular force field development at the coupled-cluster singles and doubles plus perturbative triples level of theory in the future.},

  abstract = {The study of phenomena such as protein folding and conformational changes in molecules is a central theme in chemical physics. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is the primary tool for the study of transition processes in biomolecules, but it is hampered by a huge timescale gap between the processes of interest and atomic vibrations that dictate the time step size. Therefore, it is imperative to combine MD simulations with other techniques in order to quantify the transition processes taking place on large timescales. In this work, the diffusion map with Mahalanobis kernel, a meshless approach for approximating the Backward Kolmogorov Operator (BKO) in collective variables, is upgraded to incorporate standard enhanced sampling techniques, such as metadynamics. The resulting algorithm, which we call the target measure Mahalanobis diffusion map ( tm-mmap ), is suitable for a moderate number of collective variables in which one can approximate the diffusion tensor and free energy. Imposing appropriate boundary conditions allows use of the approximated BKO to solve for the committor function and utilization of transition path theory to find the reactive current delineating the transition channels and the transition rate. The proposed algorithm, tm-mmap , is tested on the two-dimensional Moro–Cardin two-well system with position-dependent diffusion coefficient and on alanine dipeptide in two collective variables where the committor, the reactive current, and the transition rate are compared to those computed by the finite element method (FEM). Finally, tm-mmap is applied to alanine dipeptide in four collective variables where the use of finite elements is infeasible.},

This is applied to temporary anions of ethene and chlorinated ethene compounds, which are known to undergo dissociative electron attachment (DEA). It appears that the method is able to detect multiple valence resonance states in the same molecule, namely, a Π and a Σ state. The obtained nuclear and atom-condensed electronic Fukui functions are interpreted as nuclear forces and electron distributions, respectively, and show clear differences between the Π and Σ states. This enables a more profound characterization and understanding of how the DEA process proceeds. The conclusions are in line with findings from earlier publications, proving that the combination of conceptual DFT with the charge stabilization method yields reasonable results at rather low computational cost.},

These tensors are combined to evaluate the Buckingham/Dunn tensor that describes the optical rotation (OR) in oriented chiral systems. We describe several aspects of the derivation of the equations and present test calculations that verify the correctness of the tensor formulation and their implementation. The results show that the full OR tensor is completely origin invariant as for molecules and that PBC calculations match molecular cluster calculations on 1D chains. A preliminary investigation on the choice of density functional, basis set, and gauge indicates a similar dependence as for molecules: the functional is the primary factor that determines the OR magnitude, followed by the basis set and to a much smaller extent the choice of gauge. However, diffuse functions may be problematic for PBC calculations even if they are necessary for the molecular case. A comparison with experimental data of OR for the tartaric acid crystal shows reasonable agreement given the level of theory employed. The development presented in this paper offers the opportunity to simulate the OR of chiral crystalline materials with general-purpose DFT-PBC methods, which, in turn, may help to understand the role of intermolecular interactions on this sensitive electronic property.},

This provides a clear physical picture, clean expressions for reduced density matrix (RDM) elements, and systematic improvement (with a complete set of eigenvectors). Known expressions for the RDM elements require the computation of rapidities, which are obtained by first solving for the so-called eigenvalue based variables (EBV) and then root-finding a Lagrange interpolation polynomial. In this paper, we obtain expressions for the RDM elements directly in terms of the EBV. The final expressions can be computed at the same cost as the rapidity expressions. Therefore, except, in particular, circumstances, it is entirely unnecessary to compute rapidities at all. The RDM elements require numerically inverting a matrix, and while this is usually undesirable, we demonstrate that it is stable, except when there is degeneracy in the single-particle energies. In such cases, a different construction would be required.},

  abstract = {Electron transfer from a metal surface to a molecule is very important at the gas–surface interface, which can lead to electron-mediated energy transfer during molecular scattering from the surface, as evidenced by numerous state-to-state molecular beam experiments of NO and CO scattering from noble metal surfaces. However, it remains challenging to determine relevant charge-transfer states and their nonadiabatic couplings from first principles in such systems involving a continuum of metallic electronic states. In this work, we propose a pragmatic protocol for this purpose based on the constrained density functional theory (CDFT) approach. In particular, we discuss the influence of the charge partitioning algorithm used in CDFT to define the constraint property in molecule–metal systems. It is found that the widely used Bader charge analysis is adequate to define the physically sound CDFT diabatic states corresponding to a molecule with or without extra electron transferred from the metal. Numerical tests validate that the proposed CDFT scheme properly describes the electron transfer behaviors in several benchmark systems, namely, NO or CO interacting with Au(111) or Ag(111). The effects of the surface work function and the molecular electron affinity on electron transfer are discussed in detail by comparing the CDFT states of the four systems. This pragmatic CDFT protocol lays the foundation for constructing accurate global diabatic potential energy surfaces for these important systems and can be generalized to study other interfacial electron transfer related problems.},

  abstract = {As popular mixed quantum–classical dynamics methods, trajectory surface hopping and Ehrenfest mean field have been widely utilized to simulate nonadiabatic dynamics. Recently, we have proposed the branching-corrected surface hopping and the branching-corrected mean field methods, both of which closely reproduce the exact quantum dynamics in a series of standard scattering models. Here, the mixed surface hopping and mean field with branching correction (BCSHMF) is presented as a unified framework of mixed quantum–classical dynamics. As benchmarked in thousands of diverse three-level and four-level scattering models, BCSHMF achieves high reliability and flexibility, implying that surface hopping and mean field are compatible with each other in nature, and trajectory branching is essential for the mixed quantum–classical description of nonadiabatic dynamics.},

Here, we establish the dependence of these optical transitions on the disorder from hyperspectral imaging of h-BN encapsulated monolayer MoSe 2 . While both exciton and trion energies vary spatially, these two quantities are almost perfectly correlated, with spatial variation in the trion binding energy of only ∼0.18 meV. In contrast, variation in the energy splitting between the two lowest energy exciton states is one order of magnitude larger at ∼1.7 meV. Statistical analysis and theoretical modeling reveal that disorder results from dielectric and bandgap fluctuations, not electrostatic fluctuations. Our results shed light on disorder in high quality TMDC monolayers, its impact on optical transitions, and the many-body nature of excitons and trions.},

  abstract = {The ability of two-dimensional infrared (2D-IR) spectroscopy to measure the amide I band of proteins in H 2 O rather than D 2 O-based solvents by evading the interfering water signals has enabled in vivo studies of proteins under physiological conditions and in biofluids. Future exploitation of 2D-IR in analytical settings, from diagnostics to protein screening, will, however, require comparisons between multiple datasets, necessitating control of data collection protocols to minimize measurement-to-measurement inconsistencies. Inspired by analytical spectroscopy applications in other disciplines, we describe a workflow for pre-processing 2D-IR data that aims to simplify spectral cross-comparisons. Our approach exploits the thermal water signal that is collected simultaneously with, but is temporally separated from the amide I response to guide custom baseline correction and spectral normalization strategies before combining them with Principal Component noise reduction tools. Case studies show that application of elements of the pre-processing workflow to previously published data enables improvements in quantification accuracy and detection limits. We subsequently apply the complete workflow in a new pilot study, testing the ability of a prototype library of 2D-IR spectra to quantify the four major protein constituents of blood serum in a single, label-free measurement. These advances show progress toward the robust data handling strategies that will be necessary for future applications of 2D-IR to pharmaceutical or biomedical problems.},

With this aim, constant pH Monte Carlo (MC) simulations are performed within the primitive model, namely, the solvent is treated as a continuum dielectric. The study of the thermal and spatial fluctuations of the EP reveals that they are remarkably high inside the protein. The calculations indicate that fluctuations inside the protein are mainly due to the asymmetric distribution of the charge groups, while the charge fluctuations of the titratable groups play a minor role. The computed EP matches very well with the one obtained from the Poisson equation for the average charge density in spherical symmetry. The Tanford–Kirkwood multipole expansion reproduces the simulated angular-averaged potential rather accurately. Surprisingly, two of the simplest mean-field models, the linear Poisson–Boltzmann (PB) equation and Donnan potential, provide good estimations of the average EP in the effective protein surface (surface EP). The linear PB equation predicts a linear relationship between charge and surface EP, which is numerically reproduced only if the small ions within the protein are taken into account. On the other hand, the partition coefficients of the small ions inside and outside the protein predicted by Donnan theory reproduce reasonably well the simulation results.},

To take full advantage of coarse-graining, the models have to be efficiently implemented in simulation engines that are easy to use, modify, and extend. Here, we introduce the Complexes++ simulation software to simulate a residue-level coarse-grained model for proteins and their complexes, applying a Markov chain Monte Carlo engine to sample configurations. We designed a parallelization scheme for the energy evaluation capable of simulating both dilute and dense systems efficiently. Additionally, we designed the software toolbox pycomplexes to easily set up complex topologies of multi-protein complexes and their solutions in different thermodynamic ensembles and in replica-exchange simulations, to grow flexible polypeptide structures connecting ordered protein domains, and to automatically visualize structural ensembles. Complexes++ simulations can easily be modified and they can be used for efficient explorations of different simulation systems and settings. Thus, the Complexes++ software is well suited for the integration of experimental data and for method development.},

In several cases, a few collective variables account for the bulk of the structural fluctuations within the first coordination shell and also display a clear connection with the fluctuations of particle mobility. Fine-grained descriptors that characterize the radial dependence of bond-orientational order better capture the structural fluctuations relevant for particle mobility but are also more difficult to parameterize and to interpret. We also find that principal component analysis of bond-orientational order parameters provides identical results to neural network autoencoders while having the advantage of being easily interpretable. Overall, our results indicate that glassy binary mixtures have a broad spectrum of structural features. In the temperature range we investigate, some mixtures display well-defined locally favored structures, which are reflected in bimodal distributions of the structural variables identified by dimensionality reduction.},

Lett. 116 , 125701 (2016) which is known to have a LLCP. The original WAC model is a model for silica (SiO 2 ) and consists of a mixture of non-bonded Si and O ions. By adding explicit intra-molecular Si–O bonds to the model, we are able to study how several parameters (Si–O bond length, O–Si–O angle, and bond stiffness) affect the existence and location of the LLCP. We find that for this model, only the Si–O bond length has a strong effect on the LLCP, while the bond angle and bond stiffness have no significant effect on the LLCP. An analysis of the relevant coordination numbers indicates that increasing the bond length decreases the ratio R Si/O of additional Si ions per additional O ion in the first coordination shell of the Si, which causes the LLCP to move to higher, more accessible temperatures. The behavior of the R Si/O parameter shows a strong correlation with the behavior of the LLCP and might be a useful tool to determine if a LLCP exists at low, hard-to-reach temperatures in other models.},

  abstract = {One may obviously think that the best way to control magnetic properties relies on using a magnetic field. However, it is not convenient to focus a magnetic field on a small object, whereas it is much easier to do so with an electric field. Magnetoelectric coupling allows one to control the magnetization with the electric field and the polarization with the magnetic field and could therefore provide a solution to this problem. This paper aims at quantifying the impact of the electric field on both the isotropic magnetic exchange and the Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction in the case of a binuclear system of S = 1/2 spins. This study follows previous studies that showed that very high Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction, i.e., the antisymmetric exchange, can be generated when close to first order spin orbit coupling. We will, therefore, explore this regime in a model Cu(II) complex that exhibits a quasi-degeneracy of the d x 2 − y 2 and d xy orbitals. This situation is indeed the one that allows us to obtain the largest spin orbit couplings in transition metal complexes. We will show that both the magnetic exchange and the Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction are very sensitive to the electric field and that it would therefore be possible to modulate and control magnetic properties by the electric field. Finally, rationalizations of the obtained results will be proposed.},

  abstract = {Studies of radiative transitions between ground and charge transfer excited terms of heteronuclear rare-gas (ArXe) + and (KrXe) + ions with small and moderate dissociation energies ( ⁠ D 0 ArXe + = 179 and D 0 KrXe + = 389 meV) are reported. Potential energy curves and dipole transition matrix elements are evaluated using ab initio calculations based on the CASSCF method followed by the NEVPT2 treatment and perturbative description of relativistic effects as implemented in the ORCA suite. We develop an efficient approach for the calculations of Boltzmann-averaged cross sections, rate constants, and absorption and emission coefficients associated with the integral contributions of bound–bound and bound–free transitions from a manifold of rovibrational states of the (RgXe) + ion. A similar approach is used for the description of the free–free and free–bound transitions between different electronic terms of a quasimolecular (RgXe) + ion temporarily formed during a collision of Ar or Kr atoms with Xe + ions. Our method is based on the quantal version of the theory of non-adiabatic transitions in molecular and quasimolecular systems combined with the approximation of a quasicontinuum for rovibrational energy levels. This allowed us to obtain a semianalytic expression for the integral absorption properties particularly relevant at elevated temperatures. We perform a comprehensive analysis of the identified radiative processes in local thermodynamic equilibrium plasmas of rare gas Rg/Xe mixtures containing both atomic, Xe + , and molecular, RgXe + , ions and determine their role in the formation of the absorption and emission spectra in a wide range of wavelengths and gas temperatures. The results obtained are in good agreement with the available experimental data.},

Experimental two-dimensional electron energy loss spectra (EELS) encode information about the vibrational states of the molecule as well as the position and structure of electronic resonances. The calculations using complex-valued extensions of equation-of-motion coupled-cluster theory (based on non-Hermitian quantum mechanics) facilitate the assignment of all major EELS features. We confirm the two previously described π resonances at about 2.5 and 3.5 eV (the calculations place these two states at 2.92 and 3.53 eV vertically and 2.63 and 3.27 eV adiabatically). The calculations also predict a low-lying resonance at 0.46 eV, which has a mixed character—of a dipole-bound state and σ * type. This resonance becomes stabilized at one quanta of the NH excitation, giving rise to the sharp feature at 0.9 eV in the corresponding EELS. Calculations of Franck–Condon factors explain the observed variations in the vibrational excitation patterns. The ability of theory to describe EELS provides a concrete illustration of the utility of non-Hermitian quantum chemistry, which extends such important concepts as potential energy surfaces and molecular orbitals to states embedded in the continuum.},

Using femtosecond time-resolved photoelectron imaging, we investigate the real-time evolution of the vibrational wavepacket of 2,5-difluoroaniline following the coherent excitation of an out-of-plane vibrational mode in the S 1 state at 289.8 nm. Probed by an accidental resonance with the Rydberg states, the periodic oscillations with the frequency of 99 cm −1 are observed from the photoelectron kinetic energy (PKE) distributions, corresponding to the energy difference between the out-of-plane mode X 1 0 of C–F bond and the band origin. Moreover, phase reversal of π rad between 0.66–0.75 and 1.00–1.08 eV is also observed in the PKE region. Combined with the scan of the potential energy surface in the ground cationic D 0 state, the observed two ionization channels corresponding to different phases are attributed to the periodic geometry changes between the planar and the non-planar structures when the coherent wavepacket evolves from the initial vertical Franck–Condon region toward the global minimum of the S 1 potential energy surface.},

  abstract = {Nitroaromatic compounds can photorelease nitric oxide after UV absorption. The efficiency of the photoreaction depends on the molecular structure, and two features have been pointed out as particularly important for the yield of the process: the presence of methyl groups at the ortho position with respect to the nitro group and the degree of conjugation of the molecule. In this paper, we provide a theoretical characterization at the CASPT2//CASSCF (complete active space second-order perturbation theory//complete active space self-consistent field) level of theory of the photorelease of NO for four molecules derived from nitrobenzene through the addition of ortho methyl groups and/or the elongation of the conjugation. Our previously described mechanism obtained for the photorelease of NO in nitrobenzene has been adopted as a model for the process. According to this model, the process proceeds through a reactive singlet–triplet crossing (STC) region that the system can reach from the triplet 3 (π O π*) minimum. The energy barrier that must be surmounted in order to populate the reactive STC can be associated with the efficiency of the photoreaction. Here, the obtained results display clear differences in the efficiency of the photoreaction in the studied systems and can be correlated with experimental results. Thus, the model proves its ability to highlight the differences in the photoreaction efficiency for the nitroaromatic compounds studied here.},

Chem. Phys. 147 , 114201 (2017)]. Here, we simulate the effect of such incoherent population mixing in the photocurrent signal collected from a GaAs solar cell by acting externally on the transimpedance amplifier circuit used for phase-sensitive detection, and we identify an effective strategy to recognize the presence of incoherent population mixing in 2D data. While we find that incoherent mixing is reflected by the crosstalk between the linear amplitudes at the two time-delay variables in the four-pulse excitation sequence, we do not observe any strict phase correlations between the coherent and incoherent contributions, as expected from modeling of a simple system.},

  abstract = {As one of the popular coherent Raman scattering techniques, stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) has made significant progress in recent years, especially in label-free biological imaging. Polarization provides an additional degree of freedom to manipulate the SRS process. In previous studies, only linearly polarized SRS was fully investigated, in which both pump and Stokes laser fields are linearly polarized. Here, we theoretically analyzed the SRS process excited by two circularly polarized laser fields and then experimentally demonstrated it by taking a spherical symmetric CH 4 molecule as a model system. The experimental results are in good agreement with the theoretical ones. It is shown that circularly polarized SRS (CP-SRS) has unique characteristics different from linear polarization. When the handedness of circular polarization states of two laser fields is the same, CP-SRS further suppresses the depolarized vibrational band while keeping the polarized band almost unaffected. On the other hand, when the handedness is opposite, CP-SRS enhances the depolarized band while suppressing the polarized band. Therefore, the CP-SRS not only allows us to resolve the symmetry of vibrational modes but also can enhance vibrational contrast based on symmetry selectivity by suppressing or enhancing the signal from a specific vibrational mode. These results will have potential applications in improving chemical selectivity and imaging contrast as well as spectral resolution SRS microscopy. In addition, the CP-SRS has the ability to determine the depolarization ratio ρ and identify the overlapping Raman bands.},

However, that work only provided explicit expressions for one- and two-body matrix elements between singly- or doubly-excited configurations. Here, this framework is extended to compute generalized nonorthogonal matrix elements between higher-order excitations. Pre-computing and storing intermediate values allows one- and two-body matrix elements to be evaluated with an O ( 1 ) scaling relative to the system size, and the LIBGNME computational library is introduced to achieve this in practice. These advances make the evaluation of all nonorthogonal matrix elements almost as easy as their orthogonal counterparts, facilitating a new phase of development in nonorthogonal electronic structure theory.},

The inputs of the neural network classifiers are the local bond orientational order parameters of Steinhardt, Nelson, and Ronchetti [Phys. Rev. B 28 , 784 (1983)], which are derived solely from the relative positions of atoms surrounding a central reference atom. This choice of input gives classifiers that are invariant to density, increasing their transferability. The neural networks are trained and validated on millions of data points generated from a large set of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of model alkali halides in nine bulk phases (liquid, rock salt, wurtzite, CsCl, 5-5, sphalerite, NiAs, AntiNiAs, and β -BeO) across a range of temperatures. One-dimensional time convolution is employed to filter out short-lived structural fluctuations. The trained neural networks perform extremely well, with accuracy up to 99.99\% on a balanced validation dataset constructed from millions of labeled bulk phase structures. A typical analysis using the neural networks, including neighbor list generation, order parameter calculation, and class inference, is computationally inexpensive compared to MD simulations. As a demonstration of their accuracy and utility, the neural network classifiers are employed to follow the nucleation and crystal growth of two model alkali halide systems, crystallizing into distinct structures from the melt. We further demonstrate the classifiers by implementing them in automated MD melting point calculations. Melting points for model alkali halides using the most commonly employed rigid-ion interaction potentials are reported and discussed.},

Based on the reference interaction site model self-consistent field with constrained spatial electron density distribution (RISM–SCF–cSED) method, the electronic structure of molecules in solution is obtained, and the expression for the nuclear magnetic shielding tensor is derived as the second-order derivative of the Helmholtz energy of the solution system. We implemented a method for calculating chemical shifts and applied it to an adenine molecule in water, where hydrogen bonding plays a crucial role in electronic and solvation structures. We also performed the calculations of 17 O chemical shifts, which showed remarkable solvent dependence. While converged results could not be sometimes obtained using the conventional method, in the present framework with RISM–SCF–cSED, an adequate representation of electron density is guaranteed, making it possible to obtain an NMR shielding constant stably. This introduction of cSED is key to extending the method’s applicability to obtain the chemical shift of various chemical species. The present demonstration illustrates our approach’s superiority in terms of numerical robustness and accuracy.},

  abstract = {Understanding electrostatic interactions among dielectric bodies in the atmosphere and aerosols is central to controlling their aggregation. Polarization effects, which are frequently ignored, are crucial to determine interactions when geometrical anisotropies are present due to surface-induced charge segregation. Here, we adopt a direct integral formulation that accounts for the problem of charged dielectric bodies immersed in a continuum media to explore particle aggregation via geometrical tuning. We show that by breaking the structural symmetry and modifying the close-contact surface between particles of equal charge, it is possible to obtain attractive regimes at short and long distances. We evaluate the electrostatic forces and energy of a set of dimers and trimers composed of spheres, oblates, and prolates in a vacuum, where no counter-ions are present, to construct a phase diagram with the conditions required to form stable aggregates as a function of the geometrical anisotropy. We found that it is possible to direct the aggregation (or dispersion) of two and three positive dielectric particles by adjusting their geometry and controlling the contact surface among them. Our results give insight into a way to control the aggregation of dielectric systems and offer a prospect for directing the assembly of complex particle structures.},

The two-electron reduced density matrix elements are determined so that they are suitably related to those of higher-order reduced density matrices and other associated matrices, up to a given order, constituting positive semidefinite matrices. These conditions up to two-, three-, and four-order have been sequentially imposed on the variational calculation of the expectation values of the dispersion operator corresponding to several Hamiltonian models, obtaining the electronic spectra.

  abstract = {Relativistic two-component density functional calculations are carried out in a non-collinear formalism to describe spin–orbit interactions, where the exchange–correlation functional is constructed as a generalization of the non-relativistic density functional approximation. Contrary to non-relativistic density functional theory (DFT), spin–orbit coupling, however, leads to a non-vanishing paramagnetic current density. Density functionals depending on the kinetic energy density, such as meta-generalized gradient approximations, should therefore be constructed in the framework of current DFT (CDFT). The latter has previously exclusively been used in the regime of strong magnetic fields. Herein, we present a consistent CDFT approach for relativistic DFT, including spin–orbit coupling. Furthermore, we assess the importance of the current density terms for ground-state energies, excitation energies, nuclear magnetic resonance shielding, and spin–spin coupling constants, as well as hyperfine coupling constants, Δg-shifts, and the nuclear quadrupole interaction tensor in electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. The most notable changes are found for EPR properties. The impact of the current-dependent terms rises with the number of unpaired electrons, and consequently, the EPR properties are more sensitive toward CDFT. Considerable changes are observed for the strongly constrained and appropriately normed functionals, as well as the B97M family and TASK. The current density terms are less important when exact exchange is incorporated. At the same time, the current-dependent kernel ensures the stability of response calculations in all cases. We, therefore, strongly recommend to use the framework of CDFT for self-consistent spin–orbit calculations.},

  abstract = {Frozen density embedding (FDE) is an embedding method for complex environments that is simple for users to set up. It reduces the computation time by dividing the total system into small subsystems and approximating the interaction by a functional of their densities. Its combination with wavefunction methods is, however, limited to small- or medium-sized molecules because of the steep scaling in computation time of these methods. To mitigate this limitation, we present a combination of the FDE approach with pair natural orbitals (PNOs) in the TURBOMOLE software package. It combines the uncoupled FDE (FDEu) approach for excitation energy calculations with efficient implementations of second-order correlation methods in the ricc2 and pnoccsd programs. The performance of this combination is tested for tetraazaperopyrene (TAPP) molecular crystals. It is shown that the PNO truncation error on environment-induced shifts is significantly smaller than the shifts themselves and, thus, that the local approximations of PNO-based wavefunction methods can without the loss of relevant digits be combined with the FDE method. Computational wall times are presented for two TAPP systems. The scaling of the wall times is compared to conventional supermolecular calculations and demonstrates large computational savings for the combination of FDE- and PNO-based methods. Additionally, the behavior of excitation energies with the system size is investigated. It is found that the excitation energies converge quickly with the size of the embedding environment for the TAPPs investigated in the current study.},

We found that TMAO counterbalanced the disruptive effect of pressure destabilization on account of an earlier reported electronic polarization effect that led to an increased TMAO dipole moment under compression of the solvent. This direct stabilization mechanism became ineffective when the dipole polarization of TMAO was not considered and was linked to nonspecific van der Waals interactions of TMAO with the nonpolar surfaces of the two helices, which became weaker as TMAO became stronger polarized at high pressure. The corresponding thermodynamic driving forces are discussed and should be generic for hydrophobic interactions under high pressure. The proposed mechanism suggests that TMAO stands out as a piezolyte among stabilizing osmolytes, potentially protecting biological assemblies formed by hydrophobic interactions under extreme pressure conditions.},

There have been continuous efforts to develop more effective approaches to CE model building, which are further promoted by recent tremendous interest of applying machine learning techniques in materials research. In this Perspective, we present a critical review of recent methodological developments in building CE models for multicomponent materials, with particular focus on different approaches and strategies proposed to address cluster selection and training data generation. We comment on the pros and cons of different methods in a general formalism and present some personal views on the prospects of theoretical approaches to multicomponent materials.},

  abstract = {A new method based on quasi-independent parallel simulation approach, replica-averaging, has been developed to study the influence of flow on mechanical force-mediated polymer processes, such as denaturation and breaking of bonds. This method considerably mitigates the unphysical prediction of force-mediated events inherent in Brownian dynamics (BD) polymer chain simulations that employ instantaneous force profile-based criteria to identify the occurrence of such events. This inaccuracy in predicting force-mediated event kinetics is due to high fluctuations of the instantaneous force profile around the average force. Replica-averaging reduces such high fluctuation effects by computing a force profile that faithfully represents the average force profile of the polymer chain conformation, which is then used to predict reactive events. For transient conformation conditions, the replica-averaged method more accurately predicts the mechano-reactive kinetics than the time-averaged method typically employed to reduce the unphysical prediction of force-mediated events in BD simulations. Furthermore, the influence of the proposed replica-averaging method parameters on the accuracy of predicting the true average force profile along the polymer is discussed.},

We have investigated two cases: (1) diffusion of a free active particle and (2) that of a harmonically trapped particle. In our earlier work, by Ghosh et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 152 , 174901 (2020)], we had shown that p ( t ) can be used to determine the translational and rotational diffusion constant of an asymmetrically shaped particle. The method has the advantage that the measurement of the rotational motion of the anisotropic particle is not required. In this paper, we extend the study to an active anisotropic particle and show how the persistence probability of an anisotropic particle is modified in the presence of a propulsion velocity. Furthermore, we validate our analytical expression against the measured persistence probability from the numerical simulations of single particle Langevin dynamics and test whether the method proposed in our earlier work can help distinguish between active and passive anisotropic particles.},

  abstract = {The conformational and dynamical properties of isolated flexible active polar linear polymers (APLPs) are studied analytically. The APLPs are modeled as Gaussian bead-spring linear chains augmented by tangential active forces, both in a discrete and continuous representation. The polar forces lead to linear non-Hermitian equations of motion, which are solved by an eigenfunction expansion in terms of a biorthogonal basis set. Our calculations show that the polymer conformations are independent of activity. However, tangential propulsion strongly impacts the polymer dynamics and yields an active ballistic regime as well as an activity-enhanced long-time diffusive regime, which are both absent in passive systems. The polar forces imply a coupling of modes in the eigenfunction representation, in particular with the translational mode, with a respective strong influence on the polymer dynamics. The total polymer mean-square displacement on scales smaller than the radius of gyration is determined by the active internal dynamics rather than the collective center-of-mass motion, in contrast to active Brownian polymers at large Péclet numbers, reflecting the distinct difference in the propulsion mechanism.},

We present optical beam deflection experiments on solutions of the polymer polystyrene of M w = 4880 g/mol in a mixed solvent of toluene and cyclohexane. In this system, the two diffusion eigenvalues differ by almost one order of magnitude. The large eigenvalue can be attributed to the interdiffusion of the two solvents and the small one to the polymer diffusion relative to the mixed solvent. The pre-selection of the eigenvectors renders the method stable against fluctuations of the experimental parameters. Both the diffusion and the Soret coefficients attributed to the two modes agree very well with the respective values of corresponding binary mixtures.},

As the size of the probe increased, the temperature dependence of the rotation correlation time (τ c ) shifted to longer times, and from this shift, the length scale associated with the glass transition (ξ α ) was estimated through the Debye–Stokes–Einstein (DSE) relationship and the length scale of the probe (ξ sDFT ) estimated from quantum mechanical calculations. The estimated ξ α values roughly matched with ξ het obtained from calorimetric analysis but were considerably smaller than those deduced from 4D NMR, boson peak, and four-point dynamic susceptibility measurements but with a similar trend of decrease in the length scale upon the increase in the stretching exponent (β) of the system. Because β of the glass formers represents the time distribution of the system, and τ c is related to the weighted average of the distribution, the length-scale distribution of the glass transition can be deduced by adopting the DSE relationship and assuming ξ α is the weighted average of this distribution at the glass transition temperature. In such a case, the upper bound of the length scale and trend matches the experimentally obtained ξ het from 4D NMR, boson peak, and four-point dynamic susceptibility measurements. Furthermore, at a given temperature, as the probe size increased, the β value reported by the probe increased, whereas the temperature dependence of β, which strongly correlates with the fragility of the system, was independent of the probe size.},

Nanogel suspensions provide model systems that are often studied to better understand the properties of soft materials and complex fluids from the formation of colloidal crystals to the flow of viruses, blood, or platelet cells in the body. Large spherical nanogels, when embedded in a matrix of smaller nanogels, have the unique ability to spontaneously deswell to match their size to that of the nanogel composing the matrix. In contrast to hard colloids, this self-healing mechanism allows for crystal formation without giving rise to point defects or dislocations. Here, we show that anisotropic ellipsoidal nanogels adapt both their size and their shape depending on the nature of the particles composing the matrix in which they are embedded. Using small-angle neutron scattering with contrast variation, we show that ellipsoidal nanogels become spherical when embedded in a matrix of spherical nanogels. In contrast, the anisotropy of the ellipsoid is enhanced when they are embedded in a matrix of anisotropic nanogels. Our experimental data are supported by Monte Carlo simulations that reproduce the trend of decreasing aspect ratio of ellipsoidal nanogels with increasing crowding by a matrix of spherical nanogels.},

Here, we introduce GAL21 which is the first pairwise additive force field that is specifically designed to modulate the near chemisorption energy of water as a function of the coordination numbers of the metallic atoms. We find a quadratic dependence to be most suitable for capturing the dependence of the adsorption energy of water on the generalized coordination number (GCN) of the metal atoms. GAL21 has been fitted against DFT adsorption energies for Cu, Ag, Au, Ni, Pd, Pt, and Co on 500 configurations and validated on about 3000 configurations for each metal, constructed on five surfaces with GCNs varying from 2.5 to 11.25. Depending on the metals, the root mean square deviation is found between 0.7 kcal mol −1 (Au) to 1.6 kcal mol −1 (Ni). Using GAL21, as implemented in the open-source code CP2K, we then evaluate the solvation energy of Au 55 and Pt 55 NPs in water using thermodynamic integration. The solvation free energy is found to be larger for Pt than for Au and systematically larger than 200 kcal mol −1 , demonstrating the large impact of solvent on the surface energetics of NPs. Still, given that the amorphous NPs are both, the most stable and the most solvated ones, we do not predict a change in the preferred morphology between the gas-phase and in water. Finally, based on a linear regression on three sizes of NPs (from 38 to 147), the solvation energy for Au and Pt surface atoms is found to be −5.2 and −9.9 kcal mol −1 , respectively.},

In a two-step sequential deposition, the PbI 2 film plays an important role in the formation of a perovskite film with desirable qualities. This paper explores using N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), a strong Lewis base, and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) as a mixed precursor solvent (DMF/NMP) of PbI 2 and reports on preparing PbI 2 films with a porous morphology by thermal treatment. Porous PbI 2 films ensure the diffusion and sufficient reaction of the formamidinium iodide solution to form a smooth perovskite film. In addition, a dynamic spin coating method is also introduced to improve the uniformity of the perovskite film. Both methods yield a pure α-phase FAPbI 3 film immediately in the unannealed state, which is necessary for the perovskite film to maintain phase stability. Finally, PSCs with a power conversion efficiency of 21.20\% (0.13 cm 2 ) are fabricated and optimized.

  abstract = {We observe, by computer simulations, a remarkable long-distance, rare, but repetitive, exchange of ethanol molecules between two parallel graphene surfaces in nanoconfined, aqueous, ethanol solutions. We compute the rate of exchange as a function of the separation (d) between the two surfaces. We discover that the initiating (or, the launching) step in this exchange is the attainment of an instantaneous orientation of the carbon–oxygen bond vector relative to the graphene surface. This observation led us to construct a two-dimensional free energy surface for this exchange, with respect to two order parameters, namely, (i) the perpendicular distance of ethanol molecule from the graphene surfaces, z, and (ii) the orientation of the O–C bond vector, θ , of the tagged ethanol molecule. For d = 3 nm, the rate of exchange is found to be 0.44 ns −1 for the force field used. We also vary the force field and determine the sensitivity of the rate. From the free energy landscape, one could determine the minimum energy pathway. We use both, the transition state theory and Kramers’ theory, to calculate the rate. The calculated rate agrees well with the simulated value as mentioned above. We find that the rate of exchange phenomenon is sensitive to the interaction strength of graphene and the hydrophobic group of ethanol. The free energy landscape exchange shows dependence on the distance separation of the two hydrophobic surfaces and reveals interesting features.},

  abstract = {Adding carbon nanoparticles into organic phase change materials (PCMs) such as paraffin is a common way to enhance their thermal conductivity and to improve the efficiency of heat storage devices. However, the sedimentation stability of such blends can be low due to aggregation of aromatic carbon nanoparticles in the aliphatic paraffin environment. In this paper, we explore whether this important issue can be resolved by the introduction of a polymer agent such as poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) into the paraffin–nanoparticle blends: P3HT could ensure the compatibility of aromatic carbon nanoparticles with aliphatic paraffin chains. We employed a combination of experimental and computational approaches to determine the impact of P3HT addition on the properties of organic PCMs composed of paraffin and carbon nanoparticles (asphaltenes). Our findings clearly show an increase in the sedimentation stability of paraffin–asphaltene blends, when P3HT is added, through a decrease in average size of asphaltene aggregates as well as in an increase of the blends’ viscosity. We also witness the appearance of the yield strength and gel-like behavior of the mixtures. At the same time, the presence of P3HT in the blends has almost no effect on their thermophysical properties. This implies that all properties of the blends, which are critical for heat storage applications, are well preserved. Thus, we demonstrated that adding polyalkylthiophenes to paraffin–asphaltene mixtures led to significant improvement in the performance characteristics of these systems. Therefore, the polymer additives can serve as promising compatibilizers for organic PCMs composed of paraffins and asphaltenes and other types of carbon nanoparticles.},

Results show that the polaron can be more stabilized in ML CeO 2 than in the bulk, while formation of oxygen vacancy (Vo 2+ ) and polaron–vacancy complexes [(Vo 2+ -1polaron) 1+ , (Vo 2+ -2polaron) 0 ] tends to be more difficult. The polaronic defect states sit deeper in energy within the bandgap of ML CeO 2 compared to the bulk case. We further demonstrate that the epitaxial strain in ceria film, as normally exists when grown on metal substrate, plays a crucial role in regulating the defect energetics and electronic structures. In particular, the formation energies of polarons, Vo 2+ , (Vo 2+ -1polaron) 1+ , and (Vo 2+ -2polaron) 0, generally decrease with tensile strain, leading to controllable defect concentration with strain and temperature. This study not only provides physical insights into the polaronic defects in ultrathin oxide films, but also sheds light on their potential technological applications in nanoelectronics, fuel cells, and catalysts.},

  abstract = {Molecules at a liquid/vapor interface have different organizations and mobilities from those in the bulk. These differences potentially influence the rate of crystal nucleation, but the effect remains imperfectly understood. We have measured the crystal nucleation rates at the surface and in the bulk of amorphous poscaconazole, a rod-like molecule known to have a preferred interfacial orientation. We find that surface nucleation is vastly enhanced over bulk nucleation, by ∼9 orders of magnitude, and selects a different polymorph (II) from bulk nucleation (I). This phenomenon mirrors the recently reported case of D-arabitol and stems from the similarity of anisotropic surface molecular packing to the structure of the surface-nucleating polymorph. In contrast to these two systems, the surface enhancement of nucleation is weaker (though still significant) in acetaminophen and in water and does not select a different polymorph. Together, the systems investigated to date all feature surface enhancement, not suppression, of crystal nucleation, and those showing a polymorphic change feature (1) structural reconstruction at the surface relative to the bulk and (2) existence of a different polymorph that can take advantage of the surface environment to nucleate. These results help predict the effect of a liquid/vapor interface on crystal nucleation and polymorph selection, especially in systems with a large surface/volume ratio, such as atmospheric water and amorphous particles.},

High quality experimental x-ray scattering data are in poor agreement with the data from the molecular dynamics simulations, demonstrating the need for improved interatomic potentials.

After excitation of the molecule into the Franck–Condon region of the first excited state, S 1 , the molecule hops to the ground (S 0 ) state quickly. The dissociation of one of the C–N bonds initially starts in the first excited state. Then, the molecule comes to the ground state (S 0 ) via S 1 /S 0 conical intersections, followed by complete dissociation in the ground state. Two different conical intersections are identified between the first excited singlet (S 1 ) and the ground (S 0 ) electronic states. One primary and three secondary dissociation channels are observed from our dynamics calculations of photodissociation of 1-pyrazoline that are in accord with the experimentally observed channels. After internal conversion to the ground electronic state (S 0 ), the molecule dissociates to N 2 and trimethylene biradical as the primary dissociation products. The trimethylene biradical then rearranges, leading to three secondary dissociation channels, N 2 + cyclopropane, N 2 + CH 2 + C 2 H 4 , and N 2 + CH 3 CHCH 2 . The major products formed from the trimethylene biradical in the secondary process is cyclopropane contributing about 78\% of the overall products formation along with ∼12\% propene and the rest ∼10\% methylene (CH 2 ) with ethene (C 2 H 4 ).},

We present qualitative arguments and numerical evidence that when mapping spins to fermions, the transformation makes strong correlation weaker, as demonstrated by the Hartree–Fock approximation to the transformed Hamiltonian. This result can be rationalized in terms of rank reduction of spin shift terms when transformed to fermions. Conversely, the mapping of fermions to qubits makes strong correlation stronger, complicating its solution when one uses qubit-based correlators. The presence of string operators poses challenges to the implementation of quantum chemistry methods on classical computers, but these can be dealt with using established techniques of low computational cost. Our proof of principle results for XXZ and J 1 -J 2 Heisenberg (in 1D and 2D) indicates that the JW transformed fermionic Hamiltonian has reduced complexity in key regions of their phase diagrams and provides a better starting point for addressing challenging spin problems.},

These locally well-defined diabatic states allow using any diabatic quantum dynamics methods for dynamics propagation, and the definition of these states will be updated at every nuclear time step. We use several recently developed non-adiabatic mapping approaches as the diabatic dynamics methods to simulate polariton quantum dynamics in a Shin–Metiu model coupled to an optical cavity. The results obtained from the mapping approaches provide very accurate population dynamics compared to the numerically exact method and outperform the widely used mixed quantum-classical approaches, such as the Ehrenfest dynamics and the fewest switches surface hopping approach. We envision that the generalized QD scheme developed in this work will provide a powerful tool to perform the non-adiabatic polariton simulations by allowing a direct interface between the diabatic dynamics methods and ab initio polariton information.},

The positive answers have been obtained only for isothermal systems or systems with small temperature differences. We formulate thermodynamics of the stationary states of the ideal gas subjected to heat flow in the form of the zeroth, first, and second law. Surprisingly, the formal structure of steady state thermodynamics is the same as in equilibrium thermodynamics. We rigorously show that U satisfies the following equation dU = T * dS * − pdV for a constant number of particles, irrespective of the shape of the container, boundary conditions, the size of the system, or the mode of heat transfer into the system. We calculate S * and T * explicitly. The theory selects stable nonequilibrium steady states in a multistable system of ideal gas subjected to volumetric heating. It reduces to equilibrium thermodynamics when heat flux goes to zero.},

This type of dynamics occurs when a microscopic system with an explicitly time-dependent Liouvillian is coarse-grained by means of a projection operator formalism. We show how to replace the deterministic fluctuating force in the generalized Langevin equation by a stochastic process, such that the distributions of the observables are reproduced up to moments of a given order. Thus, in combination with a method to extract the memory kernel from simulation data of the underlying microscopic model, the method introduced here allows us to construct and simulate a coarse-grained model for a driven process.},

  abstract = {Physical kinetic roughening processes are well-known to exhibit universal scaling of observables that fluctuate in space and time. Are there analogous dynamic scaling laws that are unique to the chemical reaction mechanisms available synthetically and occurring naturally? Here, we formulate an approach to the dynamic scaling of stochastic fluctuations in thermodynamic observables at and away from equilibrium. Both analytical expressions and numerical simulations confirm our dynamic scaling ansatz with associated scaling exponents, function, and law. A survey of common chemical mechanisms reveals classes that organize according to the molecularity of the reactions involved, the nature of the reaction vessel and external reservoirs, (non)equilibrium conditions, and the extent of autocatalysis in the reaction network. Varying experimental parameters, such as temperature, can cause coupled reactions capable of chemical feedback to transition between these classes. While path observables, such as the dynamical activity, have scaling exponents that are time-independent, the variance in the entropy production and flow can have time-dependent scaling exponents and self-averaging properties as a result of temporal correlations that emerge during thermodynamically irreversible processes. Altogether, these results establish dynamic universality classes in the nonequilibrium fluctuations of thermodynamic observables for well-mixed chemical reactions.},

Between consecutive jumps, the wave function is propagated in a coordinate space using the multi-configuration time-dependent Hartree method. We compare this hybrid propagation methodology with exact Liouville space solutions for physical systems of interest in cavity quantum electrodynamics, demonstrating accurate results for experimentally relevant observables using a tractable number of quantum trajectories.

  abstract = {We present the computational methodology that allows rigorous and efficient nine-dimensional (9D) quantum calculations of the intermolecular vibrational states of noncovalently bound trimers of diatomic molecules, with the monomers treated as rigid. The full 9D vibrational Hamiltonian of the trimer is partitioned into a 3D “frame” (or stretching) Hamiltonian and a 6D “bend” Hamiltonian. These two Hamiltonians are diagonalized separately, and a certain number of their lowest-energy eigenstates is included in the final 9D product contracted basis in which the full 9D intermolecular vibrational Hamiltonian is diagonalized. This methodology is applied to the 9D calculations of the intermolecular vibrational levels of (HF) 3 , a prototypical hydrogen-bonded trimer, on the rigid-monomer version of an ab initio calculated potential energy surface (PES). They are the first to include fully the stretch-bend coupling present in the trimer. The frequencies of all bending fundamentals considered from the present 9D calculations are about 10\% lower than those from the earlier quantum 6D calculations that considered only the bending modes of the HF trimer. This means that the stretch-bend coupling is strong, and it is imperative to include it in any accurate treatment of the (HF) 3 vibrations aiming to assess the accuracy of the PES employed. Moreover, the 9D results are in better agreement with the limited available spectroscopic data that those from the 6D calculations. In addition, the 9D results show sensitivity to the value of the HF bond length, equilibrium or vibrationally averaged, used in the calculations. The implication is that full-dimensional 12D quantum calculations will be required to obtain definitive vibrational excitation energies for a given PES. Our study also demonstrates that the nonadditive three-body interactions are very significant in (HF) 3 and have to be included in order to obtain accurate intermolecular vibrational energy levels of the trimer.},

More specifically, we investigate the evolution of the two lowest excited states of 4-(dimethylamino)benzonitrile (DMABN) upon the twisting of the amino group, a paradigmatic system for dual fluorescence and excited-state benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that the BSE/ GW approach is able to reproduce the correct topology of excited state PES upon geometry changes in both gas and condensed phases. The vertical transition energies predicted by BSE/ GW are indeed in good agreement with coupled cluster values, including triples. The BSE approach ability to include both linear response and state-specific solvent corrections further enables it to accurately describe the solvatochromism of both excited states during the twisting of DMABN. This contribution stands as one of the first proof-of-concept that BSE/ GW PES should be accurate in cases for which TD-DFT struggles, including the central case of systems embedded in a dielectric environment.},

In this work, we assess the von Neumann entropy of the one-particle reduced density matrix (1-RDM) to compare selected configuration interaction (CI), coupled cluster, variational Monte Carlo, and fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo for benchmark hydrogen chains. A new algorithm, the circle reject method, is presented, which improves the efficiency of evaluating the von Neumann entropy using quantum Monte Carlo by several orders of magnitude. The von Neumann entropy of the 1-RDM and the eigenvalues of the 1-RDM are shown to distinguish between the dynamic correlation introduced by the Jastrow and the static correlation introduced by determinants with large weights, confirming some of the lore in the field concerning the difference between the selected CI and Slater–Jastrow wave functions.},

However, in practice, the extremely scarce spontaneous occurrence of large nuclei impedes the full determination of p a , and a numerical bias must be introduced, which is generally done on the size of the largest nucleus in the system, leading to the probability size distribution of the largest nucleus p l .

By comparing different samples, we find that the leak rate of any gas in a particular sample is well predicted by the leak rate of N 2 in that sample. In addition, we observe enhanced leak rates of water-soluble molecules. We infer that the leakage path (i.e., the graphene/graphite–SiO 2 interface) favors hydrophilic species.},

All calculations involving a classical potential were calculated with the AMOEBABIO18 polarizable force field, while electronic structure calculations were performed within the framework of density functional theory. Selected docking poses for each of the five compounds were used for MD simulations, which suggest only one of the tested leads remains bound in a catalytically active orientation. The QM/MM results for the covalent attachment of the promising lead to the catalytic serine suggest that this process is thermodynamically feasible but kinetically unlikely. Overall, our results are consistent with the low labeling percentages determined experimentally and may be useful for further development of acrylamide-based leads.},

The assumed free-energy functional is a key component of DDFT that dictates the thermodynamics of the model and, in turn, the density flux due to a concentration gradient. In this work, we compare several commonly used free-energy functionals for drying hard-sphere suspensions, including local-density approximations based on the ideal-gas, virial, and Boublík–Mansoori–Carnahan–Starling–Leland (BMCSL) equations of state as well as a weighted-density approximation based on fundamental measure theory (FMT). To determine the accuracy of each functional, we model one- and two-component hard-sphere suspensions in a drying film with varied initial heights and compositions, and we compare the DDFT-predicted volume fraction profiles to particle-based Brownian dynamics (BD) simulations. FMT accurately predicts the structure of the one-component suspensions even at high concentrations and when significant density gradients develop, but the virial and BMCSL equations of state provide reasonable approximations for smaller concentrations at a reduced computational cost. In the two-component suspensions, FMT and BMCSL are similar to each other but modestly overpredict the extent of stratification by size compared to BD simulations. This work provides helpful guidance for selecting thermodynamic models for soft materials in nonequilibrium processes, such as solvent drying, solvent freezing, and sedimentation.},

To overcome such limitations, coarse-grained (CG) models have been developed to reduce the dimensionality of the physical system under study. However, to study such systems at the atomic level, it is necessary to re-introduce the atomistic details into the CG description. Such an ill-posed mathematical problem is typically treated via numerical algorithms, which need to balance accuracy, efficiency, and general applicability. Here, we introduce an efficient and versatile method for backmapping multi-component CG macromolecules of arbitrary microstructures. By utilizing deep learning algorithms, we train a convolutional neural network to learn structural correlations between polymer configurations at the atomistic and their corresponding CG descriptions, obtained from atomistic simulations. The trained model is then utilized to get predictions of atomistic structures from input CG configurations. As an illustrative example, we apply the convolutional neural network to polybutadiene copolymers of various microstructures, in which each monomer microstructure (i.e., cis -1,4, trans -1,4, and vinyl -1,2) is represented as a different CG particle type. The proposed methodology is transferable over molecular weight and various microstructures. Moreover, starting from a specific single CG configuration with a given microstructure, we show that by modifying its chemistry (i.e., CG particle types), we are able to obtain a set of well equilibrated polymer configurations of different microstructures (chemistry) than the one of the original CG configuration.},

Here, we use a coarse-grained model to explore the dynamics of linked networks of patchy colloids whose average valence is macroscopically, rather than microscopically, constrained. Simulation results for the model show dynamic hallmarks of equilibrium gel formation and establish that the colloid–colloid bond persistence time controls the characteristic slow relaxation of the self-intermediate scattering function. The model features re-entrant network formation without phase separation as a function of linker concentration, centered at the stoichiometric ratio of linker ends to nanoparticle surface bonding sites. Departures from stoichiometry result in linker-starved or linker-saturated networks with reduced connectivity and shorter characteristic relaxation times with lower activation energies. Underlying the re-entrant trends, dynamic properties vary monotonically with the number of effective network bonds per colloid, a quantity that can be predicted using Wertheim’s thermodynamic perturbation theory. These behaviors suggest macroscopic in situ strategies for tuning the dynamic response of colloidal networks.},

  abstract = {The gelation of PEGylated gold nanoparticles dispersed in a glycerol–water mixture is probed in situ by x-ray photon correlation spectroscopy. Following the evolution of structure and dynamics over 10 4 s, a three-step gelation process is found. First, a simultaneous increase of the Ornstein–Zernike length ξ and slowdown of dynamics is characterized by an anomalous q -dependence of the relaxation times of τ ∝ q −6 and strongly stretched intermediate scattering functions. After the structure of the gel network has been established, evidenced by a constant ξ , the dynamics show aging during the second gelation step accompanied by a change toward ballistic dynamics with τ ∝ q −1 and compressed correlation functions. In the third step, aging continues after the arrest of particle motion. Our observations further suggest that gelation is characterized by stress release as evidenced by anisotropic dynamics once gelation sets in.},

Modeling and simulations methods, such as density functional theory or molecular dynamics, provide key information on the structural and dynamic properties of the systems. Of particular importance are polarization effects of the electrode/electrolyte interface, which are difficult to simulate accurately. Here, we show how these electrostatic interactions are taken into account in the framework of the Ewald summation method. We discuss, in particular, the formal setup for calculations that enforce periodic boundary conditions in two directions, a geometry that more closely reflects the characteristics of typical electrolyte/electrode systems and presents some differences with respect to the more common case of periodic boundary conditions in three dimensions. These formal developments are implemented and tested in MetalWalls, a molecular dynamics software that captures the polarization of the electrolyte and allows the simulation of electrodes maintained at a constant potential. We also discuss the technical aspects involved in the calculation of two sets of coupled degrees of freedom, namely the induced dipoles and the electrode charges. We validate the implementation, first on simple systems, then on the well-known interface between graphite electrodes and a room-temperature ionic liquid. We finally illustrate the capabilities of MetalWalls by studying the adsorption of a complex functionalized electrolyte on a graphite electrode.},

  abstract = {Line tension in wetting processes is of high scientific and technological relevance, but its understanding remains vague, mainly because it is difficult to determine. A widely used method to extract line tension relies on the variation of a droplet’s contact angle with the droplet’s size. Such an approach yields the apparent line tension, which is an effective parameter that factors in numerous contributions to the finite-size dependence, thus masking the actual line tension in terms of the excess free energy of the three-phase contact line. Based on our recent computer simulation study, we investigate how small amounts of nonionic surfactants, such as surface-active impurities, contribute to the apparent line tension in aqueous droplets. When depositing polydisperse droplets, their different surface area-to-volume ratios can result in different final bulk concentrations of surfactants, different excess adsorptions to the interfaces, and, consequently, different contact angles. We show that already trace amounts of longer-chained surfactants in a pre-contaminated liquid are enough to affect measurements of the apparent line tension. Our analysis quantifies to what extent “background” impurities, inevitably present in all kinds of experimental settings, limit the resolution of line tension measurements, which is crucial for avoiding data misinterpretation.},

We consider cosolutes with weak interfacial preferences in order to focus on the impact of cross-interactions between the two cosolute species. When the cross-interaction is properly balanced, the two cosolutes make independent, additive contributions to both bulk and interfacial properties. Conversely, repulsive cross-interactions slightly enhance the interfacial preference of both solutes. In contrast, attractive cross-interactions reduce interfacial preferences and can convert weak surfactants into weak depletants. We observe a particularly interesting transition in the symmetric case of two equivalent self-repelling cosolutes with attractive cross-interactions. In this regime, the major cosolute acts as a weak surfactant in order to avoid repulsive self-interactions, while the minor cosolute acts as a weak depletant in order to form attractive cross-interactions. The two equivalent cosolutes switch roles depending upon their relative concentration. DST very accurately describes the surface tension and surface excess of simulated lattice solutions up to molar concentrations. More importantly, DST provides quantitative and qualitative insight into the mechanism by which cosolute interactions modulate interfacial preferences.},

  abstract = {In this work, we extend a previously developed Raman bond model to periodic slab systems for interpreting chemical enhancements of surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). The Raman bond model interprets chemical enhancements as interatomic charge flow modulations termed Raman bonds. Here, we show that the Raman bond model offers a unified interpretation of chemical enhancements for localized and periodic systems. As a demonstration of the Raman bond model, we study model systems consisting of CO and pyridine molecules on Ag clusters and slabs. We find that for both localized and periodic systems, the dominant Raman bonds are distributed near the molecule–metal interface and, therefore, the chemical enhancements are determined by a common Raman bond pattern. The effects of surface coverage, thickness, and roughness on the chemical enhancements have been studied, which shows that decreasing surface coverage or creating surface roughness increases chemical enhancements. In both of these cases, the inter-fragment charge flow connectivity is improved due to more dynamic polarization at the interface. The chemical enhancement is shown to scale with the inter-fragment charge flow to the fourth power. Since the inter-fragment charge flow is determined by the charge transfer excitation energy, the Raman bond model is connected to the transition-based analysis of chemical enhancements. We also show that the SERS spectra of localized and periodic systems normalized by inter-fragment charge flows can be unified. In summary, the Raman bond model offers a unique framework for understanding SERS spectra in terms of Raman bond distributions and offers a connection between localized and periodic model systems of SERS studies.},

Herein, we investigate fingerprints of the coupling between these processes in electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. EDL charging and IT are described uniformly using the Poisson–Nernst–Planck theory, and interfacial ET is described using the Frumkin–Butler–Volmer theory. Different diffusion coefficients for cations and anions ( D + ≠ D − ) are considered. Exact analytical expressions are obtained when the potential of zero charge ( E pzc ), the equilibrium potential of the reaction ( E eq ), and electrode potential ( E M ) are equal. The analytical solution shows that a decoupling treatment is valid only for the case of D + = D − . Using a new scheme of calculating impedance response at any electrode potential, we observe an inductive loop in the low frequency range, which is a clear impedance fingerprint of the coupling effects.},

  abstract = {Atomically thin MoS 2 has emerged to be promising for photocatalytic water splitting benefiting from its suitable geometrical and electronic structure for light harvesting. A better understanding of how water molecules affect the band edge levels of MoS 2 is critical for promoting the interfacial reactivity. Here, we determine the structures of water monolayers on MoS 2 using global optimizations achieved by molecular dynamics in combination with local minimization. It is shown that cyclic water clusters are formed on a surface through a hydrogen-bonding network. The absolute band edge positions are explored taking into account the derivative discontinuity of the exchange–correlation functional. Shifts in band edges are observed with the increase in H 2 O coverage, while bandgaps tend to be slightly decreased. In particular, the band alignment relative to water redox potentials has been investigated in detail. We find that the dimer configuration is likely to suppress the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), while the polygon clusters lift the conduction band by 0.2–0.7 eV, and thus, they would enhance HER. This effect is explained in terms of the linear dependence of the band edge offset on an interface electric dipole arising from water assemblies.},

Measurements are made in the temperature range from 5 to 373 K. Methane mobility under these conditions is found to be extremely high in fresh ZSM-5, with the majority of movements occurring too fast to be resolved by the QENS instrument used. A small fraction of molecules undergoing jump diffusion on QENS time scales is identified and found to correspond with short-range jump diffusion within single zeolite pores as identified in MD simulations. Agreement between QENS and MD mobility measurements is found to be within 50\%, validating the simulation approach employed. Methane diffusion is found to be minimally affected by moderate levels of coke buildup, while highly coked samples result in the confinement of methane to single pores within the zeolite with minimal long-range diffusion.},

Here, we use femtosecond transient absorption to reveal photoinduced charge transfer and interlayer exciton formation in a mixed-dimensional type-II heterojunction between monolayer MoS 2 and vanadyl phthalocyanine (VOPc). Selective excitation of the MoS 2 exciton leads to hole transfer from the MoS 2 valence band to VOPc highest occupied molecular orbit in ∼710 fs. On the contrary, selective photoexcitation of the VOPc layer leads to instantaneous electron transfer from its excited state to the conduction band of MoS 2 in less than 100 fs. This light-initiated ultrafast separation of electrons and holes across the heterojunction interface leads to the formation of an interlayer exciton. These interlayer excitons formed across the interface lead to longer-lived charge-separated states of up to 2.5 ns, longer than in each individual layer of this heterojunction. Thus, the longer charge-separated state along with ultrafast charge transfer times provide promising results for photovoltaic and optoelectronic device applications.},

Here, simulations of single molecules experiencing homogeneous diffusion and static and dynamic heterogeneous diffusion are performed to clarify the contributions of heterogeneity to such enhanced translational diffusion. Results show that time-limited trajectories broaden the distribution of diffusion coefficients in the presence of homogeneous diffusion but not when physically reasonable degrees of static heterogeneity are present. When dynamic heterogeneity is introduced, measured diffusion coefficients uniformly increase relative to input diffusion coefficients, and the widths of output distributions decrease, providing support for the idea that dynamic heterogeneity can drive apparent translational enhancement. Among simulations with dynamic heterogeneity, when the frequency of dynamic exchange is correlated with the initial diffusion coefficient, the measured diffusion coefficient behavior as a function of observation time matches that seen experimentally, the only set of simulations explored in which this occurs. Taken together with experimental results, this suggests that enhanced translational diffusion in glassy systems occurs through dynamic exchange consistent with wide underlying distributions of diffusion coefficients and exchange coupled to local spatiotemporal dynamics.},

Achieving this goal with standard molecular dynamics (MD) simulation methods is challenging due to large length scales. An alternative approach to this problem can be formulated using classical density functional theory (cDFT), where a full configurational description of the positions of all the atoms is replaced by collective atomic site densities in the molecule. Using an example of the negatively charged silica-like system in an aqueous polar environment represented by a two-site water model, we demonstrate that cDFT can reproduce MD data at a fraction of the computational cost. An important implication of this result is the ability to understand how the solvent molecular features may affect the system’s properties at the macroscopic scale.

Recent studies have illustrated that secondary (β) relaxation is closely correlated with several properties in a range of glassy materials. However, it has been challenging to identify the pertinent structural features that govern it. In this work, we show that the so-called polyamorphous transition in metallic glasses offers an opportunity to distinguish the structural length scale of β relaxation. We find that, while the glass transition temperature and medium-range orders (MROs) change rapidly across the polyamorphous transition, the intensity of β relaxation and the short-range orders (SROs) evolve in a way similar to those in an ordinary reference glass without polyamorphous transition. Our findings suggest that the MRO accounts mainly for the global stiffening of the materials and the glass transition, while the SRO contributes more to β relaxation per se .},

  abstract = {Liquid water is well-known for its intriguing thermodynamic anomalies in the supercooled state. The phenomenological two-state models—based on the assumption of the existence of two types of competing local states (or, structures) in liquid water—have been extremely successful in describing water’s thermodynamic anomalies. However, the precise structural features of these competing local states in liquid water still remain elusive. Here, we have employed a predefined structural order parameter-free approach to unambiguously identify two types of competing local states—entropically and energetically favored—with significantly different structural and energetic features in the TIP4P/2005 liquid water. This identification is based on the heterogeneous structural relaxation of the system in the potential energy landscape (PEL) during the steepest-descent energy minimization. This heterogeneous relaxation is characterized using order parameters inspired by the spin-glass transition in frustrated magnetic systems. We have further established a direct relationship between the population fluctuation of the two states and the anomalous behavior of the heat capacity in supercooled water. The composition-dependent spatial distribution of the entropically favored local states shows an interesting crossover from a spanning network-like single cluster to the spatially delocalized clusters in the close vicinity of the Widom line. Additionally, this study establishes a direct relationship between the topographic features of the PEL and the water’s thermodynamic anomalies in the supercooled state and provides alternate markers (in addition to the locus of maxima of thermodynamic response functions) for the Widom line in the phase plane.},

  abstract = {We employ all-atom well-tempered metadynamics simulations to study the mechanistic details of both the early stages of nucleation and crystal decomposition for the benchmark metal–organic framework (MOF) ZIF-8. To do so, we developed and validated a force field that reliably models the modes of coordination bonds via a Morse potential functional form and employs cationic and anionic dummy atoms to capture coordination symmetry. We also explored a set of physically relevant collective variables and carefully selected an appropriate subset for our problem at hand. After a rapid increase of the Zn–N connectivity, we observe the evaporation of small clusters in favor of a few large clusters, which leads to the formation of an amorphous highly connected aggregate. Zn ( MIm ) 4 2 − and Zn ( MIm ) 3 − complexes are observed with lifetimes in the order of a few picoseconds, while larger structures, such as four-, five-, and six-membered rings, have substantially longer lifetimes of a few nanoseconds. The free ligands act as “templating agents” for the formation of sodalite cages. ZIF-8 crystal decomposition results in the formation of a vitreous phase. Our findings contribute to a fundamental understanding of MOF’s synthesis that paves the way to controlling synthesis products. Furthermore, our developed force field and methodology can be applied to model solution processes that require coordination bond reactivity for other ZIFs besides ZIF-8.},

SiP was synthesized in an AC discharge from the reaction of SiH 4 and gas-phase phosphorus, in argon carrier gas. Both spin–orbit ladders were observed. Fifteen rotational transitions were measured originating in the Ω = 3/2 ladder, and twelve in the Ω = 1/2 substate, each exhibiting lambda doubling and, at lower frequencies, hyperfine interactions from the phosphorus nuclear spin of I = 1/2. The lambda-doublets in the Ω = 1/2 levels appeared to be perturbed at higher J , with the f component deviating from the predicted pattern, likely due to interactions with the nearby excited A 2 Σ + electronic state, where ΔE Π-Σ ∼ 430 cm −1 . The data were analyzed using a Hund’s case a β Hamiltonian and rotational, spin–orbit, lambda-doubling, and hyperfine parameters were determined. A 2 Π/ 2 Σ deperturbation analysis was also performed, considering spin–orbit, spin-electronic, and L -uncoupling interactions. Although SiP is clearly not a hydride, the deperturbed parameters derived suggest that the pure precession hypothesis may be useful in assessing the 2 Π/ 2 Σ interaction. Interpretation of the Fermi contact term, b F , the spin-dipolar constant, c , and the nuclear spin-orbital parameter, a , indicates that the orbital of the unpaired electron is chiefly p π in character. The bond length in the v = 0 level was found to be r 0 = 2.076 Å, suggestive of a double bond between the silicon and phosphorus atoms.},

Energy decomposition analysis with the natural orbitals for chemical valence method on the bonding nature between the encapsulated metal dimer and the fullerene cage suggested the existence of two covalent bonds between the metal dimer and fullerenes, giving rise to a covalent bonding nature between the metal dimer and fullerene cage and a formal charge model of [Lu 2 ] 2+ @[C 2n ] 2− .

In the excitation spectra of jet-cooled mTI and pPDI, cis - and trans -rotational isomers appeared as doublets. Isomers were assigned by analyzing the methyl-group internal rotation for mTI and by applying low-frequency bending vibrations to the mutual exclusion rule between the one- and two-photon spectra for pPDI. The electronic spectra of the three molecules observed in the jet were assigned to the transition to the first ππ* and third singlet excited states with the aid of time-dependent (TD)-B3LYP/aug-cc-pVDZ and TD-CAM-B3LYP/aug-cc-pVDZ calculations. The 0 − 0 band of PI was observed at 36 354 cm −1 , those of the cis and trans isomers of mTI at 36 018 and 35 853 cm −1 , respectively, and those of the cis and trans isomers of pPDI at 34 437 and 34 383 cm −1 , respectively. All vibronic bands were diffuse, probably because of internal conversion to two singlet nπ* states. For mTI, based on changes in the barrier height of methyl-group internal rotation upon excitation, the Hammett-σ m of PI was determined to be −0.12.},

The advantages of the parallel-transported basis include the facility with which Taylor series expansions can be carried out in the neighborhood of a point or a manifold such as a seam (the locus of degeneracies of the electronic Hamiltonian), and the close relationship between the derivative couplings and the curvature in this basis. These are important for analytic treatments of the nuclear Schrödinger equation in the neighborhood of degeneracies. The parallel-transported basis bears a close relationship to the singular-value basis; in this article, both are expanded in power series about a reference point and are shown to agree through second order but not beyond. Taylor series expansions are effected through the projection operator, whose expansion does not involve energy denominators or any type of singularity and in terms of which both the singular-value basis and the parallel-transported basis can be expressed. The parallel-transported basis is a version of Poincaré gauge, well known in electromagnetism, which provides a relationship between the derivative couplings and the curvature and which, along with a formula due to Mead, affords an efficient method for calculating Taylor series of the basis states and the derivative couplings. The case in which fine structure effects are included in the electronic Hamiltonian is covered.},

  abstract = {This article presents a new reactive potential in the ReaxFF formalism. It aims to include the chlorine element and opens up the fields of use of ReaxFF to the whole class of organochloride compounds including conjugated or aromatic groups. Numerous compounds in this family raise global awareness due to their environmental impact, and such a reactive potential will help investigate their degradation pathways. The new force field, named CHONCl-2022_weak, belongs to the aqueous branch. The force field parameters were fitted against high-level quantum chemistry calculations, including complete active space self-consistent field/NEVPT2 calculations and density functional theory calculations, and their accuracy was evaluated using a validation set. The root means square deviation against quantum mechanics energies is 0.38 eV (8.91 kcal mol −1 ). From a structural point of view, the root means square deviation is about 0.06 Å for the bond lengths, 11.86° for the angles, and 4.12° for the dihedral angles. With CHONCl-2022_weak new force field, we successfully investigated the regioselectivity for nucleophilic or electrophilic attacks on polychlorinated biphenyls, which are toxic and permanent pollutants. The rotation barriers along the bond linking the two benzene rings, which is crucial in the toxicity of these compounds, are well reproduced by CHONCl-2022_weak. Then, our new reactive potential is used to investigate the chlorobenzene reactivity in the presence of hydroxyl radicals in atmospheric condition or in aqueous solution. The reaction pathways computed with ReaxFF agree with the quantum mechanics results. We showed that, in the presence of dioxygen molecules, in atmospheric condition, the oxidation of chlorobenzene likely leads to the formation of highly oxygenated compounds after the abstraction of hydrogen radicals. In water, the addition of a hydroxyl radical leads to the formation of chlorophenol or phenol molecules, as already predicted from plasma-induced degradation experiments.},

  abstract = {The formation of subcritical methanol clusters in the vapor phase is known to complicate the analysis of nucleation measurements. Here, we investigate how this process affects the onset of binary nucleation as dilute water–methanol mixtures in nitrogen carrier gas expand in a supersonic nozzle. These are the first reported data for water–methanol nucleation in an expansion device. We start by extending an older monomer–dimer–tetramer equilibrium model to include larger clusters, relying on Helmholtz free energy differences derived from Monte Carlo simulations. The model is validated against the pressure/temperature measurements of Laksmono et al. [Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 13 , 5855 (2011)] for dilute methanol–nitrogen mixtures expanding in a supersonic flow prior to the appearance of liquid droplets. These data are well fit when the maximum cluster size i max is 6–12. The extended equilibrium model is then used to analyze the current data. On the addition of small amounts of water, heat release prior to particle formation is essentially unchanged from that for pure methanol, but liquid formation proceeds at much higher temperatures. Once water comprises more than ∼24 mol\% of the condensable vapor, droplet formation begins at temperatures too high for heat release from subcritical cluster formation to perturb the flow. Comparing the experimental results to binary nucleation theory is challenged by the need to extrapolate data to the subcooled region and by the inapplicability of explicit cluster models that require a minimum of 12 molecules in the critical cluster.},

These condensed phase 2DIR spectrometers can provide very high temporal resolution (&lt;1 ps), but the spectral resolution is generally insufficient for resolving rotational peaks in gas phase spectra. Conventional (1D) rovibrational spectra of gas phase molecules are often plagued by severe spectral congestion, even when the sample is not a mixture. Spectral congestion can obscure the patterns in rovibrational spectra that are needed to assign peaks in the spectra. A method for generating high resolution 2DIR spectra of gas phase molecules has now been developed and tested using methane as the sample. The 2D rovibrational patterns that are recorded resemble an asterisk with a center position that provides the frequencies of both of the two coupled vibrational levels. The ability to generate easily recognizable 2D rovibrational patterns, regardless of temperature, should make the technique useful for a wide range of applications that are otherwise difficult or impossible when using conventional 1D rovibrational spectroscopy.},

Rate predictions from this approach bridge disparate independent literature studies on the same model system. As such, we find that rate predictions based on classical nucleation theory, direct brute force molecular dynamics simulations, and seeding are consistent with our approach and one another. Published rates derived from forward flux sampling simulations are, however, found to be outliers. This study serves two purposes: First, we validate the reliability of common modeling techniques and extrapolation approaches on a paradigmatic problem in materials science and chemical physics.

  abstract = {To accelerate the exploration of chemical space, it is necessary to identify the compounds that will provide the most additional information or value. A large-scale analysis of mononuclear octahedral transition metal complexes deposited in an experimental database confirms an under-representation of lower-symmetry complexes. From a set of around 1000 previously studied Fe(II) complexes, we show that the theoretical space of synthetically accessible complexes formed from the relatively small number of unique ligands is significantly (∼816k) larger. For the properties of these complexes, we validate the concept of ligand additivity by inferring heteroleptic properties from a stoichiometric combination of homoleptic complexes. An improved interpolation scheme that incorporates information about cis and trans isomer effects predicts the adiabatic spin-splitting energy to around 2 kcal/mol and the HOMO level to less than 0.2 eV. We demonstrate a multi-stage strategy to discover leads from the 816k Fe(II) complexes within a targeted property region. We carry out a coarse interpolation from homoleptic complexes that we refine over a subspace of ligands based on the likelihood of generating complexes with targeted properties. We validate our approach on nine new binary and ternary complexes predicted to be in a targeted zone of discovery, suggesting opportunities for efficient transition metal complex discovery.},

  abstract = {A central object in the computational studies of rare events is the committor function. Though costly to compute, the committor function encodes complete mechanistic information of the processes involving rare events, including reaction rates and transition-state ensembles. Under the framework of transition path theory, Rotskoff et al. [ Proceedings of the 2nd Mathematical and Scientific Machine Learning Conference, Proceedings of Machine Learning Research (PLMR, 2022), Vol. 145, pp. 757–780] proposes an algorithm where a feedback loop couples a neural network that models the committor function with importance sampling, mainly umbrella sampling, which collects data needed for adaptive training. In this work, we show additional modifications are needed to improve the accuracy of the algorithm. The first modification adds elements of supervised learning, which allows the neural network to improve its prediction by fitting to sample-mean estimates of committor values obtained from short molecular dynamics trajectories. The second modification replaces the committor-based umbrella sampling with the finite-temperature string (FTS) method, which enables homogeneous sampling in regions where transition pathways are located. We test our modifications on low-dimensional systems with non-convex potential energy where reference solutions can be found via analytical or finite element methods, and show how combining supervised learning and the FTS method yields accurate computation of committor functions and reaction rates. We also provide an error analysis for algorithms that use the FTS method, using which reaction rates can be accurately estimated during training with a small number of samples. The methods are then applied to a molecular system in which no reference solution is known, where accurate computations of committor functions and reaction rates can still be obtained.},

  abstract = {In this work, we explore the relative accuracy to which a hybrid functional, in the context of density functional theory, may predict redox properties under the constraint of satisfying the general form of Koopmans’ theorem. Taking aqueous iron as our model system within the framework of first-principles molecular dynamics, direct comparison between computed single-particle energies and experimental ionization data is assessed by both (1) tuning the degree of hybrid exchange, to satisfy the general form of Koopmans’ theorem, and (2) ensuring the application of finite-size corrections. These finite-size corrections are benchmarked through classical molecular dynamics calculations, extended to large atomic ensembles, for which good convergence is obtained in the large supercell limit. Our first-principles findings indicate that while precise quantitative agreement with experimental ionization data cannot always be attained for solvated systems, when satisfying the general form of Koopmans’ theorem via hybrid functionals, theoretically robust estimates of single-particle redox energies are most often arrived at by employing a total energy difference approach. That is, when seeking to employ a value of exact exchange that does not satisfy the general form of Koopmans’ theorem, but some other physical metric, the single-particle energy estimate that would most closely align with the general form of Koopmans’ theorem is obtained from a total energy difference approach. In this respect, these findings provide important guidance for the more general comparison of redox energies computed via hybrid functionals with experimental data.},

With this approach, three- and four-center Coulomb integrals can be reduced to the same form of two-center integrals. Resulting two-center Coulomb integrals can be further simplified into a simpler form, which can be related to the Boys function.

Since the existing active-feedback localization methods localize particles in real time assuming zero background, they are ill-suited to track in the inhomogeneous background environment of a live cell. Here, we develop a windowed estimation of signal and background levels using recent data to estimate the current particle brightness and background intensity. These estimates facilitate recursive Bayesian position estimation, improving upon current Kalman-based localization methods. Combined, online Bayesian and windowed estimation of background and signal (COBWEBS) surpasses existing 2D localization methods. Simulations demonstrate improved localization accuracy and responsivity in a homogeneous background for selected particle and background intensity combinations. Improved or similar performance of COBWEBS tracking extends to the majority of signal and background combinations explored. Furthermore, improved tracking durations are demonstrated in the presence of heterogeneous backgrounds for multiple particle intensities, diffusive speeds, and background patterns. COBWEBS can accurately track particles in the presence of high and nonuniform backgrounds, including intensity changes of up to three times the particle’s intensity, making it a prime candidate for advancing active-feedback single fluorophore tracking to the cellular interior.},

  abstract = {In this study, we develop a theory of multichromophoric excitation energy transfer (MC-EET) in the framework of macroscopic quantum electrodynamics. The theory we present is general for studying the interplay between energy transfer and fluorescence in the presence of arbitrary inhomogeneous, dispersive, and absorbing media. The dynamical equations of MC-EET, including energy-transfer kernels and fluorescence kernels, allow us to describe the combined effects of molecular vibrations and photonic environments on excitation energy transfer. To demonstrate the universality of the MC-EET theory, we show that under specific conditions, the MC-EET theory can be converted to three representative theories. First, under the Markov approximation, we derive an explicit Förster-type expression for plasmon-coupled resonance energy transfer [Hsu et al. , J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 8 , 2357 (2017)] from the MC-EET theory. In addition, the MC-EET theory also provides a parameter-free formula to estimate transition dipole–dipole interactions mediated by photonic environments. Second, we generalize the theory of multichromophoric Förster resonance energy transfer [Jang et al. , Phys. Rev. Lett. 92 , 218301 (2004)] to include the effects of retardation and dielectric environments. Third, for molecules weakly coupled with photonic modes, the MC-EET theory recovers the previous main result in Chance–Prock–Silbey classical fluorescence theory [Chance et al. , J. Chem. Phys. 60 , 2744 (1974)]. This study opens a promising direction for exploring light–matter interactions in multichromophoric systems with possible applications in the exciton migration in metal–organic framework materials and organic photovoltaic devices.},

  abstract = {Advances in algorithm developments have enabled density functional theory (DFT) description of large molecules, including whole proteins, but the self-consistent field (SCF) convergence issues often hamper practical applications. The conductor-like polarizable continuum model (CPCM), although initially introduced as an implicit solvent model, was reported to improve SCF convergence in some large molecules. However, the underlying mechanisms and applicable use cases were unclear. We investigated the impacts of CPCM on the SCF convergence of 25 peptides and found that the CPCM only effectively reduced the SCF iterations for molecules with charge separations (e.g., the zwitterionic form of peptides) but had little effect on non-charge-separated molecules. We observed that CPCM increased the HOMO–LUMO gap of both the zwitterionic and non-charge-separated molecules, but only the charge-separated molecules suffered from the vanishing HOMO–LUMO gap problem in the gas phase, which is the origin of the convergence issue. We revealed CPCM’s gap-opening mechanism as the selective stabilization/destabilization of molecular orbitals (MOs) based on their local electrostatic environment. Compared to level-shifting, a traditional SCF improvement technique, CPCM has superior performance because the stabilization/destabilization of MOs is consistent through SCF iterations. Finally, we examined CPCM’s impacts on DFT density delocalization error (DDE) when used as an SCF accelerator. CPCM can mitigate the DDE and reproduce the density-derived properties (e.g., dipole moments) matching high-level methods when a very low dielectric constant is used but tends to over-localize the electron density at higher dielectric constants.},

Over the Pt/Pd single atom embedded on B/N co-doped graphene (Pt/Pd-BNC) surface, crossover points of O 2 /O 3 selectivity inversion were predicted to be 1.33 and 0.89 V vs standard hydrogen electrode, which were also consistent with the previous experimental results.

However, its first successful quantitative application was to explain cooperative oxygen binding by hemoglobin, often called the “hydrogen molecule of biology.” The combination of its original application and the enormous amount of research on hemoglobin has made it the paradigm for studies of allostery, especially for multi-subunit proteins, and for the development of statistical mechanical models to describe how structure determines function. This article is a historical account of the development of statistical mechanical models for hemoglobin to explain both the cooperative binding of oxygen (called homotropic effects by MWC) and how oxygen binding is affected by ligands that bind distant from the heme oxygen binding site (called heterotropic allosteric effects by MWC). This account makes clear the many remaining challenges for describing the relationship of structure to function for hemoglobin in terms of a satisfactory statistical mechanical model.},

  abstract = {Configurational sampling is central to characterize the equilibrium properties of complex molecular systems, but it remains a significant computational challenge. The conventional molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of limited duration often result in inadequate sampling and thus inaccurate equilibrium estimates. Replica exchange with nonequilibrium switches (RENS) is a collective variable-free computational technique to achieve extensive sampling from a sequence of equilibrium and nonequilibrium MD simulations without modifying the underlying potential energy surface of the system. Unlike the conventional replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) simulation, which demands a significant number of replicas for better accuracy, RENS employs nonequilibrium heating (forward) and cooling (reverse) work simulations prior to configurational swaps to improve the acceptance probability for replica exchange by using only a few replicas. Here, we have implemented the RENS algorithm on four model systems and examined its performance against the conventional MD and REMD simulations. The desired equilibrium distributions were generated by RENS for all the model systems, whereas REMD and MD simulations could not do so due to inadequate sampling on the same timescales. The calculated work distributions from RENS obeyed the expected nonequilibrium fluctuation theorem. The results indicate that the switching time of the nonequilibrium simulations can be systematically altered to optimize the acceptance probability and the reduced work of switching. The modular implementation of RENS algorithm not only enables us to readily extend it to multiple replicas but also paves the way for extension to larger molecular systems in the future.},

By leveraging advances in machine-learned coarse-graining, we develop a PI method with the reduced computational cost of a classical simulation. We also propose a simple temperature elevation scheme to significantly attenuate the artifacts of standard PI approaches as well as eliminate the unfavorable temperature scaling of the computational cost. We illustrate the approach, by calculating vibrational spectra using standard models of water molecules and bulk water, demonstrating significant computational savings and dramatically improved accuracy compared to more expensive reference approaches.

However, with respect to the time domain, even the fastest detectors combined with the brightest sources may only be able to reach the microsecond timescale. Thus, conventional methods are incapable of resolving the myriad fundamental ultrafast (i.e., attosecond to picosecond) atomic-scale dynamics. The successful demonstration of femtosecond (fs) laser-based (LB) ultrafast electron microscopy (UEM) nearly 20 years ago provided a means to span this nearly 10-order-of-magnitude temporal gap. While nanometer-picosecond UEM studies of dynamics are now well established, ultrafast Å-scale imaging has gone largely unrealized. Further, while instrument development has rightly been an emphasis, and while new modalities and uses of pulsed-beam TEM continue to emerge, the overall chemical and materials application space has been only modestly explored to date. In this Perspective, we argue that these apparent shortfalls can be attributed to a simple lack of data and detail. We speculate that present work and continued growth of the field will ultimately lead to the realization that Å-scale fs dynamics can indeed be imaged with minimally modified UEM instrumentation and with repetition rates ( f rep ) below — and perhaps even well below — 1 MHz. We further argue that the use of low f rep , whether for LB UEM or for chopped/bunched beams, significantly expands the accessible application space. This calls for systematically establishing modality-specific limits so that especially promising technologies can be pursued, thus, ultimately facilitating broader adoption as individual instrument capabilities expand.},

  abstract = {The ability to simulate electrochemical reactions from first-principles has advanced significantly in recent years. Here, we discuss the atomistic interpretation of electrochemistry at three scales: from the electronic structure to elementary processes to constant-potential reactions. At each scale, we highlight the importance of the grand-canonical nature of the process and show that the grand-canonical energy is the natural thermodynamic state variable, which has the additional benefit of simplifying calculations. We show that atomic forces are the derivative of the grand-potential energy when the potential is fixed. We further examine the meaning of potential at the atomic scale and its link to the chemical potential and discuss the link between charge transfer and potential in several situations.},

  abstract = {Coherence can drive wave-like motion of electrons and nuclei in photoexcited systems, which can yield fast and efficient ways to exert materials’ functionalities beyond the thermodynamic limit. The search for coherent phenomena has been a central topic in chemical physics although their direct characterization is often elusive. Here, we highlight recent advances in time-resolved x-ray absorption spectroscopy (tr-XAS) to investigate coherent phenomena, especially those that utilize the eminent light source of isolated attosecond pulses. The unparalleled time and state sensitivities of tr-XAS in tandem with the unique element specificity render the method suitable to study valence electronic dynamics in a wide variety of materials. The latest studies have demonstrated the capabilities of tr-XAS to characterize coupled electronic–structural coherence in small molecules and coherent light–matter interactions of core-excited excitons in solids. We address current opportunities and challenges in the exploration of coherent phenomena, with potential applications for energy- and bio-related systems, potential crossings, strongly driven solids, and quantum materials. With the ongoing developments in both theory and light sources, tr-XAS holds great promise for revealing the role of coherences in chemical dynamics.},

The “quasi-constant” manifolds, on the other hand, exhibit low but non-zero sensitivity to atomic displacements. As a consequence, for any such manifold, it is possible to optimize model parameters and the training set to mitigate their impact on learning even though this is often impractical and it is preferable to use descriptors that avoid both exact singularities and the associated numerical instability.},

In the dilute limit, Mebiol displays a Newtonian behavior with an effective viscosity that decreases with temperature, consistent with a peculiar aggregation mechanism characterized by an increase of the molecular weight with a simultaneous reduction of the aggregate size. By increasing concentration and approaching gelation, both the storage and loss moduli show a nonmonotonic dependence with temperature, with a pronounced maximum around T m ≃ 28–30 °C, the value above which, in the dilute limit, the individual Mebiol chains are fully compacted. Such a distinctive trend of the elastic and viscous properties persists within the gel, which, therefore, becomes “softer” above T m . Although when temperature changes are performed adiabatically, the transition from the fluid to the gel phase takes place without any apparent discontinuity, a rapid T -jump leads to the formation of a hard gel at a concentration where a low heating rate conversely yields a fluid phase. This is a visible manifestation of the nonequilibrium nature of these physical gels.},

Currently, molecular simulations of cellular-scale membrane remodeling processes at atomic resolution are extremely difficult, due to their size, complexity, and the large times-scales on which these processes occur. Instead, elastic membrane models are used to simulate membrane shapes and transitions between them and to infer their properties and functions. Unfortunately, an efficiently parallelized open-source simulation code to do so has been lacking. Here, we present TriMem, a parallel hybrid Monte Carlo simulation engine for triangulated lipid membranes. The kernels are efficiently coded in C++ and wrapped with Python for ease-of-use. The parallel implementation of the energy and gradient calculations and of Monte Carlo flip moves of edges in the triangulated membrane enable us to simulate large and highly curved membrane structures. For validation, we reproduce phase diagrams of vesicles with varying surface-to-volume ratios and area difference. We also compute the density of states to verify correct Boltzmann sampling. The software can be used to tackle a range of large-scale membrane remodeling processes as a step toward cell-scale simulations. Additionally, extensive documentation make the software accessible to the broad biophysics and computational cell biology communities.},

We employ first-principles electron–phonon computations within the framework of the density functional theory+ U + J method to reveal the presence of these states within a thermal distribution of phonon displacements and model their evolution with temperature. Our computations reproduce the temperature dependence of the optical dielectric function of hematite with remarkable accuracy and indicate that the band edge optical absorption and second-order resonance Raman spectra arise from polaronic optical transitions involving coupling to longitudinal optical phonons with energies greater than 50 meV. Additionally, we find that the resulting polaron comprises an electron localized to two adjacent Fe atoms with distortions that lie primarily along the coordinates of phonons with energies of 31 and 81 meV.},

Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy measurements supported by density functional theory calculations show strong d -band hybridization between the Cu 3 d and Pd 4 d bands. These hybridization effects result in emergent optical properties, most apparent in the dilute Pd case. Time-resolved terahertz spectroscopy with NIR (e.g., 1550 nm) excitation displays composition-tunable electron dynamics. We posit that the negative peak in the normalized increment of transmissivity (ΔT/T) below 2 ps from dilute Pd alloys is due to non-thermalized hot-carrier generation. On the other hand, Pd-rich alloys exhibit an increase in ΔT/T due to thermalization effects upon ultrafast NIR photoexcitation. Cu x Pd 1−x alloys in the dilute Pd regime may be a promising material for future ultrafast NIR optoelectronic devices.},

  abstract = {Density functional theory calculations are combined with time-resolved photoluminescence experiments to identify the species responsible for the reversible trapping of holes following photoexcitation of InP/ZnSe/ZnS core/shell/shell quantum dots (QDs) having excess indium in the shell [P. Cavanaugh et al. , J. Chem. Phys. 155 , 244705 (2021)]. Several possible assignments are considered, and a substitutional indium adjacent to a zinc vacancy, In 3+ /V Zn 2− , is found to be the most likely. This assignment is consistent with the observation that trapping occurs only when the QD has excess indium and is supported by experiments showing that the addition of zinc oleate or acetate decreases the extent of trapping, presumably by filling some of the vacancy traps. We also show that the addition of alkyl carboxylic acids causes increased trapping, presumably by the creation of additional zinc vacancies. The calculations show that either a single In 2+ ion or an In 2+ –In 3+ dimer is much too easily oxidized to form the reversible traps observed experimentally, while In 3+ is far too difficult to oxidize. Additional experimental data on InP/ZnSe/ZnS QDs synthesized in the absence of chloride demonstrates that the reversible traps are not associated with Cl − . However, a zinc vacancy adjacent to a substitutional indium is calculated to have its highest occupied orbitals about 1 eV above the top of the valence band of bulk ZnSe, in the appropriate energy range to act as reversible traps for quantum confined holes in the InP valence band. The associated orbitals are predominantly composed of p orbitals on the Se atoms adjacent to the Zn vacancy.},

  abstract = {The degradation of microplastics in relation to marine pollution has been receiving increasing attention. Because the spherulites that comprise microplastics have a highly ordered lamellar structure, their decomposition is thought to involve a lamellar structure collapse process. However, even in the simplest case of an order–disorder transition between lamellae and melt upon heating, the microscopic details of the transition have yet to be elucidated. In particular, it is unclear whether nucleation occurs at defects in the crystalline portion or at the interface between the crystalline and amorphous portions. To observe the transition in molecular simulations, an approach that distinguishes between the crystalline and amorphous structures that make up the lamella is needed. Local order parameters (LOPs) are an attempt to define the degree of order on a particle-by-particle basis and have demonstrated the ability to precisely render complex order structure transitions during phase transitions. In this study, 274 LOPs were considered to classify the crystalline and amorphous structures of polymers. Supervised machine learning was used to automatically and systematically search for the parameters. The identified optimal LOP does not require macroscopic information such as the overall orientation direction of the lamella layers but can precisely distinguish the crystalline and amorphous portions of the lamella layers using only a small amount of neighboring particle information.},

In this work, the fragile-to-strong crossover of a model two-dimensional (2D) glassy system is analyzed via molecular dynamics simulation, which represents 2D-silica. By separating the sampled defect and defect-free inherent structures, we are able to identify their respective density of state distributions with respect to energy. A low energy cutoff is found in both distributions. It is shown that the fragile-to-strong crossover can be quantitatively related to the parameters of the energy landscape, involving, in particular, the low-energy cutoff of the energy distribution. It is also shown that the low-energy cutoff of the defect-states is determined by the formation energy of a specific defect configuration, involving two silicon and no oxygen defects. The low-temperature behavior of 2D silica is quantitatively compared with that of 3D silica, showing surprisingly similar behavior.},

The free energies of these ice forms are calculated to obtain the lattice constants for the tetragonal unit cell and the thermal expansivities at various thermodynamic conditions in the framework of quasi-harmonic approximation, taking account of their anisotropic nature. The thermal expansivities are also examined by applying a thermodynamic relation that connects them with the Grüneisen parameters and the elastic compliances. Both calculations suggest that ice III and IX exhibit a negative thermal expansion along the a -axis but have a positive one along the c -axis at low temperatures. It is found that nonaffine deformation in the variation of the lattice constant beyond affine transformation (the Born approximation) is essential in the theoretical calculation of the thermal properties of ice III and IX. We also find that the nonaffine deformation is described by the shift of the minimum energy positions in the potential manifold of hydrogen-ordered ice along a limited number of the normal mode coordinates, which is irrelevant to the system size. These modes become unstable against an applied strain, so that the potential minimum moves along those normal coordinates away from that of the affine-transformed structure. The unstable modes are all symmetry-preserving modes, and the space-group symmetry is an invariant under displacement along either of those normal coordinates. The number of the unstable modes in ice IX is 8 while it is 1 in another hydrogen-ordered ice VIII.},

  abstract = {We develop a mesoscopic model to study the plastic behavior of an amorphous material under cyclic loading. The model is depinning-like and driven by a disordered thresholds dynamics that is coupled by long-range elastic interactions. We propose a simple protocol of “glass preparation” that allows us to mimic thermalization at high temperatures as well as aging at vanishing temperature. Various levels of glass stabilities (from brittle to ductile) can be achieved by tuning the aging duration. The aged glasses are then immersed into a quenched disorder landscape and serve as initial configurations for various protocols of mechanical loading by shearing. The dependence of the plastic behavior upon monotonous loading is recovered. The behavior under cyclic loading is studied for different ages and system sizes. The size and age dependence of the irreversibility transition is discussed. A thorough characterization of the disorder-landscape is achieved through the analysis of the transition graphs, which describe the plastic deformation pathways under athermal quasi-static shear. In particular, the analysis of the stability ranges of the strongly connected components of the transition graphs reveals the emergence of a phase-separation like process associated with the aging of the glass. Increasing the age and, hence, the stability of the initial glass results in a gradual break-up of the landscape of dynamically accessible stable states into three distinct regions: one region centered around the initially prepared glass phase and two additional regions characterized by well-separated ranges of positive and negative plastic strains, each of which is accessible only from the initial glass phase by passing through the stress peak in the forward and backward, respectively, shearing directions.},

We correct for finite size simulation errors using potential tail corrections. Trotter factorization errors are accounted for either via extrapolation or by using a suitably small imaginary time step. We incorporate the three-body interaction using two methods: (1) the full inclusion method, where pair and three-body interactions are used in both Monte Carlo sampling and in the energy estimators, and (2) the perturbative method, where three-body interactions are omitted from sampling but are still present in energy estimations. Both treatments of the three-body interaction return very similar total energies and pressures. The presence of three-body interactions has only minor effects on the structural properties of the solid. Whereas the pair interaction, on its own, significantly overestimates the pressure of solid parahydrogen, the additional presence of the three-body interaction causes a severe underestimation of the pressure. Our findings suggest that accurate simulations of solid parahydrogen require four-body and possibly higher-order many-body interactions.

In water/ethanol, water/methanol, and water/ethylene glycol, which have negative enthalpies of mixing across the entire mole fraction range, the modified Kempers model successfully predicts the sign change of the Soret coefficient with high accuracy, whereas, in water/acetone and benzene/ n -heptane, which have composition ranges with positive enthalpies of mixing, it cannot predict the sign change of the Soret coefficient. These results suggest that the model is applicable in composition ranges with negative enthalpies of mixing and provides a framework for predicting and understanding the Soret effect from the equilibrium thermodynamic properties of mixing, such as the partial molar volume, partial molar enthalpy of mixing, and chemical potential.},

Our calculations are done in a fully quantum way by solving close-coupling quantum-scattering equations without any approximations. We also report a new, highly accurate CO–O 2 potential energy surface on which we did the quantum-scattering calculations. The calculated collisional broadening agrees with the available experimental data in a wide temperature range. The calculated collisional shift is negligible compared to the broadening, which is also consistent with the experimental data. We combine this result with our previous calculations for the same line in CO perturbed by N 2 [Jóźwiak et al. , J. Chem.

The results were used to interpret the recent photoelectron measurements [M. Patanen et al. , J. Chem. Phys. 155 , 054304 (2021)]. The present high-level electronic structure calculations employing, in particular, the single, double, and triple excitations and equation-of-motion coupled-cluster method accounting for single and double excitation approaches and complete basis set extrapolation technique for the evaluation of the vertical ionization energies of imidazole indicate that the A 2 A′ and B 2 A″ states are very close in energy and subject to non-adiabatic effects. Our modeling confirms the existence of pronounced vibronic coupling of the A 2 A′ and B 2 A″ states. Moreover, despite the large energy gap of nearly 1.3 eV, the ground state X 2 A″ is efficiently coupled to the A 2 A′ state. The modeling was performed within the framework of the three-state linear vibronic coupling problem employing Hamiltonians expressed in a basis of diabatic electronic states and parameters derived from ab initio calculations. The ionization spectrum was computed using the multi-configuration time-dependent Hartree method. The calculated spectrum is in good agreement with the experimental data, allowing for some interpretation of the observed features to be proposed.},

  abstract = {Acetylene and ammonia are important constituents of the interstellar medium, and their coupled chemistry induced by high-energy radiation may be responsible for the formation of a variety of prebiotically important organic–nitrogen compounds. In this work, we first comprehensively characterized the vibrational spectrum of the 1:1 C 2 H 2 ⋯NH 3 complex obtained by deposition of the C 2 H 2 /NH 3 /Ng (Ng = Ar, Kr, or Xe) gaseous mixtures at 5 K using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and ab initio calculations at the CCSD(T)/L2a_3 level of theory and examined its radiation-induced transformations. The parent complex adopts a C 3v symmetric top molecular structure with C 2 H 2 acting as a proton donor. The x-ray-induced transformations of this complex result in the formation of the C 2 H 2 ⋯NH 2 ∙ complex and various CN-containing species (CH 2 CNH, CH 3 NC, CH 2 NCH, CH 2 NC ∙ , CCN ∙ , and CNC ∙ ). The radical–molecule complex was identified based on comparison of experimental data with the results of the UCCSD(T)/L2a_3 computations. It is characterized by distinct features in the region of acetylene CH asym str mode, red-shifted from the corresponding absorptions of non-complexed acetylene by −72.9, −70.4, and −60.6 cm −1 for Ar, Kr, and Xe, respectively. Additionally, in krypton and xenon matrices, the blue-shifted features in the CH asym bend region of acetylene were observed, which can be also tentatively attributed to the C 2 H 2 ⋯NH 2 ∙ complex. The extrapolated to the complete basis set limit unrestricted coupled cluster method with single and double, and perturbative triple excitations binding energy of the C 2 H 2 ⋯NH 2 ∙ complex (including zero-point vibration energy correction) is lower than that of the C 2 H 2 ⋯NH 3 complex (1.90 and 2.51 kcal mol −1 , respectively). We believe that the C 2 H 2 ⋯NH 2 ∙ complex may be an important intermediate in cold synthetic astrochemistry.},

An isolated binary collision (IBC) model is sufficient to describe RER for solvent densities ≤ ∼4M where rotational equilibrium is re-established in ∼1.5–2.5 collisions. N 2 O RER is ∼30\% more efficient in SF 6 than in Xe due to additional relaxation pathways in SF 6 and electronic factor differences. 2DIR analysis revealed that N 2 O RER exhibits a critical slowing effect in SF 6 at near critical density ( ρ * ∼ 0.8) where the IBC model breaks down. This is attributable to the coupling of critical long-range density fluctuations to the local N 2 O free rotor environment. No such RER critical slowing is observed in Xe because IBC break down occurs much further from the Xe critical point. Many body interactions effectively shield N 2 O from these near critical Xe density fluctuations. The N 2 O ν 3 VER density dependence in SF 6 is different than that seen for RER, indicating a different coupling to the near critical environment than RER. N 2 O ν 3 VER is only about ∼7 times slower than RER in SF 6 . In contrast, almost no VER decay is observed in Xe over 200 ps. This VER solvent difference is due to a vibrationally resonant energy transfer pathway in SF 6 that is not possible for Xe.},

The computation is performed for quenching from the first bending mode of water at ν ≃ 1595 cm −1 with a rotation energy of up to ∼400 cm −1 in the bending mode. Molecular hydrogen is in its para and ortho modifications; it is rotating with a rotational quantum number of up to 4 and 3, respectively. All computations are performed on a very reliable and fully tested potential water–hydrogen energy surface of full dimensionality. Dynamics is performed in the full coupled channel formalism in the rigid bender approximation with a decoupling of the water rotation and vibration bases. Rate coefficients are converged for a kinetic temperature range 50–500 K. The crucial importance of the proper treatment of the projectile rotation is emphasized with orders of magnitude differences between the different channels for the H 2 rotation. Sensitivity to the actual rovibrational initial state of water exists but in a weaker manner. Overall quenching rate coefficients are about 10 −12 cm 3 s −1 , remaining one to three orders of magnitude lower than pure rotational quenching. They should be employed to model denser and warmer astrophysical media, such as high atmospheres or star and planet forming regions, which are to be explored by infrared space telescopes, such as JWST.},

However, theoretical understanding of nonequilibrium heat transport in current-carrying SMJs is a challenging problem due to the different kinds of nonlinear interactions involved, including electron–vibration and anharmonic vibrational coupling. Here, we overcome this challenge by accelerating Langevin-type current-induced molecular dynamics using machine-learning potential derived from density functional theory. We show that SMJs with graphene electrodes generate an order of magnitude less heating than those with gold electrodes. This is rooted in the better phonon spectral overlap of graphene with molecular vibrations, rendering harmonic phonon heat transport being dominant. In contrast, in a spectrally mismatched junction with gold electrodes, anharmonic coupling becomes important to transport heat away from the molecule to surrounding electrodes. Our work paves the way for studying current-induced heat transport and energy redistribution in realistic SMJs.},

  abstract = {The classification of three-center two-electron (3c2e) bonds into supported (closed) or unsupported (open) was proposed by Lipscomb in his work on boranes and extended to transition metal complexes by Bau and co-workers. The species in which the interactions of the terminal atoms are negligible are called “unsupported bonds.” Examples of chemical species that are said to exhibit such bonds are Li 2 H + , Na 2 H + , B 2 H 7 − , Al 2 (CH 3 ) 7 − , and [( μ 2 -H)Cr 2 (CO) 10 ] − although the general criterion for distinguishing these types of bonds is somewhat qualitative. Besides providing a unifying view of the nature of the chemical bond, in terms of quantum interference among electronic states, the Generalized Product Function Energy Partitioning method through the Interference Energy Analysis (IEA) is also potentially capable of providing a rigorous ground to the concept of supported bonds by looking at the specific interference energies between the orbital pairs associated with the bond. The IEA was performed in the species Li 2 H + , Na 2 H + , B 2 H 7 − , C 2 H 7 − , Al 2 H 7 − , and [( μ 2 -H)Cr 2 (CO) 10 ] − , as well as along the reaction path Li 2 H + → Li 2 + + H. The results shown that in all studied A–B–C bonds, the A–C interactions are as important as the A–B/B–C ones, leading to the conclusion that all studied 3c2e bonds are “supported,” in the sense that the A–C interaction is not negligible. The particularity of those species in preferring linear geometry is completely explained by quasi-classical effects, more specifically, by minimization of the electron–electron and nucleus–nucleus repulsions.},

An analysis of the spectral shifts of the OH and C=O stretching vibrations across the different metal ions and peptide chain lengths shows that these are largely caused by the electric field of the metal ion, which varies in strength as a function of the square of the distance. The metal ion–peptide interaction also remotely modulates the strength of internal hydrogen bonding in the peptide backbone via the weakening of the amide C=O bond, resulting in a decrease in internal hydrogen bond strength from Li + &gt; Na + &gt; K + .},

  abstract = {This article presents a standardized alternative to the traditional phase cycling approach employed by the overwhelming majority of contemporary Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) research. On well-tested, stable NMR systems running well-tested pulse sequences in highly optimized, homogeneous magnetic fields, the hardware and/or software responsible for traditional phase cycling quickly isolate a meaningful subset of data by averaging and discarding between 3/4 and 127/128 of the digitized data. In contrast, the new domain colored coherence transfer (DCCT) approach enables the use of all the information acquired from all transients. This approach proves to be particularly useful where multiple coherence pathways are required, or for improving the signal when the magnetic fields are inhomogeneous and unstable. For example, the authors’ interest in the nanoscale heterogeneities of hydration dynamics demands increasingly sophisticated and automated measurements deploying Overhauser Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (ODNP) in low-field electromagnets, where phase cycling and signal averaging perform suboptimally. This article demonstrates the capabilities of DCCT on ODNP data and with a collection of algorithms that provide robust phasing, avoidance of baseline distortion, and the ability to realize relatively weak signals amid background noise through signal-averaged correlation alignment. The DCCT schema works by combining a multidimensional organization of phase cycled data with a specific methodology for visualizing the resulting complex-valued data. It could be extended to other forms of coherent spectroscopy seeking to analyze multiple coherence transfer pathways.},

  abstract = {The ability to monitor lithium deposition on the anodes in real time is becoming progressively more important due to the development of advanced anode technology. Given the fact that the detrimental Li deposits are always on the micron scale, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) happens to be a very effective and selective detection technology due to the skin effect. Here, quantitative in situ 1D EPR imaging is carried out with a magnetic field gradient to achieve a one-dimensional spatial resolution along the Li growth direction in a capillary cell. The quantification of Li deposits is carefully calibrated using a 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl standard, and a processing method is presented to correct the double integration of the Dysonian line from the metallic Li. The Li deposition processes are compared in two different electrolytes. For the electrolyte containing fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) additive, the fitting results of Dysonian lines suggest that the plated Li has a larger dimension of the microstructure and the stripping proceeds more uniformly. It thus accounts for the higher Coulombic efficiency in the electrolyte with FEC. In situ EPR imaging also suggests that the Sand’s capacity varies with the electrolytes. The forced growth of dendritic Li is carried out at a very large current density using a derivative operando EPR method to monitor the growth locus of the Li dendrites, indicating a tip-growing mechanism. This work can be instructive for those who are engaged in the study of electro-deposited lithium using in situ EPR imaging technology.},

  abstract = {Conventional time-of-flight (TOF) measurements yield charge carrier mobilities in photovoltaic cells with time resolution limited by the RC time constant of the device, which is on the order of 0.1–1 µ s for the systems targeted in the present work. We have recently developed an alternate TOF method, termed nonlinear photocurrent spectroscopy (NLPC), in which carrier drift velocities are determined with picosecond time resolution by applying a pair of laser pulses to a device with an experimentally controlled delay time. In this technique, carriers photoexcited by the first laser pulse are “probed” by way of recombination processes involving carriers associated with the second laser pulse. Here, we report NLPC measurements conducted with a simplified experimental apparatus in which synchronized 40 ps diode lasers enable delay times up to 100 µ s at 5 kHz repetition rates. Carrier mobilities of ∼0.025 cm 2 /V/s are determined for MAPbI 3 photovoltaic cells with active layer thicknesses of 240 and 460 nm using this instrument. Our experiments and model calculations suggest that the nonlinear response of the photocurrent weakens as the carrier densities photoexcited by the first laser pulse trap and broaden while traversing the active layer of a device. Based on this aspect of the signal generation mechanism, experiments conducted with co-propagating and counter-propagating laser beam geometries are leveraged to determine a 60 nm length scale of drift velocity dispersion in MAPbI 3 films. Contributions from localized states induced by thermal fluctuations are consistent with drift velocity dispersion on this length scale.},

  abstract = {Parahydrogen induced polarization (PHIP) provides a powerful tool to enhance inherently weak nuclear magnetic resonance signals, particularly in biologically relevant compounds. The initial source of PHIP is the non-equilibrium spin order of parahydrogen, i.e., dihydrogen, where the two protons make up a singlet spin state. Conversion of this spin order into net magnetization of magnetic heteronuclei, e.g., 13 C, provides one of the most efficient ways to exploit PHIP. We propose a facile route to increase the performance of PHIP transfer in experiments with adiabatic sweeps of the ultralow magnetic field. To date, this technique yields the highest efficiency of PHIP transfer, yet, it has been mostly utilized with linear field sweeps, which does not consider the underlying spin dynamics, resulting in sub-optimal polarization. This issue was previously addressed by using the “constant” adiabaticity method, which, however, requires extensive calculations for large spin systems. In this work, the field sweep is optimized by utilizing the field dependence of the average 13 C polarization. Both the experimental detection and the numerical simulation of this dependence are straightforward, even for complex multi-spin systems. This work provides a comprehensive survey of PHIP transfer dynamics at ultralow fields for two molecular systems that are relevant for PHIP, namely, maleic acid and allyl pyruvate. The proposed optimization allowed us to increase the resulting 13 C polarization in 13 C-allyl pyruvate from 6.8\% with a linear profile to 8.7\% with an “optimal” profile. Such facile optimization routines are valuable for adiabatic experiments in complex spin systems undergoing rapid relaxation or chemical exchange.},

  abstract = {Multiconfiguration perturbation theory (MCPT) is a general framework for correcting the reference function of arbitrary structures. The variants of MCPT introduced so far differ in the specification of their zero-order Hamiltonian, i.e., the partitioning. A common characteristic of MCPT variants is that no numerical procedure is invoked when handling the overlap of the reference function and determinants spanning the configuration space. This comes at the price of pinpointing a principal term in the determinant expansion of the reference, rendering the PT results dependent on this choice. It is here shown that the pivot dependence of MCPT can be eliminated by using an overcomplete set of projected determinants in the space orthogonal and complementary to the reference. The projected determinants form a so-called frame, a generalization of the notion of basis, allowing for redundancy of the set. The simple structure of the frame overlap matrix facilitates overlap treatment in closed form, a feature shared by previous MCPT variants. In particular, the Moore–Penrose inverse of singular matrices appearing in frame-based MCPT can be constructed without the need for any pivoting algorithm or numerical zero threshold. Pilot numerical studies are performed for the singlet-triplet gap of biradicaloid systems, relying on geminal-based, incomplete model space reference function. Comparison with previous MCPT variants as well as illustration of pivot invariance is provided.},

With the Hartree–Fock determinant taken as the reference, we introduce a sequential product of parameterized unitary Ansätze. While the first unitary, containing the excitation operators, acts directly on the reference determinant, the second unitary, containing a set of rank-two, vacuum-annihilating scattering operators, has nontrivial action only on certain entangled states. We demonstrate the theoretical bottleneck of such an implementation in a classical computer, whereas the same is implemented in the hybrid quantum–classical variational quantum eigensolver framework with a reasonably shallow quantum circuit without any additional approximation. We have further introduced a number of variants of the proposed Ansatz with different degrees of sophistication by judiciously approximating the scattering operators. With a number of applications on strongly correlated molecules, we have shown that all our schemes can perform uniformly well throughout the molecular potential energy surface without significant additional implementation cost over the conventional unitary coupled cluster approach with single and double excitations.},

By constraining the oxygen atoms to a fixed distance, this system serves as a tunable model for general proton-transfer processes with variable barrier height. Three spectral contributions at distinct frequencies are identified and analytically predicted: the quasi-harmonic motion around the most probable configuration, amenable to normal-mode analysis, the contribution due to transfer paths when the proton moves over the barrier, and a shoulder for low frequencies stemming from the stochastic transfer-waiting-time distribution; the latter two contributions are not captured by normal-mode analysis but exclusively reported on the proton-transfer kinetics. In accordance with reaction rate theory, the transfer-waiting-contribution frequency depends inversely exponentially on the barrier height, whereas the transfer-path-contribution frequency is rather insensitive to the barrier height.},

  abstract = {Most computational studies in chemistry and materials science are based on the use of density functional theory. Although the exact density functional is unknown, several density functional approximations (DFAs) offer a good balance of affordable computational cost and semi-quantitative accuracy for applications. The development of DFAs still continues on many fronts, and several new DFAs aiming for improved accuracy are published every year. However, the numerical behavior of these DFAs is an often-overlooked problem. In this work, we look at all 592 DFAs for three-dimensional systems available in Libxc 5.2.2 and examine the convergence of the density functional total energy based on tabulated atomic Hartree–Fock wave functions. We show that several recent DFAs, including the celebrated SCAN family of functionals, show impractically slow convergence with typically used numerical quadrature schemes, making these functionals unsuitable both for routine applications and high-precision studies, as thousands of radial quadrature points may be required to achieve sub- μE h accurate total energies for these functionals, while standard quadrature grids like the SG-3 grid only contain O ( 100 ) radial quadrature points. These results are both a warning to users to always check the sufficiency of the quadrature grid when adopting novel functionals, as well as a guideline to the theory community to develop better-behaved density functionals.},

Motivated by self-interaction corrected density-functional calculations on many-electron systems, we continue their study with the exactly solvable 1 s , 2 p , and 3 d states of 36 hydrogenic one-electron ions (H–Kr 35+ ) and demonstrate with self-consistent calculations that state-of-the-art DFAs indeed exhibit large errors for the 2 p and 3 d excited states. We consider 56 functionals at the local density approximation (LDA), generalized gradient approximation (GGA) as well as meta-GGA levels, and several hybrid functionals such as the recently proposed machine-learned DM21 local hybrid functional. The best non-hybrid functional for the 1 s ground state is revTPSS. As predicted by Sun et al. , the 2 p and 3 d excited states are more difficult for DFAs, and LDA functionals turn out to yield the most systematic accuracy for these states among non-hybrid functionals. The best performance for the three states overall is observed with the BHandH global hybrid GGA functional, which contains 50\% Hartree–Fock exchange and 50\% LDA exchange. The performance of DM21 is found to be inconsistent, yielding good accuracy for some states and systems and poor accuracy for others. Based on these results, we recommend including a variety of one-electron cations in future training of machine-learned density functionals.},

  abstract = {Empirical scaling of calculated vibrational harmonic frequencies is a popular approach used in the field of molecular sciences. A nonempirical scheme that aims at reducing their basis set error is suggested here. Nearly as cost-effective as the scaled Kohn–Sham density functional theory (KS DFT), it consists of splitting the frequencies into Hartree–Fock and electron correlation contributions, followed by their extrapolation to the complete basis set (CBS) limit. Since the former converges exponentially, the overall cost may actually equal that of CBS extrapolation of the correlation part. Despite shifts in the molecular geometry during vibration, reasons are advanced to justify the approach, with extrapolation from the first two steps of the basis set ladder being effective in accelerating convergence. As benchmark data, a set of harmonic frequencies and zero-point energies for 15 molecules is employed at the second-order Moller–Plesset and coupled-cluster single double triple [CCSD(T)] levels of theory. The results outperform the optimized KS DFT scaled values. As a second test set, equilibrium structures and harmonic frequencies were computed for H 2 O 2 , CH 2 NH, C 2 H 2 O, and the trans-isomer of 1,2-C 2 H 2 F 2 . The results are also encouraging, particularly when improved for excess correlation at the CCSD(T)/V D Z level via the focal-point approach. In extreme cases, CBS extrapolation is done from two double- ζ calculations: one canonical and the other using explicit correlation theory. As a further case study, benzene is considered. While the CCSD(T) results show the smallest deviation from the best estimates, the MP2 results also attain good quality: When improved for excess correlation, they show 6–10 cm −1 errors relative to the best data, only slightly outperformed at the CCSD(T)/CBS level. Tentative results for the fundamental frequencies are also presented.},

  abstract = {In this work, we study the Wigner localization of interacting electrons that are confined to a quasi-one-dimensional harmonic potential using accurate quantum chemistry approaches. We demonstrate that the Wigner regime can be reached using small values of the confinement parameter. To obtain physical insight in our results, we analyze them with a semi-analytical model for two electrons. Thanks to electronic-structure properties such as the one-body density and the particle–hole entropy, we are able to define a path that connects the Wigner regime to the Fermi-gas regime by varying the confinement parameter. In particular, we show that the particle–hole entropy, as a function of the confinement parameter, smoothly connects the two regimes. Moreover, it exhibits a maximum that could be interpreted as the transition point between the localized and delocalized regimes.},

More recently, efforts have been made to reconcile the two techniques, integrating machine learning and exact-constraint satisfaction. We continue this integrated approach, designing a deep neural network that exploits the exact constraint and appropriate norm philosophy to de-orbitalize the strongly constrained and appropriately normed (SCAN) functional. The deep neural network is trained to replicate the SCAN functional from only electron density and local derivative information, avoiding the use of the orbital-dependent kinetic energy density. The performance and transferability of the machine-learned functional are demonstrated for molecular and periodic systems.},

  abstract = {With the objective of understanding microscopic principles governing thermal energy flow in nanojunctions, we study phononic heat transport through metal-molecule-metal junctions using classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Considering a single-molecule gold-alkanedithiol-gold junction, we first focus on aspects of method development and compare two techniques for calculating thermal conductance: (i) The Reverse Nonequilibrium MD (RNEMD) method, where heat is inputted and extracted at a constant rate from opposite metals. In this case, the thermal conductance is calculated from the nonequilibrium temperature profile that is created at the junction. (ii) The Approach-to-Equilibrium MD (AEMD) method, with the thermal conductance of the junction obtained from the equilibration dynamics of the metals. In both methods, simulations of alkane chains of a growing size display an approximate length-independence of the thermal conductance, with calculated values matching computational and experimental studies. The RNEMD and AEMD methods offer different insights, and we discuss their benefits and shortcomings. Assessing the potential application of molecular junctions as thermal diodes, alkane junctions are made spatially asymmetric by modifying their contact regions with the bulk, either by using distinct endgroups or by replacing one of the Au contacts with Ag. Anharmonicity is built into the system within the molecular force-field. We find that, while the temperature profile strongly varies (compared with the gold-alkanedithiol-gold junctions) due to these structural modifications, the thermal diode effect is inconsequential in these systems—unless one goes to very large thermal biases. This finding suggests that one should seek molecules with considerable internal anharmonic effects for developing nonlinear thermal devices.},

We study the charge transfer quenching in light harvesting complex II, a protein postulated to control non-photochemical quenching in many plant species. Using our hybrid approach, we find good agreement between our calculation and experimental measurements of the excitation lifetime. Furthermore, our calculations reveal that the exciton energy funnel plays an important role in determining quenching efficiency, a conclusion we expect to extend to other proteins that perform protective excitation quenching. This also highlights the need for simulation methods that properly account for the interplay of exciton dynamics and charge transfer processes.},

  abstract = {One-electron ionization processes X → X i + in orbitally degenerate systems, such as atoms with the open-shell configuration p N , can be divided into two groups. The first group involves the processes that are allowed in photoelectron spectra. The processes of this group in atoms obey the familiar selection rules (SRs) formulated within the Russell–Saunders L , S coupling. All other ionization processes, for which SRs are not obeyed, belong to the second group. Here, we analyze the validity of Koopmans’ theorem (KT) for the processes of the second group forbidden by SRs. We show that the general formulation of KT in the Hartree–Fock method [Plakhutin, J. Chem. Phys. 148 , 094101 (2018)] is implicitly based on the assumption that a X → X i + process is allowed by SRs, and this presents a limitation of KT. To overcome the latter, we develop an extension of KT that enables estimating the energies of SR-forbidden processes. We prove that the variational condition underlying KT gives different results for SR-allowed and SR-forbidden processes. For the former processes, this condition gives the familiar KT relationship I i = − ɛ i , while for SR-forbidden processes, the respective relationship between I i and ɛ i takes a more complex form. The practical applicability of the extension of KT is verified by applying it to the totality of ionization processes in the valence 2 s and 2 p shells of atoms C, N, and O in their ground and excited states, which involves a total of 29 SR-allowed and 34 SR-forbidden processes. For all of these processes, we compare KT estimates of ionization energies (IEs) with the relevant experimental data. For comparison, we also present the respective estimates of IEs derived with a ΔSCF approach. Particular attention is paid to the analysis of the validity of KT in the specific cases of violation of Hund’s rules for cation states.},

The appropriateness of the Gaussian prior on predictive CG property distributions is justified as a function of CG model resolution by examining the statistics of target distributions. The certainties of predictive CG distributions are shown to be limited by CG model resolution with DKL-ECG predictive noise converging to the intrinsic physical noise induced by the CG mapping operator for multiple chemistries. Further analysis of the resolution dependence of learned CG property distributions allows for the identification of CG mapping operators that capture CG degrees of freedom with strong electron–phonon coupling. We further demonstrate the ability to construct the exact quantum chemical valence electronic density of states (EDOS), including behavior in the tails of the EDOS, from an entirely CG model by combining iterative Boltzmann inversion and DKL-ECG. DKL-ECG provides a means of learning CG distributions of all-atom properties that are traditionally “lost” in CG model development, introducing a promising methodological alternative to backmapping algorithms commonly employed to recover all-atom property distributions from CG simulations.},

  abstract = {We highlight the important roles the direct spin–orbit (DSO) coupling, the spin-vibronic (SV) coupling, and the dielectric constant of the medium play on the reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) mechanism of TXO-TPA and TXO-PhCz molecules. To understand this complex phenomenon, we have calculated the RISC rate constant, k RISC , using a time-dependent correlation function-based method within the framework of second-order perturbation theory. Our computed k RISC in two different solvents, toluene and chloroform, suggests that in addition to the DSO, a dielectric medium-dependent SV mechanism may also have a significant impact on the net enhancement of the rate of RISC from the lowest triplet state to the first excited singlet state. Whereas we have found that k RISC of TXO-TPA is mostly determined by the DSO contribution independent of the choice of the solvent, the SV mechanism contributes more than 30\% to the overall k RISC of TXO-PhCz in chloroform. In toluene, however, the SV mechanism is less important for the RISC process of TXO-PhCz. An analysis of mode-specific nonadiabatic coupling (NAC) between T 2 and T 1 of TXO-PhCz and TXO-TPA suggests that the NAC values in certain normal modes of TXO-PhCz are much higher than those of TXO-TPA, and it is more pronounced with chloroform as a solvent. The findings demonstrate the role of the solvent-assisted SV mechanism toward the net RISC rate constant, which in turn maximizes the efficiency of thermally activated delayed fluorescence.},

This variable contains information about the nonlocality of the X hole and we employ it to approximate hybrid functionals, eliminating the sometimes demanding calculation of the exact X energy. The new functional is constructed using machine learning; having identified a physical correlation between T σ and the nonlocality of the X hole, we employ a neural network to express this relation. While we only modify the X functional of the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof functional [Perdew et al. , Phys. Rev. Lett. 77 , 3865 (1996)], a significant improvement over this method is achieved.},

The mathematical expressions for the dynamic structure factor are verified by comparing them with results from Brownian dynamics simulations, reporting an excellent agreement. Then, we generalize the model to linear polymer chains with arbitrary stiffness. In particular, we focus on the case of a linear polymer with stiffness that changes linearly from one end of the chain to the other, and we study the same dynamical functions previously presented. We discuss different approaches to check whether a polymer has constant or heterogeneous stiffness along its contour. Finally, we provide expressions for the Lagrangian multipliers for Gaussian chains with variable stiffness and bond length, as well as for chains with torsion-like interactions. Overall, this work presents a new insight into a well-known model for semiflexible chains and provides tools that can be exploited to explore a much broader class of polymers or compare the predictions of the model with simulations of coarse-grained semiflexible polymers.},

  abstract = {Equilibrium gels of colloidal particles can be realized through the introduction of a second species, a linker that mediates the bonds between colloids. A gel forming binary mixture whose linkers can self-assemble into linear chains while still promoting the aggregation of particles is considered in this work. The particles are patchy particles with f C patches of type C and the linkers are patchy particles with 2 patches of type A and f B patches of type B. The bonds between patches of type A ( AA bonds) promote the formation of linear chains of linkers. Two different ways (model A and model B) of bonding the linkers to the particles—or inducing branching—are studied. In model A, there is a competition between chaining and branching, since the bonding between linkers and particles takes place through AC bonds only. In model B, the linkers aggregate to particles through bonds BC only, making chaining and branching independent. The percolation behavior of these two models is studied in detail, employing a generalized Flory–Stockmayer theory and Monte Carlo simulations. The self-assembly of linkers into chains reduces the fraction of particles needed for percolation to occur (models A and B) and induces percolation when the fraction of particles is high (model B). Percolation by heating and percolation loops in temperature–composition diagrams are obtained when the formation of chains is energetically favorable by increasing the entropic gain of branching (model A). Chaining and branching are found to follow a model dependent relation at percolation, which shows that, for the same composition, longer chains require less branching for percolation to occur.},

For aqueous suspensions in a solvent of large dielectric constant, the traditional Derjaguin–Landau–Vervey–Overbeek (DLVO) theory of linear screening, supplemented with hard core interactions, reproduces the structural correlations obtained in the full primitive model quantitatively. However, for lower dielectric contrast, the increasing Coulomb coupling between the counterions and charged colloids results in strong deviations. We find a fluid–fluid phase separation into two regions either rich in charged or rich in neutral colloids, which is not reproduced by DLVO theory. Our results are verifiable in scattering or real-space experiments on charged-neutral mixtures of colloids or nanoparticles.},

  abstract = {Though jamming transitions are long studied in condensed matter physics and granular systems, much less is known about active jamming (or unjamming), which commonly takes place in living materials. In this paper, we explore, by molecular dynamic simulations, the jamming–unjamming transition in a dense system of active semiflexible filaments. In particular, we characterize the distinct impact of polar vs nematic driving for different filament rigidities and at varying densities. Our results show that high densities of dynamic active filaments can be achieved by only changing the nature of the active force, nematic or polar. Interestingly, while polar driving is more effective at unjamming the system at high densities below confluency, we find that at even higher densities, nematic driving enhances unjamming compared to its polar counterpart. The effect of varying the rigidity of filaments is also significantly different in the two cases: While for nematic driving, lowering the bending rigidity unjams the system, we find an intriguing reentrant jamming–unjamming–jamming transition for polar driving as the filament rigidity is lowered. While the first transition (unjamming) is driven by softening due to reduced rigidity, the second transition (jamming) is a cooperative effect of ordering and coincides with the emergence of nematic order in the system. Together, through a generic model of self-propelled flexible filaments, our results demonstrate how tuning the nature of self-propulsion and flexibility can be employed by active materials to achieve high densities without getting jammed.},

However, it is challenging to derive such kinetic differential equations from transient kinetic data without knowing the reaction network, especially when the data are incomplete due to experimental limitations. We introduce a program, PolyODENet, toward this goal. Based on the machine-learning method Neural ODE, PolyODENet defines a generative model and predicts concentrations at arbitrary time. As such, it is possible to include unmeasurable intermediate species in the kinetic equations. Importantly, we have implemented various measures to apply physical constraints and chemical knowledge in the training to regularize the solution space. Using simple catalytic reaction models, we demonstrate that PolyODENet can predict reaction profiles of unknown species and doing so even reveal hidden parts of reaction mechanisms.},

The experiments were performed under constant background pressures of CO (6 × 10 −8 Torr) and O 2 (3 × 10 −8 Torr). Under these conditions, we detect two transient CO species with narrow 2π* peaks, suggesting little 2π* interaction with the surface. Based on polarization measurements, we find that these two species have opposing orientations: (1) CO favoring a more perpendicular orientation and (2) CO favoring a more parallel orientation with respect to the surface. We also directly detect gas-phase CO 2 using a mass spectrometer and observe weak signatures of bent adsorbed CO 2 at slightly higher x-ray energies than the 2π* region. These results are compared to previously reported TR-XAS results at the O K-edge, where the CO background pressure was three times lower (2 × 10 −8 Torr) while maintaining the same O 2 pressure. At the lower CO pressure, in the CO 2π* region, we observed adsorbed CO and a distribution of OC–O bond lengths close to the CO oxidation transition state, with little indication of gas-like CO. The shift toward “gas-like” CO species may be explained by the higher CO exposure, which blocks O adsorption, decreasing O coverage and increasing CO coverage. These effects decrease the CO desorption barrier through dipole–dipole interaction while simultaneously increasing the CO oxidation barrier.},

However, a prerequisite for the production of such new and single elemental 2D materials is the development of simple and robust fabrication methods. In the present work, we report three different 2D superstructures of Te on Au(111) surfaces by following an alternative experimental deposition approach. We have investigated the superstructures using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), and field emission AES. Three superstructures (13 × 13, 8 × 4, and √11 × √11) of 2D Te are observed in our experiments, and the formation of these superstructures is accompanied by the lifting of the characteristic 23 × √3 surface reconstruction of the Au(111) surface. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy reveals a strong dependence of the local electronic properties on the structural arrangement of the Te atoms on the Au(111) support, and we observe superstructure-dependent electronic resonances around the Fermi level and below the Au(111) conduction band. In addition to the appearance of the new electronic resonances, the emergence of band gaps with a p -type charge character has been evidenced for two out of three Te superstructures (13 × 13 and √11 × √11) on the Au(111) support.},

Herein, we characterize the electron spin magnetic resonance change in the photoluminescence intensity for a tailored organic molecular crystal while sweeping a microwave drive up to 10 GHz in a broadband loop structure. We observe resonant transitions for both triplet and quintet spin sublevel populations showing their optical sensitivity and revealing the zero-field parameters for each. We map the evolution of these spectra in both microwave frequency and magnetic field, producing a pattern of optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) peaks. Fits to these data using a suitable model suggest significant spin polarization in this system with orientation selectivity. Unusual excitation intensity dependence is also observed, which inverts the sign of the ODMR signal for the triplet features, but not for the quintet. These observations demonstrate optical detection of the spin sublevel population dictated by SF and intermolecular geometry, and highlight anisotropic and multi-scale dynamics of triplet pairs.},

  abstract = {Aqueous rutile TiO 2 (110) is the most widely studied water–oxide interface, and yet questions about water dissociation are still controversial. Theoretical studies have systematically investigated the influence of the slab thickness on water dissociation energy (E diss ) at 1 monolayer coverage using static density functional theory calculation and found that E diss exhibits odd–even oscillation with respect to the TiO 2 slab thickness. However, less studies have accounted for the full solvation of an aqueous phase using ab initio molecular dynamics due to high computational costs in which only three, four, and five trilayer models of rutile(110)–water interfaces have been simulated. Here, we report Machine Learning accelerated Molecular Dynamics (MLMD) simulations of defect-free rutile(110)–water interfaces, which allows for a systematic study of the slab thickness ranging from 3 to 17 trilayers with much lower costs while keeping ab initio accuracy. Our MLMD simulations show that the dissociation degree of surface water ( α ) oscillates with the slab thickness and converges to ∼2\% as the TiO 2 slab becomes thicker. Converting α into dissociation free energy (ΔA diss ) and comparing with dissociation total energy E diss calculated with a single monolayer of water, we find that the full solvation of the interfaces suppresses surface water from dissociating. It is interesting to note that the machine learning potential trained from the dataset containing exclusively the five trilayer TiO 2 model exhibits excellent transferability to other slab thicknesses and further captures the oscillating behavior of surface water dissociation. Detailed analyses indicate that the central plane in odd trilayer slabs modulates the interaction between double trilayers and, thus, the bonding strength between terminal Ti and water, which affects pKa of surface water and water dissociation degree.},

These are metastable states with a non-uniform density distribution, having no long-range order. From extensive numerical simulations, we determine the distribution of free energy density values in varying size amorphous systems and also the point-to-set correlation length, which is the radius of the largest volume of amorphous one can take while still having the particle arrangements within the volume determined by the particle ordering at the surface of the chosen volume. We find that in the thermodynamic limit, the free energy density of the amorphous tends toward a value that has a slight dependence on the initial state from which it was formed—i.e., it has a formation history dependence. The amorphous phase is observed to form on both sides of the liquid linear-stability limit, showing that the liquid to amorphous transition is first order, with an associated finite free energy barrier when the liquid is metastable. In our simulations, this is demonstrated when the noise in the initial density distribution is used to induce nucleation events from the metastable liquid. Depending on the strength of the initial noise, we observe a variety of nucleation pathways, in agreement with previous results for the PFC model, which show that amorphous precursor mediated multi-step crystal nucleation can occur in colloidal systems.},

This mean-field view, mathematically described by the Langevin saturation function, predicts enhanced dielectric saturation at lower temperatures. In contrast, recent experiments for glycerol have shown a sharp increase of the NDE with increasing temperature. The formalism presented here splits the NDE into a sum of a term representing binary correlations of dipolar orientations and terms referring to three- and four-particle orientational correlations. Analysis of experimental data shows that the contribution of three- and four-particle correlations strongly increases at elevated temperatures. The mean-field picture of dielectric saturation as the origin of the NDE is inconsistent with observations. A positive NDE (increment of the field-dependent dielectric constant) is predicted for low-concentration solutions of polar molecules in nonpolar solvents. The dependence of the NDE on the concentration of the polar component is polynomial.},

Photoexcitation of gas-phase CS 2 with a 200 nm laser pulse launches oscillatory bending and stretching motion, leading to dissociation of atomic sulfur in under a picosecond. During the first 300 fs following excitation, we observe significant changes in the vibrational frequency as well as some dissociation of the C–S bond, leading to atomic sulfur in the both 1 D and 3 P states. Beyond 1400 fs, the dissociation is consistent with primarily 3 P atomic sulfur dissociation. This channel-resolved measurement of the dissociation time is based on our analysis of the time-windowed dissociation radial velocity distribution, which is measured using the temporal Fourier transform of the TRXS data aided by a Hough transform that extracts the slopes of linear features in an image. The relative strength of the two dissociation channels reflects both their branching ratio and differences in the spread of their dissociation times. Measuring the time-resolved dissociation radial velocity distribution aids the resolution of discrepancies between models for dissociation proposed by prior photoelectron spectroscopy work.},

  abstract = {The quenching of NO A 2 Σ + with O 2 as a collisional partner is important for combustion and atmospheric processes. There is still a lack of theoretical understanding of this event, especially concerning the nature of the different quenching pathways. In this work, we provide potential energy surfaces (PESs) of 20 electronic states of this system. We computed the spin-doublet and spin-quartet PESs using SA-CASSCF and XMS-CASPT2. We find two potential quenching pathways. The first one ( Q 1 ) is a two-step orientation-specific process. The system first undergoes an electron transfer (NO + X 1 Σ + + O 2 − X 2 Π g ⁠ ) at short distances, before crossing to lower neutral states, such as NO X 2 Π + O 2 a 1 Δ g ⁠ , O 2 b 1 Σ g + ⁠ , O 2 X 3 Σ g − ⁠ , or even 2 O( 3 P). The second quenching pathway ( Q 2 ) is less orientation-dependent and should be sudden without requiring the proximity conditioning Q 1 . The Q 2 cross section will be enhanced with increasing initial vibrational level in both O 2 and NO. It is responsible for the production of NO X 2 Π with higher O 2 excited states, such as O 2 c 1 Σ u − ⁠ , A′ 3 Δ u , or A 3 Σ u + ⁠ . Overall, this work provides a first detailed theoretical investigation of the quenching of NO A 2 Σ + by O 2 X 3 Σ g − as well as introduces a weighting scheme generally applicable to multireference, open-shell bimolecular systems. The effect of spin-multiplicity on the different quenching pathways is also discussed.},

  abstract = {The dicarbon radical, C 2 , is one of the most abundant molecules in the universe, and has been widely observed in various energetic environments. Even though numerous experimental and theoretical investigations on C 2 have been done during the last two centuries, spectroscopic study of C 2 in vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) region has been rare. The only three known absorption band systems in VUV region were identified by Herzberg and co-workers in 1969 by VUV spectrograph, namely the electronic transitions F 1 Π u ( v ′)– X 1 Σ g + ( v ″), f 3 Σ g − ( v ′)– a 3 Π u ( v ″) and g 3 Δ g ( v ′)– a 3 Π u ( v ″) (Herzberg-Lagerqvist-Malmberg transitions). In this study, we employ a two-photon resonance-enhanced four-wave mixing based VUV laser source and a time-of-flight mass spectrometer for reinvestigating the above three electronic transitions of C 2 through a resonant (1VUV + 1′UV) photoionization scheme. Besides those vibronic transitions as identified by Herzberg and co-workers, many more absorption bands belonging to the electronic transitions f 3 Σ g − ( v ′)– a 3 Π u ( v ″) and g 3 Δ g ( v ′)– a 3 Π u ( v ″) are observed with their spectroscopic parameters determined. The rather astrophysically important F 1 Π u state is not observed here by the resonant (1VUV + 1′UV) photoionization scheme, which must be due to its fast predissociation process. Instead, our study shows that the vibronic band g 3 Δ g ( v ′ = 2)– a 3 Π u ( v ″ = 0) exactly overlaps with F 1 Π u ( v ′ = 0)– X 1 Σ g + ( v ″ = 0), which was not realized in previous studies. The potential implications of these findings to astronomical observations are discussed.},

To construct potential energy surfaces (PESs) for valence ( A 1, A ′2) and ion-pair ( E , β , and D ′) electronic states of the complex, we utilized the intermolecular diatomic-in-molecule perturbation theory first order method. The experimental and calculated spectroscopic characteristics of the T -shaped ArICl valence and E , β states agree well. The ArICl( D ′) state PES has no vdW levels in the T -shaped configuration, and collinear ArICl( D ′) binding energy is larger than that of the T -shaped ArICl( β ) state. We calculated vibrational state energies and the ArICl(IP → valence states) luminescence excitation spectra, as well as luminescence spectra themselves, by using the Heidelberg MCTDH code. The comparison of the experimental and calculated excitation spectra shows that the latter describe their principal features. The bound–bound ArICl( E ,0, n E → X and β ,0, n β → A ) parts of experimental luminescence spectra are described adequately by the calculated spectra, whereas bound-free ArICl( E ,0, n E → X , D ′, 0, n D ′ → A ′) parts are not described since the bound-free transitions occur in repulsive parts of the ArICl( X , A ′ PESs, which we cannot describe accurately.},

Here, we provide a formalism in terms of a lab frame density matrix, which connects quantum dynamics in the molecular frame to those in the laboratory frame, providing a transparent link between computation and measurement. The formalism reveals that in any such experiment, the molecular frame dynamics vary for molecules in different orientations and that certain coherences, which are potentially experimentally accessible, are rejected by the orientation-averaged reduced vibronic density matrix. Instead, molecular angular distribution moments are introduced as a more accurate representation of experimentally accessible information. Furthermore, the formalism provides a clear definition of a molecular frame quantum tomography and specifies the requirements to perform such a measurement enabling the experimental imaging of molecular frame vibronic dynamics. Successful completion of such a measurement fully characterizes the molecular frame quantum dynamics for a molecule at any orientation in the laboratory frame.},

Recently, the development of ultrafast hybrid fs/ps CARS has enabled the exploitation of coherence beating between neighboring spectral lines to simultaneously measure rotational and vibrational temperatures from a single pure rotational spectrum. However, the influence of non-Boltzmann vibrational state distributions and limitations due to collisional dephasing at pressures greater than 1 atm remains unclear. In this work, we use spectral simulations to investigate the effects of non-Boltzmann vibrational state distributions and the applicability of coherence beating at pressures up to 10 atm. We show that short probe pulses can be leveraged to quantify non-Boltzmann vibrational state distributions of N 2 . Furthermore, we demonstrate that fs/ps CARS coherence beating can simultaneously provide sensitive measurements of rotational and vibrational temperatures of both O 2 and N 2 in air. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to qualitatively explain the accuracy and precision comparisons between probe delays.},

  abstract = {Four-component relativistic treatments of the electron paramagnetic resonance g-tensor have so far been based on a common gauge origin and a restricted kinetically balanced basis. The results of such calculations are prone to exhibit a dependence on the choice of the gauge origin for the vector potential associated with uniform magnetic field and a related dependence on the basis set quality. In this work, this gauge problem is addressed by a distributed-origin scheme based on the London atomic orbitals, also called gauge-including atomic orbitals (GIAOs), which have proven to be a practical approach for calculations of other magnetic properties. Furthermore, in the four-component relativistic domain, it has previously been shown that a restricted magnetically balanced (RMB) basis for the small component of the four-component wavefunctions is necessary for achieving robust convergence with regard to the basis set size. We present the implementation of a four-component density functional theory (DFT) method for calculating the g-tensor, incorporating both the GIAOs and RMB basis and based on the Dirac–Coulomb Hamiltonian. The approach utilizes the state-of-the-art noncollinear Kramers-unrestricted DFT methodology to achieve rotationally invariant results and inclusion of spin-polarization effects in the calculation. We also show that the gauge dependence of the results obtained is connected to the nonvanishing integral of the current density in a finite basis, explain why the results of cluster calculations exhibit surprisingly low gauge dependence, and demonstrate that the gauge problem disappears for systems with certain point-group symmetries.},

Pairs of states are considered to be in resonance if the magnitude of expansion coefficients in the corrections to the wave functions in the non-degenerate perturbation theory calculation is greater than a specified threshold, χ max . This approach is applied to calculations of the vibrational spectra of CH 4 , H 2 CO, HNO 3 , and cc-HOONO. The question of how the identified resonances depend on the value of χ max and how the choice of the resonance spaces affects the calculated vibrational spectrum is further explored for H 2 CO.

This may be due to intrinsic conformational changes (e.g., denaturation bubble formation in double stranded DNA or helix–coil transition in polypeptides) or the reversible adsorption and desorption of molecules from the polymer’s environment (e.g., DNA–protein interactions or hybridization of oligonucleotides). In this article, we analyze the tensile elasticity of a strongly stretched wormlike chain, which consists of N concatenated segments, where each segment can be in one of two states, A or B, which differ in bending stiffness. We call this model the reversible wormlike chain (rWLC) model. In the Gibbs (fixed-force, isotensional) ensemble, we obtain analytic expressions for the force–extension relation and the mean fraction of B segments. We show that, under certain conditions, there is a tension-induced crossover from a mostly A to a mostly B rWLC. In the Helmholtz (fixed-extension, isometric) ensemble, we obtain analytic expressions up to a summation. We show that, for finite N , there is marked ensemble inequivalence. Remarkably, in the Helmholtz ensemble, the rWLC can exhibit negative extensibility and multiple peaks.},

  abstract = {While the rigorous time-independent close-coupling approach is ideally suited for cold and ultracold rovibrationally inelastic collision, its application beyond atom–diatom systems in full dimensionality is numerically expensive. Coupled-states (CS) approximation and its extensions are good choices to reduce the computational cost and have been successfully applied to diatom–diatom systems. In this work, we introduce the extended CS (ECS) approximation, in which one or a few nearest Coriolis coupled helicity channels are included. Its usefulness in atom–triatom systems is demonstrated for scattering of H 2 O with rare gas atoms. The results show that the ECS approximation, even when only the nearest neighbors are included, is generally much better than the CS approximation in describing scattering. At low collision energies, the ECS gradually converges to the exact results with the increasing number of Coriolis coupled helicity blocks. We further discuss three major factors that may lead to the failure of the CS approximation, namely, the reduced mass, collision energy, and triatomic rotational quantum number. It is illustrated that these factors could impact the relative importance of off-diagonal matrix elements in the Hamiltonian, thus influencing the coupling between different helicity channels.},

Using these analytic energy derivatives, one can efficiently compute the harmonic vibrational frequencies, infrared (IR) and Raman scattering (RS) spectra of the molecule in the proximity of noble metal clusters/nanoparticles. The validity and accuracy of these analytic implementations are demonstrated by the comparison of results obtained by the finite-difference method and the analytic approaches and by the full QM and QM/DIM calculations. The complexes formed by pyridine and two sizes of gold clusters (Au 18 and Au 32 ) at varying intersystem distances of 3, 4, and 5 Å are used as the test systems, and Raman spectra of 4,4′-bipyridine in the proximity of Au 2057 and Ag 2057 metal nanoparticles (MNP) are calculated by the QM/DIM method and compared with experimental results as well. We find that the QM/DIM model can well reproduce the IR spectra obtained from full QM calculations for all the configurations, while although it properly enhances some of the vibrational modes, it artificially overestimates RS spectral intensities of several modes for the systems with very short intersystem distance. We show that this could be improved, however, by incorporating the hyperpolarizability of the gold metal cluster in the evaluation of RS intensities. Additionally, we address the potential impact of charge migration between the adsorbate and MNPs.},

Without the need for derivatives of the electron density, this allows us to cover entire chemical neighborhoods from just one quantum calculation instead of single systems one by one. Numerical evidence presented indicates that predictive accuracy is achieved in the range of mHa for the harmonic oscillator or the Morse potential and in the range of machine accuracy for hydrogen-like atoms.

  abstract = {An analytical implementation of static dipole polarizabilities within the generalized Kohn–Sham semicanonical projected random phase approximation (GKS-spRPA) method for spin-restricted closed-shell and spin-unrestricted open-shell references is presented. General second-order analytical derivatives of the GKS-spRPA energy functional are derived using a Lagrangian approach. By resolution-of-the-identity and complex frequency integration methods, an asymptotic O ( N 4 ⁡ log ( N ) ) scaling of operation count and O ( N 3 ) scaling of storage is realized, i.e., the computational requirements are comparable to those for GKS-spRPA ground state energies. GKS-spRPA polarizabilities are assessed for small molecules, conjugated long-chain hydrocarbons, metallocenes, and metal clusters, by comparison against Hartree–Fock (HF), semilocal density functional approximations (DFAs), second-order Møller–Plesset perturbation theory, range-separated hybrids, and experimental data. For conjugated polydiacetylene and polybutatriene oligomers, GKS-spRPA effectively addresses the “overpolarization” problem of semilocal DFAs and the somewhat erratic behavior of post-PBE RPA polarizabilities without empirical adjustments. The ensemble averaged GKS-spRPA polarizabilities of sodium clusters (Na n for n = 2, 3, …, 10) exhibit a mean absolute deviation comparable to PBE with significantly fewer outliers than HF. In conclusion, analytical second-order derivatives of GKS-spRPA energies provide a computationally viable and consistent approach to molecular polarizabilities, including systems prohibitive for other methods due to their size and/or electronic structure.},

As a special case, this implementation also includes Hartree–Fock srDFT (HF-srDFT). Choosing a complete-active space (CAS) wave function as the multiconfigurational parameterization of the wave function, we investigate how well CAS-srDFT reproduces experimental trends of nuclear shielding constants compared to DFT and complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF). Calculations on the nucleobases adenine and thymine show that CAS-srDFT performs on average the best of the tested methods, much better than CASSCF but only marginally better than HF-srDFT. The performance, compared to regular DFT, is similar when functionals containing exact exchange are used. We generally find that the inclusion of exact exchange is important for an accurate description of the shielding constants. In cases where no exact exchange is included, we observe that the HF- and CAS-srDFT often outperform regular DFT. For calculations on transition metal nuclei in organometallic compounds with significant static correlation, the CAS-srDFT method again outperforms CASSCF compared to experimental shielding constants, and the change from HF-srDFT is substantial. In conclusion, the static correlation posed by the metal complexes seems to be captured by CAS-srDFT, which is promising since this type of correlation is not well described by regular DFT.},

  abstract = {We present a means of studying rare reactive pathways in open quantum systems using transition path theory and ensembles of quantum jump trajectories. This approach allows for the elucidation of reactive paths for dissipative, nonadiabatic dynamics when the system is embedded in a Markovian environment. We detail the dominant pathways and rates of thermally activated processes and the relaxation pathways and photoyields following vertical excitation in a minimal model of a conical intersection. We find that the geometry of the conical intersection affects the electronic character of the transition state as defined through a generalization of a committor function for a thermal barrier crossing event. Similarly, the geometry changes the mechanism of relaxation following a vertical excitation. Relaxation in models resulting from small diabatic coupling proceeds through pathways dominated by pure dephasing, while those with large diabatic coupling proceed through pathways limited by dissipation. The perspective introduced here for the nonadiabatic dynamics of open quantum systems generalizes classical notions of reactive paths to fundamentally quantum mechanical processes.},

Most of the recent efforts applying neural networks to ab initio calculation have been focusing on the energy of the system. In this study, we take a step forward and look at the interatomic force obtained with neural network wavefunction methods by implementing and testing several commonly used force estimators in variational quantum Monte Carlo (VMC). Our results show that neural network ansatz can improve the calculation of interatomic force upon traditional VMC. The relationship between the force error and the quality of the neural network, the contribution of different force terms, and the computational cost of each term is also discussed to provide guidelines for future applications. Our work demonstrates that it is promising to apply neural network wavefunction methods in simulating structures/dynamics of molecules/materials and provide training data for developing accurate force fields.},

The method, termed DFT/MRCI(2), results from the application of quasi-degenerate perturbation theory (QDPT) and the Epstein–Nesbet partitioning to the DFT/MRCI Hamiltonian matrix. The application of QDPT obviates the need to diagonalize the large DFT/MRCI Hamiltonian; electronic energies are instead obtained as the eigenvalues of a small effective Hamiltonian, affording an orders of magnitude savings in the computational cost. Most importantly, the DFT/MRCI(2) approximation is found to be of excellent accuracy, furnishing excitation energies with a root mean squared deviation from the canonical DFT/MRCI values of less than 0.03 eV for an extensive test set of organic molecules.},

Similar to Brownian machines, these systems work by turning random inelastic tunneling events into a directional rotation of the molecule. Despite their importance as the ultimate component of future molecular machines, their modeling has not been sufficiently studied. Here, we develop a dynamical model to describe these systems. We illustrate the validity and usefulness of our model by applying it to a well-known molecular motor, showing that the obtained results are consistent with the available experimental data. Moreover, we demonstrate how to use our model to extract some difficult-to-access microscopic parameters. Finally, we include an analysis of the expected effects of current-induced forces (CIFs). Our analysis suggests that, although nonconservative contributions of the CIFs can be important in some scenarios, they do not seem important in the analyzed case. Despite this, the conservative contributions of CIFs could be strong enough to significantly alter the system’s dynamics.},

  abstract = {We report the implementation of effective quantum electrodynamics (QED) potentials for all-electron four-component relativistic molecular calculations using the DIRAC code. The potentials are also available for two-component calculations, being properly picture-change transformed. The latter point is important; we demonstrate through atomic calculations that picture-change errors are sizable. Specifically, we have implemented the Uehling potential [E. A. Uehling, Phys. Rev. 48 , 55 (1935)] for vacuum polarization and two effective potentials [P. Pyykkö and L.-B. Zhao, J. Phys. B: At., Mol. Opt. Phys. 36 , 1469 (2003) and V. V. Flambaum and J. S. M. Ginges, Phys. Rev. A 72 , 052115 (2005)] for electron self-energy. We provide extensive theoretical background for these potentials, hopefully reaching an audience beyond QED specialists. We report the following sample applications: (i) We first confirm the conjecture of P. Pyykkö that QED effects are observable for the AuCN molecule by directly calculating ground-state rotational constants B 0 of the three isotopomers studied by microwave spectroscopy; QED brings the corresponding substitution Au–C bond length r s from 0.23 to 0.04 pm agreement with experiment. (ii) In regard to spectroscopic constants of van der Waals dimers M 2 (M = Hg, Rn, Cn, Og), QED induces bond length expansions on the order of 0.15(0.30) pm for row 6(7) dimers. (iii) We confirm that there is a significant change of valence s population of Pb in the reaction PbH 4 → PbH 2 + H 2 , which is thereby a good candidate for observing QED effects in chemical reactions, as proposed in [K. G. Dyall et al. , Chem. Phys. Lett. 348 , 497 (2001)]. We also find that whereas in PbH 4 the valence 6 s 1/2 population resides in bonding orbitals, it is mainly found in nonbonding orbitals in PbH 2 . QED contributes 0.32 kcal/mol to the reaction energy, thereby reducing its magnitude by −1.27\%. For corresponding hydrides of superheavy flerovium, the electronic structures are quite similar. Interestingly, the QED contribution to the reaction energy is of quite similar magnitude (0.35 kcal/mol), whereas the relative change is significantly smaller (−0.50\%). This curious observation can be explained by the faster increase in negative vacuum polarization over positive electron self-energy contributions as a function of nuclear charge.},

  abstract = {Cavity quantum electrodynamics has been studied as a potential approach to modify free charge carrier generation in donor–acceptor heterojunctions because of the delocalization and controllable energy level properties of hybridized light–matter states known as polaritons. However, in many experimental systems, cavity coupling decreases charge separation. Here, we theoretically study the quantum dynamics of a coherent and dissipative donor–acceptor cavity system, to investigate the dynamical mechanism and further discover the conditions under which polaritons may enhance free charge carrier generation. We use open quantum system methods based on single-pulse pumping to find that polaritons have the potential to connect excitonic states and charge separated states, further enhancing free charge generation on an ultrafast timescale of several hundred femtoseconds. The mechanism involves polaritons with optimal energy levels that allow the exciton to overcome the high Coulomb barrier induced by electron–hole attraction. Moreover, we propose that a second-hybridization between a polariton state and dark states with similar energy enables the formation of the hybrid charge separated states that are optically active. These two mechanisms lead to a maximum of 50\% enhancement of free charge carrier generation on a short timescale. However, our simulation reveals that on the longer timescale of picoseconds, internal conversion and cavity loss dominate and suppress free charge carrier generation, reproducing the experimental results. Thus, our work shows that polaritons can affect the charge separation mechanism and promote free charge carrier generation efficiency, but predominantly on a short timescale after photoexcitation.},

The surface hopping scheme was used for nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations. According to our results for an all trans -ABPT SAM, the excitation energy transfer between different chromophores, very fast in the ππ ∗ manifold, does not occur between nπ ∗ states. As a consequence, the excitation transfer does not play an important role in the quenching of the azobenzene photoisomerization in the SAM (experimentally observed and reproduced by our calculations) which, instead, has to be attributed to steric effects.},

Our exact treatment of wormlike chain statistics permits the evaluation of behavior from the nematic state, thus accurately capturing the impact of single-chain behavior on collective elastic response. Results for the Frank elastic constants are presented as a function of aligning field strength and chain length, and we explore the impact of conformation fluctuations and hairpin defects on the twist, splay, and bend moduli. Our results indicate that the twist elastic constant K twist is smaller than both bend and splay constants ( K bend and K splay , respectively) for the entire range of polymer rigidity. Splay and bend elastic constants exhibit regimes of dominance over the range of chain stiffness, where K splay &gt; K bend for flexible polymers (large- N limit) while the opposite is true for rigid polymers. Theoretical analysis also suggests the splay modulus tracks exactly to that of the end-to-end distance in the transverse direction for semiflexible polymers at intermediate to large- N .

In our investigation, we identify key factors governing cluster formation of branched amphiphilic polymers and provide guidance for designing and preparing various types of polymer clusters for applications, e.g., in drug delivery or materials science. We observe different kinds of clustering in the polymer systems. Our star polymers consist of several arms of hydrophilic core particles with hydrophobic particles attached to the end of each star arm. We observe that amphiphilic star polymers generally tend to form spherical complexes. In contrast to this, bottle-brush polymers exhibit a larger variety of complex structures. With large grafting density and large side arms, we also observe spherical polymer clusters; however, for low grafting density and shorter side chains, distinct clusters connected by bridging particles are formed. Furthermore, we observe membrane-like clustering of bottle-brush polymers. We employ two different clustering algorithms for further analysis of the obtained structures with respect to shape factors, pair correlation functions, and radii of gyration. We find that the hydrophobic parts of polymers play a crucial role in the formation of the resulting structures during self-assembly. The hydrophilic core parts in star polymers along with steric hindrance lead to a screening effect for the hydrophobic parts of the polymers. With bottle-brush copolymers, the hydrophilic parts of the polymers exhibit a screening effect that is sensitive to the grafting density and side chain lengths along the backbone.},

These complex assemblies form and dissolve spontaneously over time via liquid–liquid phase separation of IDPs. Mutations in their amino acid sequence can alter their phase behavior, which has been linked to the emergence of severe diseases. We study the conformation and phase behavior of a low-complexity domain of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNPA1) using coarse-grained implicit solvent molecular dynamics simulations. We systematically analyze how these properties are affected by the number of aromatic residues within the examined sequences. We find a significant compaction of the chains and an increase in the critical temperature with an increasing number of aromatic residues. The local persistence length is determined in single-chain simulations, revealing strong sequence-specific variations along the chain contour. Comparing single-chain and condensed-state simulations, we find many more collapsed polymer conformations in the dilute systems, even at temperatures near the estimated θ -temperature of the solution. These observations strongly support the hypothesis that aromatic residues play a dominant role in condensation, which is further corroborated by a detailed analysis of the intermolecular contacts, and conversely that important properties of condensates are captured in coarse-grained simulations. Interestingly, we observe density inhomogeneities within the condensates near criticality, which are driven by electrostatic interactions. Finally, we find that the relatively small fraction of hydrophobic residues in the IDPs results in interfacial tensions, which are significantly lower compared to typical combinations of immiscible simple liquids.},

  abstract = {Lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) are negatively charged molecules covering the surface of Gram-negative bacteria (GNB). Adding divalent cations (DCs) is important to stabilize the LPS bilayer. Thus, DCs are always only considered as membrane stabilizing ions. Here, on the basis of a coarse-grained (CG) Martini force field, we conduct molecular dynamic (MD) simulations to study the divalent cation mediated LPS interaction and the stability of the LPS membrane in a wide range of DC concentrations. By measuring the LPS binding free energy and the LPS–LPS aggregate from the association course between two LPS molecules, we find that the initial addition of DCs may significantly facilitate the aggregation of LPSs into a compact structure, while sequentially adding more DCs only unpacks the LPS aggregate and drives the dissolution of LPSs. With an increasing concentration of DCs, we find a gradual replacement of DCs to monovalent cations as condensed counterions on the LPS, which follows a sign change from negative to positive in terms of the LPS effective charge and a switch of LPSs in solution from undergoing precipitation to resolubilization on adding DCs. This interaction change in the level of two LPSs accounts for the structure variation of the LPS assembly on a larger scale, where the LPS packing rigidity in the assembly bilayer is found with a similar nonmonotonic dependence with the DC concentration. Thus, our results demonstrate for the first time the presence of a re-entrant condensation behavior for LPS molecules, which can be exploited for developing novel membrane-perturbing agents based on multivalent ions as efficient GNB antibiotics.},

  abstract = {Polymer crystallization is a long-standing interesting problem both in fundamental polymer physics and in polymer manufacturing. Fundamentally, the connectivity of the macromolecules provides a unique feature for the study of nucleation and growth of crystals in contrast to the crystallization of smaller molecules. In addition, understanding the crystallization in polymers is industrially important due to the necessity of its control to achieve mechanically durable plastic materials. Molecular dynamics simulations offer a suitable way of studying this phenomenon due to their capability to probe the small time and length scales that are characteristic of nucleation. In this paper, we use a long alkane chain model to study nucleation and the growth of polyethylene crystals both within bulk and nano-droplets whose diameters range from about 6 to 11 nm. It is found that the droplets approach being more spherical during the nucleation whereas they deviate from this shape during the growth regime. Strikingly, a mean first passage time analysis indicates that the nucleation rate per unit volume decreases as the droplet size is increased. Finally, visual inspection of the simulation snapshots suggests that nuclei majorly emerged from the surface of the droplets.},

  abstract = {Materials that exhibit plasmonic response in the UV region can be advantageous for many applications, such as biological photodegradation, photocatalysis, disinfection, and bioimaging. Transition metal nitrides have recently emerged as chemically and thermally stable alternatives to metal-based plasmonic materials. However, most free-standing nitride nanostructures explored so far have plasmonic responses in the visible and near-IR regions. Herein, we report the synthesis of UV-plasmonic Cr 2 N nanoparticles using a solid-state nitridation reaction. The nanoparticles had an average diameter of 9 ± 5 nm and a positively charged surface that yields stable colloidal suspension. The particles were composed of a crystalline nitride core and an amorphous oxide/oxynitride shell whose thickness varied between 1 and 7 nm. Calculations performed using the finite element method predicted the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) for these nanoparticles to be in the UV-C region (100–280 nm). While a distinctive LSPR peak could not be observed using absorbance measurements, low-loss electron energy loss spectroscopy showed the presence of surface plasmons between 80 and 250 nm (or ∼5 to 15 eV) and bulk plasmons centered around 50–62 nm (or ∼20 to 25 eV). Plasmonic coupling was also observed between the nanoparticles, resulting in resonances between 250 and 400 nm (or ∼2.5 to 5 eV).},

  abstract = {A molecular level understanding of the aqueous Mg corrosion mechanism will be essential in developing improved alloys for battery electrodes, automobile parts, and biomedical implants. The structure and reactivity of the hydroxylated surface is expected to be key to the overall mechanism because (i) it is predicted to be the metastable surface state (rather than the bare surface) under a range of conditions and (ii) it provides a reasonable model for the outer corrosion film/water interface. We investigate the structure, interactions, and reactivity at the hydroxylated Mg(0001)/water interface using a combination of static Density Functional Theory calculations and second-generation Car–Parrinello ab initio molecular dynamics. We carry out detailed structural analyses into, among other properties, near-surface water orientations, favored adsorption sites, and near-surface hydrogen bonding behavior. Despite the short timescale (tens of ps) of our molecular dynamics run, we observe a cathodic water splitting event; the rapid timescale for this reaction is explained in terms of near-surface water structuring lowering the reaction barrier. Furthermore, we observe oxidation of an Mg surface atom to effectively generate a univalent Mg species (Mg + ). Results are discussed in the context of understanding the Mg corrosion mechanism: For example, our results provide an explanation for the catalytic nature of the Mg corrosion film toward water splitting and a feasible mechanism for the generation of the univalent Mg species often proposed as a key intermediate.},

  abstract = {Within the extended Capillary Wave Theory (ECWT), to extract the bending modulus of a liquid surface from the total structure factor of the interfacial region requires to separate the capillary waves (CW) signal from a non-CW background. Some years ago, Höfling and Dietrich (HD), working in the strict grazing incidence limit q z = 0, proposed a background that combines the liquid and vapor bulk structure factors in the amounts set by Gibbs’s plane. We contrast that proposal with Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations of the Lennard-Jones model analyzed with the Intrinsic Sampling Method (ISM). The study is extended to q z ≠ 0, to test the stronger consistency requirements of the ECWT and the experimental conditions; it shows a good MD-ECWT matching although we need some fine tuning over HD proposal. Then, the agreement with the ISM result for the surface bending modulus is good and that provides an interpretation, in terms of the molecular layering at the liquid edge, for the fluctuating surface represented by the CW signal in the surface structure factor, both for MD simulations and surface diffraction experiments.},

The aqueous TBAB phase, at concentrations similar to the solid semiclathrate hydrate (1:38 mol ratio), has a smaller interfacial tension and an increase in the gas molecules adsorbed at the interface compared to that in pure water. Both these factors may contribute to facilitating the uptake of the gases into the solid phase during the process of semiclathrate hydrate formation. At similar gas pressures, CO 2 is adsorbed preferentially compared to CH 4 , giving it a higher surface density, due to the stronger intermolecular interactions of CO 2 molecules of the solution at the interface. The increase in relative adsorption of CH 4 at the solution surface compared to that in pure water surface is due to the hydrophobic interactions between the n-alkyl chains of the TBA + cation and methane gas.},

Many questions concerning the free energy spectrum of these states, including the existence of the equilibrium transition, if any, their accessibility in the experiments, and internal relaxation dynamics toward the global energy minimum, still remain poorly addressed. By using a serially connected pore model with the statistical disorder as a minimal model of the pore networks, we explore the system free energies along the solid–liquid and liquid–gas transitions in the pore systems. The rigorous results obtained with this model shed light on the occurrence and nature of the equilibrium transition line in porous solids with arbitrary pore topology. We discuss further the free energies along the experimentally measured boundary and scanning transitions and how close the equilibrium states can be approached in these experiments.},

Compared with the corresponding values in the hydrodynamic limit, the sound velocity in the nm −1 regime was faster, and the positive dispersion of the longitudinal modulus was stronger in liquids composed of ring structures (cyclohexane and 1,4-dioxane) than in those of linear chain structures ( n -hexane and ethylene glycol dimethyl ether). Molecular dynamics simulation of n -hexane and cyclohexane was also performed. The difference in the positive dispersion of the longitudinal modulus was reproduced by simulation, and it was elucidated by the difference in the longitudinal modulus in the q = 0 limit and the THz frequency regime. The excess part of the longitudinal modulus from the hydrodynamic limit was further divided into various contributions, and the smaller excess modulus of n -hexane was mainly ascribed to two reasons. The first one is that the shear modulus of n -hexane is smaller in the THz regime, and the second one is that the positive dispersion of the bulk modulus due to the vibrational energy relaxation is weaker. The second mechanism was further interpreted in terms of the fast vibrational energy relaxation of intramolecular modes associated with the chain deformation of n -hexane.},

  abstract = {The assembly of colloidal cubic diamond is a challenging process since the shape and interaction parameters and the thermodynamic conditions where this structure is stable are elusive. The simultaneous use of shape-anisotropic particles and strong directional interactions has proven to be a successful path to exclusively nucleate this structure. Here, using molecular dynamics simulations, we explore in detail the conditions where the nucleation of cubic diamond from tetrahedral building blocks is favored. In particular, we focus on the effect of depletion and DNA-mediated interactions to form and stabilize this cubic diamond crystal. We find that a particular balance between the strength and the range of the depletion interactions enhances the self-assembly of stable cubic diamond, leading to a narrow region where this structure is nucleated. Moreover, we determine that stronger short-range depletion attractions may arrest the system, leading to the formation of percolating diamond networks or fully disordered gel structures. Accordingly, the internal arrangements of these structures exhibit a distinct variation in terms of fractal dimension and the presence of six-membered rings that increasingly acquire internal strain as the arrest gets more pronounced. With these results, we provide a clear route for the self-assembly of cubic colloidal diamond, toward the realization of crystals with superior photonic properties.},

Obvious isomer effects are revealed by comparing the relative branching ratios of different channels of the two isomers.

  abstract = {Phenol-benzimidazole and phenol-pyridine dyad complexes have served as popular model systems for the study of proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) kinetics in solution-phase experiments. Interpretation of measured PCET rates in terms of key structural parameters, such as the H-bond donor–acceptor distance, however, remains challenging. Herein, we report vibrational spectra in the electronic ground state for a series of phenol-benzimidazole and phenol-pyridine complexes isolated and cryogenically cooled in an ion trap. The four models studied each display highly red-shifted and broadened OH stretching transitions that arise from strong H-bonding interactions between the phenol OH group and the basic N site on benzimidazole/pyridine rings. The OH stretch transition in each model displays relatively strong absorption onsets near 2500 cm −1 with broad shoulders that extend asymmetrically to higher frequencies over hundreds of wavenumbers. In contrast, the deuterated isotopologues yield much weaker OD stretch transitions that appear symmetrically broadened. The spectral breadth and shape of the OD stretch transitions are ascribed to variations in OD stretch frequencies that arise from zero-point distributions in the proton donor–acceptor low-frequency soft mode vibration. The asymmetric structure of the OH stretch transitions is attributed to a set of combination bands between the OH stretch and a series of low-frequency H-bond soft modes. The spectra and modeling highlight the importance of OH stretch-soft mode couplings, which are thought to play important roles in PCET and proton transfer dynamics.},

  abstract = {A new vacuum ultraviolet absorption (VUV) spectrum of azulene vapor has been obtained by using a synchrotron radiation source. The onset of the ultraviolet spectrum, previously reported by Sidman et al. , has been analyzed in detail by Franck–Condon (FC) and Herzberg–Teller (HT) methods. The photoelectron spectral profile identifies the 3px-Rydberg state 0 0 band to be 131 cm −1 from the VUV maximum. Excited state energy levels were calculated by three independent methods: the wide scan VUV spectrum was correlated with symmetry adapted cluster configuration interaction calculations. The low energy portion of the spectrum was studied by both time dependent density functional theoretical methods (TDDFT) and multi-reference multi-root CI (MRD-CI). Equilibrium structures were determined for valence states at the TDDFT level. Rydberg states were determined by both TDDFT and MRD-CI. The FC + HT analyses were performed on the TDDFT wave-functions. The HT intensity profiles are generally low in intensity, relative to the FC ones; however, HT is dominant in the second singlet state (S 2 , 1 1 A 1 ). As a result, numerous non-symmetric modes, their overtones, and combination bands show considerable intensity in that band. Energies obtained from use of extremely diffuse s-, p-, d-, or f-character functions enabled realistic extrapolation to the IE 1 for many Rydberg states (RS). The lowest RS (3b 1 3s) based on IE 2 lies at 4.804 eV with a quantum defect of 0.714. Differentiation between valence and RS is readily made using the second moments of the charge distribution.},

  abstract = {The alteration of the valence molecular orbitals’ ordering of halopyridine molecules, by the introduction of a halogen atom(s) as substituent on the pyridine ring, has spurred an extensive interest for their investigation. Herein, the effect of a fluorine substituent on the two outermost orbitals of pyridine was elucidated by investigating the photoionization dynamics of 2-fluoropyridine (2-FP), considering that the geometrical changes with respect to the neutral geometry induced by adiabatic ionic transition affect the vacuum ultraviolet mass-analyzed threshold ionization (VUV-MATI) spectrum. The adiabatic ionization energy associated with the 0-0 band on the measured high-resolution VUV-MATI spectrum was determined to be 9.6702 ± 0.0004 eV (77 995 ± 3 cm −1 ), which differs considerably from the 9.401 eV by two-color ionization spectroscopy. Franck–Condon simulation of the MATI spectrum corresponded quantitatively with the experimental results. Interestingly, among the forbidden transitions under C S symmetry, an out-of-plane ring-bending mode resulting from the warped cationic structure of 2-FP with C 1 symmetry was discovered. Rigorously, among the unassigned peaks, the first prominent peak at 78 532 cm −1 should rather be assigned as the origin of the excited electronic state (D 1 ) of the 2-FP cation, in accordance with time-dependent density functional theory calculations. Natural bond orbital analysis led to the conclusion that such observations could be induced by electron removal from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) consisting of the π orbital of the pyridine ring and lone-pair orbital of the fluorine atom or from the HOMO-1 of the molecular non-bonding orbitals, to generate the two proximate electronic states of the cation.},

  abstract = {Pyrene fluorescence after a high-energy electronic excitation exhibits a prominent band shoulder not present after excitation at low energies. The standard assignment of this shoulder as a non-Kasha emission from the second-excited state (S 2 ) has been recently questioned. To elucidate this issue, we simulated the fluorescence of pyrene using two different theoretical approaches based on vertical convolution and nonadiabatic dynamics with nuclear ensembles. To conduct the necessary nonadiabatic dynamics simulations with high-lying electronic states and deal with fluorescence timescales of about 100 ns of this large molecule, we developed new computational protocols. The results from both approaches confirm that the band shoulder is, in fact, due to S 2 emission. We show that the non-Kasha behavior is a dynamic-equilibrium effect not caused by a metastable S 2 minimum. However, it requires considerable vibrational energy, which can only be achieved in collisionless regimes after transitions into highly excited states. This strict condition explains why the S 2 emission was not observed in some experiments.},

The rate constants were determined in the orders of magnitude of 10 −16 –10 −18 cm 3 molecule −1 s −1 , which significantly breaks the detection limit of predecessors that the reactivity of metal-oxyl radicals (M n + –O ⋅− ) with rate constants higher than 10 −14 cm 3 molecule −1 s −1 could usually be measured.

The low-energy elastic integral, differential, and momentum transfer cross sections were calculated with the Schwinger multichannel method implemented with pseudopotentials, in the static-exchange and static-exchange plus polarization levels of approximation, for energies up to 30 eV. The integral cross section calculated for low-energy electron scattering with the R-matrix method within the static-exchange and static-exchange plus polarization approximations for energies up to 15 eV are also reported. By the inspection of the cross sections, the presence of resonances is discussed. In particular, the calculated integral cross sections and the measured total cross section display a minimum at around 1 eV, which is consistent with the presence of a Ramsauer–Townsend minimum and a sharp increase at low energies, which is consistent with the presence of a virtual state. Additionally, interactions in elastic and ionization channels for intermediate collision energies were investigated with the additivity rule and the binary-encounter-Bethe methods.},

These parameters condense the spectroscopic characteristics of a molecule and, thus, are a valuable resource in terms of presenting and communicating spectroscopic observations. While spectroscopic parameters are obtained from experimental spectra by fitting an effective rovibrational Hamiltonian to transition frequencies, the ab initio calculation of these parameters is usually done within vibrational perturbation theory. In the present work, we investigate an approach related to the experimental fitting procedure, but relying solely on ab initio data obtained from variational calculations, i.e., we perform a nonlinear least squares fit of Watson’s A- and S-reduced rotation–vibration Hamiltonian to rovibrational state energies (resp. transition frequencies) from rotational–vibrational configuration interaction calculations. We include up to sextic centrifugal distortion constants. By relying on an educated guess of spectroscopic parameters from vibrational configuration interaction and vibrational perturbation theory, the fitting procedure is very efficient. We observe excellent agreement with experimentally derived parameters.},

Intuition suggests that the HF kinetic energy should not exceed the exact kinetic energy; but no proof of this conjecture exists, despite a near century of development. Beginning from a generalized virial theorem derived from scaling considerations, we derive a general expression for the kinetic energy difference that applies to all systems. For any atom or ion, this trivially reduces to the well-known result that the total energy is the negative of the kinetic energy and, since correlation energies are never positive, proves the conjecture in this case. Similar considerations apply to molecules at their equilibrium bond lengths. We use highly precise calculations on Hooke’s atom (two electrons in a parabolic well) to test the conjecture in a nontrivial case and to parameterize the difference between density functional and HF quantities, but find no violations of the conjecture.},

  abstract = {Glutaredoxins are small enzymes that catalyze the oxidation and reduction of protein disulfide bonds by the thiol–disulfide exchange mechanism. They have either one or two cysteines in their active site, resulting in different catalytic reaction cycles that have been investigated in many experimental studies. However, the exact mechanisms are not yet fully known, and to our knowledge, no theoretical studies have been performed to elucidate the underlying mechanism. In this study, we investigated a proposed mechanism for the reduction of the disulfide bond in the protein HMA4n by a mutated monothiol Homo sapiens glutaredoxin and the co-substrate glutathione. The catalytic cycle involves three successive thiol–disulfide exchanges that occur between the molecules. To estimate the regioselectivity of the different attacks, classical molecular dynamics simulations were performed and the trajectories analyzed regarding the sulfur–sulfur distances and the attack angles between the sulfurs. The free energy profile of each reaction was obtained with hybrid quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical metadynamics simulations. Since this required extensive phase space sampling, the semi-empirical density functional tight-binding method was used to describe the reactive cysteines. For an accurate description, we used specific reaction parameters fitted to B3LYP energies of the thiol–disulfide exchange and a machine learned energy correction that was trained on coupled-cluster single double perturbative triple [CCSD(T)] energies of thiol–disulfide exchanges. Our calculations show the same regiospecificity as observed in the experiment, and the obtained barrier heights are about 12 and 20 kcal/mol for the different reaction steps, which confirms the proposed pathway.},

In this paper, we extend and characterize a coupled local mode (CLM) approach for calculating the infrared spectra of PWCs using the H + ( H 2 O ) 4 cluster as a benchmark system. The CLM method is relatively low cost and incorporates the anharmonicity and coupling of OH vibrations. Here, we demonstrate the accuracy of the technique compared to experiments.

  abstract = {We present a simple mean-field theory to describe the polymer-mediated depletion attraction between colloidal particles that accounts for the polymer’s chain stiffness. We find that for fixed polymer radius of gyration and volume fraction, the strength of this attraction increases with increasing chain stiffness in both dilute and semidilute concentration regimes. In contrast, the range of attraction monotonically decreases with chain stiffness in the dilute regime, while it attains a maximum in the semidilute regime. The obtained analytical expressions for the depletion interaction were compared with numerical self-consistent field lattice computations and shown to be in quantitative agreement. From the interaction potential between two spheres, we calculated the second osmotic virial coefficient B 2 , which appears to be a convex function of chain stiffness. A minimum of B 2 as a function of chain stiffness was observed both in the numerical self-consistent field computations and the analytical theory. These findings help explain the general observation that semiflexible polymers are more effective depletants than flexible polymers and give insight into the phase behavior of mixtures containing spherical colloids and semiflexible polymers.},

  abstract = {A chiral analog of transient absorption spectroscopy, transient circular dichroism (TCD) spectroscopy is an emerging time-resolved method. Both spectroscopic methods can probe the electronic transitions of a sample, and TCD is additionally sensitive to the dynamic aspects of chirality, such as those induced by molecular excitons. Here, we develop a theoretical description of TCD for electronic multi-level models in which the pump pulse is linearly polarized and probe pulse is alternately left- and right-circularly polarized. We derive effective response functions analogous to those often used to describe other four-wave mixing methods and then simulate and analyze TCD spectra for three representative multi-level electronic model systems. We elaborate on the presence and detection of the spectral signatures of electronic coherences.},

  abstract = {This Communication presents a unified derivation of three different approximations used in density functional theory (DFT): the Perdew–Zunger self-interaction correction (PZSIC), the Hubbard correction DFT+U, and the Rung 3.5 density functionals. All three approximations can be derived by introducing electron self-interaction into the Kohn–Sham (KS) reference system of noninteracting electrons. The derivation uses the Adiabatic Projection formalism: one projects the electron–electron interaction operator onto certain states, introduces the projected operator into the reference system, and defines a density functional for the remainder. Projecting onto individual localized KS orbitals recovers our previous derivation of the PZSIC [B. G. Janesko, J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 13 , 5698–5702 (2022)]. Projecting onto localized atom-centered orbitals recovers a variant of DFT+U. Projecting onto localized states at each point in space recovers Rung 3.5 approaches. New results include an “atomic state PZSIC” that does not require localizing the KS orbitals, a demonstration that typical Hubbard U parameters reproduce a scaled-down PZSIC, and a Rung 3.5 variant of DFT+U that does not require choosing atom-dependent states.},

Recently, the study of nature-inspired materials has expanded to the micro- and nanoscale, facilitating new breakthroughs in the design of materials with unique properties. Various types of superhydrophobic surfaces inspired by the lotus/rice leaf are examples of nature-inspired surfaces with special wettability properties. A new class of functional surfaces whose design is inspired by the pitcher plant are the slippery liquid-infused porous surfaces (SLIPS). This Review summarizes the properties, design criteria, fabrication strategies, and working mechanisms of both surfaces with specific focus on SLIPS. The applications of SLIPS in the field of membrane technology [slippery liquid-infused membranes (SLIMs)] are also reviewed. These membranes are also known as liquid gating membranes due to the gating functionality of the capillary-stabilized liquid in the membrane pores leading to a smart gating mechanism. Similar to the gating ion channels in biological systems, the pores open and close in response to the ambient stimuli, e.g., pressure, temperature, and ions. Different types of stimuli-responsive smart gating membranes are introduced here, and their properties and applications are reviewed in detail. Finally, challenges and perspectives on both SLIPS and smart gating membranes are discussed. This Review provides a thorough discussion and practical applications of nature-inspired functional surfaces and membranes to pave the way for future research and further developments in this emerging field.},

We have found that the energetic stability of a GPNL monolayer is comparable to that of γ -graphyne, as evidenced by its large cohesive energy of 6.755(3) eV/atom. Diffusion barriers of several gas molecules, including hydrogen, through a GPNL membrane were determined from the analysis of their adsorption energies depending on the adsorption distance, which led to our estimation for hydrogen selectivity with respect to other target molecules. DMC hydrogen selectivity of a GPNL monolayer was found to be exceptionally high at 300 K, as high as 10 10 –10 11 against CO and N 2 gases. This, along with high hydrogen permeance due to its generic pore structure, leads us to conclude that GPNL is a promising membrane to be used as a high-performance hydrogen separator from gas mixtures. We find that when compared to our DMC results, DFT calculations tend to overestimate H 2 selectivity, which is mostly due to their inaccurate description of short-range repulsive interactions.},

We have paid attention to the effects on the conductance of the cation valency, the pore charge asymmetry, and the pore charge inversion phenomena due to trivalent ions, both in single salts and salt mixtures. In addition, we have described how small concentrations of multivalent ions can tune the nanopore conductance due to monovalent majority ions, together with the effect of these charges on the additivity of ionic conductance and fluoride-induced negative differential conductance phenomena. This compilation and discussion of previously presented experimental data offers significant insights on the interaction between fixed and mobile charges confined in nanoscale volumes and should be useful in establishing and checking new models for describing ionic transport in the vicinity of charged surfaces.},

Computationally, the role of electronic and mechanical factors responsible for the improved activity was deduced only from static DFT calculations. This demands a detailed investigation on the dynamics of reactions under 2D confinement, including temperature effects. In this work, we study CO oxidation on a 2D graphene covered Pt(111) surface at 90 and 593 K using DFT-based ab initio molecular dynamics simulations starting from the transition state configuration. We show that CO oxidation in the presence of a graphene cover is substantially enhanced (2.3 times) at 90 K.

  abstract = {Organic ionic plastic crystals (OIPCs), which consist of organic molecular ions, are considered excellent candidates for solid electrolytes due to their high ionic conductivity in solid phases. Molecular ions undergo either rotational or conformational relaxation at certain temperatures in OIPCs. There have been molecular simulations to understand the rotational motion. The polarizability of ions was, however, often ignored in simulations due to the high computational cost. Since the polarizability may affect the translational diffusion, the ionic conductivity, and the phase transition of ionic liquids, it should be of interest to investigate how the polarizability would affect the rotational diffusion of ions in solid phases. In this work, we perform extensive atomistic molecular dynamics simulations for two different kinds of OIPCs, 1-methyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate ([MMIM][PF 6 ]) and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate ([BMIM][PF 6 ]). We employ various simulation models for ions by turning on and off the polarization in their interaction potentials. We find that the polarizability hardly affects the density, the crystalline structure, and the phase transition of both OIPCs. However, a certain rotational motion, especially the rotational diffusion of PF 6 − in [MMIM][PF 6 ] OIPCs, is enhanced by a factor of up to four when the polarizability is turned on. The PF 6 − in [MMIM][PF 6 ] OIPCs undergoes rotational hopping motions more significantly due to polarizability. We find that the rotational diffusion of a certain ion can be enhanced only when the polarization results in a significant change in the dipole moment of the neighboring ions around the ion.},

The conformation of the monomer is determined by the formation of a resonance-assisted hydrogen bond (RAHB) between the carbonyl and amino groups, which leads to the formation of a bicyclic-like aromatic structure. Accordingly, the cycle formed by the non-covalent bond is preferred to the phenyl ring as the interaction site for neon. In the 1:1 complex, water lies in the molecular plane and forms a strong hydrogen bond with the carbonyl group coupled to an ancillary interaction with the methyl group, leaving the intramolecular RAHB unchanged. The experimental findings are supported by atoms in molecules and symmetry-adapted perturbation theory, which allowed for determining the hydrogen bond and intermolecular interaction energies, respectively.},

  abstract = {Laser-induced molecular alignment is well understood within the framework of the Born–Oppenheimer (BO) approximation. Without the BO approximation, however, the concept of molecular structure is lost, making it hard to precisely define alignment. In this work, we demonstrate the emergence of alignment from the first-ever non-BO quantum dynamics simulations, using the HD molecule exposed to ultrashort laser pulses as a few-body test case. We extract the degree of alignment from the non-BO wave function by means of an operator expressed in terms of pseudo-proton coordinates that mimics the BO-based definition of alignment. The only essential approximation, in addition to the semiclassical electric-dipole approximation for the matter–field interaction, is the choice of time-independent explicitly correlated Gaussian basis functions. We use a variational, electric-field-dependent basis-set construction procedure, which allows us to keep the basis-set dimension low while capturing the main effects of electric polarization on the nuclear and electronic degrees of freedom. The basis-set construction procedure is validated by comparing with virtually exact grid-based simulations for two one-dimensional model systems: laser-driven electron dynamics in a soft attractive Coulomb potential and nuclear rovibrational dynamics in a Morse potential.},

In contrast to earlier high energy D 2 –Ne collision experiments, the ( j = 2 → j ′ = 0) cold scattering produced highly symmetric angular distributions that strongly suggest a resonant quasi-bound collision complex that lives long enough to make a few rotations. Our partial wave analysis indicates that the scattering dynamics is dominated by a single resonant l = 2 orbital, even in the presence of a broad temperature (0–5 K) distribution that allows incoming orbitals up to l = 5. The dominance of a single orbital suggests that the resonant complex stabilizes through the coupling of the internal ( j = 2) and orbital ( l = 2) angular momentum to produce a total angular momentum of J = 0 for the D 2 –Ne complex.},

We use in this endeavor the recently developed stochastic multi-configuration time-dependent Hartree approach within the Monte Carlo wave packet formalism [S. Mandal et al. , J. Chem. Phys. 156 , 094109 (2022)]. The method proved to yield thermalized ensembles of wave packets when intramolecular coupling is weak. To treat strongly coupled systems, new Lindblad dissipative operators are constructed as linear combinations of the system coordinates and associated momenta. These are obtained by a unitary transformation to a normal mode representation, which reduces intermode coupling up to second order. Additionally, we use combinations of generalized raising/lowering operators to enforce the Boltzmann distribution in the dissipation operators, which yield perfect thermalization in the harmonic limit. The two ansatz are tested using a model two-dimensional Hamiltonian, parameterized to disentangle the effects of intramolecular potential coupling, of strong mode mixing observed in Fermi resonances, and of anharmonicity.},

  abstract = {A Generalized Morse Potential (GMP) is an extension of the Morse Potential (MP) with an additional exponential term and an additional parameter that compensate for MP’s erroneous behavior in the long range part of the interaction potential. Because of the additional term and parameter, the vibrational levels of the GMP cannot be solved analytically, unlike the case for the MP. We present several numerical approaches for solving the vibrational problem of the GMP based on Galerkin methods, namely, the Laguerre Polynomial Method (LPM), the Symmetrized LPM, and the Polynomial Expansion Method (PEM), and apply them to the vibrational levels of the homonuclear diatomic molecules B 2 , O 2 , and F 2 , for which high level theoretical near full configuration interaction (CI) electronic ground state potential energy surfaces and experimentally measured vibrational levels have been reported. Overall, the LPM produces vibrational states for the GMP that are converged to within spectroscopic accuracy of 0.01 cm −1 in between 1 and 2 orders of magnitude faster and with much fewer basis functions/grid points than the Colbert–Miller Discrete Variable Representation (CN-DVR) method for the three homonuclear diatomic molecules examined in this study. A Python library that fits and solves the GMP and similar potentials can be downloaded from https://gitlab.com/gds001uw/generalized-morse-solver .},

Thermal energy diffusion and electron transfer are relatively simple physical processes, but the phenomena they induce are interesting because of a variety of new application developments. In this Perspective, we introduce the fundamental aspects as well as advanced applications of several new physical phenomena induced by AuNPs-based hybrid materials with oxides or 2D materials. Localized heat can induce a great force on the surrounding medium to control mass transport, and plasmon-induced charge transfer reactions are expected to have applications in photocatalysis and solar cells. We also review increasing reports on the development of nano-optical sensors, transistors, and nano-light sources based on precisely controlled device structures utilizing AuNPs.},

However, their cross section is low, and the band can be strongly broadened in heterogeneous environments, making detection very challenging. With two-dimensional infrared (2D-IR) setups achieving ever higher sensitivities in recent years, systematic use of the weak cysteine sulfhydryls (Cys–SHs) absorption band is now within reach, even at low millimolar protein concentrations. Here, we demonstrate the capabilities of Cys–SH as an intrinsic 2D-IR label in pyruvate oxidase from E. coli , an enzyme with ten cysteines in its native sequence. 1D-IR measurements on the wild-type and individual cysteine knock-out variants show that two such residues have especially narrow SH signatures, caused by their intrahelical hydrogen bonding. 2D-IR analysis of these bands reveals an extraordinarily high anharmonicity (∼110 cm −1 ) and a long vibrational lifetime (∼4 ps). This allows monitoring spectral diffusion via center line slope analysis for up to 10 ps—separately for both the ground and excited states. The unique spectroscopic features and its ease of introduction make Cys–SH a useful IR spectroscopic label.},

On assuming that the hard, very elongate particles are cylindrically symmetric with a length L and a diameter D and isostaticity occurs at jamming, the prediction, in particular that, in the limit of L / D → +∞, ϕ MRJ hr L / D = (10 + 1)/2, is compared to the available experimental data.},

Here, we explore one of the simplest molecules in activity gradients, namely active chiral dimers composed of two particles with opposite active torques of the same magnitude. We show analytically that with increasing torque, the dimer switches its behavior from antichemotactic to chemotactic. The origin of the emergent chemotaxis is the cooperative exploration of an activity gradient by the two particles. While one of the particles moves into higher activity regions, the other moves towards lower activity regions, resulting in a net bias in the direction of higher activity. We do a comparative study of chiral active particles with charged Brownian particles under a magnetic field and show that despite the fundamental similarity in terms of their odd-diffusive behavior, their dynamics and chemotactic behavior are generally not equivalent. We demonstrate this explicitly in a dimer composed of oppositely charged active particles, which remains antichemotactic to any magnetic field.},

To understand why these materials are liquid crystals, as well as the structural determinants of discotic phase behavior, we studied a group of closely related small tail-free disk-like molecules, including both mesogenic and non-mesogenic compounds differing only in the position of a single fluorine substituent. The rigidity and structural simplicity of these molecules make them well suited to for study by large, fully all-atom simulations. Using a combination of static and dynamic metrics, we were able to identify several key features of the columnar mesophase and, thereby, conclusively identify a columnar liquid crystalline mesophase present in a subset of our systems. Our simulations feature molecules hopping between columns in the columnar mesophase and distinctive molecular rotations in 60° steps about the columnar axis. The ability to create and characterize columnar mesophases in silico provides a potent tool for untangling the structural determinants of liquid crystalline behavior in these and other tail-free discotic liquid crystals.},

  abstract = {The photocarrier recombination in van der Waals layers may determine the device performance based on these materials. Here, we investigated the photocarrier dynamics in a multilayer indium selenide nanofilm using transient absorption spectroscopy. The sub-bandgap transient absorption feature was attributed to the indirect intraband absorption of the photocarriers, which was then exploited as a probe to monitor the photocarrier dynamics. With increasing pump intensities, the photocarrier decay was accelerated because of the rising contribution from a bimolecular recombination channel that was then assigned to exciton–exciton annihilation. The rate constant of the exciton–exciton annihilation was given as (1.8 ± 0.1) × 10 −15 cm 2 ps −1 from a global fitting of the photocarrier decay kinetics for different pump intensities. Our finding suggests that, in contrast with their monolayer counterpart, the exciton–exciton annihilation is rather inefficient in multilayers due to their weaker Coulomb interaction. Hence, compared with monolayers, the lifetime of photocarriers in multilayers would not be significantly reduced under high-intensity pump conditions, and the apparent photocarrier lifetime could be further improved just by suppressing the monomolecular recombination channels such as trapping.},

There exist in the literature only two independent experimental measurements of this thermodynamic magnitude: one obtained by Uchida et al. [J. Phys. Chem. B 106 , 8202 (2002)], 28(6) mJ/m 2 , and the other by Anderson and co-workers [J. Phys. Chem. B 107 , 3507 (2003)], 30(3) mJ/m 2 . Recently, Algaba et al. [J. Colloid Interface Sci. 623 , 354 (2022)] have extended the mold integration method proposed by Espinosa and co-workers [J. Chem. Phys. 141 , 134709 (2014)] to deal with the CO 2 hydrate–water interfacial free energy (mold integration–guest or MI-H). Computer simulations predict a value of 29(2) mJ/m 2 , in excellent agreement with experimental data. The method is based on the use of a mold of attractive wells located at the crystallographic positions of the oxygen atoms of water molecules in equilibrium hydrate structures to induce the formation of a thin hydrate slab in the liquid phase at coexistence conditions. We propose here a new implementation of the mold integration technique using a mold of attractive wells located now at the crystallographic positions of the carbon atoms of the CO 2 molecules in the equilibrium hydrate structure. We find that the new mold integration–guest methodology, which does not introduce positional or orientational information of the water molecules in the hydrate phase, is able to induce the formation of CO 2 hydrates in an efficient way. More importantly, this new version of the method predicts a CO 2 hydrate–water interfacial energy value of 30(2) mJ/m 2 , in excellent agreement with experimental data, which is also fully consistent with the results obtained using the previous methodology.},

  abstract = {The evaporation of water nanofilms on a solid surface is a widespread and important process in many fields. Herein, we utilize molecular dynamics simulations to demonstrate that the evaporation of a water nanofilm is regulated by applying an alternating electric field (AEF). An AEF at a specific frequency can be resonantly absorbed by the water film. Consequently, the AEF with sufficient strength significantly increases the evaporation rate of the water film (R). In contrast, an AEF of a different frequency and polarization direction decreases R sharply, which is closely related to the strengthened hydrogen bond network and the reduced kinetic energy of the outermost water of the water film. When the maximum amplitude of the AEFs is 0.9 V/nm, which is achievable in a laboratory setting, R spans six orders of magnitude. The effects of applying the AEFs are quite distinct from those of changing the temperature. Notably, the polarization direction of the AEF plays an important role in the water evaporation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on regulating the evaporation rate of a water film, showing that it is possible to use AEFs to tune the properties of nanoscaled water, such as the wettability.},

  abstract = {Concernin the crucial interfacial issues in multi-layered kesterite Cu 2 ZnSn(S,Se) 4 (CZTSSe) solar cells, (NH 4 ) 2 S treatment has been proven to be effective in eliminating surface secondary phases. While for the CZTSSe absorbers without impurity phases, what can the low-temperature (NH 4 ) 2 S treatment do to the absorbers, thus to the device performance? Herein, the chloride-fabricated CZTSSe absorbers are surface treated with the (NH 4 ) 2 S solution at room temperature, and its influence on the device performance is investigated in detail. Surprisingly, such treatment can make the absorbers’ surface become nearly super-hydrophilicity, greatly decreasing the surface wetting angle from 63.1° ± 3.4° to 7.3° ± 0.6° after 50 min-treating, and thus lead to marked differences in the interfacial properties of the CdS/CZTSSe heterojunctions deposited in a chemical bath. Consequently, for the best-performing CZTSSe cells, combining the passivated interfacial defects, increased carrier concentration, reduced carrier recombination, and prolonged minority lifetime, the efficiency is improved from 6.54\% to 9.88\%, together with the 37 mV and 7.9\% increase in V OC and FF, respectively. This study confirms the newfound results that the (NH 4 ) 2 S treatment can effectively adjust the wettability of the absorbers to form high-quality heterojunctions to boost the device efficiency, which would be valuable for an in-depth understanding of the intrinsic mechanisms of interfacial processing.},

  abstract = {Wettability of rock surfaces with respect to oil and water, which is characterized by the contact angle, is an important factor that determines the efficacy of enhanced oil recovery operations. Experimental determination of contact angles for oil–water–rock systems is expensive and time-consuming due to the extremely long times needed for the establishment of adsorption equilibrium at the liquid–solid interface. Hence, molecular simulations form an attractive tool for computing contact angles. In this work, we use the cleaving wall technique that was developed previously in our group [R. K. R. Addula and S. N. Punnathanam, J. Chem. Phys. 153 , 154504 (2020)] to compute solid–liquid interfacial free energy, which is then combined with Young’s equation to compute the oil–water contact angle on silica surfaces. The silica surface is modeled with the INTERFACE force field that has been developed to accurately reproduce experimental data. We have considered three different surface chemistries of silica, namely, Q 2 , Q 3 , and Q 4 , in this study. Our calculations reveal that while the Q 2 and Q 3 surfaces are completely wetted by water, the Q 4 surface is partially non-wetted by water. All the simulations needed for this calculation can be performed using the Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator (LAMMPS) molecular package. This should facilitate wider adoption of the Young’s equation route to compute contact angles for systems comprised of complex molecules.},

The reaction and rovibrationally elastic scattering probabilities that we obtain at a quantum dynamical (QD) level, as an average of many statically distorted surface configurations, show great agreement with those of a dynamic surface model, which reinforces the validity of the sudden approximation inherent to the SCM. We further investigate several simple methods of binning the final rovibrational state of quasi-classical dynamics simulations, to find those best suited to reproduce the QD results for our system. Finally, we show that the SCM obtained results reproduce experimental dissociation curves very well, when the uncertainty in experimental saturation values is taken into account. Some indication of a slow channel, so far only observed in experiment, can also be found at low incidence energies, although more rigorous QD simulations are required to reduce the noise inherent to our propagation methods.},

We find that the silica HDL–LDL interface exhibits a spatial fragile-to-strong transition across the interface. Calculations of dynamics properties reveal three types of dynamical heterogeneity hybridizing within the silica HDL–LDL interface. We also observe that as the interface is traversed from HDL to LDL, the Si/O coordination number ratio jumps to an unexpectedly large value, defining a thin region of the interface where HDL and LDL exhibit significant mixing. In addition, the LLPT phase coexistence is interpreted in the framework of the traditional thermodynamics of alloys and phase equilibria.},

  abstract = {Physical properties are commonly represented by tensors, such as optical susceptibilities. The conventional approach of deriving non-vanishing tensor elements of symmetric systems relies on the intuitive consideration of positive/negative sign flipping after symmetry operations, which could be tedious and prone to miscalculation. Here, we present a matrix-based approach that gives a physical picture centered on Neumann’s principle. The principle states that symmetries in geometric systems are adopted by their physical properties. We mathematically apply the principle to the tensor expressions and show a procedure with clear physical intuition to derive non-vanishing tensor elements based on eigensystems. The validity of the approach is demonstrated by examples of commonly known second and third-order nonlinear susceptibilities of chiral/achiral surfaces, together with complicated scenarios involving symmetries such as D 6 and O h symmetries. We then further applied this method to higher-rank tensors that are useful for 2D and high-order spectroscopy. We also extended our approach to derive nonlinear tensor elements with magnetization, which is critical for measuring spin polarization on surfaces for quantum information technologies. A Mathematica code based on this generalized approach is included that can be applied to any symmetry and higher order nonlinear processes.},

  abstract = {Ice is one of the most important and interesting molecular crystals, exhibiting a rich and evolving phase diagram. Recent discoveries mean that there are now 20 distinct polymorphs; a structural diversity that arises from a delicate interplay of hydrogen bonding and van der Waals dispersion forces. This wealth of structures provides a stern test of electronic structure theories, with Density Functional Theory (DFT) often not able to accurately characterize the relative energies of the various ice polymorphs. Thanks to recent advances that enable the accurate and efficient treatment of molecular crystals with Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC), we present here the DMC-ICE13 dataset; a dataset of lattice energies of 13 ice polymorphs. This dataset encompasses the full structural complexity found in the ambient and high-pressure molecular ice polymorphs, and when experimental reference energies are available, our DMC results deliver sub-chemical accuracy. Using this dataset, we then perform an extensive benchmark of a broad range of DFT functionals. Of the functionals considered, revPBE-D3 and RSCAN reproduce reference absolute lattice energies with the smallest error, while optB86b-vdW and SCAN+rVV10 have the best performance on the relative lattice energies. Our results suggest that a single functional achieving reliable performance for all phases is still missing, and that care is needed in the selection of the most appropriate functional for the desired application. The insights obtained here may also be relevant to liquid water and other hydrogen-bonded and dispersion-bonded molecular crystals.},

  abstract = {Colloidal systems possess unique features to investigate the governing principles behind liquid-to-solid transitions. The phase diagram and crystallization landscape of colloidal particles can be finely tuned by the range, number, and angular distribution of attractive interactions between the constituent particles. In this work, we present a computational study of colloidal patchy particles with high-symmetry bonding—six patches displaying octahedral symmetry—that can crystallize into distinct competing ordered phases: a cubic simple (CS) lattice, a body-centered cubic phase, and two face-centered cubic solids (orientationally ordered and disordered). We investigate the underlying mechanisms by which these competing crystals emerge from a disordered fluid at different pressures. Strikingly, we identify instances where the structure of the crystalline embryo corresponds to the stable solid, while in others, it corresponds to a metastable crystal whose nucleation is enabled by its lower interfacial free energy with the liquid. Moreover, we find the exceptional phenomenon that, due to a subtle balance between volumetric enthalpy and interfacial free energy, the CS phase nucleates via crystalline cubic nuclei rather than through spherical clusters, as the majority of crystal solids in nature. Finally, by examining growth beyond the nucleation stage, we uncover a series of alternating one-phase and two-phase crystallization mechanisms depending on whether or not the same phase that nucleates keeps growing. Taken together, we show that an octahedral distribution of attractive sites in colloidal particles results in an extremely rich crystallization landscape where subtle differences in pressure crucially determine the crystallizing polymorph.},

The photoproduct ions are detected over 35 000–43 000 cm −1 , and the major product channel for 3-FPH + and 4-FPH + is the loss of CO forming protonated pyridine at m/z 80. For 2-FPH + , the CO loss product is present but a more abundant photoproduct arises from the loss of CH 2 O to form m/z 78. Plausible potential energy pathways that lead to dissociation are mapped out and comparisons are made to products arising from collision-induced dissociation. Although, in all cases, the elimination of CO is the overwhelming thermodynamically preferred pathway, the protonated 2-FPH + results suggest that the CH 2 O product is kinetically driven and competitive with CO loss. In addition, for each isomer, radical photoproduct ions are detected at lower abundances. SCS-CC2/aug-cc-pVTZ Franck–Condon simulations assist with the assignment of vibrionic structure and adiabatic energies (0–0) for 2-FPH + at 36 560 cm −1 , 37 430 cm −1 for 3-FPH + , and 36 140 cm −1 for 4-FPH + , yielding an accurate prediction, on average, within 620 cm −1 .},

The observables we address are post-pulse total ionization probability profiles as a function of the laser peak intensity. Three values of the internuclear distance R taken as a parameter are considered, R = R eq = 1.4 a.u. for the equilibrium geometry of the molecule, R = 5.0 a.u. for an elongated molecule, and R = 10.2 a.u. for a dissociating molecule. The most striking observation is the non-monotonous behavior of the ionization probability profiles at intermediate elongation distances with an instance of enhanced ionization and one of partial ionization quenching. We give an interpretation of this in terms of a resonance-enhanced-multiphoton ionization mechanism with interfering overlapping resonances resulting from excited electronic states.},

  abstract = {Coupled pairs of spin-1/2 nuclei support one singlet state and three triplet states. In many circumstances, the nuclear singlet order, defined as the difference between the singlet population and the mean of the triplet populations, is a long-lived state that persists for a relatively long time in solution. Various methods have been proposed for generating singlet order, starting from nuclear magnetization. This requires the stimulation of singlet-to-triplet transitions by modulated radiofrequency fields. We show that a recently described pulse sequence, known as PulsePol [Schwartz et al. , Sci. Adv., 4 , eaat8978 (2018)], is an efficient technique for converting magnetization into long-lived singlet order. We show that the operation of this pulse sequence may be understood by adapting the theory of symmetry-based recoupling sequences in magic-angle-spinning solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The concept of riffling allows PulsePol to be interpreted by using the theory of symmetry-based pulse sequences and explains its robustness. This theory is used to derive a range of new pulse sequences for performing singlet–triplet excitation and conversion in solution NMR. Schemes for further enhancing the robustness of the transformations are demonstrated.},

  abstract = {Microsolvation of electrons in ammonia is studied here via anionic N H 3 n − clusters with n = 2–6. Intensive samplings of the corresponding configurational spaces using second-order perturbation theory with extended basis sets uncover rich and complex energy landscapes, heavily populated by many local minima in tight energy windows as calculated from highly correlated coupled cluster methods. There is a marked energetical preference for structures that place the excess electron external to the molecular frame, effectively coordinating it with the three protons from a single ammonia molecule. Overall, as the clusters grow in size, the lowest energy dimer serves as the basic motif over which additional ammonia molecules are attached via unusually strong charge-assisted hydrogen bonds. This is a priori quite unexpected because, on electrostatic grounds, the excess electron would be expected to be in contact with as many protons as possible. Accordingly, a full quantum mechanical treatment of the bonding interactions under the tools provided by the quantum theory of atoms in molecules is carried out in order to dissect and understand the nature of intermolecular contacts. Vertical detachment energies reveal bound electrons even for n = 2.},

  abstract = {We report an approach to treat polarization effects in a one-dimensional (1D) environment using frozen-density embedding (FDE), suitable to compute response to electron loss or attachment as occurring in organic semiconductors during charge migration. The present work provides two key developments: (a) Local perturbations are computed avoiding an infinite repetition thereof and (b) a first-order equation-of-motion ansatz is used to compute polarization effects due to electron loss and attachment, ensuring an efficient calculation by avoiding open-shell calculations. In a first step, an unperturbed 1D molecular chain is equilibrated using FDE by translation of the center molecule. In a subsequent second step, long-range contributions are frozen and a local perturbation is introduced in the center subsystem. Freeze–thaw iterations are used to relax the electronic wavefunction of both the center subsystem and subsystems in an active region around the center subsystem, avoiding the need to translate the perturbation. The proposed scheme proves to be very efficient and allows for the calculation of charged tetraazaperopyrenes in 1D chains. Due to its efficiency, the new method is capable of providing wavefunction-based reference data relevant for electronic couplings in complex environments.},

  abstract = {The Berry connection and curvature are key components of electronic structure calculations for atoms and molecules in magnetic fields. They ensure the correct translational behavior of the effective nuclear Hamiltonian and the correct center-of-mass motion during molecular dynamics in these environments. In this work, we demonstrate how these properties of the Berry connection and curvature arise from the translational symmetry of the electronic wave function and how they are fully captured by a finite basis set of London orbitals but not by standard Gaussian basis sets. This is illustrated by a series of Hartree–Fock calculations on small molecules in different basis sets. Based on the resulting physical interpretation of the Berry curvature as the shielding of the nuclei by the electrons, we introduce and test a series of approximations using the Mulliken fragmentation scheme of the electron density. These approximations will be particularly useful in ab initio molecular dynamics calculations in a magnetic field since they reduce the computational cost, while recovering the correct physics and up to 95\% of the exact Berry curvature.},

Although we used in this work the recently introduced one-parameter correlation factor [E. Giner, J. Chem. Phys. 154 , 084119 (2021)], the theory presented here is valid for any correlation factor. Thanks to the formalization of the non-Hermitian TC eigenvalue problem as a search of stationary points for a specific functional depending on both left- and right-functions, we obtain a general framework, allowing for different choices for both the selection criterion in SCI and the second order perturbative correction to the energy. After numerical investigations on different second-row atomic and molecular systems in increasingly large basis sets, we found that taking into account the non-Hermitian character of the TC Hamiltonian in the selection criterion is mandatory to obtain a fast convergence of the TC energy. In addition, selection criteria based on either the first order coefficient or the second order energy lead to significantly different convergence rates, which is typically not the case in the usual Hermitian SCI. Regarding the convergence of the total second order perturbation energy, we find that the quality of the left-function used in the equations strongly affects the quality of the results. Within the near-optimal algorithm proposed here, we find that the SCI expansion in the TC framework converges faster than the usual SCI in terms of both the basis set and the number of Slater determinants.},

Despite their importance, it is currently impossible to evaluate the rate of these processes for a large set of molecules and, therefore, perform high-throughput virtual screening in large-scale data to gain more physical insight. In this work, we explore possible approaches to accelerate the calculations of IC and ISC rates based on a systematic reduction of the number of modes included in the computation and the study of the importance of the different parameters and the influence of their accuracy on the final result. The results reproduce the experimental trends with systematic errors that are ultimately due to the approximations of the theory. We noted that plausible results for ISC in planar molecules are only obtained by including the effect of Hertzberg–Teller coupling. Our method establishes the feasibility and expected accuracy of the computation of nonradiative rates in the virtual screening of molecular materials.},

In this work, a unified framework of transformations mapping fermionic systems to qubit systems is presented and many existing transformations—such as Jordan–Wigner, Bravyi–Kitaev, and parity transformations—are included in this framework. Based on this framework, the Multilayer Segmented Parity (MSP) transformation is proposed. The MSP transformation is a general mapping with an adjustable parameter vector, which can be viewed as a generalization of the above-mentioned mappings. Furthermore, the MSP transformation can adjust flexibly when dealing with different systems. Applying these mappings to the electronic structure Hamiltonians of various molecules, the MSP transformation is found to perform better on a number of Pauli operators and gates needed in the circuit of Hamiltonian simulation. The MSP transformation will reduce the qubit gate requirement for Hamiltonian simulation on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices, and it will provide a much wider choice of mappings for researchers.},

  abstract = {Elastic neutron scattering from proteins reflects the motional amplitudes resulting from their internal collective and single-atom dynamics and is observable if the global diffusion of whole molecules is either blocked or cannot be resolved by the spectrometer under consideration. Due to finite instrumental resolution, the measured elastic scattering amplitude always contains contaminations from quasielastic neutron scattering and some model must be assumed to extract the resolution-corrected counterpart from corresponding experimental spectra. Here, we derive a quasi-analytical method for that purpose, assuming that the intermediate scattering function relaxes with a “stretched” Mittag-Leffler function, E α (−( t / τ ) α ) (0 &lt; α &lt; 1), toward the elastic amplitude and that the instrumental resolution function has Gaussian form. The corresponding function can be integrated into a fitting procedure and allows for eliminating the elastic intensity as a fit parameter. We illustrate the method for the analysis of two proteins in solution, the intrinsically disordered Myelin Basic Protein, confirming recently published results [Hassani et al. , J. Chem. Phys. 156 , 025102 (2022)], and the well-folded globular protein myoglobin.

  abstract = {4-aminobenzoic acid (4ABA) is a model scaffold for studying solvent-mediated proton transfer. Although protonation at the carboxylic group ( O -protomer) is energetically favored in the gas phase, the N -protomer, where the proton remains on the amino group, can be kinetically trapped by electrospray ionization of 4ABA in an aprotic solvent such as acetonitrile. Here, we report the formation of the hydrated deuterium isotopologues of the N -protomers, RND 3 + ·(H 2 O) n =1–3 , (R = C 6 H 4 COOD), which are generated by condensing water molecules onto the bare N -protomers in a liquid nitrogen cooled, radiofrequency octopole ion trap at 80 K. The product clusters are then transferred to a 20 K cryogenic ion trap where they are tagged with weakly bound D 2 molecules. The structures of these clusters are determined by analysis of their vibrational patterns, obtained by resonant IR photodissociation. The resulting patterns confirm that the metastable N -protomer configuration remains intact even when warmed by the sequential condensation of water molecules. The attachment of H 2 O molecules onto the RND 3 + head group also affords the opportunity to explore the possibility of H/D exchange between the acid scaffold and the proximal water network. The spectroscopic results establish that although the RND 3 + ·(H 2 O) n =1,2 clusters are formed without H/D exchange, the n = 3 cluster exhibits about 10\% H/D exchange as evidenced by the appearance of the telltale HOD bands. The site of exchange on the acid is determined to be the acidic OH group by the emergence of the OH stretching fundamental in the –COOH motif.},

We pursue the consequences of this idea by performing coarse-grained molecular simulations of polymer melts with additives of variable size and interaction strength with the polymer matrix, thereby significantly altering the relaxation of the composite material. Both the string and localization models describe our relaxation time data well, and a comparison of the model parameters allows us to relate the local caging scale ⟨ u 2 ⟩ (the Debye-Waller parameter) to the entropy of activation for molecular rearrangements in the string model, thereby developing a bridge between these seemingly disparate approaches to liquid dynamics.},

  abstract = {Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) is a tool of choice to characterize molecular motions. In biological macromolecules, pico- to nanosecond motions, in particular, can be probed by nuclear spin relaxation rates, which depend on the time fluctuations of the orientations of spin interaction frames. For the past 40 years, relaxation rates have been successfully analyzed using the Model-Free (MF) approach, which makes no assumption on the nature of motions and reports on the effective amplitude and timescale of the motions. However, obtaining a mechanistic picture of motions from this type of analysis is difficult at best, unless complemented with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. In spite of their limited accuracy, such simulations can be used to obtain the information necessary to build explicit models of motions designed to analyze NMR relaxation data. Here, we present how to build such models, suited in particular to describe motions of methyl-bearing protein side chains and compare them with the MF approach. We show on synthetic data that explicit models of motions are more robust in the presence of rotamer jumps which dominate the relaxation in methyl groups of protein side chains. We expect this work to motivate the use of explicit models of motion to analyze MD and NMR data.},

  abstract = {Under certain conditions, the dynamics of coarse-grained models of solvated proteins can be described using a Markov state model, which tracks the evolution of populations of configurations. The transition rates among states that appear in the Markov model can be determined by computing the relative entropy of states and their mean first passage times. In this paper, we present an adaptive method to evaluate the configurational entropy and the mean first passage times for linear chain models with discontinuous potentials. The approach is based on event-driven dynamical sampling in a massively parallel architecture. Using the fact that the transition rate matrix can be calculated for any choice of interaction energies at any temperature, it is demonstrated how each state’s energy can be chosen such that the average time to transition between any two states is minimized. The methods are used to analyze the optimization of the folding process of two protein systems: the crambin protein and a model with frustration and misfolding. It is shown that the folding pathways for both systems are comprised of two regimes: first, the rapid establishment of local bonds, followed by the subsequent formation of more distant contacts. The state energies that lead to the most rapid folding encourage multiple pathways, and they either penalize folding pathways through kinetic traps by raising the energies of trapping states or establish an escape route from the trapping states by lowering free energy barriers to other states that rapidly reach the native state.},

We investigate the density layering across the nanopore as well as the orientational ordering in the polymer melt, brought about by the confinement, on both the segmental and chain scales. For the chain scale ordering, the magnitude and orientation of the axes of the gyration tensor ellipsoid of single chains are studied and are found to prefer to align parallel to the pore axis. Even though double bonds near the wall are preferentially oriented along the pore walls, studying the nematic order parameter indicates that there is no nematic ordering at the melt–wall interface. As for the dynamics in the melt, we focus here on the mean-square-displacement of the monomers for several layers across the nanopore as well as the movement of the chain center of mass both of which display a slowing down of the dynamics in the layer at the wall. We also show the strong adsorption of the monomers to the pore wall at lower temperatures.},

  abstract = {Silicon dangling bonds (DBs) on an adsorbate-covered Si(100) surface can be created in a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) with high precision required for a number of applications. However, vacancies containing DBs can diffuse, disrupting precisely created structures. In this work, we study the diffusion of Br vacancies on a Si(100)-2 × 1-Br surface in an STM under typical imaging conditions. In agreement with previous work, Br vacancies diffuse at a positive sample bias voltage. Here, we demonstrated that only vacancies containing a positively charged DB hop across the two atoms of a single Si dimer, while vacancies containing neutral and negatively charged DBs do not. Calculations based on density functional theory confirmed that positively charged Br (and Cl) vacancies have a minimum activation barrier. We propose that diffusion operates by both one-electron and two-electron mechanisms depending on the applied voltage. Our results show that the DB charge has a critical effect on the vacancy diffusion. This effect should be taken into account when imaging surface structures with charged DBs as well as when studying the diffusion of other atoms and molecules on the Si(100) surface with vacancies in an adsorbate layer.},

Second, we developed a new fitness function for half-metallic materials that can be used for predicting half-metals through an evolutionary algorithm. We used this extended technique to predict new, potentially hard magnets and rediscover known half-metals. In total, we report five promising hard magnets with high energy product (| BH | MAX ), anisotropy field ( H a ), and magnetic hardness ( κ ) and a few half-metal phases in the Cr–O system.

The results indicate that the spin effects for the Fe and Ni films are similar in that the initial sticking probability (S 0 ) of O 2 is higher when the spins of O 2 and the film are antiparallel, and the spin dependence in S 0 , which amounts to 30\%–40\% at thermal energy, decays with increasing the O 2 kinetic energy ( E 0 ). In the case of the Fe/O 2 system, however, considerable spin dependence was found to remain even at E 0 &gt; 0.2 eV and on the oxidized surface. It has also been shown that the barrier for O 2 chemisorption increases in the order of Fe(110) &lt; Ni(111) &lt; Co(0001), and the difference in the observed alignment effect among the samples can be understood based on the difference in the barrier.},

Three binary mixtures were investigated, which differ in the energetic cross interaction parameter that yields different types of azeotropic behavior. This study covers a wide temperature and composition range. Mixture A exhibits a heteroazeotrope at low temperatures, which changes to a low-boiling azeotrope at high temperatures, mixture B exhibits a low-boiling azeotrope, and mixture C exhibits a high-boiling azeotrope. The phase behavior and fluid interfacial properties as well as their relation were studied. Vapor–liquid, liquid–liquid, and vapor–liquid–liquid equilibria and interfaces were considered. Density profiles, the surface tension, the interfacial thickness, as well as the relative adsorption and enrichment of the components at the interface were studied. The results obtained from the two independent methods (MD and DGT) are overall in good agreement. The results provide insights into the relation of the phase behavior, particularly the azeotropic behavior, of simple fluid mixtures and the corresponding interfacial properties. Strong enrichment was found for the mixture with a heteroazeotrope in the vicinity of the three-phase equilibrium, which is related to a wetting transition.},

In this study, a molecular dynamics simulation is conducted to elucidate the molecular-scale growth kinetics at the interface between a (111) plane of cubic ice and water in the presence of N 2 molecules. Two potential models of N 2 molecules with and without atomic charges are examined. For both models, N 2 molecules bind stably to the interface for a period of 1 ns or longer, and the stability of the binding is higher for the charged model than for the noncharged model. Free-energy surfaces of an N 2 molecule along the interface and along an ideal (111) plane surface of cubic ice suggest that for both models, the position where an N 2 molecule binds stably is different at the interface and on the ideal plane surface, and the stability of the binding is much higher for the interface than for the ideal plane surface. For both models, stacking-disordered ice grows at the interface, and the formation probability of a hexagonal ice layer in the stacking-disordered ice is higher for the charged model than for the uncharged model. The formation probability for the hexagonal ice layer in the stacking-disordered ice depends not only on the stability of binding but also on the positions where N 2 molecules bind to the underlying ice and the number of N 2 molecules that bind stably to the underlying ice.},

A temperature response to a small adiabatic change in pressure has been measured using a piston–cylinder apparatus. We have compared our experimental results with the literature data for lower pressures and NIST approximations. We find that all existing experimental data do not agree with each other and with our experiments. The NIST approximations are mainly based on low pressure data and appear to be unreliable in the high pressure region, giving even qualitatively wrong results. OPLS and COMPASS force field models have been used in the method of molecular dynamics. The agreement of molecular simulation with our experimental data is definitely unsatisfactory, which means that the most common computational models of methanol are not sufficiently good. We hope that these experimental data and approximations will help in developing better computational models.},

Specifically, (i) the mechanically stable local minima of the PEL [inherent structures (IS)] can exhibit cavitation above the so-called Sastry volume, v S , before the liquid enters the gas phase. In addition, (ii) the pressure of the liquid at the sampled IS [i.e., the PEL equation of state, P IS ( v )] develops a spinodal-like minimum at v S . We perform molecular dynamics simulations of a monatomic water-like liquid and verify that points (i) and (ii) hold at high temperatures. However, at low temperatures, cavitation in the liquid and the corresponding IS occurs simultaneously and a Sastry volume cannot be defined. Remarkably, at intermediate/high temperatures, the IS of the liquid can exhibit crystallization, i.e., the liquid regularly visits the regions of the PEL that belong to the crystal state. The model liquid considered also exhibits a liquid–liquid phase transition (LLPT) between a low-density and a high-density liquid (LDL and HDL). By studying the behavior of P IS ( v ) during the LLPT, we identify a Sastry volume for both LDL and HDL. The HDL Sastry volume marks the onset above which IS are heterogeneous (composed of LDL and HDL particles), analogous to points (i) and (ii) above. However, the relationship between the LDL Sastry volume and the onset of heterogeneous IS is less evident. We conclude by presenting a thermodynamic argument that can explain the behavior of the PEL equation of state P IS ( v ) across both the liquid–gas phase transition and LLPT.},

What makes some liquids strong and others fragile is still not well understood. Here, we explore this question in a family of harmonic spheres that range from extremely strong to extremely fragile, using “softness,” a structural order parameter identified by machine learning to be highly correlated with dynamical rearrangements. We use a support vector machine to identify softness as the same linear combination of structural quantities across the entire family of liquids studied.

  abstract = {Ab initio calculations were carried out in order to study the electronic structure and spectroscopy of cis -HAlOH, trans- HAlOH, H 2 AlO, and AlOH 2 . The cis structure is more stable than the trans, and both are thermodynamically stable relative to the AlOH + H dissociation limit. A set of spectroscopic constants were generated for the lowest stable isomers to help with their detection in the laboratory and in the interstellar medium. The first excited state absorbs strongly in the visible region (λ = 460 nm), with a predicted transition dipole moment of 2.07 D. The electronic structures of the first excited state were calculated, including the lifetime, adiabatic excitation energy, rotational constants, and frequencies. We have shown that both isomers may be suitable for laser-induced fluorescence detection. Finally, photodissociation of the cis - and trans- HAlOH isomers is a plausible mechanism for the production of AlOH and H.},

  abstract = {The potential for selective bond breaking of a small molecule was investigated with electron spectroscopy and electron–ion coincidence experiments on ClNO. The electron spectra were measured upon direct valence photoionization and resonant core excitation at the N 1s- and O 1s-edges, followed by the emission of resonant-Auger (RA) electrons. The RA spectra were analyzed with particular emphasis on the assignment of the participator and spectator states. The states are of special relevance for investigating how distinct electronic configurations influence selective bond breaking. The electron–ion coincidence measurements provided branching fractions of the produced ion fragments as a function of electron binding energy. They explicitly demonstrate how the final electronic states created after photoionization and RA decay influence fragmentation. In particular, we observed a significantly different branching fraction for spectator states compared with participator states. In addition, it was also observed that the bonds broken for the spectator states correlate with the antibonding nature of the spectator–electron orbital.},

To give the correct electron spin splitting of the X Σ − 4 state, electron spin dipolar interaction within the ground state and the spin–orbit coupling between X Σ − 4 and two excited states, A Π 4 and 1 Σ + 2 ⁠ , are calculated ab initio alongside hyperfine interaction terms. Four hyperfine coupling terms are explicitly considered: Fermi-contact interaction, electron spin-nuclear spin dipolar interaction, nuclear spin-rotation interaction, and nuclear electric quadrupole interaction. These terms are included as part of a full variational solution of the nuclear-motion Schrödinger equation performed using program Duo , which is used to generate both hyperfine-resolved energy levels and spectra. To improve the accuracy of the model, ab initio curves are subject to small shifts. The energy levels generated by this model show good agreement with the recently derived empirical term values.

  abstract = {Ultraviolet photodissociation processes of gas phase Mg + –NO complex were studied by photofragment ion imaging experiments and theoretical calculations for excited electronic states. At 355 nm excitation, both Mg + and NO + photofragment ions were observed with positive anisotropy parameters, and theoretical calculations revealed that the two dissociation channels originate from an electronic transition from a bonding orbital consisting of Mg + 3s and NO π* orbitals to an antibonding counterpart. For the NO + channel, the photofragment image exhibited a high anisotropy ( β = 1.53 ± 0.07), and a relatively large fraction (∼40\%) of the available energy was partitioned into translational energy. These observations are rationalized by proposing a rapid dissociation process on a repulsive potential energy surface correlated to the Mg( 1 S) + NO + ( 1 Σ) dissociation limit. In contrast, for the Mg + channel, the angular distribution was more isotropic ( β = 0.48 ± 0.03) and only ∼25\% of the available energy was released into translational energy. The differences in the recoil distribution for these competing channels imply a reaction branching on the excited state surface. On the theoretical potential surface of the excited state, we found a deep well facilitating an isomerization from bent geometry in the Franck–Condon region to linear and/or T-shaped isomer. As a result, the Mg + fragment was formed via the structural change followed by further relaxation to lower electronic states correlated to the Mg + ( 2 S) + NO( 2 Π) exit channel.},

Molecular orbital analysis shows that the orbitals for the populations of the valence electron locate at each Au 3 (2e) and Au 4 (2e), which demonstrates the reliability of the grand unified model.

By solving nonsecular Bloch–Redfield master equations, we obtain analytical results for the ground-state population and coherence dynamics and classify the dynamical regimes of the incoherently driven Λ-system as underdamped and overdamped depending on whether the ratio Δ/[ rf ( p )] is greater or less than one, where Δ is the ground-state energy splitting, r is the incoherent pumping rate, and f ( p ) is a function of the transition dipole alignment parameter p . In the underdamped regime, we observe long-lived coherent dynamics that lasts for τ c ≃ 1/ r , even though the initial state of the Λ-system contains no coherences in the energy basis. In the overdamped regime for p = 1, we observe the emergence of coherent quasi-steady states with the lifetime τ c = 1.34( r /Δ 2 ), which have a low von Neumann entropy compared to conventional thermal states. We propose an experimental scenario for observing noise-induced coherent dynamics in metastable He* atoms driven by x-polarized incoherent light. Our results suggest that thermal excitations can generate experimentally observable long-lived quantum coherent dynamics in the ground-state subspace of atomic and molecular Λ-systems in the absence of coherent driving.},

A detailed dynamics and mechanism analysis was carried out on this potential energy surface using the quasi-classical trajectory approach. It is verified that the trajectories do not follow the minimum energy path (MEP), but directly dissociate to F − and CH 3 OH. In addition, a new transition state for proton exchange and a new product complex CH 2 F − ⋯H 2 O for proton abstraction were discovered. The trajectories avoid the transition state or this complex, instead dissociate to H 2 O and CH 2 F − directly through the ridge regions of the minimum energy path before the transition state. These non-MEP dynamics become more pronounced at high collision energies. Detailed dynamic simulations provide new insights into the atomic-level mechanisms of the title reaction, thanks to the new chemically accurate PES, with the aid of machine learning.},

The time-dependent changes of nonlinear IR signals reflecting fast molecular processes such as vibrational energy transfer and chemical exchange provide invaluable information on the rates and mechanisms of solvation dynamics and structural transitions of multispecies vibrationally interacting molecular systems. However, due to the intrinsic difficulties in distinguishing the contributions of molecule-specific processes to the time-resolved IR signals from those resulting from local heating, it becomes challenging to interpret time-resolved IR-PP and 2D-IR spectra exhibiting transient growing-in spectral components and cross-peaks unambiguously. Here, theoretical considerations of various effects of vibrational coupling, energy transfer, chemical exchange, the generation of hot ground states, molecular photothermal process, and their combinations on the line shapes and time-dependent intensities of IR-PP spectra and 2D-IR diagonal peaks and cross-peaks are presented. We anticipate that the present work will help researchers using IR pump–probe and 2D-IR techniques to distinguish local heating-induced photothermal signals from genuine nonlinear IR signals.},

Furthermore, we show that in the off-half-filling Hubbard model at U / t = 8, the real-space (site) representation has a much weaker sign problem compared to the momentum space representation. By applying importance sampling using a Gutzwiller-like guiding wavefunction, we are able to substantially reduce the minimum number of walkers in the case of 2 × ℓ Hubbard ladders, enabling us to get exact energies for sizable ladders. With these results, we calculate the fundamental charge gap Δ E fund = E ( N + 1) + E ( N − 1) − 2 E ( N ) for the ladder systems compared to strictly one-dimensional Hubbard chains and show that the ladder systems have a reduced fundamental gap compared to the 1D chains.},

In this contribution, we investigate some aspects of an ansatz, using generalized two-body excitation operators, which have been considered in some recent studies on quantum algorithms for quantum chemistry. Our numerical results show that, in particular, two-body operators with effective particle–hole excitation level of one in connection with the usual particle–hole double excitation operators lead to a very accurate, yet compact representation of the wavefunction. Generalized two-body operators with effective excitation rank zero have a considerably less pronounced effect. We compare with standard and unitary coupled-cluster expansions and show that the above mentioned approach matches or even surpasses the accuracy of expansions with three-body particle–hole excitations, in particular at the onset of strong correlation. A downside of the approach is that it is rather difficult to rigorously converge it to its variational minimum.},

  abstract = {Accurate theoretical prediction of the band offsets at interfaces of semiconductor heterostructures can often be quite challenging. Although density functional theory has been reasonably successful to carry out such calculations, efficient, accurate semilocal functionals are desirable to reduce the computational cost. In general, the semilocal functionals based on the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) significantly underestimate the bulk bandgaps. This, in turn, results in inaccurate estimates of the band offsets at the heterointerfaces. In this paper, we investigate the performance of several advanced meta-GGA functionals in the computational prediction of band offsets at semiconductor heterojunctions. In particular, we investigate the performance of r 2 SCAN (two times revised strongly constrained and appropriately normed functional), rMGGAC (revised semilocal functional based on cuspless hydrogen model and Pauli kinetic energy density functional), mTASK (modified Aschebrock and Kümmel meta-GGA functional), and local modified Becke–Johnson exchange-correlation functionals. Our results strongly suggest that these meta-GGA functionals for supercell calculations perform quite well, especially, when compared to computationally more demanding GW calculations. We also present band offsets calculated using ionization potentials and electron affinities, as well as band alignment via the branch point energies. Overall, our study shows that the aforementioned meta-GGA functionals can be used within the density functional theory framework to estimate the band offsets in semiconductor heterostructures with predictive accuracy.},

Existing methods, however, can struggle in problems with a large number of degrees of freedom, on-the-fly adaptive remeshing and coarse-graining, and energy landscapes that are locally flat or discontinuous. To resolve these challenges, we introduce a new double-ended method, the Binary-Image Transition State Search (BITSS). It uses just two states that converge to the transition state, resulting in a fast, flexible, and memory-efficient method. We also show that it is more robust compared to existing bracketing methods that use only two states. We demonstrate its versatility by applying BITSS to three very different classes of problems: Lennard-Jones clusters, shell buckling, and multiphase phase-field models.},

The method enables theoretical predictions of dynamical response properties of finite systems after partitioning of the frequency-dependent molecular response function. Parameters in this model are computed simply as expectation values of an electronic wavefunction, and the hardness matrix is entirely reused from ACKS2 as an adiabatic approximation is used. A numerical validation shows that accurate models can already be obtained with atomic monopoles and dipoles. Absorption spectra of 42 organic and inorganic molecular monomers are evaluated using ACKS2 ω , and our results agree well with the time-dependent DFT calculations. Also for the calculation of C 6 dispersion coefficients, ACKS2 ω closely reproduces its TDDFT reference.

  abstract = {Computational analysis of difference spectra between two analogous systems is a challenging issue, as reliable estimation of a tiny difference spectrum requires an extraordinary precision of the two original spectra. We have developed an alternative new method to calculate the difference spectra under background-free conditions, which greatly improved the efficiency of computation. In this paper, we report further improvement by using efficient parallel implementation and the time correlation formula based on time derivative quantities. As a consequence, the present work achieved further remarkable acceleration in the calculations of difference infrared and Raman spectra in the order of magnitude and thereby allowed us by analyzing these difference spectra at a practical cost of computation.},

  abstract = {In the variational subspace valence bond (VSVB) [G. D. Fletcher, J. Chem. Phys. 142 , 134112 (2015)] method, the electronic orbitals comprising the wave function correspond to chemically meaningful objects, such as bonds, lone pairs, atomic cores, and so on. Selected regions of a molecule (for example, a single chemical bond, as opposed to all the bonds) can be modeled with different levels of basis set and possible methods for modeling correlation from the other regions. The interactions between the components of a molecule (say, a bond and a neighboring orbital) can then be studied in detail for their impact on a chemical phenomenon while avoiding the expense of necessarily applying the higher levels and methods to the entire molecule. This work presents the theoretical basis for modeling correlation effects between specific electron pairs by incorporating terms in the inter-electronic coordinates (“ r 12 ”) into VSVB. The approach is validated with calculations on small systems using single-reference wave functions.},

  abstract = {When plasmonic excitations of metallic interfaces and nanostructures interact with electronic excitations in semiconductors, new states emerge that hybridize the characteristics of the uncoupled states. The engendered properties make these hybrid states appealing for a broad range of applications, ranging from photovoltaic devices to integrated circuitry for quantum devices. Here, through quantum modeling, the coupling of surface plasmon polaritons and mobile two-dimensional excitons such as those in atomically thin semiconductors is examined with emphasis on the case of strong coupling. Our model shows that at around the energy crossing of the dispersion relationships of the uncoupled species, they strongly interact and polariton states—propagating plexcitons—emerge. The temporal evolution of the system where surface plasmon polaritons are continuously injected into the system is simulated to gain initial insight on potential experimental realizations of these states. The results show a steady state that is dominated by the lower-energy polariton. The study theoretically further establishes the possible existence of propagating plexcitons in atomically thin semiconductors and provides important guidance for the experimental detection and characterization of such states for a wide range of optoelectronic technologies.},

We present a derivation of the harmonic vibrational auto-correlation function that is valid for both real and imaginary harmonic frequencies. The derivation rests on Lie algebra techniques that map otherwise complicated exponential operator arithmetic to simpler matrix formulas. The expressions for the zero- and finite-temperature harmonic auto-correlation functions have been carefully structured both to be free of branch-cut discontinuities and to remain numerically stable with finite-precision arithmetic. Simple extensions correct the harmonic Franck–Condon approximation for the lowest-order anharmonic and Herzberg–Teller effects. Quantitative simulations are shown for several examples, including the electronic absorption spectra of F 2 , HOCl, CH 2 NH, and NO 2 .},

  abstract = {Methods for correcting residual energy errors of configuration interaction (CI) calculations of molecules and other electronic systems are discussed based on the assumption that the energy defect can be mapped onto atomic regions. The methods do not consider the detailed nature of excitations but instead define a defect energy per electron that is unique to a specific atom. Defect energy contributions are determined from calculations on diatomic and hydride molecules and then applied to other systems. Calculated energies are compared with experimental thermodynamic and spectroscopic data for a set of 41 mainly organic molecules representing a wide range of bonding environments. The most stringent test is based on a severely truncated virtual space in which higher spherical harmonic basis functions are removed. The errors of the initial CI calculations are large, but in each case, including defect corrections brings calculated CI energies into agreement with experimental values. The method is also applied to a NIST compilation of coupled cluster calculations that employ a larger basis set and no truncation of the virtual space. The corrections show excellent consistency with total energies in very good agreement with experimental values. An extension of the method is applied to d m s n states of Sc, Ti, V, Mn, Cr, Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu, significantly improving the agreement of calculated transition energies with spectroscopic values.},

The strength of adsorption of PAA on the particles, driven by pH-dependent interactions with polymer brush stabilizers on the particle surfaces, was tuned via solution pH. Particle–polymer suspensions formulated at low pH, where polymers strongly adsorbed to the particles, contained clusters or weak gels at particle volume fractions of ϕ = 0.15 and ϕ = 0.40. At high pH, where the PAA only weakly adsorbed to the particle surface, particles largely remained dispersed, and the suspensions behaved as a dense fluid. The ability to visualize the suspension structure is likely to provide insight into the role of polymer-driven bridging interactions in the behavior of colloidal suspensions.},

The polymers are modeled as discrete Gaussian chains with N = 90 monomers, and the incompressibility is treated by a partial saddle-point approximation. Our implementation of WTMD proves effective at locating the ODT of the lamellar and cylindrical regions, but it has difficulty with that of the spherical and gyroid regions. In the latter two cases, our choice of order parameter cannot sufficiently distinguish the ordered and disordered states because of the similarity in microstructures. The gyroid phase has the added complication that it competes with a number of other morphologies, and thus, it might be beneficial to extend the WTMD to multiple order parameters. Nevertheless, when the method works, the ODT can be located with impressive accuracy (e.g., Δ χN ∼ 0.01).},

We increase the accuracy of NEP models both by improving the radial functions in the atomic-environment descriptor using a linear combination of Chebyshev basis functions and by extending the angular descriptor with some four-body and five-body contributions as in the atomic cluster expansion approach. We also detail our efficient implementation of the NEP approach in graphics processing units as well as our workflow for the construction of NEP models and demonstrate their application in large-scale atomistic simulations. By comparing to state-of-the-art MLPs, we show that the NEP approach not only achieves above-average accuracy but also is far more computationally efficient. These results demonstrate that the gpumd package is a promising tool for solving challenging problems requiring highly accurate, large-scale atomistic simulations. To enable the construction of MLPs using a minimal training set, we propose an active-learning scheme based on the latent space of a pre-trained NEP model.

Here, we report on the role of the surface morphology, size, and anchored site of Pd catalysts coupled to plasmonic metasurfaces formed by periodic arrays of multimetallic Ni/Au nanopillars for formic acid electro-oxidation reaction (FAOR). We compare the activity of two kinds of metasurfaces differing in the positioning of the catalytic Pd nanoparticles. In the first case, the Pd nanoparticles have a polyhedron crystal morphology with exposed (200) facets and were deposited over the Ni/Au metasurfaces in a site-selective fashion by limiting their growth at the electromagnetic hot spots (Ni/Au–Pd@W). In contrast, the second case consists of spherical Pd nanoparticles grown in solution, which are homogeneously deposited onto the Ni/Au metasurface (Ni/Au–Pd@M). Ni/Au–Pd@W catalytic metasurfaces demonstrated higher light-enhanced FAOR activity (61\%) in comparison to the Ni/Au–Pd@M sample (42\%) for the direct dehydrogenation pathway. Moreover, the site-selective Pd deposition promotes the growth of nanoparticles favoring a more selective catalytic behavior and a lower degree of CO poisoning on Pd surface. The use of cyclic voltammetry, energy-resolved incident photon to current conversion efficiency, open circuit potential, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy highlights the role of plasmonic near fields and hot holes in driving the catalytic enhancement under light conditions.},

In this study, three-dimensional (3D) cross-linked electromagnetic wave absorbing composites with the carbon nanofiber/Fe 3 O 4 (CNF/Fe 3 O 4 ) core–shell structure were synthesized by expanding the interface of the heterogeneous structure with Fe 3 O 4 nanocrystals uniformly modified on the surface of the carbon nanofiber. The 3D cross-linked structure of the composites contributes to the generation of conductive loss and macroscopic eddy current loss. The heterogeneous interface formed by graphite nanocrystals and amorphous carbon in the carbon nanofiber is identified by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy as having a strong electromagnetic wave absorption capacity for boundary-type defects. The Fe 3 O 4 nanocrystal particles on the surface of the carbon nanofiber not only have the strong magnetic loss capability of magnetic materials but also form a new heterogeneous interface with the carbon nanofiber surface, which further enhances the interfacial polarization of the composite and improves the electromagnetic wave absorption properties. With the synergistic effects of interfacial polarization, macroscopic and microscopic eddy current losses, conductive losses, and magnetic losses, the electromagnetic wave absorption performance of the composites is further enhanced based on the carbon nanofiber. The reflection loss reaches −51.11, −42.99, and −55.98 dB at 9, 12 (X-band), and 17 GHz (Ku-band), respectively, corresponding to the thicknesses of 2.0, 1.5, and 1.0 mm.

However, the low Faradaic efficiency due to the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and inert N≡N triple bond activation hinders its practical application. To find highly efficient electrocatalysts with excellent activity, stability and selectivity, we have studied a series of transition metal dimers (TM 2 ) loaded on poly triazine imide, (PTI) a crystalline carbon nitride, by density functional theory calculations. The results show that most of the metal dimers have good stability. Finally, among 26 homonuclear diatomic catalysts, Mo 2 @PTI, Re 2 @PTI, and Pt 2 @PTI exhibit strong capability for suppressing HER, with a favorable limiting potential of −0.53, −0.36, and −0.63 V, respectively, and hence, can be used as efficient electrocatalysts for NRR.

  abstract = {The transport of fluids at the nanoscale is fundamental to manifold biological and industrial processes, ranging from neurotransmission to ultrafiltration. Yet, it is only recently that well-controlled channels with cross sections as small as a few molecular diameters became an experimental reality. When aqueous electrolytes are confined within such channels, the Coulomb interactions between the dissolved ions are reinforced due to dielectric contrast at the channel walls: We dub this effect “interaction confinement.” Yet, no systematic way of computing these confined interactions has been proposed beyond the limiting cases of perfectly metallic or perfectly insulating channel walls. Here, we introduce a new formalism, based on the so-called surface response functions, that expresses the effective Coulomb interactions within a two-dimensional channel in terms of the wall’s electronic structure, described to any desired level of precision. We use it to demonstrate that in few-nanometer-wide channels, the ionic interactions can be tuned by the wall material’s screening length. We illustrate this approach by implementing these interactions in Brownian dynamics simulations of a strongly confined electrolyte and show that the resulting ionic conduction can be adjusted between Ohm’s law and a Wien effect behavior. Our results provide a quantitative approach to tuning nanoscale ion transport through the electronic properties of the channel wall material.},

In this study, we used metal–organic chemical vapor deposition to directly grow a pitted a -plane GaN thin film, subsequently covered by a thin Au layer (∼25 nm), for use as a SERS substrate, without the need for any additional etching or lithography process. The SERS substrate containing these micrometer-sized pits provided a low limit of detection (∼10 −9 M) for Rhodamine 6G (R6G), with a high enhancement factor (4.27 × 10 8 ) relative to normal Raman spectroscopy. Furthermore, Raman spectral mapping indicated that most of the R6G molecules were concentrated in the pits, enhancing the localization of the probe molecules for further analysis. The same molecular localization phenomenon was also effective for polar methylene blue but not for nonpolar paraffin. The molecular aggregation became more ambiguous upon increasing the thickness of the Au layer, suggesting that the polarity of the Ga and N atoms in the pits was responsible for the efficient aggregation of the polar R6G molecules, which could be potentially beneficial for biomedical detection.},

Droplets in the air associated with these issues are often at subzero temperatures. However, experimental results on the freezing of precooled impinged droplets are limited. In this study, we measured the freezing of precooled and impinged water droplets on cold glass surfaces. Two types of lattice-patterned microscale grooves were formed on glass surfaces to reduce the contact area of droplets and growth of frosts, which contributed to droplet freezing. In addition, the surfaces were coated with a silane coupling agent to further reduce the contact area. We analyzed the images of droplets captured using a high-speed video camera. The results of the linear relationships between the frozen droplet height, freezing front velocity, and freezing time (for the impinged droplets) indicated that the grooves and coating were effective in retarding the freezing of impinged droplets. This retardation was more evident for frost-free glass surfaces, and it was less evident for precooled droplets. Moreover, a simple heat transfer analysis was conducted to effectively estimate the overall heat flux and freezing front velocity. The sublimation of frost (adjacent to the impinged droplets) and supercool elimination of the precooled droplets significantly contributed to the heat flux and caused an increase in the freezing front velocity.},

  abstract = {Despite decades of extensive research, the behavior of confined liquids, particularly in the mixed/boundary lubrication regime, remains unelucidated. This can be attributed to several factors, including the difficulty to make direct experimental observations of the behavior of lubricant molecules under nonequilibrium conditions, the high computational cost of molecular simulations to reach steady state, and the low signal-to-noise ratio at extremely low shear rates corresponding to actual operating conditions. In this regard, we studied the correlation between the structure formation and shear viscosity of octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane confined between two mica surfaces in a mixed/boundary lubrication regime. Three different surface separations—corresponding to two-, three-, and five-layered structures—were considered to analyze the effect of confinement. The orientational distributions with one specific peak for n = 2 and two distributions, including a parallel orientation with the surface normal for n &gt; 2, were observed at rest. The confined liquids exhibited a distinct shear-thinning behavior independent of surface separations for a relatively low shear rate, γ ̇ ≲ 1 0 8 s − 1 ⁠ . However, the shear viscosities at γ ̇ ≲ 1 0 8 s − 1 depended on the number of layered structures. Newtonian behavior was observed with further increase in the shear rate. Furthermore, we found a strong correlation between the degree of molecular orientation and the shear viscosity of the confined liquids. The magnitude of the shear viscosity of the confined liquids can primarily be determined by the degree of molecular orientation, and shear thinning originates from the vanishing of specific orientational distributions with increasing shear rate.},

  abstract = {The interaction strength of the nanoparticles (NPs) with the supporting substrate can greatly influence both the rate and selectivity of catalytic reactions, but the origins of these changes in reactivity arising from the combined effects of NP structure and composition, and NP–substrate interaction is currently not well-understood. Since the dynamics of the NPs is implicated in many NP-based catalytic processes, we investigate how the supporting substrate alters the dynamics of representative Cu NPs on a model graphene substrate, and a formal extension of this model in which the interaction strength between the NPs and the substrate is varied. We particularly emphasize how the substrate interaction strength alters the local mobility and potential energy fluctuations in the NP interfacial region, given the potential relevance of such fluctuations to NP reactivity. We find the NP melting temperature T m progressively shifts downward with an increasing NP–substrate interaction strength, and that this change in NP thermodynamic stability is mirrored by changes in local mobility and potential energy fluctuations in the interfacial region that can be described as “colored noise.” Atomic diffusivity, D , in the “free” and substrate NP interfacial regions is quantified, and observed variations are rationalized by the localization model linking D to the mean square atomic displacement on a “caging” timescale on the order of a picosecond. In summary, we find that the supporting substrate strongly modulates the stability and dynamics of supported NPs—effects that have evident practical relevance for understanding changes in NP catalytic behavior derived from the supporting substrate.},

Fourteen state points at a liquid and a supercritical isotherm were simulated. To obtain results representative for macroscopic systems, simulations with several particle numbers were carried out and extrapolated to the thermodynamic limit. Our results agree well with experimental data from the literature, an accurate equation of state for krypton, and a recent virial equation of state (VEOS) for krypton in the region where the VEOS has converged. These results demonstrate that very good agreement between simulation and experiment can only be achieved if nonadditive three-body interactions and quantum effects are taken into account.},

Here, we report the existence of a novel reentrant structural transition in a S-rich arsenic sulfide liquid of composition As 2.5 S 97.5 . The nature of this transition and its effect on viscosity are investigated in situ using a combination of differential scanning calorimetry and simultaneous Raman spectroscopic and rheometric measurements. The results indicate that, upon heating significantly above its glass transition temperature (261 K), the constituent S n sulfur chains in the structure of the supercooled liquid first undergo a S n ⇌ S 8 chain-to-ring conversion near ∼383 K, which is exothermic in nature. Further heating above 393 K alters the equilibrium to shift in the opposite direction toward an endothermic ring-to-chain conversion characteristic of the well-known λ-transition in pure sulfur liquid. This behavior is attributed to the competing effects of enthalpy of mixing and conformational entropy of ring and chain elements in the liquid. The existence of reentrant structural transitions in glass-forming liquids could provide important insights into the thermodynamics of liquid–liquid transitions and may have important consequences for harnessing novel functionalities of derived glasses.},

[Phys. Rev. A 21 , 1756 (1980)], which employs an imposed cyclic density variation on the system by affine scaling of the particle coordinates. The time-stepping method employed for HS is validated against exact event-driven hard sphere methodology for a series of equilibrium quantities over a wide density range, including the pressure, singular parts of the hard sphere viscosities, and the nonsingular parts of the shear viscosity time correlation functions. The time steps used are typically only a little smaller than those employed in continuous potential simulations. Exact pressure tensor fluctuation expressions are derived for the singular (or infinite limiting frequency) equilibrium parts of the viscosities, which were employed in the simulations. The values obtained agree well with the predictions of the Enskog theory for all densities considered. The bulk viscosity obtained by NEMD is shown to be noticeably frequency dependent for densities in excess of ∼0.8, decaying approximately exponentially to the Enskog and equilibrium simulation values at all densities considered for frequencies in excess of ∼5 in hard sphere units. Temperature profiles during the cycle and the effects of strain amplitude on the computed frequency dependent bulk viscosity are presented. The bulk viscosity increases with the maximum density amplitude.},

The particle–particle and the particle–tether collision rates are related to the phase space geometry and are used to study the FCC and fluid states. In tethered systems, the entropy can be determined by at least two routes: (i) through integration of the tether collision rates with the tether length r T or (ii) through integration of the particle–particle collision rates with the hard-sphere diameter σ (or, equivalently, the density). If the entropy were an entirely analytic function of r T and σ , these two methods for calculating the entropy should lead to the same results; however, a non-analytic region exists as an extension of the solid–fluid phase transition of the untethered hard-sphere system, and integration paths that cross this region will lead to values for the entropy that depend on the particular path chosen. The difference between the calculated entropies appears to be related to the communal entropy, and the location of the non-analytic region appears to be related to conditions where the regions of phase space associated with the FCC configuration become separated from those associated with the disordered fluid. The non-analytic region is finite in extent, vanishing below r T / a ≈ 0.55, where a is the lattice spacing, and there are many continuous paths that connect the fluid and solid phases that can be used to determine the crystal free energy with respect to the fluid.},

The ground state isomer of GaMg 8 with high symmetry structure is predicted to be the best-fit candidate for the “magic” cluster because of its excellent stability. Natural bond orbital calculations reveal that Ga and Mg atoms play the role of electron acceptor and donor in all ground state isomers, while the orbitals in both Ga and Mg are sp-hybridized. Most importantly, chemical bonding studies based on atom-in-molecular theory have shown that the lowest-energy state of GaMg 4 is so special, in that it has not only the critical size for the appearance of Mg–Mg covalent bonds, but also the only cluster that has both Ga–Mg covalent and non-covalent bonds. Finally, theoretical calculations of IR and Raman spectra of all ground state isomers indicate that the spectra of these clusters are observable in the low-frequency band, and thus they can be identified by spectroscopic experiments. Furthermore, the bond heterogeneity of the Ga–Mg in the GaMg 4 ground state isomer has also been specifically investigated, including the fixed GaMg 4 structure with Mg atoms added in different directions, as well as ab initio molecular dynamics sampling at different temperatures.},

The instrument was used to study the pyrolysis behavior of mass-selected (V 2 O 5 ) N O − ( N = 1–6) cluster anions and the dissociation channels were clarified with atomistic precision. Similar to the dissociation behavior of the heated metal oxide cluster cations reported in literature, the desorption of either atomic oxygen atom or molecular O 2 prevailed for the (V 2 O 5 ) N O − clusters with N = 2–5 at 873 K. However, novel dissociation channels involving fragmentation of (V 2 O 5 ) N O − to small-sized V x O y − anions concurrent with the release of neutral vanadium oxide species were identified for the clusters with N = 3–6. Significant variations in branching ratios for different dissociation channels were observed as a function of cluster size. Kinetic studies indicated that the dissociation rates of (V 2 O 5 ) N O − monotonically increased with the increase in cluster size. The internal energies carried by the (V 2 O 5 ) N O − clusters at 873 K as well as the energetics data for dissociation channels have been theoretically calculated to rationalize the experimental observations. The decomposition behavior of vanadium oxide clusters from this study can provide new insights into the pyrolysis mechanism of metal oxide nanoparticles that are widely used in high temperature catalysis.},

  abstract = {Examples of extracting meaningful information from image projection data using tomographic reconstruction techniques can be found in many areas of science. Within the photochemical dynamics community, tomography allows for complete three-dimensional (3D) charged particle momentum distributions to be reconstructed following a photodissociation or photoionization event. This permits highly differential velocity- and angle-resolved measurements to be made simultaneously. However, the generalized tomographic reconstruction strategies typically adopted for use with photochemical imaging—based around the Fourier-slice theorem and filtered back-projection algorithms—are not optimized for these specific types of problems. Here, we discuss pre-existing alternative strategies—namely, the simultaneous iterative reconstruction technique and Hankel Transform Reconstruction (HTR)—and introduce them in the context of velocity-map imaging applications. We demonstrate the clear advantages they afford, and how they can perform considerably better than approaches commonly adopted at present. Most notably, with HTR we can set a bound on the minimum number of projections required to reliably reconstruct 3D photoproduct distributions. This bound is significantly lower than what is currently accepted and will help make tomographic imaging far more accessible and efficient for many experimentalists working in the field of photochemical dynamics.},

The result is a sequence of letters, s ∈ {A,T,C,G}, or a gene, that describes the perimeter of the colloidal object and programs its self-assembly. This represents a genome that is finite and can be exhaustively enumerated. These genes derive from symmetry, which may be topologically represented by two-dimensional parabolic orbifolds; since these orbifolds are surfaces that may be derived from first principles, this represents an ab initio route to colloid functionality. The genes are human readable and can be employed to easily design colloidal units.

  abstract = {Quantum time correlation functions (TCFs) involving two states are important for describing nonadiabatic dynamical processes such as charge transfer (CT). Based on a previous single-state method, we propose an imaginary-time open-chain path-integral (OCPI) approach for evaluating the two-state symmetrized TCFs. Expressing the forward and backward propagation on different electronic potential energy surfaces as a complex-time path integral, we then transform the path variables to average and difference variables such that the integration over the difference variables up to the second order can be performed analytically. The resulting expression for the symmetrized TCF is equivalent to sampling the open-chain configurations in an effective potential that corresponds to the average surface. Using importance sampling over the extended OCPI space via open path-integral molecular dynamics, we tested the resulting path-integral approximation by calculating the Fermi’s golden rule CT rate constant within a widely used spin-boson model. Comparing with the real-time linearized semiclassical method and analytical result, we show that the imaginary-time OCPI provides an accurate two-state symmetrized TCF and rate constant in the typical turnover region. It is shown that the first bead of the open chain corresponds to physical zero-time and that the endpoint bead corresponds to final time t ; oscillations of the end-to-end distance perfectly match the nuclear mode frequency. The two-state OCPI scheme is seen to capture the tested model’s electronic quantum coherence and nuclear quantum effects accurately.},

In this article, we examine a particle diffusing in an annulus with an inner absorbing boundary and an outer reflective boundary. We obtain analytic expressions for the joint distribution of the hitting time and the hitting angle in two and three dimensions. For certain configurations, we observe a “diffusive echo,” i.e., two well-defined maxima in the first passage time distribution to a targeted position on the absorbing boundary. This effect, which results from the interplay between the starting location and the environmental constraints, may help to significantly increase the efficiency of the random search by generating a high, sustained flux to the targeted position over a short period. Finally, we examine the corresponding one-dimensional system for which there is no well-defined echo. In a confined system, the flux integrated over all target positions always displays a shoulder. This does not, however, guarantee the presence of an echo in the joint distribution.},

In this work, we present an analysis of the exact theory that allows one to infer the effects of such approximations on the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital eigenvalues. Then, we show the importance of the asymptotic behavior of the XC potential in the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) in the case of the NCAPR functional (nearly correct asymptotic potential revised) for determining the shift of the frontier orbital eigenvalues toward the exact values. Thereby we establish a procedure at the GGA level of refinement that allows one to make a single calculation to determine the ionization potential, the electron affinity, and the hardness of molecules (and its solid counterpart, the bandgap) with an accuracy equivalent to that obtained for those properties through energy differences, a procedure that requires three calculations. For solids, the accuracy achieved for the bandgap lies rather close to that which is obtained through hybrid XC energy functionals, but those also demand much greater computational effort than what is required with the simple NCAPR GGA calculation.},

  abstract = {A model designed to mimic the implications of the collective optical response of molecular ensembles in optical cavities on molecular vibronic dynamics is investigated. Strong molecule–radiation field coupling is often reached when a large number N of molecules respond collectively to the radiation field. In electronic strong coupling, molecular nuclear dynamics following polariton excitation reflects (a) the timescale separation between the fast electronic and photonic dynamics and the slow nuclear motion on one hand and (b) the interplay between the collective nature of the molecule–field coupling and the local nature of the molecules nuclear response on the other. The first implies that the electronic excitation takes place, in the spirit of the Born approximation, at an approximately fixed nuclear configuration. The second can be rephrased as the intriguing question of whether the collective nature of optical excitation leads to collective nuclear motion following polariton formation resulting in so-called polaron decoupled dynamics. We address this issue by studying the dynamical properties of a simplified Holstein–Tavis–Cummings-type model, in which boson modes representing molecular vibrations are replaced by two-level systems, while the boson frequency and the vibronic coupling are represented by the coupling between these levels (that induces Rabi oscillations between them) and electronic state dependence of this coupling. We investigate the short-time behavior of this model following polariton excitation as well as its response to CW driving and its density of states spectrum. We find that, while some aspects of the dynamical behavior appear to adhere to the polaron decoupling picture, the observed dynamics mostly reflect the local nature of the nuclear configuration of the electronic polariton rather than this picture.},

Certainly, the ultimate goal is to be able to compute these macroscopic properties from first-principles calculations beginning with the very atomic constitution of matter. In this work, Mie potential parameters were obtained through dimer interaction energy curves derived from ab initio calculations to represent methane and substituted-methane molecules in a spherical one-site coarse-grained model. Bottom-up-based Mie potential parameters of this work were compared with top-down-based ones from the statistical associating fluid theory (SAFT) models for the calculation of thermodynamic properties and critical point by molecular dynamics simulations and SAFT-VR Mie equation of state. Results demonstrated that bottom-up-based Mie potential parameters when averaging the Mie potential parameters of a representative population of conformers provide values close to the top-down-based ones from SAFT models and predict well properties of tetrahedral molecules. This shows the level of consistency embedded in the SAFT-VR Mie family of models and confers the status of a purely predictive equation of state for SAFT-VR Mie when a reasonable model is considered to represent a molecule of interest.},

Both approaches, dubbed amfX2C and e(xtended)amfX2C, allow us to uniquely tailor PCE corrections to mean-field models, viz. Hartree–Fock or Kohn–Sham DFT, in the latter case also avoiding the need for a point-wise calculation of exchange–correlation PCE corrections. We assess the numerical performance of these PCE correction models on spinor energies of group 18 (closed-shell) and group 16 (open-shell) diatomic molecules, achieving a consistent ≈ 1 0 − 5 Hartree accuracy compared to reference four-component data. Additional tests include SCF calculations of molecular properties such as absolute contact density and contact density shifts in copernicium fluoride compounds ( ⁠ CnF n ⁠ , n = 2,4,6), as well as equation-of-motion coupled-cluster calculations of x-ray core-ionization energies of 5 d - and 6 d -containing molecules, where we observe an excellent agreement with reference data. To conclude, we are confident that our (e)amfX2C PCE correction models constitute a fundamental milestone toward a universal and reliable relativistic two-component quantum-chemical approach, maintaining the accuracy of the parent four-component one at a fraction of its computational cost.},

In σ -functionals, the function of the eigenvalues σ of the Kohn–Sham response matrix that enters the coupling constant and frequency integration in the dRPA is replaced by another function optimized with the help of reference sets of atomization, reaction, transition state, and non-covalent interaction energies. σ -Functionals are highly accurate and yield chemical accuracy of 1 kcal/mol in reaction or transition state energies, in main group chemistry. A shortcoming of σ -functionals is their inability to accurately describe processes involving a change of the electron number, such as ionizations or electron attachments. This problem is attributed to unphysical self-interactions caused by the neglect of the exchange kernel in the dRPA and σ -functionals. Here, we tackle this problem by introducing a frequency- and σ -dependent scaling of the eigenvalues σ of the KS response function that models the effect of the exchange kernel. The scaling factors are determined with the help of the homogeneous electron gas. The resulting scaled σ -functionals retain the accuracy of their unscaled parent functionals but in addition yield very accurate ionization potentials and electron affinities. Moreover, atomization and total energies are found to be exceptionally accurate. Scaled σ -functionals are computationally highly efficient like their unscaled counterparts.},

  abstract = {It has been known for more than a decade that the gauge variance of the kinetic energy density τ leads to additional terms in the magnetic orbital rotation Hessian used in linear-response time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT), affecting excitation energies obtained with τ -dependent exchange–correlation functionals. While previous investigations found that a correction scheme based on the paramagnetic current density has a small effect on benchmark results, we report more pronounced effects here, in particular, for the popular M06-2X functional and for some other meta -generalized gradient approximations (mGGAs). In the first part of this communication, this is shown by a reassessment of a set of five Ni(II) complexes for which a previous benchmark study that did not impose gauge invariance has found surprisingly large errors for excitation energies obtained with M06-2X. These errors are more than halved by restoring gauge invariance. The variable importance of imposing gauge invariance for different mGGA-based functionals can be rationalized by the derivative of the mGGA exchange energy integrand with respect to τ . In the second part, a large set of valence excitations in small main-group molecules is analyzed. For M06-2X, several selected n → π * and π → π ⊥ * excitations are heavily gauge-dependent with average changes of −0.17 and −0.28 eV, respectively, while π → π ‖ * excitations are marginally affected (−0.04 eV). Similar patterns, but of the opposite signs, are found for SCAN0. The results suggest that reevaluation of previous gauge variant TDDFT results based on M06-2X and other mGGA functionals is warranted.},

  abstract = {For energy harvesting with plasmonic photocatalysis, it is important to optimize geometrical arrangements of plasmonic nanomaterials, electron (or hole) acceptors, and co-catalysts so as to improve the charge separation efficiency and suppress charge recombination. Here, we employ a photocatalytic system with Au nanocubes on TiO 2 and introduce MnO 2 as an oxidation co-catalyst onto the nanocubes via site-selective oxidation based on plasmon-induced charge separation (PICS). However, it has been known that PbO 2 is the only material that can be deposited onto Au nanomaterials through PICS with sufficient site-selectivity. Here we addressed this issue by introducing an indirect approach for MnO 2 deposition via site-selective PbO 2 deposition and subsequent galvanic replacement of PbO 2 with MnO 2 . The indirect approach gave nanostructures with MnO 2 introduced at around the top part, bottom part, or entire surface of the Au nanocubes on a TiO 2 electrode. The activity of those plasmonic photocatalysts was strongly dependent on the location of MnO 2 . The key to improving the activity is to separate MnO 2 from TiO 2 to prevent recombination of the positive charges in MnO 2 with the negative ones in TiO 2 .},

  abstract = {The ability of biomolecules to exert forces on their surroundings or resist compression from the environment is essential in a variety of biologically relevant contexts. For filaments in the low-temperature limit and under a constant compressive force, Euler buckling theory predicts a sudden transition from a compressed state to a bent state in these slender rods. In this paper, we use a mean-field theory to show that if a semiflexible chain is compressed at a finite temperature with a fixed end-to-end distance (permitting fluctuations in the compressive forces), it exhibits a continuous phase transition to a buckled state at a critical level of compression. We determine a quantitatively accurate prediction of the transverse position distribution function of the midpoint of the chain that indicates this transition. We find that the mean compressive forces are non-monotonic as the extension of the filament varies, consistent with the observation that strongly buckled filaments are less able to bear an external load. We also find that for the fixed extension (isometric) ensemble, the buckling transition does not coincide with the local minimum of the mean force (in contrast to Euler buckling). We also show that the theory is highly sensitive to fluctuations in length in two dimensions and the buckling transition can still be accurately recovered by accounting for those fluctuations. These predictions may be useful in understanding the behavior of filamentous biomolecules compressed by fluctuating forces, relevant in a variety of biological contexts.},

We derive a unified expression for the mean field free energy for the three geometrical classes. While for low grafting densities, the effect of chain elasticity can be neglected in poor solvent conditions, it becomes relevant at higher grafting densities and, in particular, for concave geometries. Based on the analysis of the end monomer distribution, we introduce an analytical term that describes the elasticity as a function of grafting density. The accuracy of the model is validated with molecular dynamics simulations as well as SCF computations and shown to yield precise values for the layer thickness over a wide range of system parameters. We further apply this model to analyze the gating behavior of switchable brushes inside nanochannels.},

The long time diffusivities of nanoparticles show a non-monotonic tendency at various nanoparticle–polymer interactions due to the intermittent hopping of nanoparticles through network cells. The preferred locations of small nanoparticles switch from the cell centers to the corners of cells as they interact with the network more strongly, which results in the hopping energy barrier between different cells switching from cell center localization to adsorption on networks. Steric hindrance seriously hampers large nanoparticles from hopping to neighboring network cells, and the interactions between the nanoparticle and network enhance the network deformability and also affect the hopping of nanoparticles. The multiple constraint mechanisms result in the non-monotonic diffusivities of nanoparticles with different interactions and non-Brownian motions at different time scales. Our work illustrates the hopping mechanisms of nanoparticles in polymer networks from thermodynamic and dynamic points of view.},

  abstract = {Under ambient atmospheric conditions, a thin film of water wets many solid surfaces, including insulators, ice, and salt. The film thickness as well as its transport behavior sensitively depend on the surrounding humidity. Understanding this intricate interplay is of the highest relevance for water transport through porous media, particularly in the context of soil salinization induced by evaporation. Here, we use molecular simulations to evaluate the transport properties of thin water films on prototypical salt and soil interfaces, namely NaCl and silica solid surfaces. Our results show two distinct regimes for water transport: at low water coverage, the film permeance scales linearly with the adsorbed amount, in agreement with the activated random walk model. For thicker water films, the permeance scales as the adsorbed amount to the power of 3, in line with the Stokes equation. By comparing results obtained for silica and NaCl surfaces, we find that, at low water coverage, water permeance at the silica surface is considerably lower than at the NaCl surface, which we attribute to difference in hydrogen bonding. We also investigate the effect of atomic surface defects on the transport properties. Finally, in the context of water transport through the porous material, we determine the humidity-dependent crossover between a vapor-dominated and a thin film-dominated transport regimes depending on the pore size.},

  abstract = {Interactions of N 2 at oxide surfaces are important for understanding electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) mechanisms. Interactions of N 2 at the polycrystalline vanadium oxide/vapor interface were monitored at room temperature and total pressures up to 10 −1 Torr using Near-Ambient Pressure X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (NAP-XPS). The oxide film was predominantly V(IV), with V(III) and V(V) components. XPS spectra were acquired in environments of both pure N 2 and equal pressures of N 2 and H 2 O vapor. In pure N 2 , broad, partially resolved N1s features were observed at binding energies of 401.0 and 398.7 eV, with a relative intensity of ∼3:1, respectively. These features remained upon subsequent pumpdown to 10 −9 Torr. The observed maximum N surface coverage was ∼1.5 × 10 13 cm −2 —a fraction of a monolayer. In the presence of equal pressures of H 2 O, the adsorbed N intensity at 10 −1 Torr is ∼25\% of that observed in the absence of H 2 O. The formation of molecularly adsorbed H 2 O was also observed. Density functional theory-based calculations suggest favorable absorption energies for N 2 bonding to both V(IV) and V(III) cation sites but less so for V(V) sites. Hartree–Fock-based cluster calculations for N 2 –V end-on adsorption show that experimental XPS doublet features are consistent with the calculated shake-up and normal, final ionic configurations for N 2 end-on bonding to V(III) sites but not V(IV) sites. The XPS spectra of vanadium oxide transferred in situ between electrochemical and UHV environments indicate that the oxide surfaces studied here are stable upon exposure to the electrolyte under NRR-relevant conditions.},

The freezing point depression of these mixtures is calculated and compared to experimental results.

Herein, we show that in situ mechanical vibration can facilitate the framework melting at a lower temperature and produce glassy metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) with unique properties. Using zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF)-62 as a concept-proofing material, in situ mechanical vibration enables low-temperature melting at 653 K, far below its melting point (713 K). The resultant vibrated ZIF-62 glass exhibited a lower glass transition temperature of 545 K, improved gas accessible porosity, and pronounced short-to-medium range structures compared to the corresponding melt-quenched glass. We propose that vibration-facilitated surface reconstruction facilitates pre-melting, which could be the cause of the lowered melting temperature. The vibration assisted method represents a new general method to produce MOF glasses without thermal decomposition.},

It is investigated here by means of accurate transport calculations with ab initio ion–atom potentials for the Cr, Co, and Ni cations in He buffer gas near room temperature. The values for the open-shell ions in degenerate states are shown to be well approximated by using the single isotropic interaction potential. Minimalistic implementation of the multireference configuration interaction (MRCI) method is enough to describe the zero-field transport properties of metastable ions in the 3 d m −1 4 s configuration, such as Cr + (a 6 D), Co + (a 5 F), and Ni + ( 4 F), due to their weak and almost isotropic interaction with He atom and the low sensitivity of the measured mobilities to the potential well region. By contrast, interactions involving the ions in the ground 3 d m states, such as Cr + (a 6 S), Co + (a 3 F), and Ni + ( 2 D), are strong and anisotropic; the MRCI potentials poorly describe their transport coefficients. Even the coupled cluster with singles, doubles, and non-iterative triples approach taking into account vectorial spin–orbit coupling may not be accurate enough, as shown here for Ni + ( 2 D). The sensitivity of ion mobility and the ESC effect to interaction potentials, similarities in ion–He interactions of the studied ions in distinct configurations, accuracy and possible improvements of the ab initio schemes, and control of the ESC effect by macroscopic parameters are discussed. Extensive sets of improved interaction potentials and transport data are generated.},

  abstract = {Kasha’s rule generally holds true for solid-state molecular systems, where the rates of internal conversion and vibrational relaxation are sufficiently higher than the luminescence rate. In contrast, in systems where plasmons and matter interact strongly, the luminescence rate is significantly enhanced, leading to the emergence of luminescence that does not obey Kasha’s rule. In this work, we investigate the anti-Kasha emissions of single molecules, free-base and magnesium naphthalocyanine (H 2 Nc and MgNc), in a plasmonic nanocavity formed between the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) and metal substrate. A narrow-line tunable laser was employed to precisely reveal the excited-state levels of a single molecule located under the tip and to selectively excite it into a specific excited state, followed by obtaining a STM-photoluminescence (STM-PL) spectrum to reveal the energy relaxation from the state. The excitation to higher-lying states of H 2 Nc caused various changes in the emission spectrum, such as broadening and the appearance of new peaks, implying the breakdown of Kasha’s rule. These observations indicate emissions from the vibrationally excited states in the first singlet excited state ( S 1 ) and second singlet excited state ( S 2 ), as well as internal conversion from S 2 to S 1 . Moreover, we obtained direct evidence of electronic and vibronic transitions from the vibrationally excited states, from the STM-PL measurements of MgNc. The results obtained herein shed light on the energy dynamics of molecular systems under a plasmonic field and highlight the possibility of obtaining various energy-converting functions using anti-Kasha processes.},

  abstract = {SiC 2 is a fascinating molecule due to its unusual bonding and astrophysical importance. In this work, we report the first global potential energy surface (PES) for ground-state SiC 2 using the combined-hyperbolic-inverse-power-representation method and accurate ab initio energies. The calibration grid data are obtained via a general dual-level protocol developed afresh herein that entails both coupled-cluster and multi-reference configuration interaction energies jointly extrapolated to the complete basis set limit. Such an approach is specially devised to recover much of the spectroscopy from the PES, while still permitting a proper fragmentation of the system to allow for reaction dynamics studies. Besides describing accurately the valence strongly bound region that includes both the cyclic global minimum and isomerization barriers, the final analytic PES form is shown to properly reproduce dissociation energies, diatomic potentials, and long-range interactions at all asymptotic channels, in addition to naturally reflect the correct permutational symmetry of the potential. Bound vibrational state calculations have been carried out, unveiling an excellent match of the available experimental data on c - S i C 2 ( A 1 1 ) ⁠ . To further exploit the global nature of the PES, exploratory quasi-classical trajectory calculations for the endothermic C 2 + Si → SiC + C reaction are also performed, yielding thermalized rate coefficients for temperatures up to 5000 K. The results hint for the prominence of this reaction in the innermost layers of the circumstellar envelopes around carbon-rich stars, hence conceivably playing therein a key contribution to the gas-phase formation of SiC, and eventually, solid SiC dust.},

  abstract = {Transient microscopy has emerged as a powerful tool for imaging the diffusion of excitons and free charge carriers in optoelectronic materials. In many excitonic materials, extraction of diffusion coefficients can be simplified because of the linear relationship between signal intensity and local excited state population. However, in materials where transport is dominated by free charge carriers, extracting diffusivities accurately from multidimensional data is complicated by the nonlinear dependence of the measured signal on the local charge carrier density. To obtain accurate estimates of charge carrier diffusivity from transient microscopy data, statistically robust fitting algorithms coupled to efficient 3D numerical solvers that faithfully relate local carrier dynamics to raw experimental measurables are sometimes needed. Here, we provide a detailed numerical framework for modeling the spatiotemporal dynamics of free charge carriers in bulk semiconductors with significant solving speed reduction and for simulating the corresponding transient photoluminescence microscopy data. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, we apply a fitting algorithm using a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler to experimental data on bulk CdS and methylammonium lead bromide (MAPbBr 3 ) crystals. Parameter analyses reveal that transient photoluminescence microscopy can be used to obtain robust estimates of charge carrier diffusivities in optoelectronic materials of interest, but that other experimental approaches should be used for obtaining carrier recombination constants. Additionally, simplifications can be made to the fitting model depending on the experimental conditions and material systems studied. Our open-source simulation code and fitting algorithm are made freely available to the scientific community.},

  abstract = {In microrheology, the local rheological properties, such as the viscoelasticity of a complex fluid, are inferred from the free or forced motion of embedded colloidal probe particles. Theoretical machinery developed for forced-probe microrheology of colloidal suspensions focused on either constant-force (CF) or constant-velocity (CV) probes, while in experiments, neither the force nor the kinematics of the probe is fixed. More importantly, the constraint of CF or CV introduces a difficulty in the meaningful quantification of the fluctuations of the probe due to a thermodynamic uncertainty relation. It is known that, for a Brownian particle trapped in a harmonic potential well, the product of the standard deviations of the trap force and the particle position is dk B T in d dimensions, with k B T being the thermal energy. As a result, if the force (position) is not allowed to fluctuate, the position (force) fluctuation becomes infinite. To allow the measurement of fluctuations in theoretical studies, in this work, we consider a microrheology model in which the embedded probe is dragged along by a moving harmonic potential so that both its position and the trap force are allowed to fluctuate. Starting from the full Smoluchowski equation governing the dynamics of N hard active Brownian particles, we derive a pair Smoluchowski equation describing the dynamics of the probe as it interacts with one bath particle by neglecting hydrodynamic interactions among particles in the dilute limit. From this, we determine the mean and the variance (i.e., fluctuation) of the probe position in terms of the pair probability distribution. We then characterize the behavior of the system in the limits of both weak and strong trap. By taking appropriate limits, we show that our generalized model can be reduced to the well-studied CF or CV microrheology models.},

  abstract = {Replica-exchange enveloping distribution sampling (RE-EDS) is a pathway-independent multistate free-energy method currently implemented in the GROMOS software package for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. It has a high intrinsic sampling efficiency as the interactions between the unperturbed particles have to be calculated only once for multiple end-states. As a result, RE-EDS is an attractive method for the calculation of relative solvation and binding free energies. An essential requirement for reaching this high efficiency is the separability of the nonbonded interactions into solute–solute, solute–environment, and environment–environment contributions. Such a partitioning is trivial when using a Coulomb term with a reaction-field (RF) correction to model the electrostatic interactions but not when using lattice-sum schemes. To avoid cutoff artifacts, the RF correction is typically used in combination with a charge-group-based cutoff, which is not supported by most small-molecule force fields as well as other MD engines. To address this issue, we investigate the combination of RE-EDS simulations with a recently introduced RF scheme including a shifting function that enables the rigorous calculation of RF electrostatics with atom-based cutoffs. The resulting approach is validated by calculating solvation free energies with the generalized AMBER force field in water and chloroform using both the GROMOS software package and a proof-of-concept implementation in OpenMM.},

To illustrate this approach, we consider Fröhlich-type electron–phonon interactions and employ an imaginary time influence functional to incorporate phonon-induced effects nonperturbatively. The effective mass and binding energies are compared with perturbative and variational approaches, which provide qualitatively consistent trends. We evaluate electron-hole recombination rates as mediated through both trap-assisted and bimolecular processes, developing a consistent statistical mechanical approach valid in the reaction limited regime. These calculations demonstrate how phonons screen electron–hole interactions, generically reducing exciton binding energies and increasing their radiative lifetimes.},

  abstract = {Quantum master equations (QMEs) provide a general framework for describing electronic dynamics within a complex molecular system. Off-diagonal QMEs (OD-QMEs) correspond to a family of QMEs that describe the electronic dynamics in the interaction picture based on treating the off-diagonal coupling terms between electronic states as a small perturbation within the framework of second-order perturbation theory. The fact that OD-QMEs are given in terms of the interaction picture makes it non-trivial to obtain Schrödinger picture electronic coherences from them. A key experimental quantity that relies on the ability to obtain accurate Schrödinger picture electronic coherences is the absorption spectrum. In this paper, we propose using a recently introduced procedure for extracting Schrödinger picture electronic coherences from interaction picture inputs to calculate electronic absorption spectra from the electronic dynamics generated by OD-QMEs. The accuracy of the absorption spectra obtained this way is studied in the context of a biexciton benchmark model, by comparing spectra calculated based on time-local and time-nonlocal OD-QMEs to spectra calculated based on a Redfield-type QME and the non-perturbative and quantum-mechanically exact hierarchical equations of motion method.},

An active learning scheme is employed to obtain a training set containing configurations of thermodynamic relevance. This enables bypassing of the structural relaxation procedure that is necessary when applying conventional NNP approaches to the lattice configuration problem. The idea is demonstrated on the calculation of the temperature dependence of the degree of A/B site inversion in three spinel oxides, MgAl 2 O 4 , ZnAl 2 O 4 , and MgGa 2 O 4 . The present scheme may serve as an alternative to cluster expansion for “difficult” systems, e.g., complex bulk or interface systems with many components and sublattices that are relevant to many technological applications today.},

In this work, we address the performance of the fifth functional (PNOF5) and the seventh functional (PNOF7) to deal with another common problem, the charge delocalization error. The effects of this problem can be observed in charged systems of repeated well-separated fragments, where the energy should be the sum of the charged and neutral fragments, regardless of how the charge is distributed. In practice, an energetic overstabilization of fractional charged fragments leads to a preference for having the charge delocalized throughout the system. To establish the performance of PNOFs regarding charge delocalization error, charged chains of helium atoms and the W4-17-MR set molecules were used as base fragments, and their energy, charge distribution, and correlation regime were studied. It was found that PNOF5 prefers localized charge distributions, while PNOF7 improves the treatment of interpair static correlation and tends to the correct energetic limit for several cases, although a preference for delocalized charge distributions may arise in highly strong correlation regimes. Overall, it is concluded that PNOFs can simultaneously deal with static correlation and charge delocalization errors, resulting in a promising choice to study charge-related problems.},

Specifically, equilibrium structures and harmonic vibrational wavenumbers and dipole moments of closed and open shell molecules were calculated and compared to the best available experimental results or very accurate calculations. OO-REMP is capable of predicting bond lengths of small closed and open shell molecules with an accuracy of 0.2 and 0.5 pm, respectively, often within the range of experimental uncertainty. Equilibrium harmonic vibrational wavenumbers are predicted with an accuracy better than 20 cm −1 . Dipole moments of small closed and open shell molecules are reproduced with a relative error of less than 3\%.

  abstract = {The problem of resonance energy transfer between a pair of chiral molecules mediated by two electrically polarizable bridging particles is solved using molecular quantum electrodynamics theory. In this framework, a single virtual photon propagates between any two-coupled entities and is responsible for the conveyance of excitation energy from the emitter to the absorber. Electric dipole and quadrupole, and magnetic dipole couplings linear in the Maxwell fields are employed for donor and acceptor, while each mediator scatters two virtual photons and responds quadratically to the electric displacement field via its electric dipole polarizability. This enables fourth-order diagrammatic perturbation theory to be used to compute the probability amplitude for the process. Individual multipole moment contributions to the Fermi golden rule rate are then extracted for oriented and isotropic systems. Discriminatory transfer rates arise when either the donor or the acceptor are electric–magnetic dipole and the other has a pure multipole moment, or when both are chiral, with mixed electric dipole–quadrupole contributions vanishing in the fluid phase. The bridge-mediated transfer rate is found to be a maximum for a collinear geometry. Moreover, a multi-level model of the mediator is necessary for energy migration. Asymptotically limiting rates for arbitrary and collinear geometries are also obtained for one center purely electric dipolar and the other purely quadrupolar, or both donor and absorber purely quadrupolar. Understanding is gained of radiationless and radiative transfer mechanisms between chiral moieties in a dielectric medium.},

A MOB pairwise decomposition of the correlation part of the dipole moment is applied, and these pair dipole moments could be further regressed as a universal function of MOs. The dipole MOB features consist of the energy MOB features and their responses to electric fields. An interpretable and rotationally equivariant derivative kernel for Gaussian process regression (GPR) is introduced to learn the dipole moment more efficiently. The proposed problem setup, feature design, and ML algorithm are shown to provide highly accurate models for both dipole moments and energies on water and 14 small molecules. To demonstrate the ability of MOB-ML to function as generalized density-matrix functionals for molecular dipole moments and energies of organic molecules, we further apply the proposed MOB-ML approach to train and test the molecules from the QM9 dataset. The application of local scalable GPR with Gaussian mixture model unsupervised clustering GPR scales up MOB-ML to a large-data regime while retaining the prediction accuracy. In addition, compared with the literature results, MOB-ML provides the best test mean absolute errors of 4.21 mD and 0.045 kcal/mol for dipole moment and energy models, respectively, when training on 110 000 QM9 molecules. The excellent transferability of the resulting QM9 models is also illustrated by the accurate predictions for four different series of peptides.},

  abstract = {Catalytically active macromolecules are envisioned as key building blocks in the development of artificial nanomotors. However, theory and experiments report conflicting findings regarding their dynamics. The lack of consensus is mostly caused by the limited understanding of the specifics of self-propulsion mechanisms at the nanoscale. Here, we study a generic model of a self-propelled nanoparticle that does not rely on a particular mechanism. Instead, its main assumption is the fundamental symmetry of microscopic dynamics of chemical reactions: the principle of microscopic reversibility. Significant consequences of this assumption arise if we subject the particle to the action of an external time-periodic force. The particle diffusion coefficient then becomes enhanced compared to the unbiased dynamics. The enhancement can be controlled by the force amplitude and frequency. We also derive the power spectrum of particle trajectories. Among the new effects stemming from the microscopic reversibility are the enhancement of the spectrum at all frequencies and sigmoid-shaped transitions and a peak at characteristic frequencies of rotational diffusion and external forcing. Microscopic reversibility is a generic property of a broad class of chemical reactions. Therefore, we expect that the presented results will motivate new experimental studies aimed at testing our predictions. This could provide new insights into the dynamics of catalytic macromolecules.},

  abstract = {Polaron-transformed quantum master equation (PQME) offers a unified framework to describe the dynamics of quantum systems in both limits of weak and strong couplings to environmental degrees of freedom. Thus, the PQME serves as an efficient method to describe charge and exciton transfer/transport dynamics for a broad range of parameters in condensed or complex environments. However, in some cases, the polaron transformation (PT) being employed in the formulation invokes an over-relaxation of slow modes and results in premature suppression of important coherence terms. A formal framework to address this issue is developed in the present work by employing a partial PT that has smaller weights for low frequency bath modes. It is shown here that a closed form expression of a second order time-local PQME including all the inhomogeneous terms can be derived for a general form of partial PT, although more complicated than that for the full PT. All the expressions needed for numerical calculation are derived in detail. Applications to a model of a two-level system coupled to a bath of harmonic oscillators, with test calculations focused on those due to homogeneous relaxation terms, demonstrate the feasibility and the utility of the present approach.},

In short chains of up to ten units, we observe the crossover between coherent (tunneling, ballistic) motion and thermally-assisted conduction, with thermal effects enhancing the current beyond the quantum coherent limit. We further show that unconventional (nonmonotonic with size) transport behavior emerges when monomer-to-monomer electronic coupling is made large. In long chains, we identify a different behavior, with thermal effects suppressing the conductance below the coherent-ballistic limit. With the goal to identify a minimal model for molecular chains displaying unconventional and effective long-range transport, we simulate a modular polymer with alternating regions of high and low rigidity. Simulations show that, surprisingly, while charge correlations are significantly affected by structuring environmental conditions, reflecting charge delocalization, the electrical resistance displays an averaging effect, and it is not sensitive to this patterning. We conclude by arguing that efficient long-range charge transport requires engineering both internal electronic parameters and environmental conditions.},

  abstract = {Machine learning (ML) based interatomic potentials are emerging tools for material simulations, but require a trade-off between accuracy and speed. Here, we show how one can use one ML potential model to train another: we use an accurate, but more computationally expensive model to generate reference data (locations and labels) for a series of much faster potentials. Without the need for quantum-mechanical reference computations at the secondary stage, extensive reference datasets can be easily generated, and we find that this improves the quality of fast potentials with less flexible functional forms. We apply the technique to disordered silicon, including a simulation of vitrification and polycrystalline grain formation under pressure with a system size of a million atoms. Our work provides conceptual insight into the ML of interatomic potential models and suggests a route toward accelerated simulations of condensed-phase systems.},

  abstract = {Compared to top-down coarse-grained (CG) models, bottom-up approaches are capable of offering higher structural fidelity. This fidelity results from the tight link to a higher resolution reference, making the CG model chemically specific. Unfortunately, chemical specificity can be at odds with compound-screening strategies, which call for transferable parameterizations. Here, we present an approach to reconcile bottom-up, structure-preserving CG models with chemical transferability. We consider the bottom-up CG parameterization of 3441 C 7 O 2 small-molecule isomers. Our approach combines atomic representations, unsupervised learning, and a large-scale extended-ensemble force-matching parameterization. We first identify a subset of 19 representative molecules, which maximally encode the local environment of all gas-phase conformers. Reference interactions between the 19 representative molecules were obtained from both homogeneous bulk liquids and various binary mixtures. An extended-ensemble parameterization over all 703 state points leads to a CG model that is both structure-based and chemically transferable. Remarkably, the resulting force field is on average more structurally accurate than single-state-point equivalents. Averaging over the extended ensemble acts as a mean-force regularizer, smoothing out both force and structural correlations that are overly specific to a single-state point. Our approach aims at transferability through a set of CG bead types that can be used to easily construct new molecules while retaining the benefits of a structure-based parameterization.},

  abstract = {Plasmonic systems, such as metal nanoparticles, are widely used in different areas of application, going from biology to photovoltaics. The modeling of the optical response of such systems is of fundamental importance to analyze their behavior and to design new systems with required properties. When the characteristic sizes/distances reach a few nanometers, nonlocal and spill-out effects become relevant and conventional classical electrodynamics models are no more appropriate. Methods based on the Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TD-DFT) represent the current reference for the description of quantum effects. However, TD-DFT is based on knowledge of all occupied orbitals, whose calculation is computationally prohibitive to model large plasmonic systems of interest for applications. On the other hand, methods based on the orbital-free (OF) formulation of TD-DFT can scale linearly with the system size. In this Review, OF methods ranging from semiclassical models to the Quantum Hydrodynamic Theory will be derived from the linear response TD-DFT, so that the key approximations and properties of each method can be clearly highlighted. The accuracy of the various approximations will then be validated for the linear optical properties of jellium nanoparticles, the most relevant model system in plasmonics. OF methods can describe the collective excitations in plasmonic systems with great accuracy and without system-tuned parameters. The accuracy of these methods depends only on the accuracy of the (universal) kinetic energy functional of the ground-state electronic density. Current approximations and future development directions will also be indicated.},

In density functional theory (DFT), all information pertaining to stability, reactivity, and other properties is encompassed in the ground state electron density. The basic theorems of DFT govern that energy is a universal functional of the density, and thus, it can be regarded as a special kind of information. In this work, we quantify the energetic information in terms of Shannon entropy and Fisher information for energetic distributions of atoms and molecules. Two identities are unveiled for an energetic density, its gradient, and Laplacian to rigorously satisfy. A new partition scheme to decompose atoms in molecules has been proposed using the energetic distribution. We also show that our approach can simultaneously quantify both two-body and many-body interactions. This new framework should provide new analytical tools for us to appreciate electronic properties of molecular systems, including stability and reactivity. More importantly, this work establishes the missing link in DFT between energy and information, the two most fundamental quantities in quantum theory.},

Herein, we present a new photocatalytic reaction system based on Au nanoclusters (Au NCs) to enhance the conversion efficiency. Negatively charged Au NCs electrostatically interact with positively charged metal ions and form highly aggregated nanocrystals, which can efficiently capture a chemical substance in the reaction mixture. In such a reaction system, the distance between the electron donor and acceptor can be shortened, resulting in an efficient electron transfer process. We examined the electron transfer behavior in a nanocavity system via resazurin photoreduction and compared the reaction rate with that of a colloidal system, which is a commonly used reaction system. Evidently, the nanocavity system facilitated an enhanced reaction rate compared to that of the colloidal system. Furthermore, this nanocavity reaction system permitted multistep photoreactions and multi-electron transfer processes.},

This transition is induced by the reversible dimerization/dissociation of the molecular and atomistic states of hydrogen. In this work, we present the first attempt to thermodynamically model the FFPT in hydrogen at extreme conditions. Our predictions for the phase coexistence and the reaction equilibrium of the two alternative forms of fluid hydrogen are based on experimental data and supported by the results of simulations.

Promoting or inhibiting nanoscale epitaxial crystallization and selecting its final products underpin applications in cryopreservation, semiconductor devices, oxide electronics, quantum electronics, structural and functional ceramics, and advanced glasses. As precursors for crystallization, amorphous solids are distinguished from liquids and gases by the comparatively long relaxation times for perturbations of the mechanical stress and for variations in composition or bonding. These factors allow experimentally controllable parameters to influence crystallization processes and to drive materials toward specific outcomes. For example, amorphous precursors can be employed to form crystalline phases, such as polymorphs of Al 2 O 3 , VO 2 , and other complex oxides, that are not readily accessible via crystallization from a liquid or through vapor-phase epitaxy. Crystallization of amorphous solids can further be guided to produce a desired polymorph, nanoscale shape, microstructure, or orientation of the resulting crystals. These effects enable advances in applications in electronics, magnetic devices, optics, and catalysis. Directions for the future development of the chemical physics of crystallization from amorphous solids can be drawn from the structurally complex and nonequilibrium atomic arrangements in liquids and the atomic-scale structure of liquid–solid interfaces.},

In this study, we fix most of these parameters to typical values found in photosynthetic light-harvesting complexes of plants and determine the accuracy of approximate spectra with respect to exact calculation as a function of the energy gap and interpigment coupling in a pigment dimer. We use a spectral density with the first eight intramolecular modes of chlorophyll a and include inhomogeneous disorder for the calculation of spectra. We compare the accuracy of absorption, linear dichroism, and circular dichroism spectra calculated using the Full Cumulant Expansion (FCE), coherent time-dependent Redfield (ctR), and time-independent Redfield and modified Redfield methods. As a reference, we use spectra calculated with the exact stochastic path integral evaluation method. We find the FCE method to be the most accurate for the calculation of all spectra. The ctR method performs well for the qualitative calculation of absorption and linear dichroism spectra when the pigments are moderately coupled ( ∼ 15 c m − 1 ) ⁠ , but ctR spectra may differ significantly from exact spectra when strong interpigment coupling ( &gt; 100 c m − 1 ) is present. The dependence of the quality of Redfield and modified Redfield spectra on molecular parameters is similar, and these methods almost always perform worse than ctR, especially when the interpigment coupling is strong or the excitonic energy gap is small (for a given coupling). The accuracy of approximate spectra is not affected by resonance with intramolecular modes for typical system–bath coupling and disorder values found in plant light-harvesting complexes.},

This means that the time-reversal invariance of the correlation functions is broken due to the presence of odd responses in active systems.

  abstract = {Machine learning is an important tool in the study of the phase behavior from molecular simulations. In this work, we use un-supervised machine learning methods to study the phase behavior of two off-lattice models, a binary Lennard-Jones (LJ) mixture and the Widom–Rowlinson (WR) non-additive hard-sphere mixture. The majority of previous work has focused on lattice models, such as the 2D Ising model, where the values of the spins are used as the feature vector that is input into the machine learning algorithm, with considerable success. For these two off-lattice models, we find that the choice of the feature vector is crucial to the ability of the algorithm to predict a phase transition, and this depends on the particular model system being studied. We consider two feature vectors, one where the elements are distances of the particles of a given species from a probe (distance-based feature) and one where the elements are +1 if there is an excess of particles of the same species within a cut-off distance and −1 otherwise (affinity-based feature). We use principal component analysis and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding to investigate the phase behavior at a critical composition. We find that the choice of the feature vector is the key to the success of the unsupervised machine learning algorithm in predicting the phase behavior, and the sophistication of the machine learning algorithm is of secondary importance. In the case of the LJ mixture, both feature vectors are adequate to accurately predict the critical point, but in the case of the WR mixture, the affinity-based feature vector provides accurate estimates of the critical point, but the distance-based feature vector does not provide a clear signature of the phase transition. The study suggests that physical insight into the choice of input features is an important aspect for implementing machine learning methods.},

  abstract = {Colloidal patchy particles with divalent attractive interaction can self-assemble into linear polymer chains. Their equilibrium properties in 2D and 3D are well described by Wertheim’s thermodynamic perturbation theory, which predicts a well-defined, exponentially decaying equilibrium chain length distribution. In experimental realizations, due to gravity, particles sediment to the bottom of the suspension, forming a monolayer of particles with a gravitational height smaller than the particle diameter. In accordance with experiments, an anomalously high monomer concentration is observed in simulations, which is not well understood. To account for this observation, we interpret polymerization as taking place in a highly confined quasi-2D plane and extend the Wertheim thermodynamic perturbation theory by defining additional reaction constants as functions of chain length. We derive the theory, test it on simple square well potentials, and apply it to the experimental case of synthetic colloidal patchy particles immersed in a binary liquid mixture, which are described by an accurate effective critical Casimir patchy particle potential. The important interaction parameters entering the theory are explicitly computed using the integral method in combination with Monte Carlo sampling. Without any adjustable parameter, the predictions of the chain length distribution are in excellent agreement with explicit simulations of self-assembling particles. We discuss the generality of the approach and its application range.},

  abstract = {Spatial confinement of a polymer chain results in a reduction of conformational entropy. For confinement of a flexible N -mer chain in a planar slit or cylindrical pore (confining dimension D ), a blob model analysis predicts the asymptotic scaling behavior Δ F / N ∼ D − γ with γ ≈ 1.70, where Δ F is the free energy increase due to confinement. Here, we extend this scaling analysis to include the variation of local monomer density upon confinement giving Δ F / N ∼ D − γ (1 − h ( N , D )), where the correction-to-scaling term has the form h ∼ D y / N Δ with exponents y = 3 − γ ≈ 1.30 and Δ = 3/ γ − 1 ≈ 0.76. To test these scaling predictions, we carry out Wang–Landau simulations of confined and unconfined tangent-hard-sphere chains (bead diameter σ ) in the presence of a square-well trapping potential. The fully trapped chain provides a common reference state, allowing for an absolute determination of the confinement free energy. Our simulation results for 32 ≤ N ≤ 1024 and 3 ≤ D / σ ≤ 14 are well-described by the extended scaling relation giving exponents of γ = 1.69(1), y = 1.25(2), and Δ = 0.75(6).},

  abstract = {The introduction of soft organic nanoparticles (NPs) into polymer melts has recently expanded the material design space for polymer nanocomposites, compared to traditional nanocomposites that utilize rigid NPs, such as silica, metallic NPs, and other inorganic NPs. Despite advances in the fabrication and characterization of this new class of materials, the effect of NP stiffness on the polymer structure and dynamics has not been systematically investigated. Here, we use molecular dynamics to investigate the segmental dynamics of the polymer interfacial region of isolated NPs of variable stiffness in a polymer matrix. When the NP–polymer interactions are stronger than the polymer–polymer interactions, we find that the slowing of segmental dynamics in the interfacial region is more pronounced for stiff NPs. In contrast, when the NP–polymer interaction strength is smaller than the matrix interaction, the NP stiffness has relatively little impact on the changes in the polymer interfacial dynamics. We also find that the segmental relaxation time τ α of segments in the NP interfacial region changes from values lower than to higher than the bulk material when the NP–polymer interaction strength is increased beyond a “critical” strength, reminiscent of a binding–unbinding transition. Both the NP stiffness and the polymer–surface interaction strength can thus greatly influence the relative segmental relaxation and interfacial mobility in comparison to the bulk material.},

  abstract = {Nanostructured materials based on CeO 2 and Pt play a fundamental role in catalyst design. However, their characterization is often challenging due to their structural complexity and the tendency of these materials to change under reaction conditions. In this work, we combine calculations based on the density functional theory, a machine-learning assisted global optimization method, and ab initio thermodynamics to characterize stable oxidation states of ceria-supported Pt y O x particles under different environmental conditions. The collection of global minima structures for different stoichiometries resulting from the global optimization effort is used to assess the effect of temperature, oxygen pressure, and support interactions on the phase diagrams, oxidation states, and geometries of the Pt y O x particles. We, thus, identify favored structural motifs and O:Pt ratios, revealing that oxidized states of freestanding and ceria-supported platinum particles are more stable than reduced ones under a wide range of conditions. These results indicate that studies rationalizing activity of ceria-supported Pt clusters must consider oxidized states and that previous understanding of such materials obtained only with fully reduced Pt clusters may be incomplete.},

Thermodynamics variables governing the adsorption from air to water surface of bombykol, the most studied pheromone, and of three derivative molecules, bombykal, bombykoic acid, and bombykyle acetate, are computed by steered and un-biased molecular dynamics in order to compare the role of their polar head group on adsorption on aqueous aerosols. When adsorbed, the molecule center of mass stands at about 1.2 Å from the interface and oscillates on the same length scale, trapped in an energy well. Gibbs energy of adsorption and desorption time of bombykol are found to be 9.2 k B T and 59 µ s, respectively. The following ordering between the molecules is observed, reading from the more to the least adsorbed: bombykoic acid &gt; bombykol &gt; bombykoic acetate &gt; bombykal. It originates from a complex interplay of entropy and enthalpy. The entropy and enthalpy of adsorption are discussed in the light of structural arrangement, H-bonding, and hydrophilic tail positioning of the molecules at the interface. Our results show that, when dispersed in the air, pheromones adsorb on aqueous aerosols. However, the individual residence time is quite short on pure water surfaces. Aerosols can, therefore, only have a decisive influence on chemical communication through collective effects or through their chemical composition that is generally more complex than that of a pure water surface.},

  abstract = {Using classical molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate the dielectric properties at interfaces of water with graphene, graphite, hexane, and water vapor. For graphite, we compare metallic and nonmetallic versions. At the vapor–liquid water and hexane–water interfaces, the laterally averaged dielectric profiles are significantly broadened due to interfacial roughness and only slightly anisotropic. In contrast, at the rigid graphene surface, the dielectric profiles are strongly anisotropic and the perpendicular dielectric profile exhibits pronounced oscillations and sign changes. The interfacial dielectric excess, characterized by the shift of the dielectric dividing surface with respect to the Gibbs dividing surface, is positive for all surfaces, showing that water has an enhanced dielectric response at hydrophobic surfaces. The dielectric dividing surface positions vary significantly among the different surfaces, which points to pronounced surface-specific dielectric behavior. The interfacial repulsion of a chloride ion is shown to be dominated by electrostatic interactions for the soft fluid–fluid interfaces and by non-electrostatic Lennard-Jones interactions for the rigid graphene–water interface. A linear tensorial dielectric model for the ion–interface interaction with sharp dielectric interfaces located on the dielectric dividing surface positions works well for graphene but fails for vapor and hexane, because these interfaces are smeared out. The repulsion of chloride from the metallic and nonmetallic graphite versions differs very little, which reflects the almost identical interfacial water structure and can be understood based on linear continuum dielectric theory. Interface flexibility shows up mostly in the nonlinear Coulomb part of the ion–interface interaction, which changes significantly close to the interfaces and signals the breakdown of linear dielectric continuum theory.},

We employ dissipative particle dynamics with soft-core forcefield tested against experimental data on micellization of surfactants in water, and the previous results are reproduced in this work. We consider three different nonionic surfactants: hexaethylene glycol monododecyl ether (C 12 E 6 ), 2-[4-(2,4,4-trimethylpentan-2-yl)phenoxy]ethanol) known as Triton X-100 (TX-100), and two alkyl glucoside surfactants (C n G 1 ) with n -alkane tail fragments and a saccharide hydrophilic head at decane–water and toluene–water interfaces. For TX-100, we composed a model based on the literature forcefield and found good agreement with the experimental critical micelle concentrations (CMCs). The head–head interactions are of different origins for different surfactant groups: entropic repulsion between ethylene oxide chains of C 12 E 6 and TX-100, and more chemically specific and complex interactions between the maltose heads of alkyl glucosides. We interpret our results with the Redlich–Peterson equation of monolayer adsorption in order to relate the adsorption to the bulk concentration of the surfactant and the interfacial tension. The densities of the adsorbed monolayer at CMC mostly agree with the experimental data, and a reasonable agreement was obtained for the interfacial tension at CMC. At the same time, we found significant discrepancies between the simulated and experimental adsorption isotherms. We explain them by the oversimplified forcefield: when the parameters are fitted to the free energies of bulk solutions, they may not correctly reproduce the interfacial free energies.},

  abstract = {Truncated cluster models represent an effective way for simulating x-ray spectra of 2D materials. Here, we systematically assessed the influence of two key parameters, the cluster shape (honeycomb, rectangle, or parallelogram) and size, in x-ray photoelectron (XPS) and absorption (XAS) spectra simulations of three 2D materials at five K-edges (graphene, C 1s; C 3 N, C/N 1s; h -BN, B/N 1s) to pursue the accuracy limit of binding energy (BE) and spectral profile predictions. Several recent XPS experiments reported BEs with differences spanning 0.3, 1.5, 0.7, 0.3, and 0.3 eV, respectively. Our calculations favor the honeycomb model for stable accuracy and fast size convergence, and a honeycomb with ∼10 nm side length (120 atoms) is enough to predict accurate 1s BEs for all 2D sheets. Compared to all these experiments, predicted BEs show absolute deviations as follows: 0.4–0.7, 0.0–1.0, 0.4–1.1, 0.6–0.9, and 0.1–0.4 eV. A mean absolute deviation of 0.3 eV was achieved if we compare only to the closest experiment. We found that the sensitivity of computed BEs to different model shapes depends on systems: graphene, sensitive; C 3 N, weak; and h -BN, very weak. This can be attributed to their more or less delocalized π electrons in this series. For this reason, a larger cluster size is required for graphene than the other two to reproduce fine structures in XAS. The general profile of XAS shows weak dependence on model shape. Our calculations provide optimal parameters and accuracy estimations that are useful for x-ray spectral simulations of general graphene-like 2D materials.},

Additionally, we found that there exists an optimal thickness of the liquid water layer favoring hydrate growth due to the presence of both liquid water and hydrate-forming guest molecules. For all other cases of liquid water layer thickness, hydrate growth is slower due to the limited availability of hydrate-forming guests close to the hydrate formation front. Finally, we investigated the connection between the thickness of the liquid water layer and the degree of subcooling and found a very good agreement between our molecular dynamics simulations and theoretical predictions.},

It is found that the structures of Pt/water interfaces are significantly influenced by the step density, particularly in regard to the distribution of chemisorbed water. The step sites of metal surfaces are more preferred for water chemisorption than terrace sites, and until the step density is very low, water will chemisorb on the terrace. In addition, it is revealed that the PZCs of stepped Pt/water interfaces are generally smaller than that of Pt(111), and the difference is mainly attributed to the difference in their work function, providing a simple way to estimate the PZCs of stepped metal surfaces. Finally, it is interesting to see that the Volta potential difference is almost the same for Pt/water interfaces with different step densities, although their interface structures and magnitude of charge transfer clearly differ.},

  abstract = {Polar crystal surfaces play an important role in the functionality of many materials and have been studied extensively over many decades. In this article, a theoretical framework is presented that extends existing theories by placing the surrounding solution environment on an equal footing with the crystal itself; this is advantageous, e.g., when considering processes such as crystal growth from solution. By considering the polar crystal as a stack of parallel plate capacitors immersed in a solution environment, the equilibrium adsorbed surface charge density is derived by minimizing the free energy of the system. In analogy to the well-known diverging surface energy of a polar crystal surface at zero temperature, for a crystal in solution it is shown that the “polar catastrophe” manifests as a diverging free energy cost to perturb the system from equilibrium. Going further than existing theories, the present formulation predicts that fluctuations in the adsorbed surface charge density become increasingly suppressed with increasing crystal thickness. We also show how, in the slab geometry often employed in both theoretical and computational studies of interfaces, an electric displacement field emerges as an electrostatic boundary condition, the origins of which are rooted in the slab geometry itself, rather than the use of periodic boundary conditions. This aspect of the work provides a firmer theoretical basis for the recent observation that standard “slab corrections” fail to correctly describe, even qualitatively, polar crystal surfaces in solution.},

The rigid-ion approach gives access to an effective restricted primitive model in which the anion and cation have equal but opposite charges and are otherwise identical. For this model, the decay of the pair-correlation functions is in qualitative agreement with simple theory. The polarizable ion approach gives a good account of the diffraction results and yields thermodynamic parameters (density, isothermal compressibility, Debye screening length, and heat capacity) in accord with experiment. The longest decay length for the partial pair-distribution functions is a factor of ≃2.5 times greater than the nearest-neighbor distance. The results are commensurate with the decay lengths found for the effective restricted primitive model, which are much shorter than those found in experiments on concentrated electrolytes or ionic liquids using surface force apparatus.},

  abstract = {Freezing of water is the most common liquid-to-crystal phase transition on Earth; however, despite its critical implications on climate change and cryopreservation among other disciplines, its characterization through experimental and computational techniques remains elusive. In this work, we make use of computer simulations to measure the nucleation rate ( J ) of water at normal pressure under different supercooling conditions, ranging from 215 to 240 K. We employ two different water models: mW, a coarse-grained potential for water, and TIP4P/ICE, an atomistic nonpolarizable water model that provides one of the most accurate representations of the different ice phases. To evaluate J , we apply the Lattice Mold technique, a computational method based on the use of molds to induce the nucleus formation from the metastable liquid under conditions at which observing spontaneous nucleation would be unfeasible. With this method, we obtain estimates of the nucleation rate for ice Ih and Ic and a stacking mixture of ice Ih/Ic, reaching consensus with most of the previously reported rates, although differing with some others. Furthermore, we confirm that the predicted nucleation rates obtained by the TIP4P/ICE model are in better agreement with experimental data than those obtained through the mW potential. Taken together, our study provides a reliable methodology to measure nucleation rates in a simple and computationally efficient manner that contributes to benchmarking the freezing behavior of two popular water models.},

  abstract = {We model, via classical molecular dynamics simulations, the plastic phase of ice VII across a wide range of the phase diagram of interest for planetary investigations. Although structural and dynamical properties of plastic ice VII are mostly independent on the thermodynamic conditions, the hydrogen bond network (HBN) acquires a diverse spectrum of topologies distinctly different from that of liquid water and of ice VII simulated at the same pressure. We observe that the HBN topology of plastic ice carries some degree of similarity with the crystal phase, stronger at thermodynamic conditions proximal to ice VII, and gradually lessening when approaching the liquid state. Our results enrich our understanding of the properties of water at high pressure and high temperature and may help in rationalizing the geology of water-rich planets.},

We show how the average hydrogen nuclear kinetic energy, mainly affected by zero-point vibrational energies, shows differences larger compared to the changes simply related to temperature effects when moving from one phase to another. In particular, the Gaussian contribution to the average nuclear kinetic energy is larger in the tetragonal phase compared to the cubic and orthorhombic ones. Moreover, we find that the vibrational densities of states of MAPbBr 3 single crystals in the orthorhombic phase are compatible with previously reported results on powder samples, and that the only vibrational modes that show slightly different frequencies compared to MAPbI 3 are those in the energy range between 100 and 300 cm −1 , related to librational/rotational modes. As these shifts are of about 10 cm −1 and do not affect any higher-energy vibrational mode, we conclude that the zero-point energies and average nuclear kinetic energies in the two-hybrid organic/inorganic perovskites are expected to be approximately the same within a harmonic framework.},

[F–H–F] − has a symmetric structure, which can be described as a H + acid shared by two terminal F − donors (F − –H + –F − ). To explore whether two identical donors are bound to result in SSHBs, we performed theoretical studies on a series of compounds (L–H + –L) with two identical electron donors (L corresponds to donors containing group 14, 15, 16, and 17 elements). The results show that identical donors do not definitely lead to SSHBs. Instead, typical hydrogen bonds also exist. Both electronegativity and basicity contribute to the patterns of hydrogen bonds, where more electronegative and weaker donors benefit to SSHBs. In addition, it was found that zero-point energies also respond to the hydrogen bonding systems. This systemic work is expected to provide more insights into SSHBs.},

Based on the enumeration of the possible hydrogen bonding networks for a fixed oxygen atom scaffold, the residual entropy ( S 0 ) of these three gas phase cages was estimated at 0.754 82, 0.754 44, and 0.754 17 · Nk b , where N is the number of molecules and k b is Boltzmann’s constant. A previously identified descriptor of enhanced stability based on the relative arrangement and connectivity of nearest-neighbor fragments on the polyhedral water cluster [strong-weak-effective-bond model] also applies to the larger hollow cages. The three cages contain a maximum of 7, 9, and 11 such preferable arrangements of trans nearest dimer pairs with one “free” OH bond on the donor molecule ( t 1 d dimers). The Many-Body Expansion (MBE) up to the 4-body suggests that the many-body terms vary nearly linearly with the cluster binding energy. Using a hierarchical approach of screening the relative stability of networks starting from optimizations with the TIP4P, TTM2.1-F, and MB-pol classical potentials, subsequently refining at more accurate levels of electronic structure theory (DFT and MP2), and finally correcting for zero-point energy, we were able to identify a group of four low-lying isomers of the (H 2 O) 24 T-cage, two of which are antisymmetric and the other two form a pair of antipode configurations.},

  abstract = {Variational autoencoders (VAEs) are rapidly gaining popularity within molecular simulation for discovering low-dimensional, or latent, representations, which are critical for both analyzing and accelerating simulations. However, it remains unclear how the information a VAE learns is connected to its probabilistic structure and, in turn, its loss function. Previous studies have focused on feature engineering, ad hoc modifications to loss functions, or adjustment of the prior to enforce desirable latent space properties. By applying effectively arbitrarily flexible priors via normalizing flows, we focus instead on how adjusting the structure of the decoding model impacts the learned latent coordinate. We systematically adjust the power and flexibility of the decoding distribution, observing that this has a significant impact on the structure of the latent space as measured by a suite of metrics developed in this work. By also varying weights on separate terms within each VAE loss function, we show that the level of detail encoded can be further tuned. This provides practical guidance for utilizing VAEs to extract varying resolutions of low-dimensional information from molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations.},

In general, good agreement of the two approaches is observed. Remaining deviations can be attributed to higher-order relativistic, also called non-radiative quantum electrodynamics (QED), corrections of the perturbative approach that are automatically included in the variational solution of the no-pair Dirac–Coulomb–Breit (DCB) equation to all orders of the α fine-structure constant. The analysis of the polynomial α dependence of the DCB energy makes it possible to determine the leading-order relativistic correction to the non-relativistic energy to high precision without regularization. Contributions from the Breit–Pauli Hamiltonian, for which expectation values converge slowly due the singular terms, are implicitly included in the variational procedure. The α dependence of the no-pair DCB energy shows that the higher-order ( α 4 E h ) non-radiative QED correction is 5\% of the leading-order ( α 3 E h ) non-radiative QED correction for Z = 2 (He), but it is 40\% already for Z = 4 (Be 2+ ), which indicates that resummation provided by the variational procedure is important already for intermediate nuclear charge numbers.},

  abstract = {The third-order response lies at the heart of simulating and interpreting nonlinear spectroscopies ranging from two-dimensional infrared (2D-IR) to 2D electronic (2D-ES), and 2D sum frequency generation (2D-SFG). The extra time and frequency dimensions in these spectroscopic techniques provide access to rich information on the electronic and vibrational states present, the coupling between them, and the resulting rates at which they exchange energy that are obscured in linear spectroscopy, particularly for condensed phase systems that usually contain many overlapping features. While the exact quantum expression for the third-order response is well established, it is incompatible with the methods that are practical for calculating the atomistic dynamics of large condensed phase systems. These methods, which include both classical mechanics and quantum dynamics methods that retain quantum statistical properties while obeying the symmetries of classical dynamics, such as LSC-IVR, centroid molecular dynamics, and Ring Polymer Molecular Dynamics (RPMD), naturally provide short-time approximations to the multi-time symmetrized Kubo transformed correlation function. Here, we show how the third-order response can be formulated in terms of equilibrium symmetrized Kubo transformed correlation functions. We demonstrate the utility and accuracy of our approach by showing how it can be used to obtain the third-order response of a series of model systems using both classical dynamics and RPMD. In particular, we show that this approach captures features such as anharmonically induced vertical splittings and peak shifts while providing a physically transparent framework for understanding multidimensional spectroscopies.},

They overlap completely with each other without any shift everywhere for all the states of Li 2 . At all the calculated points on the seven potential curves ranging between −14.83 and −15.00 hartree, the average difference was only 0.0583 kcal/mol and the maximum difference was only +0.165 kcal/mol. For the vertical excitation energies from the ground state curve to the seven excited states, the differences between theory and experiment were 0.000 645 eV in average and their maximum difference was −0.007 20 eV. The potential properties calculated with the FC theory also agreed well with the experimental values. These results show a high potentiality of the FC theory as a highly predictive quantum chemistry theory. For comparison, as an example of the Hartree–Fock based theory popular in modern quantum chemistry, we adopted the symmetry-adapted-cluster (SAC)-configuration-interaction (CI) theory using a highly flexible basis set. While the FC theory gave the absolute agreements with experiments, the SAC-CI potential curves compare reasonably well with experiments only after shifting-down of the SAC-CI curves by 5.727 kcal/mol. The differences in the excitation energies between SAC-CI and experiments were 0.004 28 eV on average, and the maximum difference was +0.109 67 eV.

A Frenkel Hamiltonian of HJ aggregate type is used along with a reduced H-aggregate representation; electron–phonon coupling includes local high-frequency modes as well as anharmonic intermolecular modes. The latter are operative in mediating inter-chain transport by a mechanism of transient localization type. Strikingly, this mechanism is found to be of quantum coherent character and involves non-adiabatic effects. Using periodic boundary conditions, a normal diffusion regime is identified from the exciton mean-squared displacement, apart from early-time transients. Diffusion coefficients are found to be of the order of 3 × 10 −3 cm 2 /s, showing a non-linear increase with temperature.},

  abstract = {Understanding the bulk and interfacial properties of super-concentrated electrolytes, such as ionic liquids (ILs), has attracted significant attention lately for their promising applications in supercapacitors and batteries. Recently, McEldrew et al. [J. Phys. Chem. B 125 , 2677 (2021)] developed a theory for reversible ion associations in bulk ILs, which accounted for the formation of all possible (Cayley tree) clusters and a percolating ionic network (gel). Here, we adopt and develop this approach to understand the associations of ILs in the electrical double layer at electrified interfaces. With increasing charge of the electrode, the theory predicts a transition from a regime dominated by a gelled or clustered state to a crowding regime dominated by free ions. This transition from gelation to crowding is conceptually similar to the overscreening to crowding transition.},

  abstract = {Modeling and simulation of complex biochemical reaction networks form cornerstones of modern biophysics. Many of the approaches developed so far capture temporal fluctuations due to the inherent stochasticity of the biophysical processes, referred to as intrinsic noise. Stochastic fluctuations, however, predominantly stem from the interplay of the network with many other—and mostly unknown—fluctuating processes, as well as with various random signals arising from the extracellular world; these sources contribute extrinsic noise. Here, we provide a computational simulation method to probe the stochastic dynamics of biochemical systems subject to both intrinsic and extrinsic noise. We develop an extrinsic chemical Langevin equation (CLE)—a physically motivated extension of the CLE—to model intrinsically noisy reaction networks embedded in a stochastically fluctuating environment. The extrinsic CLE is a continuous approximation to the chemical master equation (CME) with time-varying propensities. In our approach, noise is incorporated at the level of the CME, and it can account for the full dynamics of the exogenous noise process, irrespective of timescales and their mismatches. We show that our method accurately captures the first two moments of the stationary probability density when compared with exact stochastic simulation methods while reducing the computational runtime by several orders of magnitude. Our approach provides a method that is practical, computationally efficient, and physically accurate to study systems that are simultaneously subject to a variety of noise sources.},

We show that HCISCF nuclear gradients are fairly insensitive to the size of the “selected” variational space, which allows us to reduce the computational cost without introducing significant errors. The ability of the HCISCF to treat larger active spaces combined with the flexibility for users to control the computational cost makes the method very attractive for studying strongly correlated systems, which require a larger active space than possible with a complete active space self-consistent field. Finally, we study the realistic catalyst, Fe(PDI), and highlight some of the challenges this system poses for density functional theory (DFT). We demonstrate how HCISCF can clarify the energetic stability of geometries obtained from DFT when the results are strongly dependent on the functional. We also use the HCISCF gradients to optimize geometries for this species and study the adiabatic singlet–triplet gap. During geometry optimization, we find that multiple near-degenerate local minima exist on the triplet potential energy surface.},

Functionalization allows one to fine tune not only their chemical stability but also the redox potential and kinetics of the electron transfer reaction. However, the reaction rate constant is not only determined by the redox species but also impacted by solvent effects. In this work, we show how the functionalization of benzoquinone with different functional groups impacts the solvent reorganization free energies of electron transfer half-reactions in acetonitrile. The use of molecular density functional theory, whose computational cost for studying the electron transfer reaction is considerably reduced compared to the state-of-the-art molecular dynamics simulations, enables us to perform a systematic study. We validate the method by comparing the predictions of the solvation shell structure and the free energy profiles for electron transfer reaction to the reference classical molecular dynamics simulations in the case of anthraquinone solvated in acetonitrile. We show that all the studied electron transfer half-reactions follow the Marcus theory, regardless of functional groups. Consequently, the solvent reorganization free energy decreases as the molecular size increases.},

  abstract = {While bonding molecular orbitals exhibit constructive interference relative to atomic orbitals, antibonding orbitals show destructive interference. When full localization of occupied orbitals into bonds is possible, bonding and antibonding orbitals exist in 1:1 correspondence with each other. Antibonding orbitals play an important role in chemistry because they are frontier orbitals that determine orbital interactions, as well as much of the response of the bonding orbital to perturbations. In this work, we present an efficient method to construct antibonding orbitals by finding the orbital that yields the maximum opposite spin pair correlation amplitude in second order perturbation theory (AB2) and compare it with other techniques with increasing basis set size. We conclude the AB2 antibonding orbitals are a more robust alternative to the Sano orbitals as initial guesses for valence bond calculations due to having a useful basis set limit. The AB2 orbitals are also useful for efficiently constructing an active space, and they work as good initial guesses for valence excited states. In addition, when combined with the localized occupied orbitals, and relocalized, the result is a set of molecule-adapted minimal basis functions that is built without any reference to atomic orbitals of the free atom. As examples, they are applied to the population analysis of halogenated methane derivatives, H–Be–Cl, and SF 6 , where they show some advantages relative to good alternative methods.},

  abstract = {Polaritonic chemistry relies on the strong light–matter interaction phenomena for altering the chemical reaction rates inside optical cavities. To explain and understand these processes, the development of reliable theoretical models is essential. While computationally efficient quantum electrodynamics self-consistent field (QED-SCF) methods, such as quantum electrodynamics density functional theory, need accurate functionals, quantum electrodynamics coupled cluster (QED-CC) methods provide a systematic increase in accuracy but at much greater cost. To overcome this computational bottleneck, herein we introduce and develop the QED-CC-in-QED-SCF projection-based embedding method that inherits all the favorable properties from the two worlds: computational efficiency and accuracy. The performance of the embedding method is assessed by studying some prototypical but relevant reactions, such as methyl transfer reaction, proton transfer reaction, and protonation reaction, in a complex environment. The results obtained with the new embedding method are in excellent agreement with more expensive QED-CC results. The analysis performed on these reactions indicates that the electron–photon correlation effects are local in nature and that only a small region should be treated at the QED-CC level for capturing important effects due to cavity. This work sets the stage for future developments of polaritonic quantum chemistry methods and will serve as a guideline for the development of other polaritonic embedding models.},

This has resulted in a focus on generating functioning protein-based devices without a concerted effort to develop reliable tools necessary to measure the fundamental properties of the bio–abio interface, such as surface concentration, biomolecular structure, and activity. In this Perspective, we discuss current methods used to characterize these critical properties of devices that operate by integrating a protein into both flat surfaces and nanoparticle materials.

  abstract = {This Perspective outlines a panoramic description of the nature of the chemical bond according to valence bond theory. It describes single bonds and demonstrates the existence of a “forgotten family” of charge-shift bonds (CSBs) in which the entire/most of the bond energy arises from the resonance between the covalent and ionic structures of the bond. Many of the CSBs are homonuclear bonds. Hypervalent molecules (e.g., XeF 2 ) are CSBs. This Perspective proceeds to describe multiple bonded molecules with an emphasis on C 2 and 3 O 2 . C 2 has four electron pairs in its valence shell and, hence, 14 covalent structures and 1750 ionic structures. This Perspective outlines an effective methodology of peeling the electronic structure to the minimal and important number of structures: a dominant structure that displays a quadruple bond and two minor structures with π + σ bonds, which stabilize the quadruple bond by resonance. 3 O 2 is chosen because it is a diradical, which is persistent and life-sustaining. It is shown that the persistence of this diradical is due to the charge-shift bonding of the π -3-electron bonds. This section ends with a discussion of the roles of π vs σ in the geometric preferences of benzene, acetylene, ethene, and their Si-based analogs. Subsequently, this Perspective discusses bonding in clusters of univalent metal atoms, which possess only parallel spins ( n+1 M n ), and are nevertheless bonded due to the resonance interactions that stabilize the repulsive elementary structure (all spins are up). The bond energy reaches ∼40 kcal/mol for a pair of atoms (in n+1 Cu n ; n ∼ 10–12). The final subsection discusses singlet excited states in ethene, ozone, and SO 2 . It demonstrates the capability of the breathing-orbital VB method to yield an accurate description of a variety of excited states using merely 10 or few VB structures. Furthermore, the method underscores covalent structures that play a key role in the correct description and bonding of these excited states.},

The difference in the structural organization arises from the hydrophilic character of the OOH side group that has a strong affinity with the water interface region, leading to significant reorganization of the bilayer. In this article, we describe a coarse-grained (CG) model of POPC and DOPC lipid peroxides within the framework of the Martini CG force-field ( v 2.2), derived from experimental data. We then discuss extensively the predicted structure and the influence of hydration and show how shifting the position of the unsaturated bonds along the chain changes the structure.

In this study, we performed atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of the homodimer of the 55-residue congener of the C-terminal domain of the amyloid protein precursor, C99(1–55), in a 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine-cholesterol lipid bilayer and compared the conformational ensemble of wild-type (WT) sequence to those of the A2T and D23N variants. These mutations are particularly interesting as the protective Alzheimer’s disease (AD) A2T mutation is known to decrease A β production, whereas the early onset AD D23N mutation does not affect A β production. We found noticeable differences in the structural ensembles of the three sequences. In particular, A2T varies from both WT and D23N by having long-range effects on the population of the extracellular juxtamembrane helix, the interface between the G29xxx-G33xxx-G37 motifs, and the fluctuations of the transmembrane helical topologies.},

Protonation and deprotonation involve the making and breaking of covalent bonds, which cannot be studied by classical force fields. However, environment effects on the rates should be captured by such methods. Here, we present an approach for estimating deprotonation rates based on Warshel’s extension of Marcus’s theory of electron transfer, with input from molecular simulations. The missing bond dissociation energy is represented by a constant term determined by fitting the pK a value in solution. The statistics of the energy gap between protonated and deprotonated states is used to compute free energy curves of the two states and, thus, free energy barriers, from which the rate can be deduced. The method is applied to Glu, Asp, and His in bulk solution and select membrane proteins: the M2 proton channel, bacteriorhodopsin, and cytochrome c oxidase.},

The mean squared displacement of surfactant molecules provides evidence that the longest relaxation time estimated by the proposed method serves as the characteristic timescale at equilibrium. We also demonstrate that the longest relaxation time plays an essential role in flow-induced scission. Using conditional statistics based on the aggregation number of micelles, we examine the statistical properties of the lifetime of wormlike micelles.

In this paper, we study the chemo-mechanical coupling that leads to the self-propulsion of chemically active colloids. The coupling between chemical reactions and momentum transport is a consequence of Onsager reciprocal relations. They state that the velocity and the surface reaction rate are related to mechanical and chemical affinities through a symmetric matrix. A consequence of Onsager reciprocal relations is that if a chemical reaction drives the motion of the colloid, then an external force generates a reaction rate. Here, we investigate Onsager reciprocal relations for a spherical active colloid that catalyzes a reversible surface chemical reaction between two species. We solve the relevant transport equations using a perturbation expansion and numerical simulations to demonstrate the validity of reciprocal relations around the equilibrium. Our results are consistent with previous studies and highlight the key role of solute advection in preserving the symmetry of the Onsager matrix. Finally, we show that Onsager reciprocal relations break down around a nonequilibrium steady state, which has implications for the thermal fluctuations of the active colloids used in experiments.},

The ELECTRODE package also contains a finite-field approach, multiple corrections for nonperiodic boundary conditions of the particle–particle particle–mesh solver, and a Thomas–Fermi model for using nonideal metals as electrodes. We demonstrate the capabilities of this implementation for a parallel-plate electrical double-layer capacitor, for which we have investigated the charging times with the different implemented methods and found an interesting relationship between water and ionic dipole relaxations. To prove the validity of the one-dimensional correction for the long-range electrostatics, we estimated the vacuum capacitance of two coaxial carbon nanotubes and compared it to structureless cylinders, for which an analytical expression exists. In summary, the ELECTRODE package enables efficient electrochemical simulations using state-of-the-art methods, allowing one to simulate even heterogeneous electrodes. Moreover, it allows unveiling more rigorously how electrode curvature affects the capacitance with the one-dimensional correction.},

  abstract = {We present a classical molecular-dynamics study of the collective dynamical properties of the coexisting liquid phase at equilibrium body-centered cubic (BCC) Fe crystal–melt interfaces. For the three interfacial orientations (100), (110), and (111), the collective dynamics are characterized through the calculation of the intermediate scattering functions, dynamical structure factors, and density relaxation times in a sequential local region of interest. An anisotropic speedup of the collective dynamics in all three BCC crystal–melt interfacial orientations is observed. This trend differs significantly from the previously observed slowing down of the local collective dynamics at the liquid–vapor interface [del Rio and González, Acta Mater. 198 , 281 (2020)]. Examining the interfacial density relaxation times, we revisit the validity of the recently developed time-dependent Ginzburg–Landau theory for the solidification crystal–melt interface kinetic coefficients, resulting in excellent agreement with both the magnitude and the kinetic anisotropy of the crystal–melt interface kinetic coefficients measured from the non-equilibrium molecular-dynamics simulations.},

  abstract = {Localized surface plasmon resonances on noble metal nanoparticles (NPs) can efficiently drive reactions of adsorbed ligand molecules and provide versatile opportunities in chemical synthesis. The driving forces of these reactions are typically elevated temperatures, hot charge carriers, or enhanced electric fields. In the present work, dehalogenation of halogenated thiophenols on the surface of AuNPs has been studied by surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) as a function of the photon energy to track the kinetics and identify reaction products. Reaction rates are found to be surprisingly similar for different halothiophenols studied here, although the bond dissociation energies of the C–X bonds differ significantly. Complementary information about the electronic properties at the AuNP surface, namely, work-function and valence band states, has been determined by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy of isolated AuNPs in the gas-phase. In this way, it is revealed how the electronic properties are altered by the adsorption of the ligand molecules, and we conclude that the reaction rates are mainly determined by the plasmonic properties of the AuNPs. SERS spectra reveal differences in the reaction product formation for different halogen species, and, on this basis, the possible reaction mechanisms are discussed to approach an understanding of opportunities and limitations in the design of catalytical systems with plasmonic NPs.},

For the B3LYP functional, which has the best overall performance, the energy of the optical state, 7.27 eV, is within the observed range of (7.2–7.4) eV and is predicted to be insulating, with indirect bandgaps of (5.6–5.8) eV. Mulliken analyses of the excited state wavefunction indicate extensive redistributions of charge and spin resulting in a strongly excitonic state with a central charge of −0.8ǀeǀ surrounded by charges of +0.12ǀeǀ at the four nearest neighbor sites. The thermally relaxed state is predicted to be similarly excitonic, with comparable bandgaps and atomic charges. Calculations of the ground and excited state relaxations lead to a Stokes shift of 0.47 eV and predicted Γ-point luminescence energy of 6.89 eV. Assuming a similar shift at the band edge (X 1 ), an estimate of 5.29 eV is predicted for the luminescence energy, which compares with the observed value of 5.27 eV. Excited state vibrational spectra show marked differences from the ground state, with the introduction of an infrared peak at 1150 cm −1 and a modest shift of 2 cm −1 in the TO(X) Raman mode at 1340 cm −1 . Similar calculations of the lowest energy bi- and triexcitons predict these to be bound states in both optical and thermal configurations and plausible precursors to exciton condensation. Estimates of bi- and triexciton luminescence energies predict red shifts with respect to the single exciton line, which are compared to the recently reported values.},

Adsorption energies are computed by ab initio density functional theory (DFT) and used to calculate the Gibbs free energy of adsorption of water on LTO. Integrating the disjoining pressure, consisting of molecular and structural components, with respect to film thickness gives an expression for the Gibbs free energy. In this way, parameters for the disjoining pressure can be calculated by fitting its integral to the Gibbs free energy computed by ab initio DFT. A combination of literature-known models for spin drying and evaporation is utilized to describe the temporal evolution of the water layer. The vapor above the water layer is modeled by diffusion and a mass balance is applied at the water–air interface. For thick initial layers, an analytical approximation is derived which only depends on fluid and ambient conditions but not on the substrate properties.},

However, low dimensional connectivity in the inorganic frameworks leads to strongly bounded excitons with limited absorption properties, which impedes their application in photovoltaic devices. Here, we show that, by incorporating a strong electron accepting methylviologen cation, charge transfer (CT) at the organic/inorganic interface can effectively tune the optical properties in one-dimensional (1D) lead–halide perovskites. Both 1D MVPb 2 I 6 and MVPb 2 Br 6 display expanded absorption and photoresponse activity compared to CT inactive cations. The photoinduced CT process in MVPb 2 I 6 was further characterized by transient absorption spectroscopy, which shows an ultrafast CT process within 1 ps, generating charge separated states.

  abstract = {Understanding the microscopic behavior of aqueous electrolyte solutions in contact with graphene and related carbon surfaces is important in electrochemical technologies, such as capacitive deionization or supercapacitors. In this work, we focus on preferential adsorption of ions in mixed alkali–halide electrolytes containing different fractions of Li + /Na + or Li + /K + and/or Na + /K + cations with Cl − anions dissolved in water. We performed molecular dynamics simulations of the solutions in contact with both neutral and positively and negatively charged graphene surfaces under ambient conditions, using the effectively polarizable force field. The simulations show that large ions are often intuitively attracted to oppositely charged electrodes. In contrast, the adsorption behavior of small ions tends to be counterintuitive. In mixed-cation solutions, one of the cations always supports the adsorption of the other cation, while the other cation weakens the adsorption of the first cation. In mixed-cation solutions containing large and small cations simultaneously, adsorption of the larger cations varies dramatically with the electrode charge in an intuitive way, while adsorption of the smaller cations changes oppositely, i.e., in a counterintuitive way. For (Li/K)Cl mixed-cation solutions, these effects allow the control of Li + adsorption by varying the electrode charge, whereas, for LiCl single-salt solutions, Li + adsorption is nearly independent of the electrode charge. We rationalize this cation–cation lever effect as a result of a competition between three driving forces: (i) direct graphene–ion interactions, (ii) the strong tendency of the solutions to saturate the network of non-covalent intermolecular bonds, and (iii) the tendency to suppress local charge accumulation in any region larger than typical interparticle distances. We analyze the driving forces in detail using a general method for intermolecular bonding based on spatial distribution functions and different contributions to the total charge density profiles. The analysis helps to predict whether an ion is more affected by each of the three driving forces, depending on the strength of the ion solvation shells and the compatibility between the contributions of the charge density profiles due to the ion and water molecules. This approach is general and can also be applied to other solutions under different thermodynamic conditions.},

To probe these relationships, we report the quantum-chemical investigation of a series of trialkyltetrelethynyl acenes (tetrel = silicon or germanium) that adopt the brickwork, slip-stack, or herringbone (HB) packing configurations; the π-conjugated backbones considered here are pentacene and anthradithiophene.

Here, we use nonequilibrium molecular dynamics to investigate the size dependence of the interfacial thermal conductance of gold nanoparticles immersed in water and with tunable wettability. The interfacial thermal conductance is found to increase when the nanoparticle size decreases. We rationalize such a behavior with a generalized acoustic model, where the interfacial bonding decreases with the nanoparticle size. The analysis of the interfacial thermal spectrum reveals the importance of the low frequency peak of the nanoparticle spectrum as it matches relatively well the oxygen peak in the vibrational spectrum. However, by reducing the nanoparticle size, the low frequency peak is exacerbated, explaining the enhanced heat transfer observed for small nanoparticles. Finally, we assess the accuracy of the continuum heat transfer equations to describe the thermal relaxation of small nanoparticles with initial high temperatures. We show that, before the nanoparticle loses its integrity, the continuum model succeeds in describing with small percentage deviations the molecular dynamics data. This work brings a simple methodology to understand, beyond the plasmonic nanoparticles, thermal boundary conductance between a nanoparticle and its environment.},

Layer growth on the micron scale was followed using visible light scattering from stirred samples. The layer thicknesses were found to diverge with decreasing temperature when coexistence was approached from the one-phase region, but only for solutions richer in the higher density/higher surface tension component. The onset of divergence was &lt;1 K above the bulk coexistence temperature; nearer the critical composition, the onset temperature was the critical temperature itself. All three systems showed identical divergent wetting properties after variable normalization. In contrast, no divergent wetting layer formation was seen in the benzene + 1,2-propanediol or water + phenol systems. The mathematical sign of the Hamaker constant correlates with the contrasting behaviors. Collectively, these results have implications for theoretical descriptions of adsorption layer growth and crossover behavior, for measurements of complete wetting temperatures, and for practical applications.},

By examining the range-dependence of different types of energetic contributions to the crystal lattice energy, we can glean qualitative understanding of solid-state intermolecular interactions as well as practical, exploitable reductions in the number of computations required for accurate energies. Here, we assess the range-dependent character of two-body interactions of 24 small organic molecular crystals by using the physically interpretable components from symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (electrostatics, exchange-repulsion, induction/polarization, and London dispersion).

Complex shapes observed for water OH-stretching bands, common to all high-polarity solvents, were assigned to water in several solvation states. In the present study, classical molecular dynamics simulations of a single water molecule in four ionic liquids and three dipolar solvents were used to test and refine this interpretation. Consistent with past assignments, simulations show solitary water usually donates two hydrogen bonds to distinct solvent molecules. Such symmetrically solvated water produces the primary pair of peaks identified in the OH spectra of water in nearly all solvents. We had further proposed that additional features flanking this main peak are due to asymmetric solvation states, states in which only one OH group makes a hydrogen bond to solvent. Such states were found in significant concentrations in all of the systems simulated. Simulations of the OH stretching spectra using a semiclassical description and the vibrational map developed by Auer and Skinner [J. Chem. Phys. 128 , 224511–224512 (2008)] provided semi-quantitative agreement with experiment. Analysis of species-specific spectra confirmed assignment of the additional features in the experimental spectra to asymmetrically solvated water. The simulations also showed that rapid water motions cause a marked motional narrowing compared with the inhomogeneous limit. This narrowing is largely responsible for making the additional features due to minority solvation states manifest in the spectra.},

Understanding the symmetry breaking phase transitions exhibited by many chiral molecular substances provides basic insights for topics ranging from the origin of life to the rational design of drug manufacturing processes. In this work, we have performed molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the fluid–fluid phase transitions of a flexible three-dimensional four-site chiral molecular model developed by Latinwo et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 145 , 154503 (2016)] and Petsev et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 155 , 084105 (2021)]. By introducing a bias favoring local homochiral vs heterochiral interactions, the system exhibits a phase transition from a single achiral phase to a single chiral phase that undergoes infrequent interconversion between the two thermodynamically identical chiral states: the L-rich and D-rich phases. According to the phase rule, this reactive binary system has two independent degrees of freedom and exhibits a density-dependent critical locus.

  abstract = {We examine the many-body expansion (MBE) for alkaline earth metal clusters, Be n , Mg n , Ca n ( n = 4, 5, 6), at the Møller–Plesset second order perturbation theory, coupled-cluster singles and doubles with perturbative triples, multi-reference perturbation theory, and multi-reference configuration interaction levels of theory. The magnitude of each term in the MBE is evaluated for several geometrical configurations. We find that the behavior of the MBE for these clusters depends strongly on the geometrical arrangement and, to a lesser extent, on the level of theory used. Another factor that affects the MBE is the in situ (ground or excited) electronic state of the individual atoms in the cluster. For most geometries, the three-body term is the largest, followed by a steady decrease in absolute energy for subsequent terms. Though these systems exhibit non-negligible multi-reference effects, there was little qualitative difference in the MBE when employing single vs multi-reference methods. Useful insights into the connectivity and stability of these clusters have been drawn from the respective potential energy surfaces and quasi-atomic orbitals for the various dimers, trimers, and tetramers. Through these analyses, we investigate the similarities and differences in the binding energies of different-sized clusters for these metals.},

  abstract = {Singlet fission (SF), a process that produces two triplet excitons from one singlet exciton, has attracted recent interest for its potential to circumvent the detailed-balance efficiency limit of single-junction solar cells. For the potential of SF to be fully realized, accurate assignment and quantification of SF is necessary. Intersystem crossing (ISC) is another process of singlet to triplet conversion that is important to distinguish from SF to avoid either over- or under-estimation of SF triplet production. Here, we quantify an upper bound on the rate of ISC in two commonly studied SF chromophores, TIPS–pentacene and TIPS–tetracene, by using transient absorption spectroscopy of solutions of varying concentrations in toluene. We show that SF in solutions of these acenes has previously been misidentified as ISC, and vice versa. By determining a bimolecular SF rate constant in concentrated solutions in which SF dominates over ISC, we distinguish triplet formation due to SF from triplet formation due to ISC and show that the characteristic time scale of ISC must be longer than 325 ns in TIPS–pentacene, while it must be longer than 118 ns in TIPS–tetracene. We additionally note that no excimer formation is observed in the relatively dilute (up to 8 mM) solutions studied here, indicating that previous excimer formation observed at much higher concentrations may be partially due to aggregate formation. This work highlights that an accurate quantification of ISC is crucial as it leads to accurate determination of SF rate constants and yields.},

The radicals are doped into a beam of liquid helium droplets and probed with infrared action spectroscopy from 2700 to 3125 cm −1 , allowing for a low temperature measurement of the CH stretching region. The presence of anharmonic resonance polyads in the 2800–3000 cm −1 region complicates its interpretation. To facilitate spectral assignment, the anharmonic resonances are modeled with two model Hamiltonian approaches that explicitly couple CH stretch fundamentals to HCH bend overtones and combinations: a VPT2+K normal mode model based on coupled-cluster with single, double, and perturbative triple excitations [CCSD(T)] quartic force fields and a semi-empirical local mode model. Both of these computational methods provide generally good agreement with the experimental spectra.},

The potential was calculated by the supermolecular approach at the explicitly correlated coupled cluster [CCSD (T)-F12a] level with aug-cc-pVTZ basis set plus midpoint bond functions. Two vibrationally averaged four-dimensional potentials for CO–CO 2 with CO 2 at the ground and ν 3 excited states were generated by the integration of the five-dimensional potential over the Q 3 intramolecular coordinate. Each potential displays a T-shaped global minimum with the C end in the CO unit pointing toward the C atom in the CO 2 unit and a T-shaped local minimum but with the CO monomer rotated by 180°. The rovibrational bound states and energy levels for the CO–CO 2 dimer were obtained employing the radial discrete variable representation/angular finite basis representation method in conjunction with the Lanczos algorithm. The vibrational ground and some lower excited states for CO–CO 2 are localized around the global minimum because of the higher potential barriers. The band origin is blueshifted by 0.2089 cm −1 for CO–CO 2 in the CO 2 ν 3 range, which is consistent with the experimental result of 0.211 cm −1 . The geared bending vibrational frequencies for CO–CO 2 are 24.7101 and 24.5549 cm −1 at the ground and ν 3 excited states of CO 2 , respectively. The predicted rovibrational frequencies, as well as spectral constants, coincide with the available observations, and these parameters show that the CO–CO 2 complex is a nearly prolate asymmetric rotor.},

  abstract = {A comprehensive computational study on the oxygen molecule (O 2 ) adsorption and activation on bimetallic Au–Ir subnanometer clusters supported on TiO 2 (101)— up to five atoms in size—is performed. A global optimization density functional theory-based basin-hopping algorithm is used to determine putative global minima configurations of both mono- and bimetallic clusters supported on the metal oxide surface for all sizes and compositions. Our results indicate a strong cluster-oxide interaction for monometallic Ir clusters with calculated adsorption energy (E ads ) values ranging from −3.11 to −5.91 eV. Similar values are calculated for bimetallic Au–Ir clusters (−3.21 up to −5.69 eV). However, weaker E ads values are calculated for Au clusters (ranging from −0.66 to −2.07 eV). As a general trend, we demonstrate that for supported Au–Ir clusters on TiO 2 (101), those Ir atoms preferentially occupy cluster-oxide interface positions while acting as anchor sites for the Au atoms. The overall geometric arrangements of the putative global minima configurations define O 2 adsorption and dissociation, particularly involving the monometallic Au 5 and Ir 5 as well as the bimetallic Au 2 Ir 3 and Au 3 Ir 2 supported clusters. Spontaneous O 2 dissociation is observed on both Ir 5 and on the Ir-metallic part of Au 3 Ir 2 and Au 2 Ir 3 supported clusters. This is in sharp contrast with supported Au 5 , where a large activation energy is needed (1.90 eV). Interestingly, for Au 5 , we observe that molecular O 2 adsorption is favorable at the cluster/oxide interface, followed by a smaller dissociation barrier (0.71 eV). From a single cluster catalysis point of view, our results have strong implications in the ongoing understanding of oxide supported bimetallic while providing a useful first insight into the continuous in silico design of novel subnanometer catalysts.},

The photodesorption spectra from the mixed ices reveal an indirect desorption mechanism for which the desorption of N 2 15 and CO 13 is triggered by the photoabsorption of CO 13 and N 2 15 ⁠ , respectively. This mechanism is confirmed by the x-ray photodesorption of CO 13 from a layered CO 13 / N 2 15 ice irradiated at 401 eV on the N 1s → π * transition of N 2 15 ⁠ . This latter experiment enables us to quantify the relevant depth involved in the indirect desorption process, which is found to be 30–40 monolayers in that case. This value is further related to the energy transport of Auger electrons emitted from the photoabsorbing N 2 15 molecules that scatter toward the ice surface, inducing the desorption of CO 13 ⁠ . The photodesorption yields corrected from the energy that can participate in the desorption process (expressed in molecules desorbed by eV deposited) do not depend on the photon energy; hence, they depend neither on the photoabsorbing molecule nor on its state after Auger decay. This demonstrates that x-ray induced electron stimulated desorption, mediated by Auger scattering, is the dominant process explaining the desorption of N 2 15 and CO 13 from the ices studied in this work.},

Precise analysis of the 3 He, 14 N, 15 N, and 1 H resonance frequencies show a linear dependence on the gas density. Extrapolation of these results to the zero-pressure limit gives ν 0 ( 1 H), ν 0 ( 14 N), and ν 0 ( 15 N) resonance frequencies of the isolated ammonia molecule at 300 K. The analogous value for 3 He atoms in gaseous mixtures ν 0 ( 3 He) was measured as well. The application of a new scheme to introduce the most important electronic effects on NMR shieldings, together with highly accurate quantum chemical shielding calculations, allows the 14/15 N and 1 H shielding of the isolated ammonia molecule to be obtained with the greatest accuracy and precision. For the first time, these studies were carried out on ammonia within the so-called four-component relativistic framework. The NMR frequency comparison method provides an approach for determining the 14 N and 15 N nuclear magnetic moments. The new shielding parameters in ammonia were used for re-evaluation of the entire nitrogen absolute shielding scale. Additionally, the absolute shielding values of several gaseous compounds and secondary reference substances in liquids were presented. It was established that 14 N and 15 N absolute shielding constants in 14 NH 3 and 15 NH 3 are very similar and only differ by less than 0.01 ppm, which is not usually measurable in NMR experiments. Precise calculations of 14 N and 15 N dipole moments were also made from these accurate shielding values.},

The so determined equilibrium constants were treated by the “third-law method” of thermodynamic analysis, integrated with theoretical calculations, and the dissociation energy at 0 K was derived as D 0 K ° (AuTi) = 241.0 ± 5.2 kJ/mol. A similar investigation was carried out for the AuSc and AuFe species, whose dissociation energies were previously reported with large uncertainties. The direct dissociation and the isomolecular exchange with the Au 2 dimer were studied in the 1969–2274 and 1842–2092 K ranges for AuSc and AuFe, respectively, and the dissociation energies derived as D 0 K ° (AuSc) = 240.4 ± 6.0 and D 0 K ° (AuFe) = 186.2 ± 4.2 kJ/mol.

The stronger bond of AuTi compared to AuFe parallels the trend observed in monochlorides.

  abstract = {Multi-ionization and subsequent Coulomb explosion (CE) of the N 2 O molecule irradiated by a linearly polarized 800 nm laser field is investigated by a reaction microscope, where a number of CE channels of N 2 O q + with q ≤ 5 for two-body fragmentation and q ≤ 8 for three-body fragmentation were observed. For two-body CE, by analyzing the internuclear separations extracted from kinetic energy releases (KERs), dissociation branching fractions, and laser intensity dependence, interestingly, we found that fragmentation N 2 O 5+ → N 3+ + NO 2+ is produced directly from dissociating N 2 O 3+ via non-sequential stairstep ionization, whereas most of the others result from the sequential stairstep ionization. For three-body CE, 25 fragmentation channels of N 2 O q + ( q = 3–8) are distinguished in the present charge-encoded multi-photoion coincidence plot, and the concerted fragmentation mechanism is nominated in a typical Dalitz plot. With the help of the numerical computation with the measured KERs and momentum correlation angles, the geometric structures of molecular ions prior to fragmentation are reconstructed, which display the bending motion and simultaneous two-bond stretching before the CE. Increasing of the bond length for high charged N 2 O q + indicates the dominating stairstep ionization in the three-body fragmentation.},

This is made by using a symmetry adapted basis set combining electronic (spin and orbital) and nuclear angular momenta in the reactants channel. To this aim, accurate ab initio calculations are performed separately for reactants and products. In the reactants channel, the three lowest electronic states (without spin–orbit couplings) have been diabatized, and the spin–orbit couplings have been introduced through a model localizing the spin–orbit interactions in the N + atom, which yields accurate results as compared to ab initio calculations, including spin–orbit couplings. For the products, 11 purely adiabatic spin–orbit states have been determined with ab initio calculations. The reactive rate constants thus obtained are in very good agreement with the available experimental data for several ortho-H 2 fractions, assuming a thermal initial distribution of spin–orbit states. The rate constants for selected spin–orbit J A states are obtained, to provide a proper validation of the spin–orbit effects to obtain the experimental rate constants.},

The determination of the steady-state carrier responses allows the clarification of optical and photovoltaic properties under 1-sun illumination and thus the identification of loss mechanisms in device performance. Model calculations are also provided to show how the carrier lifetime governs the luminescence quantum yields and open-circuit voltages. The calculations quantify a scaling law between a monomolecular recombination lifetime and an open-circuit voltage as a result of a combination of two density-dependent effects.},

  abstract = {We extended our studies of the effect of dynamical electron correlation on the covalent bonds in the AH and AF series (A = B–F) to the recoupled pair bonds in the excited a 4 Σ − states of the CH and CF molecules. Dynamical correlation is energetically less important in the a 4 Σ − states than in the corresponding X 2 Π states for both molecules, which is reflected in smaller changes in bond energies ( D e ). Changes in the equilibrium bond distance ( R e ) and vibrational frequency (ω e ), on the other hand, are influenced by the changes in the slope and curvature of the dynamical electron correlation energy as a function of the internuclear distance R , E DEC ( R ). In the CH( a 4 Σ − ) state, these changes are much smaller than in the CH(X 2 Π) state, but in the CF( a 4 Σ − ) state, they are larger, reflecting a significant difference in the shapes of E DEC ( R ) curves. At large R , the shape of E DEC ( R ) curves for covalent and recoupled pair bonds is similar although different in magnitude. For the CH( a 4 Σ − ) state, E DEC ( R ) has a minimum at R = R e + 0.72 Å as the orbitals associated with the formation of the recoupled pair bond switch places. E DEC ( R ) for the CF( a 4 Σ − ) state decreases continuously throughout the bound region of the potential energy curve because the dynamical correlation energy associated with the electrons in the lone pair orbitals is increasing. These results support our earlier conclusion that we still have much to learn about the nature of dynamical electron correlation in molecules.},

The deep learning model is built based on a convolutional encoder–decoder network (CED) and is applied for high-dimensional surrogate modeling to relate the fluid properties to the fluid–fluid potential. The CED model is then combined with the interatomic potential-based continuum theory to determine the concentration profiles of a confined LJ fluid and confined water. We show that the DL-QT model exhibits robust predictive performance for a confined LJ fluid under various thermodynamic states and for water confined in a nanochannel of different widths. The DL-QT model seamlessly connects molecular physics at the nanoscale with continuum theory by using a deep learning model.},

The scheme is based on a previously formulated theory for predicting optical absorption and magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) spectra. The scheme operates in the framework of the full semi-classical field–matter interaction operator, thus generating a powerful and general computational scheme capable of computing the absorption, circular dichroism (CD), and MCD spectra. In addition, our implementation includes the treatment of relativistic effects in the framework of quasidegenerate perturbation theory, which accounts for scalar relativistic effects (in the self-consistent field step) and spin–orbit coupling (in the TD-DFT step), as well as external magnetic field perturbations. Hence, this formalism is also able to probe spin-forbidden transitions. The random orientations of molecules are taken into account by a semi-numerical approach involving a Lebedev numerical quadrature alongside analytical integration. It is demonstrated that the numerical quadrature requires as few as 14 points for satisfactory converged results, thus leading to a highly efficient scheme, while the calculation of the exact transition moments creates no computational bottlenecks. It is demonstrated that at zero magnetic field, the CD spectrum is recovered, while the sum of left and right circularly polarized light contributions provides the linear absorption spectrum. The virtues of this efficient and general protocol are demonstrated on a selected set of organic molecules where the various contributions to the spectral intensities have been analyzed in detail.},

In reality, the photosynthetic reaction center constitutes an open quantum system of EET and ET, which manifests interplay of pigments, solar light, and phonon baths. So far, theoretical studies have been mainly based on master equation approaches in the Markovian condition. The non-Markovian environmental effect, which may play a crucial role, has not been sufficiently considered. In this work, we propose a mixed dynamic approach to investigate this open system. The influence of phonon bath is treated via the exact dissipaton equation of motion (DEOM), while that of photon bath is via the Lindblad master equation. Specifically, we explore the effect of non-Markovian quantum phonon bath on the coherent transfer dynamics and its manipulation on the current–voltage behavior. Distinguished from the results of the completely Markovian–Lindblad equation and those adopting the classical environment description, the mixed DEOM–Lindblad simulations exhibit transfer coherence up to a few hundred femtoseconds and the related environmental manipulation effect on the current. These non-Markovian quantum coherent effects may be extended to more complex and realistic systems and be helpful in the design of organic photovoltaic devices.},

Chem. Chem. Phys. 24 , 3532 (2022)]. NRO analysis along the intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) for several typical chemical reactions demonstrated that electron transfer occurs mainly in the vicinity of transition states and in regions where the energy profile along the IRC shows shoulder features, allowing the reaction mechanism to be explained in terms of electron motion. However, its application has been limited to single configuration theories such as Hartree–Fock theory and density functional theory. In this work, the concept of NRO is extended to multiconfigurational wavefunctions and formulated as the multiconfiguration NRO (MC-NRO). The MC-NRO method is applicable to various types of electronic structure theories, including multiconfigurational theory and linear response theory, and is expected to be a practical tool for extracting the essential qualitative features of a broad range of chemical reactions, including covalent bond dissociation and chemical reactions in electronically excited states. In this paper, we calculate the IRC for five basic chemical reaction processes at the level of the complete active space self-consistent field theory and discuss the phenomenon of electron transfer by performing MC-NRO analysis along each IRC. Finally, issues and future prospects of the MC-NRO method are discussed.},

In this work, we present an efficient nonadiabatic molecular dynamics (NAMD) simulation method based on time-dependent density functional tight-binding (TDDFTB) theory. Specifically, the adiabatic electronic structure, an essential NAMD input, is described at the TDDFTB level. The nonadiabatic effects originating from the coupled motions of electrons and nuclei are treated by the trajectory surface hopping algorithm. To improve the computational efficiency, nonadiabatic couplings between excited states within the TDDFTB method are derived and implemented using an analytical approach. Furthermore, the time-dependent nonadiabatic coupling scalars are calculated based on the overlap between molecular orbitals rather than the Slater determinants to speed up the simulations. In addition, the electronic decoherence scheme and a state reassigned unavoided crossings algorithm, which has been implemented in the NEXMD software, are used to improve the accuracy of the simulated dynamics and handle trivial unavoided crossings. Finally, the photoinduced nonadiabatic dynamics of a benzene molecule are simulated to demonstrate our implementation. The results for excited state NAMD simulations of benzene molecule based on TDDFTB method compare well to those obtained with numerically expensive time-dependent density functional theory. The proposed methodology provides an attractive theoretical simulation tool for predicting the photophysical and photochemical properties of complex materials.},

  abstract = {Given a chemical reaction going from reactant (R) to the product (P) on a potential energy surface (PES) and a collective variable (CV) discriminating between R and P, we define the free-energy profile (FEP) as the logarithm of the marginal Boltzmann distribution of the CV. This FEP is not a true free energy. Nevertheless, it is common to treat the FEP as the “free-energy” analog of the minimum potential energy path and to take the activation free energy, Δ F RP ‡ ⁠ , as the difference between the maximum at the transition state and the minimum at R. We show that this approximation can result in large errors. The FEP depends on the CV and is, therefore, not unique. For the same reaction, different discriminating CVs can yield different Δ F RP ‡ ⁠ . We derive an exact expression for the activation free energy that avoids this ambiguity. We find Δ F RP ‡ to be a combination of the probability of the system being in the reactant state, the probability density on the dividing surface, and the thermal de Broglie wavelength associated with the transition. We apply our formalism to simple analytic models and realistic chemical systems and show that the FEP-based approximation applies only at low temperatures for CVs with a small effective mass. Most chemical reactions occur on complex, high-dimensional PES that cannot be treated analytically and pose the added challenge of choosing a good CV. We study the influence of that choice and find that, while the reaction free energy is largely unaffected, Δ F RP ‡ is quite sensitive.},

  abstract = {We consider an arbitrary quantum mechanical system, initially in its ground-state, exposed to a time-dependent electromagnetic pulse with a carrier frequency ω 0 and a slowly varying envelope of finite duration. By working out a solution to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation in the high- ω 0 limit, we find that, to the leading order in ω 0 − 1 ⁠ , a perfect self-cancellation of the system’s linear response occurs as the pulse switches off. Surprisingly, the system’s observables are, nonetheless, describable in terms of a combination of its linear density response function and nonlinear functions of the electric field. An analysis of a jellium slab and jellium sphere models reveals a very high surface sensitivity of the considered setup, producing a richer excitation spectrum than accessible within the conventional linear response regime. On this basis, we propose a new spectroscopic technique, which we provisionally name the Nonlinear High-Frequency Pulsed Spectroscopy (NLHFPS). Combining the advantages of the extraordinary surface sensitivity, the absence of constraints by the traditional dipole selection rules, and the clarity of theoretical interpretation utilizing the linear response time-dependent density functional theory, NLHFPS has a potential to evolve into a powerful characterization method for nanoscience and nanotechnology.},

  abstract = {Real-time feedback-driven single-particle tracking is a technique that uses feedback control to enable single-molecule spectroscopy of freely diffusing particles in native or near-native environments. A number of different real-time feedback-driven single-particle tracking (RT-FD-SPT) approaches exist, and comparisons between methods based on experimental results are of limited use due to differences in samples and setups. In this study, we used statistical calculations and dynamical simulations to directly compare the performance of different methods. The methods considered were the orbital method, the knight‘s tour (grid scan) method, and MINFLUX, and we considered both fluorescence-based and interferometric scattering (iSCAT) approaches. There is a fundamental trade-off between precision and speed, with the knight’s tour method being able to track the fastest diffusion but with low precision, and MINFLUX being the most precise but only tracking slow diffusion. To compare iSCAT and fluorescence, different biological samples were considered, including labeled and intrinsically fluorescent samples. The success of iSCAT as compared to fluorescence is strongly dependent on the particle size and the density and photophysical properties of the fluorescent particles. Using a wavelength for iSCAT that is negligibly absorbed by the tracked particle allows for an increased illumination intensity, which results in iSCAT providing better tracking for most samples. This work highlights the fundamental aspects of performance in RT-FD-SPT and should assist with the selection of an appropriate method for a particular application. The approach used can easily be extended to other RT-FD-SPT methods.},

Numerical simulations are conducted in a nonperturbative and non-Markovian SB coupling regime by using the hierarchical equations of motion under these fields at different cycle frequencies. The work applied to the total system and the heat exchanged with the baths are rigorously evaluated. In addition, by regarding quasi-static work as free energy, we compute the quantum thermodynamic variables and analyze the simulation results by using thermodynamic work diagrams for the first time. Analysis of these diagrams indicates that, in the strong SB coupling region, the fields for the SB interactions are major sources of work, while in other regions, the field for the subsystem is a source of work. We find that the maximum efficiency is achieved in the quasi-static case and is determined solely by the bath temperatures, regardless of the SB coupling strength, which is a numerical manifestation of Carnot’s theorem.},

In this article, we look for an interpretation for the high accuracy of coupled-cluster theory based on how the manifold of coupled-cluster wave functions is embedded within the space of n -electron wave functions. We define the coupled-cluster and configuration interaction manifolds and measure the distances from the full-configuration interaction (FCI) wave function to these manifolds. We clearly observe that the FCI wave function is closer to the coupled-cluster manifold that is curved than to the configuration interaction manifold that is flat for the selected systems studied in this work. Furthermore, the decomposition of the distances among these manifolds and wave functions into excitation ranks gives insights into the failure of the coupled-cluster approach for multireference systems. The present results show a new interpretation for the quality of the coupled-cluster method, as contrasted to the truncated configuration interaction approach, besides the well-established argument based on size extensivity. Furthermore, we show how a geometric description of wave function methods can be used in electronic structure theory.},

  abstract = {This work presented a new model, Polarizable Fragment Density Model (PFDM), for the fast energy estimation of peptides, proteins, or other large molecular systems. By introducing an analogous relation to the virial theorem, the kinetic energy in Kohn–Sham Density Functional Theory (DFT) is approximated to the corresponding potential energy multiplied by a scale factor. Furthermore, the error due to this approximation together with the exchange–correlation energy is approximated as a second order Taylor’s expansion about density. The PFDM energy is expressed as a functional of electronic density with system-dependent model parameters, such as a scaling factor c and a series of atomic pairwise K AB . The electron density in PFDM consists of a frozen part retaining chemical bonding information and a polarizable part to describe polarization effects, both of which are expanded as a linear expansion of Gaussian basis functions. The frozen density can be pre-calculated by fitting the DFT calculated density of fragments, as well as the polarizable density is optimized to solve PFDM energy. The PFDM energy is a quadratic function of the expansion coefficients of polarizable density and can be solved without expensive iteration process and numerical integrals. PFDM is especially suitable for the energy calculation of large molecular system with identical subunits, such as proteins, nucleic acids, and molecular clusters. Applying the PFDM method to the proteins, the results show that the accuracy is comparable to the PM6 semi-empirical method, and the efficiency is one order of magnitude faster than PM6.},

However, when two molecular fragments bind through complex interactions involving multiple concurrent charge flows, ordinary CD analysis is capable of providing only an averaged picture of the related charge-flow profiles and no detailed information on each of them. In this article, we combine CD analysis with a Hirshfeld partitioning of the molecular charge redistribution for a local analysis on focused portions of the molecule, allowing for a detailed characterization of one charge flow at a time. The resulting scheme—the local charge-displacement (LCD) analysis—is tested on the intriguing case of the dimethyl sulfide–sulfur dioxide complex, characterized by concurrent charge flows relating to a sulfur–sulfur homochalcogen interaction and a pair of hydrogen bonds. The LCD scheme is then applied to the analysis of multiple hydrogen bonding in the acetic acid dimer, of base-pairing interactions in DNA, and of ambifunctional hydrogen bonding in the ammonia–pyridine complex.},

The configuration selection scheme proposed in this work is quite general, requiring only the selection of several de-excitation and excitation orbitals in a sense like the restricted active space self-consistent field method. Practically, this is also the first time that BOVB results are extrapolated to complete basis set limit.

Following this interesting idea, the Stratonovich–Weyl transform is used to map an operator in the Hilbert space to a continuous function on the SU ( N ) Lie group, i.e., a smooth manifold which is a phase space of continuous variables. We further use the Wigner representation to describe the nuclear degrees of freedom and derive an exact expression of the time-correlation function as well as the exact quantum Liouvillian for the non-adiabatic system. Making the linearization approximation, this exact Liouvillian is reduced to the Liouvillian of several recently proposed methods, and the performance of this linearized method is tested using non-adiabatic models. We envision that the theoretical work presented here provides a rigorous and unified framework to formally derive non-adiabatic quantum dynamics approaches with continuous variables and connects the previous methods in a clear and concise manner.},

However, the analysis of resonance Raman spectra is much facilitated when measurements are accompanied by Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations that are expensive for large biomolecules. In this work, resonance Raman spectra are therefore computed with the Density Functional Tight-Binding (DFTB) method in the time-dependent excited-state gradient approximation. To test the accuracy of the tight-binding approximations, this method is first applied to typical resonance Raman benchmark molecules, such as β-carotene, and compared to results obtained with pure and range-separated exchange–correlation functionals. We then demonstrate the efficiency of the approach by considering a computationally challenging heme variation. Overall, we find that the vibrational frequencies and excited-state properties (energies and gradients) that are needed to simulate the spectra are reasonably accurate and suitable for interpretation of experiments. We can therefore recommend DFTB as a fast computational method to interpret resonance Raman spectra.},

We employ the reduced hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) approach to calculate the time evolution of the system and compare it to the pure F exciton cases. We compute the absorption and time-gated fluorescence (TGF) spectra for different exciton transfer integrals and F-CT bandgap conditions. The coherence length of excitons ( N coh ) is evaluated employing two different definitions. We observe the presence of an excited hot state peak whose intensity is associated with the delocalization of the excited species and ultrafast dynamics that are solely dependent on the frequency of the local bath. The results indicate that the inclusion of CT states promotes localization of the excitons, which is manifested in a decrease in the intensity of the hot state peak and the 0–1 peak and an increase in the intensity of the 0–0 emission peak in the TGF spectrum, leading to a decrease of N coh .},

The effects of wall temperature, fluid thermal diffusivity, and particle size and density were considered in terms of both the focusing efficiency and performance of Brownian particles. It was revealed that the particle focusing process follows a quadratic relationship with time at high wall temperatures or a linear relationship at low wall temperatures. For a fixed wall temperature, the focusing efficiency (i.e., how fast the Brownian particles aggregate) is dominated by the Prandtl number, that is, the relative importance of the heat transfer and momentum transfer in the fluid. Meanwhile, the Lewis number, that is, the ratio of the fluid thermal diffusivity to the particle self-diffusivity, controls the focusing performance (i.e., to what extent Brownian particles aggregate). The possible mechanisms behind this are discussed. Finally, the negligible influence of particle density on both the focusing efficiency and performance was revealed.},

  abstract = {The multireference second-order perturbation theory (CASPT2) is known to deliver a quantitative description of various complex electronic states. Despite its near-size-consistent nature, the applicability of the CASPT2 method to large, real-life systems is mostly hindered by large computational and storage costs for the two-external tensors, such as two-electron integrals, amplitudes, and residuum. To this end, Menezes and co-workers developed a reduced-scaling CASPT2 scheme by incorporating the local pair-natural orbital (PNO) representation of the many-body wave functions using non-orthonormal projected atomic orbitals (PAOs) into the CASPT theory [F. Menezes et al. , J. Chem. Phys. 145 , 124115 (2016)]. Alternatively, in this paper, we develop a new PNO-based CASPT2 scheme using the orthonormal localized virtual molecular orbitals (LVMOs) and assess its performance and accuracy in comparison with the conventional PAO-based counterpart. Albeit the compactness, the LVMOs were considered to perform somewhat poorly compared to PAOs in the local correlation framework because they caused enormously large orbital domains. In this work, we show that the size of LVMO domains can be rendered comparable to or even smaller than that of PAOs by the use of the differential overlap integrals for domain construction. Optimality of the MOs from the CASSCF treatment is a key to reducing the LVMO domain size for the multireference case. Due to the augmented Hessian-based localization algorithm, an additional computational cost for obtaining the LVMOs is relatively minor. We demonstrate that the LVMO-based PNO-CASPT2 method is routinely applicable to large, real-life molecules such as Menshutkin S N 2 reaction in a single-walled carbon nanotube reaction field.},

The relation is based on a silent assumption that the two densities can be obtained from two independent Kohn–Sham equations, i.e., are v s -representable. It is shown that this assumption does not hold for pairs of densities: ρ tot being the Kohn–Sham density in some system and ρ B obtained from such partitioning of ρ tot that the difference ρ tot − ρ B vanishes on a Lebesgue measurable volume element. The inversion procedure is still applicable for ρ tot − ρ B but cannot be interpreted as the inversion of the Kohn–Sham equation. It is rather the inversion of a Kohn–Sham-like equation. The effective potential in the latter equation comprises a “contaminant” that might even not be unique.

Au has the lowest onset potential for catalyzing the electrooxidation of 4-HMBA among the three metals in base, whereas Pt does not catalyze the electrooxidation of 4-HMBA under alkaline conditions, although it is conventionally a good electrocatalyst for alcohol oxidation.

The electrodeposited Au NPs on indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass is further utilized as the working electrode for the 4-HMBA electrooxidation. With its broad absorption in the visible and near-infrared range, we show that the Au NPs on the ITO electrode could enhance the electrochemical oxidation of 4-HMBA under green and red LED light illuminations (505 and 625 nm).

  abstract = {In the Stokes–Einstein picture, diffusion of a Brownian particle or a molecule in a liquid solvent is caused by unbalanced fluctuations of osmotic forces on different sides of the particle. When the particle carries a charge or a higher multipolar moment, this picture is amended by fluctuations of electrostatic forces producing dielectric friction. Dielectric friction slows down both the translational and rotational diffusion. While this picture is well established and is physically sound, standard theories grossly overestimate the magnitude of dielectric friction for small dipolar solutes and larger colloidal particles, such as proteins. Motivated by recent simulation studies, this Perspective discusses the interplay between osmotic (van der Waals) and electrostatic forces in promoting molecular and colloidal diffusion. Much can be learned about microscopic friction mechanisms from statistical and dynamical correlations between osmotic and electrostatic forces.},

  abstract = {To understand protein folding mechanisms from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, it is important to explore not only folded/unfolded states but also representative intermediate structures on the conformational landscape. Here, we propose a novel approach to construct the landscape using the uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) method, which reduces the dimensionality without losing data-point proximity. In the approach, native contact likelihood is used as feature variables rather than the conventional Cartesian coordinates or dihedral angles of protein structures. We tested the performance of UMAP for coarse-grained MD simulation trajectories of B1 domain in protein G and observed on-pathway transient structures and other metastable states on the UMAP conformational landscape. In contrast, these structures were not clearly distinguished on the dimensionality reduced landscape using principal component analysis or time-lagged independent component analysis. This approach is also useful to obtain dynamical information through Markov state modeling and would be applicable to large-scale conformational changes in many other biomacromolecules.},

  abstract = {Depletion forces are fundamental for determining the phase behavior of a vast number of materials and colloidal dispersions and have been used for the manipulation of in- and out-of-equilibrium thermodynamic states. The entropic nature of depletion forces is well understood; however, most theoretical approaches, and also molecular simulations, work quantitatively at moderate size ratios in much diluted systems since large size asymmetries and high particle concentrations are difficult to deal with. The existing approaches for integrating out the degrees of freedom of the depletant species may fail under these extreme physical conditions. Thus, the main goal of this contribution is to introduce a general physical formulation for obtaining the depletion forces even in those cases where the concentration of all species is relevant. We show that the contraction of the bare forces uniquely determines depletion interactions. Our formulation is tested by studying depletion forces in binary and ternary colloidal mixtures. We report here results for dense systems with total packing fractions of 45\% and 55\%. Our results open up the possibility of finding an efficient route to determine effective interactions at a finite concentration, even under non-equilibrium thermodynamic conditions.},

  abstract = {A wide class of antimicrobial amphipathic peptides is aimed to selectively form through pores in bacterial membranes. The partial incorporation of the peptides into the lipid monolayer leads to elastic deformation of the membrane. The deformation influences both the adsorption of the peptides and their lateral interaction. Detailed study of pore formation mechanisms requires an accurate determination of the surface concentration of the peptides at their given bulk concentration. Widely used methods to register the adsorption are atomic force microscopy (AFM), surface plasmon resonance refractometry (SPRR), and inner field compensation (IFC). AFM and SPRR utilize membranes deposited onto a solid support, while IFC operates with model membranes under substantial lateral tension. Here, we theoretically studied the effect of the solid support and lateral tension on the elastic deformations of the membrane induced by partially incorporated amphipathic peptides and thus on the peptide adsorption energy and lateral interaction. We demonstrated that, under conditions typical for AFM, SPRR, and IFC, the adsorption energy can increase by up to 1.5 k B T per peptide leading to about 4 times decreased surface concentration as compared to free-standing tensionless membranes. In addition, the effective lateral size of the peptide molecule increases by about 10\%, which can have an impact on the quantitative description of the adsorption isotherms. Our results allow estimating the effects of the solid support and lateral tension on the adsorption and interaction of amphipathic peptides at the membrane surface and taking them into account in interpretation of experimental observations.},

Excited states of π -stacked dimers of tetra-thiophene oligomers (T4), infinite isolated polythiophene (PT) chains, and P3[Alkyl]T crystals are modeled using configuration interaction singles (CIS) calculations. Excited states in cofacial T4 dimers are mostly localized Frenkel states except for two low energy charge transfer (CT) exciton states, which become the ionization potential and electron affinity levels of T4 molecules at large dimer separation. The lowest excited states in infinite, isolated PT chains and P3[Alkyl]T crystals are intra-chain excitons where the electron and hole are localized on the same chain. The next lowest excited states are interchain, CT excitons in which the electron and hole reside on neighboring chains. The former capture almost all optical oscillator strength and the latter may be a route to efficient formation of polaronic charge carriers in P3[Alkyl]T systems. Changes in optical absorption energies of T4 dimers as a function of molecular separation are explained using CIS calculations with four frontier orbitals in the active space. Shifts in optical absorption energy observed on going from isolated chains to P3[Alkyl]T lamellar structures are already present in single-particle transition energies induced by direct π – π interactions at short range. The electroabsorption spectrum of T4 dimers is calculated as a function of dimer separation and states that are responsible for parallel and perpendicular components of the spectrum are identified.},

To focus on the protein–solvent interface, we use mixtures with about equal numbers of amino acids and solvent molecules. The elastin and lysozyme mixtures show similar glass transition steps, which extend over a broad temperature range of 157–185 K. The BDS and NMR studies yield fully consistent results for the fastest process P1, which is caused by the structural relaxation of ethylene glycol between the protein molecules and follows an Arrhenius law with an activation energy of E a = 0.63 eV. It involves quasi-isotropic reorientation and is very similar in the elastin and lysozyme matrices but different from the α and β relaxations of bulk ethylene glycol. Two slower BDS processes, viz., P2 and P3, have protein-dependent time scales, but they exhibit a similar Arrhenius-like temperature dependence with an activation energy of E a ∼ 0.81 eV. However, P2 and P3 do not have a clear NMR signature. In particular, the NMR results for the lysozyme mixture reveal that the protein backbone does not show isotropic α -like motion on the P2 and P3 time scales but only restricted β -like reorientation. The different activation energies of the P1 and P2/P3 processes do not support an intimate coupling of protein and ethylene glycol dynamics. The present results are compared with previous findings for mixtures of proteins with water or glycerol, implying qualitatively different dynamical couplings at various protein–solvent interfaces.},

Here, the famous Heusler alloys are investigated as ECO 2 RR catalysts for the first time by means of density functional theory calculations. The linear scaling relationship between the adsorption energies of CHO (and COOH) and CO intermediates is broken and, thus, the overpotential can be tuned regularly by chemically permuting different 3 d , 4 d , or 5 d transition metals (TMs) in Heusler alloy Cu 2 TMAl. Cu 2 ZnAl shows the best activity among all the 30 Heusler alloys considered in the present study, with 41\% improvement in energy efficiency compared to pure Cu electrode. Cu 2 PdAl, Cu 2 AgAl, Cu 2 PtAl, and Cu 2 AuAl are also good candidates. The calculations on the competition between hydrogen evolution reaction and CO 2 RR indicate that Cu 2 ZnAl is also the one having the best selectivity toward hydrocarbons. This work identifies the possibility of applying the Heusler alloy as an efficient ECO 2 RR catalyst. Since thousands of Heusler alloys have been found in experiments, the present study also encourages the search for more promising candidates in this broad research area.},

  abstract = {Many techniques to fabricate complex nanostructures and quantum emitting defects in low dimensional materials for quantum information technologies rely on the patterning capabilities of focused ion beam (FIB) systems. In particular, the ability to pattern arrays of bright and stable room temperature single-photon emitters (SPEs) in 2D wide-bandgap insulator hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) via high-energy heavy-ion FIB allows for direct placement of SPEs without structured substrates or polymer-reliant lithography steps. However, the process parameters needed to create hBN SPEs with this technique are dependent on the growth method of the material chosen. Moreover, morphological damage induced by high-energy heavy-ion exposure may further influence the successful creation of SPEs. In this work, we perform atomic force microscopy to characterize the surface morphology of hBN regions patterned by Ga + FIB to create SPEs at a range of ion doses and find that material swelling, and not milling as expected, is most strongly and positively correlated with the onset of non-zero SPE yields. Furthermore, we simulate vacancy concentration profiles at each of the tested doses and propose a qualitative model to elucidate how Ga + FIB patterning creates isolated SPEs that is consistent with observed optical and morphological characteristics and is dependent on the consideration of void nucleation and growth from vacancy clusters. Our results provide novel insight into the formation of hBN SPEs created by high-energy heavy-ion milling that can be leveraged for monolithic hBN photonic devices and could be applied to a wide range of low-dimensional solid-state SPE hosts.},

We have investigated the wetting layer formation of water (ice) on the graphite (0001) surface using a combination of low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). At around monolayer coverages, the LEED pattern showed a (2 × 2) periodicity and STM revealed a hydrogen-bonded hexagonal network. The lattice constant was about 9\% larger than that for ice I h /I c crystals, and the packing density was 0.096 Å −2 . These results indicate that an extended ice network is formed on graphite, different from that on metal surfaces. Graphite is hydrophobic under ambient conditions due to the airborne contaminant but is considered inherently hydrophilic for a clean surface. In this study, the hydrophilic nature of the clean surface has been investigated from a molecular viewpoint. The formation of a well-ordered commensurate monolayer supports that the interaction of water with graphite is not negligible so that a commensurate wetting layer is formed at the weak substrate–molecule interaction limit.},

The way the density of states of these low-frequency excess modes D ( ω ) depends on the frequency ω has been debated for decades. Recent simulation studies of 3D glasses suggest that D ( ω ) scales universally with ω 4 in a low-frequency regime below the first sound mode. However, no simulation study has ever probed as low frequencies as possible to test directly whether this quartic law could work all the way to extremely low frequencies. Here, we calculated D ( ω ) below the first sound mode in 3D glasses over a wide range of frequencies. We find D ( ω ) scales with ω β with β &lt; 4 at very low frequencies examined, while the ω 4 law works only in a limited intermediate-frequency regime in some glasses. Moreover, our further analysis suggests our observation does not depend on glass models or glass stabilities examined. The ω 4 law of D ( ω ) below the first sound mode is dominant in current simulation studies of 3D glasses, and our direct observation of the breakdown of the quartic law at very low frequencies thus leaves an open but important question that may attract more future numerical and theoretical studies.},

  abstract = {Following the interest in the experimental realization of laser cooling for thallium fluoride (TlF), determining the potential of thallium chloride (TlCl) as a candidate for laser cooling experiments has recently received attention from a theoretical perspective [Yuan et al. , J. Chem. Phys. 149 , 094306 (2018)]. From these ab initio electronic structure calculations, it appeared that the cooling process, which would proceed from transitions between a 3 Π 0 + and X 1 Σ 0 + states, had as a potential bottleneck the long lifetime (6.04 µ s) of the excited state a 3 Π 0 + ⁠ , that would make it very difficult to experimentally control the slowing zone. In this work, we revisit the electronic structure of TlCl by employing four-component Multireference Configuration Interaction (MRCI) and Polarization Propagator (PP) calculations and investigate the effect of such approaches on the computed transition dipole moments between a 3 Π 0 + and a 3 Π 1 excited states of TlCl and TlF (the latter serving as a benchmark between theory and experiment). Whenever possible, MRCI and PP results have been cross-validated by four-component equation of motion coupled-cluster calculations. We find from these different correlated approaches that a coherent picture emerges in which the results of TlF are extremely close to the experimental values, whereas for TlCl the four-component calculations now predict a significantly shorter lifetime (between 109 and 175 ns) for the a 3 Π 0 + than prior estimates. As a consequence, TlCl would exhibit rather different, more favorable cooling dynamics. By numerically calculating the rate equation, we provide evidence that TlCl may have similar cooling capabilities to TlF. Our analysis also indicates the potential advantages of boosting stimulated radiation in optical cycles to improve cooling efficiency.},

  abstract = {Methyl groups in organic solids generally behave as uniaxial quantum rotors. The existing nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) theory appears to be complete, capable of describing even the finest details of the temperature-dependent spectra of such objects. However, the once reported temperature effects in the carbon spectra of the C 13 -labeled methyl group in a single crystal of acetylsalicylic acid have still not been explained. As the temperature decreases, in the quartet corresponding to the rapid motional averaging regime, the inner lines first begin to broaden, but then, they narrow again, so that at 6 K, a pattern similar to that at room temperature was observed. In the present work, these puzzling effects are explained quantitatively by invoking the molecular Zeeman (MZ) interaction. Like the spin–rotation (SR) interaction long known to occur in methyl groups, it engages the magnetic moments generated by their torsional motions. However, it has not been considered in NMR spectroscopy until now. This is a surprising situation because in the magnetic fields currently used in NMR spectroscopy, the MZ interaction is orders of magnitude stronger than the (magnetic field independent) SR effects.},

  abstract = {The D 5 Π–X 5 Δ (0,0) band of vanadium hydride at 654 nm has been recorded by laser excitation spectroscopy and represents the first analyzed spectrum of VH in the gas phase. The molecules were generated using a hollow cathode discharge source, with laser-induced fluorescence detected via the D 5 Π–A 5 Π (0,0) transition. All five main (ΔΩ = ΔΛ) subbands were observed as well as several satellite ones, which together create a rather complex and overlapped spectrum covering the region 15 180–15 500 cm −1 . The D 5 Π state displays the effects of three strong local perturbations, which are likely caused by interactions with high vibrational levels of the B 5 Σ − and c 3 Σ − states, identified in a previous multiconfigurational self-consistent field study by Koseki et al. [J. Phys. Chem. A 108 , 4707 (2004)]. Molecular constants describing the X 5 Δ, A 5 Π, and D 5 Π states were determined in three separate least-squares fits using effective Hamiltonians written in a Hund’s case (a) basis. The fine structure of the ground state is found to be consistent with its assignment as a σπ 2 δ, 5 Δ electronic state. The fitted values of its first-order spin–orbit and rotational constants in the ground state are A = 36.5378 15 c m − 1 and B = 5.7579(13) cm −1 , the latter of which yields a bond length of R 0 = 1.7212 2 Å. This experimental value is in good agreement with previous computational studies of the molecule and fits well within the overall trend of decreasing bond length across the series of 3d transition metal monohydrides.},

  abstract = {In this work, we have studied, within density functional theory, the interaction of NO with pure and oxidized silver clusters, both anionic and cationic, composed from 11 to 13 Ag atoms. In that size interval, shell closing effects are not expected, and structural and electronic odd–even effects will determine the strength of interaction. First, we obtained that species Ag n ± and Ag n O ± with odd number of electrons ( n = 12) adsorb NO with higher energy than their neighbors ( n = 11 and 13). This result is in agreement with the facts observed in recent mass spectroscopy measurements, which were performed, however, at finite temperature. The adsorption energy is about twice for oxidized clusters compared to pure ones and higher for anions than for cations. Second, the adsorption of another NO molecule on Ag n NO ± forms Ag n ( NO ) 2 ± ⁠ , with the dimer (NO) 2 in cis configuration, and binding the two N atoms with two neighbor Ag atoms. The n = 12 species show the higher adsorption energy again. Third, in the absence of reaction barriers, all complexes Ag n ( NO ) 2 ± dissociate spontaneously into Ag n O ± and N 2 O, except the n = 12 anion. The maximum high barrier along the dissociation path of Ag 13 ( NO ) 2 − is about 0.7 eV. Further analysis of projected density of states for Ag 11 − 13 ( NO ) x ± (x = 0, 1, 2) molecules shows that bonding between NO and Ag clusters mainly occurs in the energy range between −3.0 and 3.0 eV. The overlap between 4 d of Ag and 2 p of N and O is larger for Ag 12 ( NO ) 2 ± than for neighbor sizes. For n = 12, the d bands are close to the (NO) 2 2 π orbital, leading to extra back-donation charge from the 4 d of Ag to the closer 2 π orbital of (NO) 2 .},

Over 20 product channels are identified and characterized using 3D coincidence imaging of the ionic fragments. The momentum correlations in the three-body fragmentation channels provide evidence for a dominant sequential mechanism, starting with the cleavage of a C–C bond, ejecting C H 3 + and CH 3 CHOH + cations, followed by a secondary fragmentation of the hydroxyethyl cation that can be delayed for up to a microsecond after ionization. The C–O bond dissociation channels are less frequent, involving proton transfer and double proton transfer, forming H 2 O + and H 3 O + products, respectively, and exhibiting mixed sequential and concerted character. These results can be explained by the high potential barrier for the C–O bond dissociation seen in our ab initio quantum chemical calculations. We also observe coincident COH + + C 2 H n + ions, suggesting exotic structural rearrangements, starting from the Frank–Condon geometry of the neutral 2-propanol system. Remarkably, the relative yield of the H 3 + product is suppressed compared with methanol and alkene dications. Ab initio potentials and ground state molecular dynamics simulations show that a rapid and direct C–C bond cleavage dominates the Coulomb explosion process, leaving no time for H 2 roaming, which is a necessary precursor to the H 3 + formation.},

  abstract = {Strong Coulomb repulsion between the two charges in a square planar mixed-valence cell in quantum cellular automata (QCA) allows us to encode the binary information in the two energetically beneficial diagonal distributions of the electronic density. In this article, we pose a question: to what extent is this condition obligatory for the design of the molecular cell? To answer this question, we examine the ability to use a square-planar cell composed of one-electron mixed valence dimers to function in QCA in a general case when the intracell Coulomb interaction U is not supposed to be extremely strong, which means that it is comparable with the characteristic electron transfer energy (violated strong U limit). Using the two-mode vibronic model treated within the semiclassical (adiabatic) and quantum-mechanical approaches, we demonstrate that strong vibronic coupling is able to create a considerable barrier between the two diagonal-type charge configurations, thus ensuring bistability and polarizability of the cells even if the Coulomb barrier is not sufficient. The cases of weak and moderate Coulomb repulsion and strong vibronic coupling are exemplified by consideration of the cation radicals of the two polycyclic derivatives of norbornadiene [C 12 H 12 ] + and [C 17 H 16 ] + with the terminal C=C chromophores playing the role of redox sites. By using the detailed ab initio data, we reveal the main characteristics of the bi-dimeric cells composed of these molecules and illustrate the pronounced effect of the vibronic recovery clearly manifesting itself in the shape of the cell–cell response function. Revealing such “vibronic recovery” of strong localization when the strong U limit is violated suggests a way to a significant expansion of the class of molecular systems suitable as QCA cells.},

Quasi-classical trajectory simulations on the new PES reveal that hydrogen abstraction leading to H 2 O + C 2 H 5 dominates in the collision energy range of 10–50 kcal/mol. The abstraction cross sections increase and the dominant mechanism shifts from rebound (small impact parameters and backward scattering) to stripping (larger impact parameters and forward scattering) with increasing collision energy as opacity functions and scattering angle distributions indicate. The abstraction reaction clearly favors side-on OH attack over O-side and the least-preferred H-side approach, whereas C 2 H 6 behaves like a spherical object with only slight C–C-perpendicular side-on preference. The collision energy efficiently flows into the relative translation of the products, whereas product internal energy distributions show only little collision energy dependence. H 2 O/C 2 H 5 vibrational distributions slightly/significantly violate zero-point energy and are nearly independent of collision energy, whereas the rotational distributions clearly blue-shift as the collision energy increases.},

Reactions are studied following an ab initio molecular dynamics approach, and the results are rationalized following a tree-shaped reaction model based on Bayesian inference. We find that NF 3 reacts more efficiently with hot metal atoms to form monofluoride molecules than SF 6 . In addition, when using NF 3 , the reaction products have lower kinetic energy, requiring fewer collisions to thermalize with the cryogenic helium. Furthermore, we find that the reaction probability for AlF formation is much higher than for CaF across a broad range of kinetic temperatures.},

Deep learning potential (DP), as an alternative way, has been demonstrated to be able to conduct cluster simulations with close-to DFT accuracy but at a much lower computational cost. In this work, we update 34 structures of the 41 Cu clusters with atomic numbers ranging from 10 to 50 by combining global optimization and the DP model. The calculations show that the configuration of small Cu n clusters ( n = 10–15) tends to be oblate and it gradually transforms into a cage-like configuration as the size increases ( n &gt; 15). Based on the updated structures, their relative stability and electronic properties are extensively studied.

The simulation indicates that the main product is CO for these three clusters, while the selectivity of hydrocarbons is inhibited. This work is expected to clarify the ground-state structures and fundamental properties of Cu n clusters, and to guide experiments for the design of Cu-based catalysts.},

  abstract = {The study of molecular impurities in para -hydrogen ( p H 2 ) clusters is key to push forward our understanding of intra- and intermolecular interactions, including their impact on the superfluid response of this bosonic quantum solvent. This includes tagging with only one or very few p H 2 , the microsolvation regime for intermediate particle numbers, and matrix isolation with many solvent molecules. However, the fundamental coupling between the bosonic p H 2 environment and the (ro-)vibrational motion of molecular impurities remains poorly understood. Quantum simulations can, in principle, provide the necessary atomistic insight, but they require very accurate descriptions of the involved interactions. Here, we present a data-driven approach for the generation of impurity ⋯ p H 2 interaction potentials based on machine learning techniques, which retain the full flexibility of the dopant species. We employ the well-established adiabatic hindered rotor (AHR) averaging technique to include the impact of the nuclear spin statistics on the symmetry-allowed rotational quantum numbers of p H 2 . Embedding this averaging procedure within the high-dimensional neural network potential (NNP) framework enables the generation of highly accurate AHR-averaged NNPs at coupled cluster accuracy, namely, explicitly correlated coupled cluster single, double, and scaled perturbative triples, CCSD(T*)-F12a/aVTZcp, in an automated manner. We apply this methodology to the water and protonated water molecules as representative cases for quasi-rigid and highly flexible molecules, respectively, and obtain AHR-averaged NNPs that reliably describe the corresponding H 2 O⋯ p H 2 and H 3 O + ⋯ p H 2 interactions. Using path integral simulations, we show for the hydronium cation, H 3 O + , that umbrella-like tunneling inversion has a strong impact on the first and second p H 2 microsolvation shells. The automated and data-driven nature of our protocol opens the door to the study of bosonic p H 2 quantum solvation for a wide range of embedded impurities.},

The molecule containing the radioactive F-18 isotope is well known from its application in positron emission tomography as a radiotracer in tumor examination. In the stable form with the F-19 isotope, FDG was proposed as a potential radiosensitizer. Since reduction processes may be relevant in radiosensitization, we investigated low-energy electron attachment to FDG with a crossed electron–molecule beam experiment and with quantum chemical calculations as well as molecular dynamics at elevated temperatures to reveal statistical dissociation. We experimentally find that the susceptibility of FDG to low-energy electrons is relatively low. The calculations indicate that upon attachment of an electron with a kinetic energy of ∼0 eV, only dipole-bound states are accessible, which agrees with the weak ion yields observed in the experiment. The temporary negative ions formed upon electron attachment to FDG may decay by a large variety of dissociation reactions. The major fragmentation channels include H 2 O, HF, and H 2 dissociation, accompanied by ring opening.},

  abstract = {Ninety years ago, Wigner derived the leading order expansion term in ℏ 2 for the tunneling rate through a symmetric barrier. His derivation included two contributions: one came from the parabolic barrier, but a second term involved the fourth-order derivative of the potential at the barrier top. He left us with a challenge, which is answered in this paper, to derive the same but for an asymmetric barrier. A crucial element of the derivation is obtaining the ℏ 2 expansion term for the projection operator, which appears in the flux-side expression for the rate. It is also reassuring that an analytical calculation of semiclassical transition state theory (TST) reproduces the anharmonic corrections to the leading order of ℏ 2 . The efficacy of the resulting expression is demonstrated for an Eckart barrier, leading to the conclusion that especially when considering heavy atom tunneling, one should use the expansion derived in this paper, rather than the parabolic barrier approximation. The rate expression derived here reveals how the classical TST limit is approached as a function of ℏ and, thus, provides critical insights to understand the validity of popular approximate theories, such as the classical Wigner, centroid molecular dynamics, and ring polymer molecular dynamics methods.},

  abstract = {Practical implementations of the Ewald method used to compute Coulomb interactions in molecular dynamics simulations are hampered by the requirement to truncate its reciprocal space series. It is shown that this can be mitigated by representing the contributions from the neglected reciprocal lattice vector terms as a simple modification of the real space expression in which the real and reciprocal space series have slightly different charge spreading parameters. This procedure, called the α ′ method, enables significantly fewer reciprocal lattice vectors to be taken than is currently typical for Ewald, with negligible additional computational cost, which is validated on model systems representing different classes of charged system, a CsI crystal and melt, water, and a room temperature ionic liquid. A procedure for computing accurate energies and forces based on a periodic sampling of an additional number of reciprocal lattice vectors is also proposed and validated by the simulations. The convergence characteristics of expressions for the pressure based on the forces and the potential energy are compared, which is a useful assessment of the accuracy of the simulations in reproducing the Coulomb interaction. The techniques developed in this work can reduce significantly the total computer simulation times for medium sized charged systems, by factors of up to ∼5 for those in the classes studied here.},

  abstract = {An integrated experimental–computational strategy for the accurate characterization of the conformational landscape of flexible biomolecule building blocks is proposed. This is based on the combination of rotational spectroscopy with quantum-chemical computations guided by artificial intelligence tools. The first step of the strategy is the conformer search and relative stability evaluation performed by means of an evolutionary algorithm. In this step, last generation semiempirical methods are exploited together with hybrid and double-hybrid density functionals. Next, the barriers ruling the interconversion between the low-lying conformers are evaluated in order to unravel the possible fast relaxation paths. The relative stabilities and spectroscopic parameters of the “surviving” conformers are then refined using state-of-the-art composite schemes. The reliability of the computational procedure is further improved by the inclusion of vibrational and thermal effects. The final step of the strategy is the comparison between experiment and theory without any ad hoc adjustment, which allows an unbiased assignment of the spectroscopic features in terms of different conformers and their spectroscopic parameters. The proposed approach has been tested and validated for homocysteine, a highly flexible non-proteinogenic α -amino acid. The synergism of the integrated strategy allowed for the characterization of five conformers stabilized by bifurcated N–H 2 ⋯O=C hydrogen bonds, together with an additional conformer involving a more conventional HN⋯H–O hydrogen bond. The stability order estimated from the experimental intensities as well as the number and type of conformers observed in the gas phase are in full agreement with the theoretical predictions. Analogously, a good match has been found for the spectroscopic parameters.},

However, this requires an accurate and efficient propagator for the numerical integration of the time-dependent Kohn–Sham equation. While a low-order time propagator is already sufficient for the low-lying valence absorption spectra, it is no longer the case for the x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) of systems composed even only of light elements, for which the use of a high-order propagator is indispensable. It is then crucial to choose a largest possible time step and a shortest possible simulation time so as to minimize the computational cost. To this end, we propose here a robust AutoPST approach to determine automatically (Auto) the propagator (P), step (S), and time (T) for relativistic RT-TDDFT simulations of XAS.},

Within the nuclear–electronic orbital (NEO) approach, such effects are incorporated in a computationally efficient way by treating electrons and select nuclei, typically protons, quantum mechanically with molecular orbital techniques. Herein, we implement and test a NEO coupled cluster method that explicitly includes the triple electron–electron–proton excitations, where two electrons and one proton are excited simultaneously, using automatic differentiation. Our calculations show that this NEO-CCSDT eep method provides highly accurate proton densities and proton affinities, outperforming any previously studied NEO method. These examples highlight the importance of the triple electron–electron–proton excitations for an accurate description of nuclear quantum effects. Additionally, we also implement and test the second-order approximate coupled cluster with singles and doubles (NEO-CC2) method as well as its scaled-opposite-spin (SOS) versions. The NEO-SOS′-CC2 method, which scales the electron–proton correlation energy as well as the opposite-spin and same-spin components of the electron–electron correlation energy, achieves nearly the same accuracy as the NEO-CCSDT eep method for the properties studied. Because of its low computational cost, this method will enable a wide range of chemical and photochemical applications for large molecular systems. This work sets the stage for a variety of developments and applications within the NEO framework.},

  abstract = {The ab initio GW plus Bethe–Salpeter equation (GW-BSE, where G is the one particle Green&#39;s function and W is the screened Coulomb interaction) approach has emerged as a leading method for predicting excitations in both solids and molecules with a predictive power contingent upon several factors. Among these factors are the (1) generalized Kohn–Sham eigensystem used to construct the GW self-energy and to solve the BSE and (2) the efficacy and suitability of the Tamm–Dancoff approximation. Here, we present a detailed benchmark study of low-lying singlet excitations from a generalized Kohn–Sham (gKS) starting point based on an optimally tuned range-separated hybrid (OTRSH) functional. We show that the use of this gKS starting point with one-shot G 0 W 0 and G 0 W 0 -BSE leads to the lowest mean absolute errors (MAEs) and mean signed errors (MSEs), with respect to high-accuracy reference values, demonstrated in the literature thus far for the ionization potentials of the GW100 benchmark set and for low-lying neutral excitations of Thiel’s set molecules in the gas phase, without the need for self-consistency. The MSEs and MAEs of one-shot G 0 W 0 -BSE@OTRSH excitation energies are comparable to or lower than those obtained with other functional starting points after self-consistency. Additionally, we compare these results with linear-response time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations and find GW-BSE to be superior to TDDFT when calculations are based on the same exchange-correlation functional. This work demonstrates tuned range-separated hybrids used in combination with GW and GW-BSE can greatly suppress starting point dependence for molecules, leading to accuracy similar to that for higher-order wavefunction-based theories for molecules without the need for costlier iterations to self-consistency.},

Using a joint machine learning- and computation-based screening strategy, we evaluated our candidates based on corrosion resistance, catalytic activity, N 2 selectivity, cost, and the ability to synthesize. We found that only 20 materials will satisfy all criteria in our screening strategy, all of which contain varying amounts of Cu. Our proposed list of candidates is consistent with previous materials investigated in the literature, with the exception of Cu–Co and Cu–Ag based compounds that merit further investigation.},

  abstract = {When a physical system is driven away from equilibrium, the statistical distribution of its dynamical trajectories informs many of its physical properties. Characterizing the nature of the distribution of dynamical observables, such as a current or entropy production rate, has become a central problem in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics. Asymptotically, for a broad class of observables, the distribution of a given observable satisfies a large deviation principle when the dynamics is Markovian, meaning that fluctuations can be characterized in the long-time limit by computing a scaled cumulant generating function. Calculating this function is not tractable analytically (nor often numerically) for complex, interacting systems, so the development of robust numerical techniques to carry out this computation is needed to probe the properties of nonequilibrium materials. Here, we describe an algorithm that recasts this task as an optimal control problem that can be solved variationally. We solve for optimal control forces using neural network ansatz that are tailored to the physical systems to which the forces are applied. We demonstrate that this approach leads to transferable and accurate solutions in two systems featuring large numbers of interacting particles.},

  abstract = {Cross-linking is known to play a pivotal role in the relaxation dynamics and mechanical properties of thermoset polymers, which are commonly used in structural applications because of their light weight and inherently strong nature. Here, we employ a coarse-grained (CG) polymer model to systematically explore the effect of cross-link density on basic thermodynamic properties as well as corresponding changes in the segmental dynamics and elastic properties of these network materials upon approaching their glass transition temperatures ( T g ). Increasing the cross-link density unsurprisingly leads to a significant slowing down of the segmental dynamics, and the fragility K of glass formation shifts in lockstep with T g , as often found in linear polymer melts when the polymer mass is varied. As a consequence, the segmental relaxation time τ α becomes almost a universal function of reduced temperature, ( T − T g )/ T g , a phenomenon that underlies the applicability of the “universal” Williams–Landel–Ferry (WLF) relation to many polymer materials. We also test a mathematical model of the temperature dependence of the linear elastic moduli based on a simple rigidity percolation theory and quantify the fluctuations in the local stiffness of the network material. The moduli and distribution of the local stiffness likewise exhibit a universal scaling behavior for materials having different cross-link densities but fixed ( T − T g )/ T g . Evidently, T g dominates both τ α and the mechanical properties of our model cross-linked polymer materials. Our work provides physical insights into how the cross-link density affects glass formation, aiding in the design of cross-linked thermosets and other structurally complex glass-forming materials.},

We have performed avoided level crossing muon spin resonance (ALC- μ SR) and transverse field muon spin rotation (TF- μ SR) measurements on Alq 3 and 8-hydroxyquinoline (8hq), which is meant to model the muoniated radicals present in Alq 3 when they are not in an OSC. These are supplemented by benchmarked DFT calculations. The ALC- μ SR and TF- μ SR spectra of 8hq and Alq 3 are best explained by Mu adding to all six secondary carbons of the quinolate rings with roughly equal yields and localized spin density. There is no evidence in the TF- μ SR spectrum of Alq 3 for the formation of radicals with muon hyperfine coupling constants of 23 or 91 MHz as reported earlier by others. Our measurements support the view that there is localized spin density on the molecule to which Mu is covalently bound and the muon is not a passive probe in organic systems as it can be incorporated into radicals that have different electronic structures to the parent compounds. The muoniated radicals in Alq 3 are more short-lived than in 8hq, which could be due to interactions with mobile electrons in the OSC, but with electron spin flip rates on the order of ∼ 1 0 7 s − 1 ⁠ .},

WMI may be affected by changes in temperature and pressure, and hence, they can alter chemical/physical processes that occur in aqueous environments. Traditionally, attention has been focused on hydrophobic interactions while, in comparison, the role of hydrophilic and hybrid (hydrophobic–hydrophilic) interactions have been mostly overlooked. Here, we study the role of T and P on the WMI between nanoscale (i) hydrophobic–hydrophobic, (ii) hydrophilic–hydrophilic, and (iii) hydrophilic–hydrophobic pairs of (hydroxylated/non-hydroxylated) graphene-based surfaces. We find that hydrophobic, hydrophilic, and hybrid interactions are all sensitive to P . However, while hydrophobic interactions [case (i)] are considerably sensitive to T -variations, hydrophilic [case (ii)] and hybrid interactions [case (iii)] are practically T -independent. An analysis of the entropic and enthalpic contributions to the potential of mean force for cases (i)–(iii) is also presented. Our results are important in understanding T - and P -induced protein denaturation and the interactions of biomolecules in solution, including protein aggregation and phase separation processes. From the computational point of view, the results presented here are relevant in the design of implicit water models for the study of molecular and colloidal/nanoparticle systems at different thermodynamic conditions.},

A. 110 , 17720 (2013)]. In the present work, we investigate water’s second glass transition based on the genuine glassy state of high-density water as prepared from micron-sized liquid water droplets, avoiding crystallinity at all stages. All the calorimetric features of water’s second glass transition observed in the previous work are also observed here on the genuine glassy samples. This suggests that the glass transition indeed thermodynamically links amorphous ices continuously with deeply supercooled water. We proceed to extend the earlier study by investigating the effect of preparation history on the calorimetric glass transition temperature. The best samples prepared here feature both a lower glass transition temperature T g,2 and a higher polyamorphic transition temperature T ons , thereby extending the range of thermal stability in which the deeply supercooled liquid can be observed by about 4 K. Just before the polyamorphic transition, we observe a spike-like increase of heat capacity that we interpret in terms of nucleation of low-density water. Without this spike, the width of water’s second glass transition is 15 K, and the Δ c p amounts to 3 ± 1 J K −1 mol −1 , making the case for the high-density liquid being a strong liquid. We suggest that samples annealed at 1.9 GPa to 175 K and decompressed at 140 K to ≥0.10 GPa are free from such nuclei and represent the most ideal high-density amorphous glasses.},

  abstract = {A supercooled fluid close to the glass transition develops nonlocal shear-stress correlations that anticipate the emergence of elasticity. We performed molecular dynamics simulations of a binary Lennard-Jones mixture at different temperatures and investigated the spatiotemporal autocorrelation function of the shear stress for different wavevectors, q , from a locally measured and Fourier-transformed stress tensor. Anisotropic correlations are observed at non-zero wavevectors, exhibiting strongly damped oscillations with a characteristic frequency ω ( q ). A comparison with a recently developed hydrodynamic theory [Maier et al. , Phys. Rev. Lett. 119 , 265701 (2017)] shows a remarkably good quantitative agreement between particle-based simulations and theoretical predictions.},

  abstract = {The kinetics of spin-selective reactions involving triplet molecules, such as triplet–triplet annihilation or electron transfer to dioxygen molecules in the ground triplet spin state, are strongly dependent on the dipole–dipole interaction (DDI) of electron spins in spin-1 particles. The effect of this interaction on the intersystem crossing in the reaction encounter complex of the paramagnetic particles was previously considered for some particular cases using oversimplified approaches. In this study, we consider a rigorous kinetic model of the irreversible reaction between the spin-1/2 and spin-1 particles in an encounter complex with the reactive doublet state. This model explicitly includes both isotropic exchange coupling of the reactants and spin dependence of the reaction rate in the form of the Haberkorn reaction term. For the time-independent DDI, an analytical expression for the reaction kinetics was derived. The effect of DDI fluctuations was analyzed using numerical simulations. It was found that increasing both the exchange coupling and the reaction rate constants can significantly slow down the quartet–doublet spin transitions and, as a consequence, the observed spin-selective reaction rate. Additionally, the presence of the irreversible reaction in the doublet states affects a coherent evolution in the non-reactive quartet subsystem.},

  abstract = {Out-of-equilibrium, strong correlation in a many-body system can trigger emergent properties that act to constrain the natural dissipation of energy and matter. Signs of such self-organization appear in the avalanche, bifurcation, and quench of a state-selected Rydberg gas of nitric oxide to form an ultracold, strongly correlated ultracold plasma. Work reported here focuses on the initial stages of avalanche and quench and uses the mm-wave spectroscopy of an embedded quantum probe to characterize the intermolecular interaction dynamics associated with the evolution to plasma. Double-resonance excitation prepares a Rydberg gas of nitric oxide composed of a single selected state of principal quantum number, n 0 . Penning ionization, followed by an avalanche of electron–Rydberg collisions, forms a plasma of NO + ions and weakly bound electrons, in which a residual population of n 0 Rydberg molecules evolves to a state of high orbital angular momentum, ℓ . Predissociation depletes the plasma of low- ℓ molecules. Relaxation ceases and n 0 ℓ (2) molecules with ℓ ≥ 4 persist for very long times. At short times, varying excitation spectra of mm-wave Rydberg–Rydberg transitions mark the rate of electron-collisional ℓ -mixing. Deep depletion resonances that persist for long times signal energy redistribution in the basis of central-field Rydberg states. The widths and asymmetries of Fano line shapes witness the degree to which coupling in the arrested bath (i) broadens the allowed transition and (ii) mixes the local network of levels in the ensemble.},

  abstract = {As early as 1975, Pitzer suggested that copernicium, flerovium, and oganesson are volatile substances behaving like noble gas because of their closed-shell configurations and accompanying relativistic effects. It is, however, precarious to predict the chemical bonding and physical behavior of a solid by knowledge of its atomic or molecular properties only. Copernicium and oganesson have been analyzed very recently by our group. Both are predicted to be semiconductors and volatile substances with rather low melting and boiling points, which may justify a comparison with the noble gas elements. Here, we study closed-shell flerovium in detail to predict its solid-state properties, including the melting point, by decomposing the total energy into many-body forces derived from relativistic coupled-cluster theory and from density functional theory. The convergence of such a decomposition for flerovium is critically analyzed, and the problem of using density functional theory is highlighted. We predict that flerovium in many ways does not behave like a typical noble gas element despite its closed-shell 7 p 1 / 2 2 configuration and resulting weak interactions. Unlike the case of noble gases, the many-body expansion in terms of the interaction energy does not converge smoothly. This makes the accurate prediction of phase transitions very difficult. Nevertheless, a first prediction by Monte Carlo simulation estimates the melting point at 284 ± 50 K. Furthermore, calculations for the electronic bandgap suggests that flerovium is a semiconductor similar to copernicium.},

Density functional theory calculations have been performed to explore new fragmentation schemes, giving special attention to previously unexplored pathways, such as isomerization and elimination of HNC. The isomerization mechanisms producing five- to seven-membered ring intermediates are described and are found to be a dominant channel both energetically and kinetically. Energetically competing pathways are established for the astrochemically important HNC-loss channel, which has hitherto never been considered in the context of the loss of a 27 amu fragment from the parent ions. Elimination of acetylene was also studied in great detail. Overall, the computational results are found to complement the experimental observations from the concurrently conducted PEPICO investigation. These could potentially open the doors for rich and interesting vacuum ultraviolet radiation-driven chemistry on planetary atmospheres, meteorites, and comets.},

Experimentally, we populate resonances in two ways: either by the impact of free electrons on the neutral molecule or by the photoexcitation of the bound molecular anion. These two excitation means lead to transient anions in different initial geometries. In both cases, the anions decay by electron emission and we record the electron spectra. Several types of emission are recognized, differing by the way in which the resulting molecule is vibrationally excited. In the excitation of specific vibrational modes, distinctly different modes are visible in electron collision and photodetachment experiments. The unspecific vibrational excitation, which leads to the emission of thermal electrons following the internal vibrational redistribution, shows similar features in both experiments. A model for the thermal emission based on a detailed balance principle agrees with the experimental findings very well. Finally, a similar behavior in the two experiments is also observed for a third type of electron emission, the vibrational autodetachment, which yields electrons with constant final energies over a broad range of excitation energies. The entrance channels for the vibrational autodetachment are examined in detail, and they point to a new mechanism involving a reverse valence to non-valence internal conversion.},

The present study reports the jet-cooled rovibrational infrared study of three centrosymmetric two-ring PAH molecules, viz., naphthalene (C 10 H 8 ), [1,5] naphthyridine (C 8 H 6 N 2 ), and biphenyl (C 12 H 10 ), in the in-plane ring C–H bending (975–1035 cm −1 ) and C–C ring stretching (1580–1620 cm −1 ) regions. For the two most rigid PAHs, the accuracy of spectroscopic parameters derived in ground and several excited states (six for naphthalene and six for [1,5] naphthyridine) has significantly improved the literature values. In addition, comparison between experiments and quantum chemical calculations confirms the predictive power of the corrected calculated rotational parameters. The more flexible structure of biphenyl makes the analysis of high resolution jet-cooled spectra of ν 19 and ν 23 modes recorded at about 1601 and 1013 cm −1 , respectively, particularly challenging. The presence of three torsional vibrations below 120 cm −1 together with small values of the rotational constants prevented us from determining the ground and v 19 = 1 excited rotational constants independently. In the ν 23 band region, the presence of two bands rotationally resolved and separated by only 0.8 cm −1 raises the question of possible splittings due to a large amplitude motion, most probably the torsion of the aliphatic bond between the two phenyl rings.},

  abstract = {We measured the solid–liquid–vapor (SLV) equilibrium of binary mixtures during experiments that alternated between cooling the mixture and injecting the more-volatile component into the sample chamber; thus, the composition of the mixture changed (non-isoplethic) throughout the experiment. Four binary mixtures were used in the experiments to represent mixtures with miscible solid phases (N 2 /CO) and barely miscible solid solutions (N 2 /C 2 H 6 ), as well as mixtures with intermediate solid miscibility (N 2 /CH 4 and CO/CH 4 ). We measured new SLV pressure data for the binary mixtures, except for N 2 /CH 4 , which are also available in the literature for verification in this work. While these mixtures are of great interest in planetary science and cryogenics, the resulting pressure data are also needed for modeling purposes. We found the results for N 2 /CH 4 to be consistent with the literature. The resulting new SLV curve for CO/CH 4 shows similarities to N 2 /CH 4 . Both have two density inversion points (bracketing the temperature range where the solid floats). This result is important for places such as Pluto, Triton, and Titan, where these mixtures exist in vapor, liquid, and solid phases. Based on our experiments, the presence of a eutectic is unlikely for the N 2 /CH 4 and CO/CH 4 systems. An azeotrope with or without a peritectic is likely, but further investigations are needed to confirm. The N 2 /CO system does not have a density inversion point, as the ice always sinks in its liquid. For N 2 /C 2 H 6 , new SLV pressure data were measured near each triple point of the pure components.},

The Breit interaction in the Coulomb gauge consists of magnetic and gauge contributions. The high computational cost of the gauge term limits the application of the Breit interaction in relativistic molecular calculations. In this work, we apply the Pauli component integral–density matrix contraction scheme for gauge interaction with a maximum spin- and component separation scheme. We also present two different computational algorithms for evaluating gauge integrals. One is the generalized Obara–Saika algorithm, where the Laplace transformation is used to transform the gauge operator into Gaussian functions and the Obara–Saika recursion is used for reducing the angular momentum. The other algorithm is the second derivative of Coulomb interaction evaluated with Rys-quadrature. This work improves the efficiency of performing Dirac–Hartree–Fock with the variational treatment of Breit interaction for molecular systems. We use this formalism to examine relativistic trends in the Periodic Table and analyze the relativistic two-electron interaction contributions in heavy-element complexes.},

In this work, the path integral molecular dynamics is developed to simulate thermodynamics, Green’s function, and momentum distribution of two-component bosons in three dimensions. As an example of our general method, we consider the thermodynamics of up to 16 bosons in a three-dimensional harmonic trap. For noninteracting spinor bosons, our simulation shows a bump in the heat capacity. As the repulsive interaction strength increases, however, we find the gradual disappearance of the bump in the heat capacity. We believe that this simulation result can be tested by ultracold spinor bosons with optical lattices and magnetic-field Feshbach resonance to tune the inter-particle interaction. We also calculate Green’s function and momentum distribution of spinor bosons. Our work facilitates the exact numerical simulation of spinor bosons, whose property is one of the major problems in ultracold Bose gases.},

  abstract = {Unless the approximate wavefunction of the parent system is expressed in terms of explicitly correlated basis functions, the finite size of the generalized Fock matrix is unlikely to be the leading source of the truncation error in the ionization energy E produced by the EKT (extended Koopmans’ theorem) formalism. This conclusion is drawn from a rigorous analysis that involves error partitioning into the parent- and ionized-system contributions, the former being governed by asymptotic power laws when the underlying wavefunction is assembled from a large number of spinorbitals and the latter arising from the truncation of the infinite-dimensional matrix V whose elements involve the 1-, 2-, and 3-matrices of the parent system. Quite surprisingly, the decay of the second contribution with the number n of the natural spinorbitals (NOs) employed in the construction of the truncated V turns out to be strongly system-dependent even in the simplest case of the 1 S states of two-electron systems, following the n −5 power law for the helium atom while exhibiting an erratic behavior for the H − anion. This phenomenon, which stems from the presence of the so-called solitonic natural spinorbitals among the NOs, renders the extrapolation of the EKT approximates of E to the complete-basis-set limit generally unfeasible. However, attaining that limit is not contingent upon attempted reproduction of the ill-defined one-electron function known as “the removal orbital,” which does not have to be invoked in the derivation of EKT and whose expansion in terms of the NOs diverges.},

A procedure is proposed to estimate the relative significance of these two factors. Numerical examples are given for four weakly bound intermolecular complexes. It is shown that the violation of the non-negativity condition is the principal source of error in the FDET energy if ρ B is the density of the isolated environment, i.e., it is generated without taking into account the interactions with the embedded species. Reduction of both the magnitude of the violation of the non-negativity condition and the error in the FDET energy can be pragmatically achieved by means of the explicit treatment of the electronic polarization of the environment.},

As an example application, a potential-energy surface is generalized for a small DNA duplex, taking into account explicit solvation and long-range electron exchange–correlation effects. A long-standing problem in molecular science is that experimental studies of the structural and thermodynamic behavior of DNA under tension are not well confirmed by simulation; study of the potential energy vs extension taking into account a novel correction shows that leading classical DNA models have excessive stiffness with respect to stretching. This discrepancy is found to be common across multiple forcefields. The quantum correction is in qualitative agreement with the experimental thermodynamics for larger DNA double helices, providing a candidate explanation for the general and long-standing discrepancy between single molecule stretching experiments and classical calculations of DNA stretching. The new dataset of quantum calculations should facilitate multiple types of nucleic acid simulation, and the associated Kernel Modified Molecular Dynamics method (KMMD) is applicable to biomolecular simulations in general.

  abstract = {We describe a numerical algorithm for approximating the equilibrium-reduced density matrix and the effective (mean force) Hamiltonian for a set of system spins coupled strongly to a set of bath spins when the total system (system + bath) is held in canonical thermal equilibrium by weak coupling with a “super-bath”. Our approach is a generalization of now standard typicality algorithms for computing the quantum expectation value of observables of bare quantum systems via trace estimators and Krylov subspace methods. In particular, our algorithm makes use of the fact that the reduced system density, when the bath is measured in a given random state, tends to concentrate about the corresponding thermodynamic averaged reduced system density. Theoretical error analysis and numerical experiments are given to validate the accuracy of our algorithm. Further numerical experiments demonstrate the potential of our approach for applications including the study of quantum phase transitions and entanglement entropy for long range interaction systems.},

These rate coefficients can be obtained from coupled-channel (CC) quantum scattering calculations, which are very demanding, however. Here, we present various approximate but more efficient methods based on the coupled-states approximation (CSA), which neglects the off-diagonal Coriolis coupling in the scattering Hamiltonian in body-fixed coordinates. In particular, we investigated a method called NNCC (nearest-neighbor Coriolis coupling) [Yang et al. , J. Chem. Phys. 148 , 084101 (2018)] that includes Coriolis coupling to first order. The NNCC method is more demanding than the common CSA method but still much more efficient than full CC calculations, and it is substantially more accurate than CSA. All of this is illustrated by showing state-to-state cross sections and rate coefficients of rovibrational transitions induced in CO 2 by collisions with He atoms. It is also shown that a further reduction of CPU time, practically without loss of accuracy, can be obtained by combining the NNCC method with the multi-channel distorted-wave Born approximation that we applied in full CC calculations in a previous paper.},

  abstract = {The indirect spin–spin coupling tensor, J , between mercury nuclei in systems containing this element can be of the order of a few kHz and one of the largest measured. We analyzed the physics behind the electronic mechanisms that contribute to the one- and two-bond couplings n J Hg–Hg ( n = 1, 2). For doing so, we performed calculations for J -couplings in the ionized X 2 2 + and X 3 2 + linear molecules ( X = Zn, Cd, Hg) within polarization propagator theory using the random phase approximation and the pure zeroth-order approximation with Dirac–Hartree–Fock and Dirac–Kohn–Sham orbitals, both at four-component and zeroth-order regular approximation levels. We show that the “paramagnetic-like” mechanism contributes more than 99.98\% to the total isotropic value of the coupling tensor. By analyzing the molecular and atomic orbitals involved in the total value of the response function, we find that the s -type valence atomic orbitals have a predominant role in the description of the coupling. This fact allows us to develop an effective model from which quantum electrodynamics (QED) effects on J -couplings in the aforementioned ions can be estimated. Those effects were found to be within the interval (0.7; 1.7)\% of the total relativistic effect on isotropic one-bond 1 J coupling, though ranging those corrections between the interval (−0.4; −0.2)\% in Zn-containing ions, to (−1.2; −0.8)\% in Hg-containing ions, of the total isotropic coupling constant in the studied systems. The estimated QED corrections show a visible dependence on the nuclear charge Z of each atom X in the form of a power-law proportional to Z X 5 ⁠ .},

  abstract = {For the accurate computation of relative energies, domain-based local pair natural orbital coupled-cluster [DLPNO-CCSD(T 0 )] has become increasingly popular. Even though DLPNO-CCSD(T 0 ) shows a formally linear scaling of the computational effort with the system size, accurate predictions of relative energies remain costly. Therefore, multi-level approaches are attractive that focus the available computational resources on a minor part of the molecular system, e.g., a reaction center, where changes in the correlation energy are expected to be the largest. We present a pair-selected multi-level DLPNO-CCSD(T 0 ) ansatz that automatically partitions the orbital pairs according to their contribution to the overall correlation energy change in a chemical reaction. To this end, the localized orbitals are mapped between structures in the reaction; all pair energies are approximated through computationally efficient semi-canonical second-order Møller–Plesser perturbation theory, and the orbital pairs for which the pair energies change significantly are identified. This multi-level approach is significantly more robust than our previously suggested, orbital selection-based multi-level DLPNO-CCSD(T 0 ) ansatz [M. Bensberg and J. Neugebauer, J. Chem. Phys. 155 , 224102 (2021)] for reactions showing only small changes in the occupied orbitals. At the same time, it is even more efficient without added input complexity or accuracy loss compared to the full DLPNO-CCSD(T 0 ) calculation. We demonstrate the accuracy of the multi-level approach for a total of 128 chemical reactions and potential energy curves of weakly interacting complexes from the S66x8 benchmark set.},

This establishes a method that uses independent trajectories that exactly reproduce Lindblad decay dynamics using a wavefunction description, with deterministic changes of the magnitudes of the quantum expansion coefficients, while only adding on a stochastic phase. We further demonstrate that when including nuclei in the Ehrenfest dynamics, the L -MFE method gives semi-quantitatively accurate results, with the accuracy limited by the accuracy of the approximations present in the semiclassical MFE approach.

A number of capture theory models have been developed over the past several decades to predict the rate coefficients for reactions between ions and molecules—ranging from the Langevin equation (for reactions between ions and non-polar molecules) to more recent fully quantum theories (for reactions at ultracold temperatures). A number of different capture theory methods are discussed, with the key assumptions underpinning each approach clearly set out. The strengths and limitations of these capture theory methods are examined through detailed comparisons between low-temperature experimental measurements and capture theory predictions. Guidance is provided on the selection of an appropriate capture theory method for a given class of ion–molecule reaction and set of experimental conditions—identifying when a capture-based model is likely to provide an accurate prediction. Finally, the impact of capture theories on fields such as astrochemical modeling is noted, with some potential future directions of capture-based approaches outlined.},

  abstract = {The formation of the fibrillar structure of amyloid proteins/peptides is believed to be associated with neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Since the rate of aggregation can influence neurotoxicity, finding the key factors that control this rate is of paramount importance. It was recently found that the rate of protein aggregation is related to the mechanical stability of the fibrillar structure such that the higher the mechanical stability, the faster the fibril is formed. However, this conclusion was supported by a limited dataset. In this work, we expand the previous study to a larger dataset, including the wild type of Aβ42 peptide and its 20 mutants, the aggregation rate of which was measured experimentally. By using all-atom steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations, we can assess the mechanical stability of the fibril structure, which is characterized by the rupture force, pulling work, and unbinding free energy barrier. Our result confirms that mechanical stability is indeed related to the aggregation rate. Since the estimation of the aggregation rate using all-atom simulations is almost forbidden by the current computational capabilities, our result is useful for predicting it based on information obtained from fast SMD simulations for fibrils.},

  abstract = {Active systems, which are driven out of equilibrium by local non-conservative forces, can adopt unique behaviors and configurations. An important challenge in the design of novel materials, which utilize such properties, is to precisely connect the static structure of active systems to the dissipation of energy induced by the local driving. Here, we use tools from liquid-state theories and machine learning to take on this challenge. We first analytically demonstrate for an isotropic active matter system that dissipation and pair correlations are closely related when driving forces behave like an active temperature. We then extend a nonequilibrium mean-field framework for predicting these pair correlations, which unlike most existing approaches is applicable even for strongly interacting particles and far from equilibrium, to predicting dissipation in these systems. Based on this theory, we reveal a robust analytic relation between dissipation and structure, which holds even as the system approaches a nonequilibrium phase transition. Finally, we construct a neural network that maps static configurations of particles to their dissipation rate without any prior knowledge of the underlying dynamics. Our results open novel perspectives on the interplay between dissipation and organization out of equilibrium.},

  abstract = {Fluorination of graphene sheets with xenon difluoride leads to the formation of the widest bandgap Gr derivative, namely, fluorographene. Accurate experimental observations distinguish two stages of mechanism in the fluorination procedure: the half-fluorination stage, wherein one side of the Gr sheet is rapidly fluorinated, and the full-fluorination stage, involving much slower fluorination of the opposite side of the sheet [R. J. Kashtiban et al. , Nat. Commun. 5 , 5902 (2014)]. Here, we perform comprehensive density functional calculations to illustrate accurate microscopic insights into the much slower rate of the full-fluorination stage compared with the half-fluorination one. The calculated minimum energy paths for the half- and full-fluorination processes demonstrate much enhanced fluorine adsorption after the half-fluorination stage, which sounds inconsistent with the experimental picture. This ambiguity is explained in terms of significant chemical activation of the graphene sheet after half-fluorination, which remarkably facilitates the formation of chemical contaminants in the system and, thus, substantially slows down the full-fluorination procedure. After considering the binding energy and durability of the relevant chemical species, including hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen molecules and xenon atom, it is argued that oxygen–fluorine ligands are the most likely chemical contaminants opposing the complete fluorination of a graphene sheet. Then, we propose an oxygen desorption mechanism to carefully explain the much enhanced rate of the full-fluorination procedure at elevated temperatures. The potential photocatalytic application of the pristine and defected samples in water splitting and carbon dioxide reduction reactions is also discussed.},

The results show that adsorption energies vary linearly with strain; expansive strain enhances the adsorption of most adsorbates. Unlike the adsorbate scaling relations that are central atom dependent, the adsorbate scaling relations on strained surfaces are central atom independent. C–H/O–H bonds are elongated/shortened with expansive strain, and adsorption energies of CHx generally change more than those of OHx and NHx, which can be rationalized with effective medium theory and pertinent bond energies. Thermodynamically, In 2 O 3 (110)/ZrO 2 (101) is the most active/inactive. The estimated variation of rate constants at 300 K from 0\% to 2\% strain based on the Brønsted–Evans–Polanyi relationship demonstrates great strain regulation potential of catalytic performance on these oxide surfaces. Finally, it is demonstrated that strain tends to facilitate the reactions whose sum of the stoichiometric number is positive, which can be used as a rule to guide strain engineering for heterogeneous catalysis.},

  abstract = {The design of all-solid heterogeneous catalysts with frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) has attracted much attention recently because of their appealing low dissociation energy for H 2 molecules due to which a promotion of hydrogenation reaction is expected. The sterically encumbered Lewis acid (metal site) and base (nitrogen site) in the cavity of single transition metal atom-doped M/C 2 N sheets make them potential candidates for the design of catalysts with FLPs, while a comprehensive understanding of their intrinsic property and reactivity is still lacking. Calculations show that the complete dissociation of the H 2 molecule into two H* states at the N sites requires two steps: heterolytic cleavage of the H 2 molecule and the transfer of H* from the metal site to the N site, which are strongly related to the acidity of the metal site. Ni/C 2 N and Pd/C 2 N, which outperform the other eight transition metal atom (M) anchored M/C 2 N candidates, possess low energy barriers for the complete dissociation of H 2 molecules, with values of only 0.30 and 0.20 eV, respectively. Furthermore, both Ni/C 2 N and Pd/C 2 N catalysts can achieve semi-hydrogenation of C 2 H 2 into C 2 H 4 , with overall barriers of 0.81 and 0.75 eV, respectively, which are lower than those reported for many other catalysts. It is speculated that M/C 2 N catalysts with intrinsic FLPs may also find applications in other important hydrogenation reactions.},

  abstract = {Plasmonic gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) can convert laser irradiation into thermal energy for a variety of applications. Although heat transfer through the AuNP–water interface is considered an essential part of the plasmonic heating process, there is a lack of mechanistic understanding of how interface curvature and the heating itself impact interfacial heat transfer. Here, we report atomistic molecular dynamics simulations that investigate heat transfer through nanoscale gold–water interfaces. We simulated four nanoscale gold structures under various applied heat flux values to evaluate how gold–water interface curvature and temperature affect the interfacial heat transfer. We also considered a case in which we artificially reduced wetting at the gold surfaces by tuning the gold–water interactions to determine if such a perturbation alters the curvature and temperature dependence of the gold–water interfacial heat transfer. We first confirmed that interfacial heat transfer is particularly important for small particles (diameter ≤ 10 nm). We found that the thermal interface conductance increases linearly with interface curvature regardless of the gold wettability, while it increases nonlinearly with the applied heat flux under normal wetting and remains constant under reduced wetting. Our analysis suggests the curvature dependence of the interface conductance coincides with changes in interfacial water adsorption, while the temperature dependence may arise from temperature-induced shifts in the distribution of water vibrational states. Our study advances the current understanding of interface thermal conductance for a broad range of applications.},

  abstract = {To explore the curvature dependence of solid–fluid interfacial thermodynamics, we calculate, using Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulation, the surface free energy for a 2 d hard-disk fluid confined in a circular hard container of radius R as a function of the bulk packing fraction η and wall curvature C ̄ = − 1 / R ⁠ . (The curvature is negative because the surface is concave.) Combining this with our previous data [Martin et al ., J. Phys. Chem. B 124 , 7938–7947 (2020)] for the positive curvature case (a hard-disk fluid at a circular wall, C ̄ = + 1 / R ⁠ ), we obtain a complete picture of surface thermodynamics in this system over the full range of positive and negative wall curvatures. Our results show that γ is linear in C ̄ with a slope that is the same for both positive and negative wall curvatures, with deviations seen only at high negative curvatures (strong confinement) and high density. This observation indicates that the surface thermodynamics of this system is consistent with the predictions of so-called morphometric thermodynamics at both positive and negative curvatures. In addition, we show that classical density functional theory and a generalized scaled particle theory can be constructed that give excellent agreement with the simulation data over most of the range of curvatures and densities. For extremely high curvatures, where only one or two disks can occupy the container at maximum packing, it is possible to calculate γ exactly. In this limit, the simulations and density functional theory calculations are in remarkable agreement with the exact results.},

  abstract = {Modeling and understanding properties of materials from first principles require knowledge of the underlying atomistic structure. This entails knowing the individual chemical identity and position of all atoms involved. Obtaining such information for macro-molecules, nano-particles, and clusters and for the surface, interface, and bulk phases of amorphous and solid materials represents a difficult high-dimensional global optimization problem. The rise of machine learning techniques in materials science has, however, led to many compelling developments that may speed up structure searches. The complexity of such new methods has prompted a need for an efficient way of assembling them into global optimization algorithms that can be experimented with. In this paper, we introduce the Atomistic Global Optimization X (AGOX) framework and code as a customizable approach that enables efficient building and testing of global optimization algorithms. A modular way of expressing global optimization algorithms is described, and modern programming practices are used to enable that modularity in the freely available AGOX Python package. A number of examples of global optimization approaches are implemented and analyzed. This ranges from random search and basin-hopping to machine learning aided approaches with on-the-fly learnt surrogate energy landscapes. The methods are applied to problems ranging from supported clusters over surface reconstructions to large carbon clusters and metal-nitride clusters incorporated into graphene sheets.},

Structure models containing either a majority of S n chains or S 8 rings are considered and compared to experimental data from x-ray scattering. The comparison suggests a liquid structure of a majority of twofold sulfur at low temperature, dominated by S 8 rings that open progressively upon temperature increase. Typical features associated with such rings are analyzed and indicate that they contribute to a specific third correlating distance in the pair correlation function and to a contribution at low wavevector k in the reciprocal space. The vibrational properties of liquid sulfur are also considered and indicate a contribution at 60 meV that is associated with both chains and rings, albeit the latter lead to a more intense peak at this wavenumber. The underlying network structure also impacts the dynamic properties of the melts which display enhanced dynamic heterogeneities when S 8 rings are present. The analysis of the electronic Kohn–Sham energies shows insulating character with a gap of about ≃2.0 eV, albeit the presence of localized mid-gap states is acknowledged that can be associated, in part, with the presence of S 6 rings.},

There is even a range of densities for which no bubble can form, and the liquid at a pressure below the bulk saturated vapor pressure remains indefinitely stable. As the fluid density in mineral inclusions is often derived from the temperature of bubble disappearance, a correction for the finite volume effect is required. Previous works have explained these phenomena and proposed a numerical procedure to compute the correction for pure water in a container completely wet by the liquid phase. Here, we revisit these works and provide an analytic formulation valid for any fluid, including the case of partial wetting. We introduce the Berthelot–Laplace length λ = 2 γκ /3, which combines the liquid isothermal compressibility κ and its surface tension γ . The quantitative effects are fully captured by a single, nondimensional parameter: the ratio of λ to the container size.},

Although benzene and pyridine are important aromatic molecules, the qualities of the HR spectra previously reported were not high enough to be compared with those of IR and Raman spectroscopy. Our HR spectroscopic system significantly improves sensitivity that enables the detection of HR bands of benzene and pyridine not observed before. In addition to band assignments, we interpret HR bands of benzene based on the vibronic coupling theory of (pre-) resonance hyper-Raman scattering. Depolarization ratios of HR bands of benzene and pyridine, obtained from polarized-HR measurements, are first examined from a theoretical point of view of HR spectroscopy. Moreover, we evaluate quantum chemical calculations for HR spectra by comparing experimental and computational spectra. We show that the frequency-dependent polarizability and hyperpolarizability calculations using time-dependent density functional theory well reproduce the HR experiments for bulk aromatic compounds.},

Our approach is based on the calculation of ice–liquid free energy differences from biased coexistence simulations that reversibly sample the melting and growth of layers of ice. We computed a total of 19 melting points for five different ice polymorphs, which are in excellent agreement with the melting lines obtained from the integration of the Clausius–Clapeyron equation. For proton-ordered and fully proton-disordered ice phases, the results are in very good agreement with previous calculations based on thermodynamic integration. For the partially proton-disordered ice III, we find a large increase in stability that is in line with previous observations using direct coexistence simulations for the TIP4P/2005 model. This issue highlights the robustness of the approach employed here for ice polymorphs with diverse degrees of proton disorder. Our approach is general and can be applied to the calculation of other complex phase diagrams.},

However, this description does not naturally connect to the modern understanding of what governs the relaxation rate in equilibrium. In equilibrium, it is well known that the relaxation rate, γ eq , depends on temperature and density. In addition, a large class of systems obeys density scaling, which means the rate specifically depends on the scaling parameter, Γ = e ( ρ )/ T , where e ( ρ ) is a system specific function. This paper presents a generalization of the fictive temperature concept in terms of a fictive scaling parameter, Γ fic , and a density scaling conjecture for aging glasses in which the aging rate depends on Γ and Γ fic .},

The estimated values were in good agreement with the reported experimental data, thus validating the present methodology. The analysis of the Monte Carlo trajectories indicated that the main permeation paths are located in the polymer and interfacial phases, although the water phase may make a non-negligible contribution to mass transport.},

We show that ions modify the behavior of the surrounding water molecules and form interfacial layers of water around them with physical properties distinct from those of bulk water. Small cations with high charge densities influence the kinetics of water well beyond the first solvation shell. At terahertz frequencies, we observe an emergence of fast relaxation processes of water with their magnitude following the ionic order Cs &gt; Rb &gt; K &gt; Na &gt; Li, revealing an enhanced population density of weakly coordinated water at the ion–water interface.

We demonstrate that this allows us to extract the quasi-exponential decay rate and the revival timescale. We solve analytically a model containing a state coupled to the idealized Bixon–Jortner quasicontinuum, and we obtain an interferometric signature of revival, which can be easily generalized to realistic systems. Moreover, we analyze how this revival signature is influenced by the system parameters, and we suggest optimal conditions for its observation.

The ground state has a sextuple chemical bond, and each of the calculated excited states has one less bond than the previous state. The calculated values for the ground X 1 Σ g + state of Mo 2 have been extrapolated to the complete basis set limits.

The ordering of the molecular bonding orbitals changes as the spin is increased from quintet to septet state resulting in a change in energy separation Δ S,S−1 of the calculated states. The quite low bond dissociation energy of the ground state is due to the splitting of the molecular bonding orbitals in two groups differing in energy by ∼3 eV. Finally, the bond breaking of Mo 2 , as the multiplicity of spin is increased, is analyzed in parallel with the Mo–Mo bond breaking in a series of Mo 2 Cl x complexes when x is increased.

However, in its standard form, this method is only consistent with the weak-coupling quantum master equation at all temperatures when many auxiliary density operators are included in the hierarchy, even when low temperature corrections are included. Here, we propose a new low temperature correction scheme for the termination of the hierarchy based on Zwanzig projection, which alleviates this problem and restores consistency with the weak-coupling master equation with a minimal hierarchy. The utility of the new correction scheme is demonstrated on a range of model systems, including the Fenna–Matthews–Olson complex. The new closure is found to improve convergence of the HEOM even beyond the weak-coupling limit and is very straightforward to implement in existing HEOM codes.},

  abstract = {Recent work has shown that it is possible to circumvent the calculation of the spectral density and directly generate the coefficients of the discretized influence functionals using data from classical trajectory simulations. However, the accuracy of this procedure depends on the validity of the high temperature approximation. In this work, an alternative derivation based on the Kubo formalism is provided. This enables the calculation of additional correction terms that increases the range of applicability of the procedure to lower temperatures. Because it is based on the Kubo-transformed correlation function, this approach allows the direct use of correlation functions obtained from methods such as ring-polymer molecular dynamics and centroid molecular dynamics in determining the influence functional coefficients for subsequent system-solvent simulations. The accuracy of the original procedure and the corrected procedure is investigated across a range of parameters. It is interesting that the correction term comes at zero additional cost. Furthermore, it is possible to improve upon the correction using zero-cost physical intuition and heuristics making the method even more accurate.},

  abstract = {Molecular rotations and vibrations have been extensively studied by chemists for decades, both experimentally using spectroscopic methods and theoretically with the help of quantum chemistry. However, the theoretical investigation of molecular rotations and vibrations in strong magnetic fields requires computationally more demanding tools. As such, proper calculations of rotational and vibrational spectra were not feasible up until very recently. In this work, we present rotational and vibrational spectra for two small linear molecules, H 2 and LiH, in strong magnetic fields. By treating the nuclei as classical particles, trajectories for rotations and vibrations are simulated from ab initio molecular dynamics. Born–Oppenheimer potential energy surfaces are calculated at the Hartree–Fock and MP2 levels of theory using London atomic orbitals to ensure gauge origin invariance. For the calculation of nuclear trajectories, a highly efficient Tajima propagator is introduced, incorporating the Berry curvature tensor accounting for the screening of nuclear charges.},

The trajectories are conditioned to end at a certain point (or in a certain region) in space. The bridge equations can be recast exactly in the form of a non-linear stochastic integro-differential equation. This equation can be very well approximated when the trajectories are closely bundled together in space, i.e., at low temperature, or for transition paths. The approximate equation can be solved iteratively using a fixed point method. We discuss how to choose the initial trajectories and show some examples of the performance of this method on some simple problems.

The ratcheted particles, which move on a lattice with periodic boundary conditions subject to a time-periodic drive, can be stochastically evolved in time to sample representative trajectories via a Gillespie method. In lieu of generating realizations of trajectories, a BTTN state can variationally approximate a distribution over the vast number of many-body configurations. We apply the density matrix renormalization group algorithm to initialize BTTN states, which are then propagated in time via the time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) algorithm to yield the steady-state behavior, including the effects of both typical and rare trajectories. The application of the methods to ratchet currents is highlighted, but the approach extends naturally to other interacting lattice models with time-dependent driving. Although trajectory sampling is conceptually and computationally simpler, we discuss situations for which the BTTN TDVP strategy can be beneficial.},

  abstract = {Spectral line shapes provide a window into the local environment coupled to a quantum transition in the condensed phase. In this paper, we build upon a stochastic model to account for non-stationary background processes produced by broad-band pulsed laser stimulation, as distinguished from those for stationary phonon bath. In particular, we consider the contribution of pair-fluctuations arising from the full bosonic many-body Hamiltonian within a mean-field approximation, treating the coupling to the system as a stochastic noise term. Using the Itô transformation, we consider two limiting cases for our model, which lead to a connection between the observed spectral fluctuations and the spectral density of the environment. In the first case, we consider a Brownian environment and show that this produces spectral dynamics that relax to form dressed excitonic states and recover an Anderson–Kubo-like form for the spectral correlations. In the second case, we assume that the spectrum is Anderson–Kubo like and invert to determine the corresponding background. Using the Jensen inequality, we obtain an upper limit for the spectral density for the background. The results presented here provide the technical tools for applying the stochastic model to a broad range of problems.},

We use this unique circumstance to establish a rigorous comparison between the individual contributions to the correlation energies stemming from the two theories in the { U , Δ v } parameter space. Within this analysis of the Hubbard dimer, we observe a change in the sign of the HF kinetic correlation energy, compare the indirect repulsion energies, and derive an expression for the “traditional” correlation energy, i.e., the one that corrects the HF estimate, in a pure site-occupation function theory spirit [Eq. (45) ]. Next, we test the performances of the Liu–Burke and the Seidl–Perdew–Levy functionals, which model the correlation energy based on its weak- and strong-interaction limit expansions and can be used for both the traditional and the KS correlation energies. Our results show that, in the Hubbard dimer setting, they typically work better for the HF reference, despite having been originally devised for KS. These conclusions are somewhat in line with prior assessments of these functionals on various chemical datasets. However, the Hubbard dimer model allows us to show the extent of the error that may occur in using the strong-interaction ingredient for the KS reference in place of the one for the HF reference, as has been carried out in most of the prior assessments.},

These ccECPs are given as a sum of spin-orbit averaged relativistic effective potential (AREP) and effective spin–orbit (SO) terms. The construction involves several steps with increasing refinements from more simple to fully correlated methods. The optimizations are carried out with objective functions that include weighted many-body atomic spectra, norm-conservation criteria, and SO splittings. Transferability tests involve molecular binding curves of corresponding hydride and oxide dimers. The constructed ccECPs are systematically better and in a few cases on par with previous effective core potential (ECP) tables on all tested criteria and provide a significant increase in accuracy for valence-only calculations with these elements. Our study confirms the importance of the AREP part in determining the overall quality of the ECP even in the presence of sizable spin–orbit effects. The subsequent quantum Monte Carlo calculations point out the importance of accurate trial wave functions that, in some cases (mid-series transition elements), require treatment well beyond a single-reference.},

  abstract = {The chain walking (CW) polymerization technique has the unique property of a movable catalyst synthesizing its own path by creating branch-on-branch structures. By successive attachment of monomers, the resulting architecture ranges from dendritic to linear growth depending on the walking rate, which is defined by the ratio of walking steps and reaction events of the catalyst. The transition regime is characterized by local dendritic sub-structures (dendritic blobs) and a global linear chain feature forming a dendritic bottle-brush. A scaling model for structures obtained by CW catalysis is presented and validated by computer simulation relating the extensions of CW structures to the catalyst’s walking ability. The limiting case of linear (low walking rate) and dendritic growth (high walking rate) is recovered, and the latter is shown to bear analogies to the Barabási–Albert graph and Bernoulli growth random walk. We could quantify the size of the dendritic blob as a function of the walking rate by using spectral properties of the connectivity matrix of the simulated macromolecules. This allows us to fit the numerical constants in the scaling approach. We predict that independent of the underlying chemical process, all CW polymerization syntheses involving a highly mobile catalyst ultimately result in bottle-brush structures whose properties depend on a unique parameter: the walking rate.},

We have in fact established a correlation between molecular motion characterized by NMR and the mechanical secondary relaxation (tan δ) for nine polycarbonate-like glasses. All of the NMR and mechanical data are for T ≪ Tg. The resulting structural insights suggest that the chains of these polymers are simultaneously both Flory random coils and Vol’kenstein bundles. The cooperative motions of groups of bundles can be described qualitatively by a variety of constrained-kinetics models of the glass. All of the models share a common trait for large-amplitude motion: an exponential increase in the time required for an inter-bundle dilation event with a linear increase in bundle group size. This dependence and a locally ordered Vol’kenstein bundle lead to an understanding of the surprising 60° (K) shift of tan δ to higher temperature for ring-fluoro-polycarbonate relative to that of polycarbonate by the apparently minor substitution of a fluorine for a hydrogen on every fourth ring.},

This input is employed within the framework of wetting theory and allows us to predict qualitatively the behavior of quasi-liquid layer thickness as a function of ambient conditions. Our results emphasize the significance of vapor pressure. The ice–vapor interface is shown to exhibit only incomplete premelting, but the situation can shift to a state of complete surface melting above water saturation. The results obtained serve also to assess the role of subsurface freezing at the water–vapor interface, and we show that intermolecular forces favor subsurface ice nucleation only in conditions of water undersaturation. We show that ice regelation at ambient pressure may be explained as a process of capillary freezing, without the need to invoke the action of bulk pressure melting. Our results for van der Waals forces are exploited in order to gauge dispersion interactions in empirical point charge models of water.},

  abstract = {An experimental study of the catalytic oxidation of methane over Pd foil in a flow reactor revealed that regular temporal oscillations in the reaction rate can arise at atmospheric pressure under methane-rich conditions. CO, CO 2 , H 2 , and H 2 O were detected as products. The oscillations of partial pressures of products and reactants in the gas phase were accompanied by oscillations of the catalyst temperature. According to an operando x-ray diffraction and mass-spectrometry study, the oscillations originate due to spontaneous oxidation and reduction of palladium; the high active catalyst surface is represented by metallic palladium, and the transition to the low-active state is accompanied by the formation of the PdO phase. In addition, it was detected that carbon dissolves in near-surface layers of palladium to form the PdC x phase. To describe the oscillations in the oxidation of methane, a 17-step reaction mechanism and a corresponding kinetic model were developed. The mechanism considers direct dissociative adsorption of methane and oxygen, pyrolytic activation of methane, oxidation and reduction of palladium, and direct formation and desorption of CO, CO 2 , H 2 , and H 2 O. Numerical solutions from the mathematical model of the continuously stirred-tank reactor qualitatively reproduce experimentally observed oscillatory dynamics. We have also developed a model, which considers the reversible diffusion of adsorbed oxygen and carbon atoms into the Pd bulk that allows us to explain the long induction period preceding the appearance of the oscillations. Mathematical modeling shows that the concentrations of dissolved oxygen and carbon atoms also oscillate under reaction conditions.},

  abstract = {The electronic structure of the N3/TiO 2 interface can directly influence the performance of a dye sensitized solar cell (DSSC). Therefore, it is crucial to understand the parameters that control the dye’s orientation on the semiconductor’s surface. A typical step in DSSC fabrication is to submerge the nanoparticulate semiconductor film in a solution containing the dye, the sensitizing solution. The pH of the N3 sensitizing solution determines the distribution of the N3 protonation states that exist in solution. Altering the pH of the sensitizing solution changes the N3 protonation states that exist in solution and, subsequently, the N3 protonation states that anchor to the TiO 2 substrate. We utilize the surface specific technique of heterodyne detected vibrational sum frequency generation spectroscopy to determine the binding geometry of N3 on a TiO 2 surface as a function of the sensitizing solution pH conditions. It is determined that significant reorientation of the dye occurs in pH ≤ 2.0 conditions due to the lack of N3-dye carboxylate anchoring groups participating in adsorption to the TiO 2 substrate. Consequently, the change in molecular geometry is met with a change in the interfacial electronic structure that can hinder electron transfer in DSSC architectures.},

  abstract = {The critical energy release rate ( G c ) is a key parameter in numerical simulations of hydraulic fracturing, which may be affected by a fluid. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of minerals’ tensile failure can be performed to gain insights into the mechanisms relevant to the critical energy release rate at the microscale. The methodology of calculating the critical energy release rate for solid–fluid systems is challenging. In this study, we conduct extensive MD simulations for solid–vacuum and solid–fluid systems. Typical components in shale and andesite, including quartz, muscovite, and kerogen, are selected in our investigation. The effect of H 2 O and CO 2 on the critical energy release rate is analyzed. Fracture propagation and fluid invasion in fractures are also monitored. The results show that quartz and muscovite are brittle in H 2 O and CO 2 and kerogen has very pronounced ductile behavior. H 2 O can reduce the critical energy release rate of quartz and muscovite slightly, but may increase that of kerogen. The effect of CO 2 on quartz and muscovite is mild, while it reduces G c of kerogen significantly. The implication is the creation of a much higher surface area in kerogen by CO 2 than by H 2 O, which is in line with large-scale observations.},

  abstract = {A major challenge in simulating glassy systems is the ability to generate configurations that may be found in equilibrium at sufficiently low temperatures, in order to probe static and dynamic behavior close to the glass transition. A variety of approaches have recently explored ways of surmounting this obstacle. Here, we explore the possibility of employing mechanical agitation, in the form of cyclic shear deformation, to generate low energy configurations in a model glass former. We perform shear deformation simulations over a range of temperatures, shear rates, and strain amplitudes. We find that shear deformation induces faster relaxation toward low energy configurations, or overaging , in simulations at sufficiently low temperatures, consistently with previous results for athermal shear. However, for temperatures at which simulations can be run until a steady state is reached with or without shear deformation, we find that the inclusion of shear deformation does not result in any speed up of the relaxation toward low energy configurations. Although we find the configurations from shear simulations to have properties indistinguishable from an equilibrium ensemble, the cyclic shear procedure does not guarantee that we generate an equilibrium ensemble at a desired temperature. In order to ensure equilibrium sampling, we develop a hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm that employs cyclic shear as a trial generation step and has acceptance probabilities that depend not only on the change in internal energy but also on the heat dissipated (equivalently, work done). We show that such an algorithm, indeed, generates an equilibrium ensemble.},

The near resonant-enhancement of two photon absorption in the two aromatic species produces only a few low charge state (+2) atomic ions in a neat molecular cluster, but the enclosure of the same cluster with layers of Ar can significantly increase the charge state of MCAIs. The yields of singly charged atomic ions from the molecular species, such as H + , C + , and Cl + , are positively correlated with the number of molecules inside the Ar cluster, but the yields of the MCAI and Ar + demonstrate opposite behaviors. A higher number of aromatic molecules are actually detrimental to the production of Ar + and MCAIs. The results of exponential fittings of the yields of MCAIs at different laser intensities reveal a systematic change for the exponent of Ar + : with increasing concentrations of 3ClB in Ar clusters, the exponent decreases and eventually reaches the same value as those of MCAIs. These results are consistent with our previous hypothesis that the formation mechanism of MCAIs may be different from that of singly charged species and that the strong resonance of Ar 3 + may play an important role in the overall energy absorption. Moreover, the effect of the molecular core seems to change the formation mechanism of Ar + to that of MCAIs.},

An assignment of the main observed spectral features is based on the results of multi-configurational self-consistent field (MCSCF) calculations for the excitation energies and static exchange (STEX) calculations for energies and intensities. MCSCF results have been analyzed in terms of static and dynamic electron relaxation as well as electron correlation contributions to double-core-hole state ionization potentials. The analysis of applicability of the STEX method, which implements the one-particle picture toward the complete basis set limit, is motivated by the fact that it scales well toward large species. We find that combining the MCSCF and STEX techniques is a viable approach to analyze double-core-hole spectra.},

An indicative kinetic energy resolution of 0.4\%, together with the full angular dependence of the fast electrons, provides a detailed description of the vibronically coupled structure. It is demonstrated that a modest quadratic vibronic coupling model, parameterized by the quasidiabatic ansatz, is sufficient to accurately recreate all the observed vibronic interactions. Simulated spectra are shown to be in excellent agreement with the experimental data, verifying the proposed model and providing a framework that may be used to accurately simulate spectra of larger C 2 n H monohydride carbon chains.

  abstract = {Spontaneous and photo-induced decay processes of HfF 5 − and WF 5 − molecular anions were investigated in the Double ElectroStatic Ion Ring ExpEriment (DESIREE). The observation of these reactions over long time scales (several tens of ms) was possible due to the cryogenic temperatures (13 K) and the extremely low residual gas pressure (∼10 −14 mbar) of DESIREE. For photo-induced reactions, laser wavelengths in the range 240 to 450 nm were employed. Both anion species were found to undergo spontaneous decay via electron detachment or fragmentation. After some ms, radiative cooling processes were observed to lower the probability for further decay through these processes. Photo-induced reactions indicate the existence of an energy threshold for WF 5 − anions at about 3.5 eV, above which the neutralization yield increases strongly. By contrast, HfF 5 − ions exhibit essentially no enhanced production of neutrals upon photon interaction, even for the highest photon energy used in this experiment (∼5.2 eV). This suppression will be highly beneficial for the efficient detection, in accelerator mass spectrometry, of the extremely rare isotope 182 Hf using the 182 HfF 5 − anion while effectively reducing the interfering stable isobar 182 W in the analyte ion 182 WF 5 − . The radionuclide 182 Hf is of great relevance in astrophysical environments as it constitutes a potential candidate to study the events of nucleosynthesis that may have taken place in the vicinity of the solar system several million years ago.},

A novel numerical approach is developed to analyze the time dependence of the dissociation rate and to determine the absolute scaling of the radiative cooling rate coefficient. The model results show that radiative cooling competes with dissociation below the critical total vibrational energies E c = 5.39(1) eV for OHPyr + and 5.90(1) eV for BrPyr + . These critical energies and implications for radiative cooling dynamics are important for astrochemical models concerned with energy dissipation and molecular lifecycles.

In this work, we benchmark the accuracy of ADC methods for electron attachment and ionization of open-shell molecules with the UHF reference orbitals (EA/IP-ADC/UHF) and develop an approach to quantify the spin contamination in charged excited states. Following this assessment, we demonstrate that the spin contamination can be reduced by combining EA/IP-ADC with the reference orbitals from restricted open-shell Hartree–Fock (ROHF) or orbital-optimized Møller–Plesset perturbation (OMP) theories. Our numerical results demonstrate that for open-shell systems with strong spin contamination in the UHF reference, the third-order EA/IP-ADC methods with the ROHF or OMP reference orbitals are similar in accuracy to equation-of-motion coupled cluster theory with single and double excitations.},

Even though they have widely been utilized as a basic ingredient in Kevlar, Twaron, and other fabrics and applications, their intrinsic behavior under intense shock loading is still to be understood. In this work, we characterize the anisotropic shock response of PPTA crystals by performing reactive molecular dynamics simulations. Results from shock loading along the two perpendicular directions to the polymer backbones, [100] and [010], indicate distinct shock release mechanisms that preserve and destroy the hydrogen bond network. Shocks along the [100] direction for particle velocity U p &lt; 2.46 km/s indicate the formation of a plastic regime composed of shear bands, where the PPTA structure is planarized. Shocks along the [010] direction for particle velocity U p &lt; 2.18 km/s indicate a complex response regime, where elastic compression shifts to amorphization as the shock is intensified. While hydrogen bonds are mostly preserved for shocks along the [100] direction, hydrogen bonds are continuously destroyed with the amorphization of the crystal for shocks along the [010] direction. Decomposition of the polymer chains by cross-linking is triggered at the threshold particle velocity U p = 2.18 km/s for the [010] direction and U p = 2.46 km/s for the [100] direction. These atomistic insights based on large-scale simulations highlight the intricate and anisotropic mechanisms underpinning the shock response of PPTA polymers and are expected to support the enhancement of their applications.},

The trion is modeled by a three-particle Schrödinger equation and the magnetic-field interaction is included by means of a vector potential in symmetric gauge. By using a coordinate transformation and a unitary transformation, the trion Hamiltonian can be converted into the sum of a translational term describing the Landau quantization for the trion center-of-mass motion, an internal term describing the trion binding, and a translational–internal coupling term depending linearly on the magnetic-field strength. The trion eigenenergy and wavefunction can then be calculated efficiently by using a variational method, and the quantum numbers of trions in magnetic fields can be assigned. The eigenenergies, binding energies, and correlation energies of three trion branches, which correspond to the ground-state trion and two excited-state trions solved from the trion Hamiltonian in zero magnetic field, are studied numerically in finite magnetic fields. The present method is applied to study the magnetic-field dependence of trion energy levels in hole-doped WSe 2 monolayers. The binding energies and correlation energies of positive trions in WSe 2 are investigated over a range of magnetic fields up to 25 T.},

While Mori’s projection operator yields linear generalized Langevin equations that can be computationally efficiently implemented in numerical simulations, the downside is that Mori’s generalized Langevin equation does not encompass the multi-body potential of mean force required to correctly encode structural and thermodynamic properties in coarse-grained many-body systems. Zwanzig’s projection operator yields nonlinear generalized Langevin equations including the multi-body potential of mean force, while the remaining force contributions are not as cheap to implement in molecular simulation without making it formally hard to justify approximations. For many-particle coarse-grained models, due to computational and conceptual simplicity, an often used approach is to combine nonlinear conservative interactions with linear expressions to model dissipation. In a previous study [V. Klippenstein and N. F. A. van der Vegt, J. Chem. Phys. 154 , 191102 (2021)], we proposed a method to parameterize such models to achieve dynamic consistency in coarse-grained models, allowing us to reconcile Mori’s and Zwanzig’s approach for practical purposes. In the current study, by applying the same strategy, we develop coarse-grained implicit solvent models for the continuous Asakura–Oosawa model, which under certain conditions allows us to develop very accurate coarse-grained potentials. By developing coarse-grained models for different reference systems with varying parameters, we test the broader applicability of the proposed procedure and demonstrate the relevance of accurate coarse-grained potentials in bottom-up derived dissipative models. We study how different system parameters affect the dynamic representability of the coarse-grained models. In particular, we find that the quality of the coarse-grained potential is crucial to correctly model the backscattering effect due to collisions on the coarse-grained scale. As hydrodynamic interactions are not explicitly modeled in the presented coarse-graining approach, deviations are observed in the long-time dynamics. The Asakura–Oosawa model allows for the tuning of system parameters to gain an improved understanding of this limitation. We also propose three new iterative optimization schemes to fine-tune the generalized Langevin thermostat to exactly match the reference velocity-autocorrelation function.},

The system–bath entanglement theorem is then readily followed between an important class of nonequilibrium steady-state correlation functions. All these relations are validated numerically. A simple corollary is the transport current expression, which exactly recovers the result obtained from the nonequilibrium Green’s function formalism.},

This paper discusses the results obtained with the real-time equation-of-motion CC cumulant (RT-EOM-CC) approach and CC Green’s function (CCGF) approaches in applications to the water and water dimer molecules. We compare the ionization potentials obtained with these methods for the valence region with the results obtained with the coupled-cluster with singles, doubles, and perturbative triples formulation as a difference of energies for N and N − 1 electron systems. All methods show good agreement with each other. They also agree well with the experiment with errors usually below 0.1 eV for the ionization potentials. We also analyze unique features of the spectral functions, associated with the position of satellite peaks, obtained with the RT-EOM-CC and CCGF methods employing single and double excitations, as a function of the monomer OH bond length and the proton transfer coordinate in the dimer. Finally, we analyze the impact of the basis set effects on the quality of calculated ionization potentials and find that the basis set effects are less pronounced for the augmented-type sets.},

  abstract = {Photosynthetic organisms use pigment–protein complexes to capture the sunlight that powers most life on earth. Within these complexes, the position of the embedded pigments is all optimized for light harvesting. At the same time, the protein scaffold undergoes thermal fluctuations that vary the structure, and, thus, photophysics, of the complexes. While these variations are averaged out in ensemble measurements, single-molecule spectroscopy provides the ability to probe these conformational changes. We used single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy to identify the photophysical substates reflective of distinct conformations and the associated conformational dynamics in phycoerythrin 545 (PE545), a pigment–protein complex from cryptophyte algae. Rapid switching between photophysical states was observed, indicating that ensemble measurements average over a conformational equilibrium. A highly quenched conformation was also identified, and its population increased under high light. This discovery establishes that PE545 has the characteristics to serve as a photoprotective site. Finally, unlike homologous proteins from the evolutionarily related cyanobacteria and red algae, quenching was not observed upon photobleaching, which may allow for robust photophysics without the need for rapid repair or replacement machinery. Collectively, these observations establish the presence of a rich and robust set of conformational states of PE545. Cryptophytes exhibit particularly diverse energetics owing to the variety of microenvironments in which they survive, and the conformational states and dynamics reported here may provide photophysical flexibility that contributes to their remarkable ability to flourish under diverse conditions.},

  abstract = {The mechanochemical coupling and biological function of myosin motors are regulated by Ca 2+ concentrations. As one of the regulation pathways, Ca 2+ binding induces a conformational change of the light chain calmodulin and its binding modes with a myosin lever arm, which can affect the stiffness of the lever arm and force transmission. However, the underlying molecular mechanism of the Ca 2+ regulated stiffness change is not fully understood. Here, we study the effect of Ca 2+ binding on the conformational dynamics and stiffness of the myosin VIIa lever arm bound with a calmodulin by performing molecular dynamics simulations and dynamic correlation network analysis. The results showed that the calmodulin bound lever arm at an apo state can sample three different conformations. In addition to the conformation observed in a crystal structure, a calmodulin bound lever arm at the apo condition can also adopt other two conformations featured by different extents of small-angle bending of the lever arm. However, large-angle bending is strongly prohibited. Such results suggest that the calmodulin bound lever arm without Ca 2+ binding is plastic for small-angle deformation but shows high stiffness for large-angle deformation. In comparison, after the binding of Ca 2+ , although the calmodulin bound lever arm is locally more rigid, it can adopt largely deformed or even unfolded conformations, which may render the lever arm incompetent for force transmission. The conformational plasticity of the lever arm for small-angle deformation at the apo condition may be used as a force buffer to prevent the lever arm from unfolding during the power stroke action of the motor domain.},

Here, we report on the modification of protein–membrane interactions by disordered chains using meshless membrane simulations. The protein and bound membrane are modeled together as a chiral crescent protein rod with two excluded-volume chains. As the chain length increases, the repulsion between them reduces the cluster size of the proteins. It induces spindle-shaped vesicles and a transition between arc-shaped and circular protein assemblies in a disk-shaped vesicle. For flat membranes, an intermediate chain length induces many tubules owing to the repulsion between the protein assemblies, whereas longer chains promote perpendicular elongation of tubules. Moreover, protein rods with zero rod curvature and sufficiently long chains stabilize the spherical buds. For proteins with a negative rod curvature, an intermediate chain length induces a rugged membrane with branched protein assemblies, whereas longer chains induce the formation of tubules with periodic concave-ring structures.},

The fitting of the experimental data with these functional relations then allows for the calculation of the nanocrystalline density, pressure in the nanocrystal, and difference in the surface tension coefficients at the nanocrystal–matrix interface and melt–matrix interface, as well as the difference in the surface entropies per unit area at the nanocrystal–matrix and melt–matrix interfaces.},

  abstract = {Recent studies suggest that cosolute mixtures may exert significant non-additive effects upon protein stability. The corresponding liquid–vapor interfaces may provide useful insight into these non-additive effects. Accordingly, in this work, we relate the interfacial properties of dilute multicomponent solutions to the interactions between solutes. We first derive a simple model for the surface excess of solutes in terms of thermodynamic observables. We then develop a lattice-based statistical mechanical perturbation theory to derive these observables from microscopic interactions. Rather than adopting a random mixing approximation, this dilute solution theory (DST) exactly treats solute–solute interactions to lowest order in perturbation theory. Although it cannot treat concentrated solutions, Monte Carlo (MC) simulations demonstrate that DST describes the interactions in dilute solutions with much greater accuracy than regular solution theory. Importantly, DST emphasizes a fundamental distinction between the “intrinsic” and “effective” preferences of solutes for interfaces. DST predicts that three classes of solutes can be distinguished by their intrinsic preference for interfaces. While the surface preference of strong depletants is relatively insensitive to interactions, the surface preference of strong surfactants can be modulated by interactions at the interface. Moreover, DST predicts that the surface preference of weak depletants and weak surfactants can be qualitatively inverted by interactions in the bulk. We also demonstrate that DST can be extended to treat surface polarization effects and to model experimental data. MC simulations validate the accuracy of DST predictions for lattice systems that correspond to molar concentrations.},

  abstract = {The structural and dynamical properties of nanoconfined solutions can differ dramatically from those of the corresponding bulk systems. Understanding the changes induced by confinement is central to controlling the behavior of synthetic nanostructured materials and predicting the characteristics of biological and geochemical systems. A key outstanding issue is how the molecular-level behavior of nanoconfined electrolyte solutions is reflected in different experimental, particularly spectroscopic, measurements. This is addressed here through molecular dynamics simulations of the OH stretching infrared (IR) spectroscopy of NaCl, NaBr, and NaI solutions in isotopically dilute HOD/D 2 O confined in hydroxylated amorphous silica slit pores of width 1–6 nm and pH ∼ 2 ⁠ . In addition, the water reorientation dynamics and spectral diffusion, accessible by pump–probe anisotropy and two-dimensional IR measurements, are investigated. The aim is to elucidate the effect of salt identity, confinement, and salt concentration on the vibrational spectra. It is found that the IR spectra of the electrolyte solutions are only modestly blue-shifted upon confinement in amorphous silica slit pores, with both the size of the shift and linewidth increasing with the halide size, but these effects are suppressed as the salt concentration is increased. This indicates the limitations of linear IR spectroscopy as a probe of confined water. However, the OH reorientational and spectral diffusion dynamics are significantly slowed by confinement even at the lowest concentrations. The retardation of the dynamics eases with increasing salt concentration and pore width, but it exhibits a more complex behavior as a function of halide.},

On [C 10 mim][PF 6 ] surface, a significant orientational wetting is observed, with the wetting strength showing a diverging tendency. Depth of the wetting was captured from the density and orientational order profile by a static length, which remarkably increases below the temperature T stat upon cooling down. The dynamical correlation length that measures the distance of surface-dynamics acceleration into the bulk was characterized via the spatial-dependent mobility. The translational correlation exhibits a similar drastic increment at T stat , while the rotational correlation drastically increases at a lower temperature T rot . We connect these results to the dynamics in bulk liquids, by finding T stat and T rot that correspond to the onset temperatures where the liquids become cooperative for translational and rotational relaxation, respectively. This signifies the importance of collective dynamics in the bulk on the orientational wetting and surface dynamics in the ILs.},

Recently, we showed that the solution dynamics become slower when the diameter of the pristine pores is reduced. Here, we determine the effects of (aminopropyl)triethoxysilane and dye surface functionalizations on the motions of the water molecules and lithium ions from ambient temperatures down to the glass transition. The local and diffusive solution dynamics are similar in both functionalized pores but, on average, slower than in pristine pores with comparable diameters. When the exchange between different confinement regions is sufficiently slow at reduced temperatures, bimodal water and lithium dynamics may be observed. We attribute this bimodality to bulk-like motion in the pore centers and slowed-down motion at the pore walls. For the lithium ions, a bimodality observed in the pristine pores is absent in the functionalized ones. We conjecture that the steric hindrance and electrostatic interactions associated with the grafted functional groups interfere with the formation of a defined electric double layer, while the enhanced surface roughness and unequal charge distribution result in overall slower dynamics. Thus, the nature of the walls is an important parameter for the solution dynamics. Thereby, in situ measurements of the pH value inside the silica pores using the grafted dye molecules reveal that observed changes in the pH value in response to the surface functionalization are of limited relevance for the water reorientation.},

For states below T c , we identify a lifetime τ lt that measures the time scale on which the system can be considered as an amorphous solid. The temperature dependence of τ lt can be well described by an Arrhenius law. The existence of transient amorphous solid states below T c is associated with the possibility of brittle yielding, as manifested by a sharp stress drop in the stress–strain relation and shear banding. We show that brittle yielding requires, on the one hand, low shear rates and, on the other hand, the time scale corresponding to the inverse shear rate has to be smaller or of the order of τ lt .

  abstract = {We study theoretically the quantum dynamics and spectroscopy of rovibrational polaritons formed in a model system composed of a single rovibrating diatomic molecule, which interacts with two degenerate, orthogonally polarized modes of an optical Fabry–Pérot cavity. We employ an effective rovibrational Pauli–Fierz Hamiltonian in length gauge representation and identify three-state vibro-polaritonic conical intersections (VPCIs) between singly excited vibro-polaritonic states in a two-dimensional angular coordinate branching space. The lower and upper vibrational polaritons are of mixed light–matter hybrid character, whereas the intermediate state is purely photonic in nature. The VPCIs provide effective population transfer channels between singly excited vibrational polaritons, which manifest in rich interference patterns in rotational densities. Spectroscopically, three bright singly excited states are identified when an external infrared laser field couples to both a molecular and a cavity mode. The non-trivial VPCI topology manifests as pronounced multi-peak progression in the spectral region of the upper vibrational polariton, which is traced back to the emergence of rovibro-polaritonic light–matter hybrid states. Experimentally, ubiquitous spontaneous emission from cavity modes induces a dissipative reduction of intensity and peak broadening, which mainly influences the purely photonic intermediate state peak as well as the rovibro-polaritonic progression.},

  abstract = {Hydrazoic acid (HN 3 ) is used as a case study for investigating the accuracy and precision by which a molecular structure—specifically, a semi-experimental equilibrium structure ( r e SE )—may be determined using current state-of-the-art methodology. The influence of the theoretical corrections for effects of vibration–rotation coupling and electron-mass distribution that are employed in the analysis is explored in detail. The small size of HN 3 allowed us to deploy considerable computational resources to probe the basis-set dependence of these corrections using a series of coupled-cluster single, double, perturbative triple [CCSD(T)] calculations with cc-pCV X Z ( X = D, T, Q, 5) basis sets. We extrapolated the resulting corrections to the complete basis set (CBS) limit to obtain CCSD(T)/CBS corrections, which were used in a subsequent r e SE structure determination. The r e SE parameters obtained using the CCSD(T)/cc-pCV5Z corrections are nearly identical to those obtained using the CCSD(T)/CBS corrections, with uncertainties in the bond distances and angles of less than 0.0006 Å and 0.08°, respectively. The previously obtained r e SE structure using CCSD(T)/ANO2 agrees with that using CCSD(T)/cc-pCV5Z to within 0.000 08 Å and 0.016° for bond distances and angles, respectively, and with only 25\% larger uncertainties, validating the idea that r e SE structure determinations can be carried out with significantly smaller basis sets than those needed for similarly accurate, strictly ab initio determinations. Although the purely computational r e structural parameters [CCSD(T)/cc-pCV6Z] fall outside of the statistical uncertainties (2σ) of the corresponding r e SE structural parameters, the discrepancy is rectified by applying corrections to address the theoretical limitations of the CCSD(T)/cc-pCV6Z geometry with respect to basis set, electron correlation, relativity, and the Born–Oppenheimer approximation, thereby supporting the contention that the semi-experimental approach is both an accurate and vastly more efficient method for structure determinations than is brute-force computation.},

  abstract = {First, high-resolution sub-Doppler infrared spectroscopic results for cyclopentyl radical (C 5 H 9 ) are reported on the α-CH stretch fundamental with suppression of spectral congestion achieved by adiabatic cooling to T rot ≈ 19(4) K in a slit jet expansion. Surprisingly, cyclopentyl radical exhibits a rotationally assignable infrared spectrum, despite 3N − 6 = 36 vibrational modes and an upper vibrational state density (ρ ≈ 40–90 #/cm −1 ) in the critical regime (ρ ≈ 100 #/cm −1 ) necessary for onset of intramolecular vibrational relaxation (IVR) dynamics. Such high-resolution data for cyclopentyl radical permit detailed fits to a rigid-rotor asymmetric top Hamiltonian, initial structural information for ground and vibrationally excited states, and opportunities for detailed comparison with theoretical predictions. Specifically, high level ab initio calculations at the coupled-cluster singles, doubles, and perturbative triples (CCSD(T))/ANO0, 1 level are used to calculate an out-of-plane bending potential, which reveals a C 2 symmetry double minimum 1D energy surface over a C 2v transition state. The inversion barrier [V barrier ≈ 3.7(1) kcal/mol] is much larger than the effective moment of inertia for out-of-plane bending, resulting in localization of the cyclopentyl wavefunction near its C 2 symmetry equilibrium geometry and tunneling splittings for the ground state too small (&lt;1 MHz) to be resolved under sub-Doppler slit jet conditions. The persistence of fully resolved high-resolution infrared spectroscopy for such large cyclic polyatomic radicals at high vibrational state densities suggests a “deceleration” of IVR for a cycloalkane ring topology, much as low frequency torsion/methyl rotation degrees of freedom have demonstrated a corresponding “acceleration” of IVR processes in linear hydrocarbons.},

  abstract = {The added technological potential of bimetallic clusters and nanoparticles, as compared to their pure (i.e., one-component) counterparts, stems from the ability to further fine-tune their properties and, consequently, functionalities through a simultaneous use of the “knobs” of size and composition. The practical realization of this potential can be greatly advanced by the knowledge of the correlations and relationships between the various characteristics of bimetallic nanosystems on the one hand and those of their pure counterparts as well as pure constituent components on the other hand. Here, we present results of a density functional theory based study of pure Pt n and Mo n clusters aimed at revisiting and exploring further their structural, electronic, and energetic properties. These are then used as a basis for analysis and characterization of the results of calculations on two-component Pt n-m Mo m clusters. The analysis also includes establishing relationships between the properties of the Pt n-m Mo m clusters and those of their Pt n-m and Mo m components. One of the particularly intriguing findings suggested by the calculated data is a linear dependence of the average binding energy per atom in sets of Pt n-m Mo m clusters that have the same fixed number m of Mo atoms and different number n-m of Pt atoms on the fractional content (n-m)/n of Pt atoms. We derive an analytical model that establishes the fundamental basis for this linearity and expresses its parameters—the m -dependent slope and intercept—in terms of characteristic properties of the constituent components, such as the average binding energy per atom of Mo m and the average per-atom adsorption energy of the Pt atoms on Mo m . The conditions of validity and degree of robustness of this model and of the linear relationship predicted by it are discussed.},

The instrument offers the possibility to study chemical reaction dynamics and kinetics where higher pressures are either desired or unavoidable, adding a new tool to help close the “pressure gap” between surface science and applied catalysis. NAP-VMI conditions are created by two sets of ion optics that guide ions through an aperture and map their velocities. The aperture separates the high pressure ionization region and maintains the necessary vacuum in the detector region. The performance of the NAP-VMI is demonstrated with results from N 2 O photodissociation and N 2 scattering from a Pd(110) surface, which are compared under vacuum and at near-ambient pressure (1 × 10 −3 mbar). NAP-VMI has the potential to be applied to, and useful for, a broader range of experiments, including photoelectron spectroscopy and scattering with liquid microjets.},

Here, we expand the scope of information thermodynamics to deterministic bipartite chemical reaction networks, namely, composed of two coupled subnetworks sharing species but not reactions. We do so by introducing a meaningful notion of mutual information between different molecular features that we express in terms of deterministic concentrations. This allows us to formulate separate second laws for each subnetwork, which account for their energy and information exchanges, in complete analogy with stochastic systems. We then use our framework to investigate the working mechanisms of a model of chemically driven self-assembly and an experimental light-driven bimolecular motor. We show that both systems are constituted by two coupled subnetworks of chemical reactions. One subnetwork is maintained out of equilibrium by external reservoirs (chemostats or light sources) and powers the other via energy and information flows. In doing so, we clarify that the information flow is precisely the thermodynamic counterpart of an information ratchet mechanism only when no energy flow is involved.},

  abstract = {Gibbs energies for reactions involving aqueous ions are challenging to predict due to the large solvation energies of such ions. A stringent test would be the ab initio reproduction of the aqueous-phase chelate effect, an entropic effect in reactions of very small enthalpy changes. This paper examines what is required to achieve such a reproduction for the paradigmatic reaction M(NH 3 ) 4 2+ + 2 en → M( en ) 2 2+ + 4 NH 3 ( en = 1,2-ethylenediamine), for which Δ rxn G* and Δ rxn H* are −2.3 and +1.6 kcal mol −1 , respectively, if M = Zn. Explicit solvation via simulation was avoided in order to allow sufficiently accurate electronic structure models; this required the use of continuum solvation models (CSMs), and a great deal of effort was made in attempting to lower the relative errors of Δ solv G*[M(NH 3 ) 4 2+ ] vs Δ solv G*[M( en ) 2 2+ ] from the CSMs available in Gaussian software. CSMs in ADF and JDFTx software were also tested. A uniform 2.2 kcal mol −1 accuracy in Δ rxn G* for all three metal-atom choices M = {Zn, Cd, Hg} was eventually achieved, but not from any of the known CSMs tested, nor from cavity size reoptimization, nor from semicontinuum modeling: post facto solvation energy corrections [one per solute type, NH 3 , en , M(NH 3 ) 4 2+ , M( en ) 2 2+ ] were needed. It is hoped that this study will aid (and encourage) further CSM development for coordination-complex ions.},

  abstract = {Local hybrid functionals are a more flexible class of density functional approximations, allowing for a position-dependent admixture of exact exchange. This additional flexibility, however, comes with a more involved mathematical form and a more complicated design. A common denominator for previously constructed local hybrid functionals is the usage of thermochemical benchmark data to construct these functionals. Herein, we design a local hybrid functional without relying on benchmark data. Instead, we construct it in a more ab initio manner, following the principles of modern meta-generalized gradient approximations and considering theoretical constraints. To achieve this, we make use of the density matrix expansion and a local mixing function based on an approximate correlation length. The accuracy of the developed density functional approximation is assessed for thermochemistry, excitation energies, polarizabilities, magnetizabilities, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spin–spin coupling constants, NMR shieldings, and shifts, as well as EPR g -tensors and hyperfine coupling constants. Here, the new exchange functional shows a robust performance and is especially well suited for atomization energies, barrier heights, excitation energies, NMR coupling constants, and EPR properties, whereas it loses some ground for the NMR shifts. Therefore, the designed functional is a major step forward for functionals that have been designed from first principles.},

Here, we present a coherent state representation of the vibronic dynamics and of the resulting response functions for the widely used linearly displaced harmonic oscillator model. Analytical expressions are initially derived for the case of third-order response functions in an N -level system, with ground state initialization of the oscillator (zero-temperature limit). The results are then generalized to the case of Mth order response functions, with arbitrary M. The formal derivation is translated into a simple recipe, whereby the explicit analytical expressions of the response functions can be derived directly from the Feynman diagrams. We further generalize to the whole set of initial coherent states, which form an overcomplete basis. This allows one, in principle, to derive the dependence of the response functions on arbitrary initial states of the vibrational modes and is here applied to the case of thermal states. Finally, a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian approach is used to include in the above expressions the effect of vibrational relaxation.},

However, it can be challenging to apply transition path theory to data from such methods because determining whether configurations and trajectory segments are part of reactive trajectories requires looking backward and forward in time. Here, we show how this issue can be overcome efficiently by introducing simple data structures. We illustrate the approach in the context of nonequilibrium umbrella sampling, but the strategy is general and can be used to obtain transition path theory statistics from other methods that sample segments of unbiased trajectories.},

  abstract = {Quantum chemical calculations using density functional theory are reported for the diatomic molecules LiF, BeO, and BN. The nature of the interatomic interactions is analyzed with the Energy Decomposition Analysis–Natural Orbitals of Chemical Valence (EDA-NOCV) method, and the results are critically discussed and compared with data from Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules, Natural Bond Orbital, and Mayer approaches. Polar bonds, like nonpolar bonds, are caused by the interference of wave functions, which lead to an accumulation of electronic charge in the bonding region. Polar bonds generally have a larger percentage of electrostatic bonding to the total attraction, but nonpolar bonds may also possess large contributions from Coulombic interaction. The term “ionic contribution” refers to valence bond structures and is misleading because it refers to separate fragments with negligible overlap that occur only in the solid state and in solution, not in a molecule. The EDA-NOCV method gives detailed information about the individual orbital contributions, which can be identified by visual inspection of the associated deformation densities. It is very important, particularly for polar bonds to distinguish between the interatomic interactions of the final dissociation products after bond rupture and the interactions between the fragments in the eventually formed bond. The bond formation in LiF is dominated by orbital interactions (90\%) between Li and F yielding a single bond, but the eventually formed bond comes mainly from the electrostatic attraction between Li + and F − , where the minor orbital interactions (10\%) have equally strong σ and π components. The symmetry allowed bond formation of BeO between Be in the 1 S ground state and O in the excited 1 D state is dominated (90\%) by a strong dative Be → O σ bond with negligible π interactions. The final bond situation in BeO is best described by the interaction between Be + and O − , where the Coulombic forces provide 60\% of the attraction and the orbital interactions give equally strong σ and π bonds. The chemical bond in BN is analyzed in the X 3 Π ground state and the a 1 Σ + excited state. Both states have triple bonds with strong π bonds, which are in the a 1 Σ + state even stronger than the σ bond.},

  abstract = {The study of chemical reactions in environments under nonequilibrium conditions has been of interest recently in a variety of contexts, including current-induced reactions in molecular junctions and scanning tunneling microscopy experiments. In this work, we outline a fully quantum mechanical, numerically exact approach to describe chemical reaction rates in such nonequilibrium situations. The approach is based on an extension of the flux correlation function formalism to nonequilibrium conditions and uses a mixed real and imaginary time hierarchical equations of motion approach for the calculation of rate constants. As a specific example, we investigate current-induced intramolecular proton transfer reactions in a molecular junction for different applied bias voltages and molecule–lead coupling strengths.},

  abstract = {Pesticides benefit agriculture by increasing crop yield, quality, and security. However, pesticides may inadvertently harm bees, which are valuable as pollinators. Thus, candidate pesticides in development pipelines must be assessed for toxicity to bees. Leveraging a dataset of 382 molecules with toxicity labels from honey bee exposure experiments, we train a support vector machine (SVM) to predict the toxicity of pesticides to honey bees. We compare two representations of the pesticide molecules: (i) a random walk feature vector listing counts of length- L walks on the molecular graph with each vertex- and edge-label sequence and (ii) the Molecular ACCess System (MACCS) structural key fingerprint (FP), a bit vector indicating the presence/absence of a list of pre-defined subgraph patterns in the molecular graph. We explicitly construct the MACCS FPs but rely on the fixed-length- L random walk graph kernel (RWGK) in place of the dot product for the random walk representation. The L -RWGK-SVM achieves an accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score (mean over 2000 runs) of 0.81, 0.68, 0.71, and 0.69, respectively, on the test data set—with L = 4 being the mode optimal walk length. The MACCS-FP-SVM performs on par/marginally better than the L -RWGK-SVM, lends more interpretability, but varies more in performance. We interpret the MACCS-FP-SVM by illuminating which subgraph patterns in the molecules tend to strongly push them toward the toxic/non-toxic side of the separating hyperplane.},

  abstract = {Among other improvements, the Martini 3 coarse-grained force field provides a more accurate description of the solvation of protein pockets and channels through the consistent use of various bead types and sizes. Here, we show that the representation of Na + and Cl − ions as “tiny” (TQ5) beads limits the accessible time step to 25 fs. By contrast, with Martini 2, time steps of 30–40 fs were possible for lipid bilayer systems without proteins. This limitation is relevant for systems that require long equilibration times. We derive a quantitative kinetic model of time-integration instabilities in molecular dynamics (MD) as a function of the time step, ion concentration and mass, system size, and simulation time. We demonstrate that ion–water interactions are the main source of instability at physiological conditions, followed closely by ion–ion interactions. We show that increasing the ionic masses makes it possible to use time steps up to 40 fs with minimal impact on static equilibrium properties and dynamical quantities, such as lipid and solvent diffusion coefficients. Increasing the size of the bead representing the ions (and thus changing their hydration) also permits longer time steps. For a soluble protein, we find that increasing the mass of tiny beads also on the protein permits simulations with 30-fs time steps. The use of larger time steps in Martini 3 results in a more efficient exploration of configuration space. The kinetic model of MD simulation crashes can be used to determine the maximum allowed time step upfront for an efficient use of resources and whenever sampling efficiency is critical.},

  abstract = {Single-molecule Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET) experiments are ideally suited to resolve the structural dynamics of biomolecules. A significant challenge to date is capturing and quantifying the exchange between multiple conformational states, mainly when these dynamics occur on the sub-millisecond timescale. Many methods for quantitative analysis are challenged if more than two states are involved, and the appropriate choice of the number of states in the kinetic network is difficult. An additional complication arises if dynamically active molecules coexist with pseudo-static molecules in similar conformational states with undistinguishable Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) efficiencies. To address these problems, we developed a quantitative integrative analysis framework that combines the information from FRET-lines that relate average fluorescence lifetimes and intensities in two-dimensional burst frequency histograms, fluorescence decays obtained by time-correlated single-photon-counting, photon distribution analysis of the intensities, and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. Individually, these methodologies provide ambiguous results for the characterization of dynamics in complex kinetic networks. However, the global analysis approach enables accurate determination of the number of states, their kinetic connectivity, the transition rate constants, and species fractions. To challenge the potential of smFRET experiments for studying multi-state kinetic networks, we apply our integrative framework using a set of synthetic data for three-state systems with different kinetic connectivity and exchange rates. Our methodology paves the way toward an integrated analysis of multiparameter smFRET experiments that spans all dimensions of the experimental data. Finally, we propose a workflow for the analysis and show examples that demonstrate the usefulness of this toolkit for dynamic structural biology.},

This leads to a scaling that is at most cubic in system size with trivial parallelization of the calculation. We apply this new method to calculate the spectra and electronic density of the dominant excitons of a carbon-nanohoop bound fullerene system with 520 electrons using less than 4000 core hours.},

Herein, we demonstrate the bottom-up synthesis of well-organized covalent-organic frameworks doped by nitrogen atoms on an Ag(111) substrate. Using high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy and non-contact atomic force microscopy, the atomic structures of the intermediate metal–organic frameworks and the final covalent-organic frameworks are clearly identified. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy characterization reveals that the electronic bandgap of the as-formed N-doped covalent-organic framework is 2.45 eV, in qualitative agreement with the theoretical calculations. The calculated band structure together with the projected density of states analysis clearly unveils that the incorporation of nitrogen atoms into the covalent-organic framework backbone will remarkably tune the bandgap owing to the fact that the foreign nitrogen atom has one more electron than the carbon atom. Such covalent-organic frameworks may offer an atomic-scale understanding of the local electronic structure of heteroatom-doped covalent-organic frameworks and hold great promise for all relevant wide bandgap semiconductor technologies, for example, electronics, photonics, high-power and high-frequency devices, and solar energy conversion.},

For magnetic properties, this necessitates generalizations to ensure gauge invariance. In most implementations, τ is generalized by incorporating the external magnetic field. However, this introduces artifacts in the response of the density matrix and does not satisfy the iso-orbital constraint. Here, we extend previous approaches based on the current density to paramagnetic nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) shieldings and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) g-tensors. The impact is assessed for main-group compounds and transition-metal complexes considering 25 density functional approximations. It is shown that the current density leads to substantial improvements—especially for the popular Minnesota and strongly constrained and appropriately normed (SCAN) functional families. Thus, we strongly recommend to use the current density generalized τ in paramagnetic NMR and EPR calculations with meta-GGAs.},

In this work, the impact of PQD weight ratio, PQD concentration, and host solvent polarity during cation exchange is comprehensively investigated for the first time. In addition, the whole exchange process under varying conditions is monitored by photoluminescence spectroscopy. As a result, we observe extremely fast cation exchange (∼20 min) under a condition at a CsPbI 3 /FAPbI 3 PQD weight ratio of 1:1, a concentration of 70 mg/ml, and a host solvent using toluene. Moreover, we directly fabricate a PQD solar cell device using these obtained mixed cation Cs 0.5 FA 0.5 PbI 3 PQDs and achieved an enhanced power conversion efficiency of 14.58\%.

Our findings demonstrate that a more precise energy dissipation estimation can be obtained by enhancing the sensitivity of the biochemical oscillations.

In order to account for the effects of orientation, we introduce two- and three-body orientation-dependent particle-centered descriptors for systems composed of rod-like particles. To demonstrate the suitability of the proposed functions, we use an efficient feature selection scheme and simple linear regression to construct coarse-grained many-body interaction potentials for computationally efficient simulations of model systems consisting of colloidal particles with an anisotropic shape: mixtures of colloidal rods and non-adsorbing polymer coils, hard rods enclosed by an elastic microgel shell, and ligand-stabilized nanorods. We validate the machine-learning (ML) effective many-body potentials based on orientation-dependent symmetry functions by using them in direct coexistence simulations to map out the phase behavior of colloidal rods and non-adsorbing polymer coils. We find good agreement with the results obtained from simulations of the true binary mixture, demonstrating that the effective interactions are well described by the orientation-dependent ML potentials.},

  abstract = {We investigate the aging behavior in a well-studied model system comprised of a colloidal suspension of thermoreversible adhesive hard spheres (AHS) but thermally quenched below the gel transition to much larger depths than previously studied. The aging behavior in the model AHS system is monitored by small amplitude oscillatory shear rheology measurements conducted while rapidly quenching from the liquid state at 40 °C to a temperature below the gel temperature, and new, anomalous aging behaviors are observed. Shallow quenches lead to monotonic development of the elastic modulus with time, consistent with prior reports for the development of a homogeneous gel [Gordon et al. , J. Rheol. 61 , 23–34 (2017)]. However, for deeper quenches, a unique and new phenomenon is reported, namely, after an initial rise in the modulus, a reproducible drop in the modulus is observed, followed by a plateau in the modulus value. This drop can be gradual or sudden and the extent of the drop depends on the quench depth. After this drop in the modulus, AHS gel evolves toward a quench-path independent state over the experimental timescale. These effects of the extent of quenching on aging behavior are hypothesized to be a consequence of quenching into different underlying thermodynamic states of colloidal gels and the possible influence of the adhesive glass dynamical arrest for the deepest quenches. The research connects homogeneous gelation with heterogeneous gel formation due to phase separation and shows that the extent of quench can be used as an independent parameter to govern the rheological response of the arrested gel.},

  abstract = {We report the implementation of a symmetry-adapted perturbation theory algorithm based on a density functional theory [SAPT(DFT)] description of monomers. The implementation adopts a density-fitting treatment of hybrid exchange–correlation kernels to enable the description of monomers with hybrid functionals, as in the algorithm by Bukowski, Podeszwa, and Szalewicz [Chem. Phys. Lett. 414 , 111 (2005)]. We have improved the algorithm by increasing numerical stability with QR factorization and optimized the computation of the exchange–correlation kernel with its 2-index density-fitted representation. The algorithm scales as O ( N 5 ) formally and is usable for systems with up to ∼3000 basis functions, as demonstrated for the C 60 –buckycatcher complex with the aug-cc-pVDZ basis set. The hybrid-kernel-based SAPT(DFT) algorithm is shown to be as accurate as SAPT(DFT) implementations based on local effective exact exchange potentials obtained from the local Hartree–Fock (LHF) method while avoiding the lower-scaling [ O ( N 4 )] but iterative and sometimes hard-to-converge LHF process. The hybrid-kernel algorithm outperforms Hartree–Fock-based SAPT (SAPT0) for the S66 test set, and its accuracy is comparable to the many-body perturbation theory based SAPT2+ approach, which scales as O ( N 7 ), although SAPT2+ exhibits a more narrow distribution of errors.},

  abstract = {The Cassie–Baxter state of wetting explains a large equilibrium contact angle and the slippery dynamics of a water droplet on a superhydrophobic rough surface. It also causes a contact angle hysteresis (CAH) that cannot be fully described by dynamic wetting theories including the molecular kinetic theory (MKT). We analyze the contact line dynamics on a superhydrophobic surface in the framework of the MKT. Multi-body dissipative particle dynamics simulations of a capillary bridge confined between two rough surfaces under steady shear are performed. We find that, in addition to the contact line friction force from the MKT, an additional friction force contribution is needed on rough surfaces. It can be obtained by subtracting from the total friction force the force solely caused by the actual liquid–solid contact area. We find that the additional force is almost constant at all contact line velocities. Thus, it is directly related to the CAH. The CAH originates not only from contact line pinning but also from the shear flow due to the strong friction in the central region of the liquid–solid interface away from the contact line. The analysis of the particle flow inside the capillary bridge shows that liquid particles trapped in the grooves of the surface texture actually move with the same velocity as the surface and exert strong additional friction to other liquid particles. This work extends the MKT to rough surfaces, as well as to elucidate the origin of the CAH of a capillary bridge. The finding would help to better understand other situations of dynamic wetting on superhydrophobic surfaces.},

Many of its very peculiar properties are quite elusive, and in particular, obtaining good estimations of the diffusion coefficients of the solvated proton and hydroxide at a reasonable computational cost has been an unsolved challenge until now. Here, I present extensive results of several unusually long ab initio molecular dynamics (MD) simulations employing different combinations of the Born–Oppenheimer and second-generation Car–Parrinello MD propagation methods with different ensembles (NVE and NVT) and thermostats, which show that these methods together with the RPBE-D3 functional provide a very accurate estimation of the diffusion coefficients of the solvated H 3 O + and OH − ions, together with an extremely accurate description of several properties of neutral water (such as the structure of the liquid and its diffusion and shear viscosity coefficients). In addition, I show that the estimations of D H 3 O + and D OH − depend dramatically on the simulation length, being necessary to reach timescales in the order of hundreds of picoseconds to obtain reliable results.},

  abstract = {Predicting the asymmetric structure and dynamics of solvated hydroxide and hydronium in water from ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) has been a challenging task. The difficulty mainly comes from a lack of accurate and efficient exchange–correlation functional in elucidating the amphiphilic nature and the ubiquitous proton transfer behaviors of the two ions. By adopting the strongly constrained and appropriately normed (SCAN) meta-generalized gradient approximation functional in AIMD simulations, we systematically examine the amphiphilic properties, the solvation structures, the electronic structures, and the dynamic properties of the two water ions. In particular, we compare these results to those predicted by the PBE0-TS functional, which is an accurate yet computationally more expensive exchange–correlation functional. We demonstrate that the general-purpose SCAN functional provides a reliable choice for describing the two water ions. Specifically, in the SCAN picture of water ions, the appearance of the fourth and fifth hydrogen bonds near hydroxide stabilizes the pot-like shape solvation structure and suppresses the structural diffusion, while the hydronium stably donates three hydrogen bonds to its neighbors. We apply a detailed analysis of the proton transfer mechanism of the two ions and find the two ions exhibit substantially different proton transfer patterns. Our AIMD simulations indicate that hydroxide diffuses more slowly than hydronium in water, which is consistent with the experimental results.},

  abstract = {The hypothesis that the anomalous behavior of liquid water is related to the existence of a second critical point in deeply supercooled states has long been the subject of intense debate. Recent, sophisticated experiments designed to observe the transformation between the two subcritical liquids on nano- and microsecond time scales, along with demanding numerical simulations based on classical (rigid) models parameterized to reproduce thermodynamic properties of water, have provided support to this hypothesis. A stronger numerical proof requires demonstrating that the critical point, which occurs at temperatures and pressures far from those at which the models were optimized, is robust with respect to model parameterization, specifically with respect to incorporating additional physical effects. Here, we show that a liquid–liquid critical point can be rigorously located also in the WAIL model of water [Pinnick et al. , J. Chem. Phys. 137 , 014510 (2012)], a model parameterized using ab initio calculations only. The model incorporates two features not present in many previously studied water models: It is both flexible and polarizable, properties which can significantly influence the phase behavior of water. The observation of the critical point in a model in which the water–water interaction is estimated using only quantum ab initio calculations provides strong support to the viewpoint according to which the existence of two distinct liquids is a robust feature in the free energy landscape of supercooled water.},

We here propose to machine learn phase space averages, conventionally obtained by ab initio or force-field-based molecular dynamics (MD) or Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. In analogy to ab initio MD, our ab initio machine learning (AIML) model does not require bond topologies and, therefore, enables a general machine learning pathway to obtain ensemble properties throughout the chemical compound space. We demonstrate AIML for predicting Boltzmann averaged structures after training on hundreds of MD trajectories. The AIML output is subsequently used to train machine learning models of free energies of solvation using experimental data and to reach competitive prediction errors (mean absolute error ∼ 0.8 kcal/mol) for out-of-sample molecules—within milliseconds. As such, AIML effectively bypasses the need for MD or MC-based phase space sampling, enabling exploration campaigns of Boltzmann averages throughout the chemical compound space at a much accelerated pace. We contextualize our findings by comparison to state-of-the-art methods resulting in a Pareto plot for the free energy of solvation predictions in terms of accuracy and time.},

C 2 features a strong predissociative F 1 Π u − X 1 Σ g + electronic transition near 130 nm originally measured in 1969; however, no experimental studies of this transition have been carried out since, and theoretical studies of the F 1 Π u state are limited. In this work, potential energy curves of excited electronic states of C 2 are calculated with the aim of describing the predissociative nature of the F 1 Π u state and providing new ab initio photodissociation cross sections for astrochemical applications. Accurate electronic calculations of 56 singlet, triplet, and quintet states are carried out at the DW-SA-CASSCF/MRCI+Q level of theory with a CAS(8,12) active space and the aug-cc-pV5Z basis set augmented with additional diffuse functions. Photodissociation cross sections arising from the vibronic ground state to the F 1 Π u state are calculated by a coupled-channel model. The total integrated cross section through the F 1 Π u v = 0 and v = 1 bands is 1.198 × 10 −13 cm 2 cm −1 , giving rise to a photodissociation rate of 5.02 × 10 −10 s −1 under the standard interstellar radiation field, much larger than the rate in the Leiden photodissociation database.

  abstract = {The chemical model of matter consists of atoms held together by bonds. The success of this model implies that the physical interactions of the electrons and nuclei in molecules combine into compound interactions that create the bonding. In the quantum mechanical description, the modified atoms in molecules and the bonding synergism are contained in the molecular electronic wave function. So far, only part of this information has been recovered from the wave function. Notably, the atoms have remained unidentified in the wave function. One reason is that conventional energy decomposition analyses formulate separate model wave functions, independent of the actual wave function, to represent “prepared atoms” and preconceived interactions and, then, intuitively catenate the parts. In the present work, the embedded modified atoms and the inherent physical synergisms between them are determined by a unified derivation entirely from the actual molecular valence space wave function. By means of a series of intrinsic orbital and configurational transformations of the wave function, the energy of formation of a molecule is additively resolved in terms of intra-atomic energy changes, interference energies, and quasi-classical, non-classical, and charge-transfer Coulombic interactions. The analysis furnishes an algorithm for the quantitative resolution of the energy of formation, which enables analyses elucidating reaction energies.},

  abstract = {The extended-system adaptive biasing force (eABF) method and its newer variants offer rapid exploration of the configuration space of chemical systems. Instead of directly applying the ABF bias to collective variables, they are harmonically coupled to fictitious particles, which separates the problem of enhanced sampling from that of free energy estimation. The prevalent analysis method to obtain the potential of mean force (PMF) from eABF is thermodynamic integration. However, besides the PMF, most information is lost as the unbiased probability of visited configurations is never recovered. In this contribution, we show how statistical weights of individual frames can be computed using the Multistate Bennett’s Acceptance Ratio (MBAR), putting the post-processing of eABF on one level with other frequently used sampling methods. In addition, we apply this formalism to the prediction of nuclear magnetic resonance shieldings, which are very sensitive to molecular geometries and often require extensive sampling. The results show that the combination of enhanced sampling by means of extended-system dynamics with the MBAR estimator is a highly useful tool for the calculation of ensemble properties. Furthermore, the extension of the presented scheme to the recently published Gaussian-accelerated molecular dynamics eABF hybrid is straightforward and approximation free.},

Phys. 150 , 134108 (2019)] is analyzed with the double purpose of developing the mathematical tools and concepts needed to describe these expansions at general order and to identify the factors that define the rate of convergence of CP series. To this end, the CP energy, amplitude, and Lagrangian multiplier equations as a function of the perturbation strength are developed. By determining the critical points, defined as the perturbation strengths for which the Jacobian becomes singular, the rate of convergence and the intruder and critical states are determined for five small molecules: BH, CO, H 2 O, NH 3 , and HF. To describe the patterns of convergence for these expansions at orders lower than the high-order asymptotic limit, a model is developed where the perturbation corrections arise from two critical points. It is shown that this model allows for rationalization of the behavior of the perturbation corrections at much lower order than required for the onset of the asymptotic convergence. For the H 2 O, CO, and HF molecules, the pattern and rate of convergence are defined by critical states where the Fock-operator underestimates the excitation energies, whereas the pattern and rate of convergence for BH are defined by critical states where the Fock-operator overestimates the excitation energy. For the NH 3 molecule, both forms of critical points are required to describe the convergence behavior up to at least order 25.},

  abstract = {We have extended cluster perturbation (CP) theory to comprehend the Lagrangian framework of coupled cluster (CC) theory and derived the CP Lagrangian energy series ( L CP ) where the 2 n + 1/2 n + 2 rules for the cluster amplitudes and multipliers are used to get the energy corrections. We have also developed the variational CP ( L C P ) series, where the total cluster amplitudes and multipliers are determined through the same orders as in the L CP series, but the energy is obtained by inserting the total cluster amplitudes and multipliers in the Lagrangian. The energies of the L C P series have errors that are bilinear in the errors of the total cluster amplitudes and multipliers. Test calculations have been performed for S(D) and SD(T) orbital excitation spaces. With the exception of molecular systems that have a low lying doubly excited state compared to the electronic ground state configuration, we find that the fourth order models L C P S ( D −4) , L C P S D ( T −4) , and L CPSD ( T −4) give energies of CC target state quality. For the L C P S ( D −4) model, CC target state quality is obtained as the L C P S ( D −4) calculation determines more than 99.7\% of the coupled cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) correlation energy as the numerical deviations of the L C P S ( D −4) energy from the CCSD energy were more than an order of magnitude smaller than the triples correlation contribution. For the L C P S D ( T −4) and L CPSD ( T −4) models, CC target state quality was obtained, given that the L C P S D ( T −4) and L CPSD ( T −4) calculations recover more than 99\% of the coupled cluster singles doubles and triples (CCSDT) correlation contribution and as the numerical deviations of the L C P S D ( T −4) and L CPSD ( T −4) energies from the CCSDT energy were nearly and order of magnitude smaller than the quadruples correlation contribution. We, thus, suggest that the fourth order models may replace the full target CC models with no or very limited loss of accuracy.},

  abstract = {Fast evolution of modern society stimulates intense development of new materials with novel functionalities in energy and environmental applications. Due to rapid progress of computer science, computational design of materials with target properties has recently attracted a lot of interest. Accurate and efficient calculation of fundamental thermodynamic properties, including redox potentials, acidity constants, and solvation free energies, is of great importance for selection and design of desirable materials. Free energy calculation based on ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) can predict these properties with high accuracy at complex environments, however, they are being impeded by high computational costs. To address this issue, this work develops an automated scheme that combines iterative training of machine learning potentials (MLPs) and free energy calculation and demonstrates that these thermodynamic properties can be computed by ML accelerated MD with ab initio accuracy and a much longer time scale at cheaper costs, improving poor statistics and convergence of numerical integration by AIMD. Our automated scheme lays the foundation for computational chemistry-assisted materials design.},

  abstract = {The semilocal form of an exchange hole is highly useful in developing non-local range-separated hybrid density functionals for finite and extended systems. The way to construct the conventional exact exchange hole model is based on either the Taylor series expansion or the reverse engineering technique from the corresponding exchange energy functional. Although the latter technique is quite popular in the context of generalized gradient approximation (GGA) functionals, the same for the meta-GGA functionals is not so much explored. Thus, in this study, we propose a reverse-engineered semilocal exchange hole of a meta-GGA functional, which only depends on the meta-GGA ingredient α (also known as the Pauli kinetic energy enhancement factor). The model is subsequently used to design the short-range-separated meta-GGA hybrid density functional. We show that the present method can be successfully applied for several challenging problems in the context of solids, especially for which the GGA based hybrid fails drastically. This assessment proves that the present functional is quite useful for materials sciences. Finally, we also use this method for several molecular test cases, where the results are also as comparative as its base semilocal functional.},

  abstract = {We present a classical induction model to evaluate the three-body ion–water–water (I–W–W) and water–water–water (W–W–W) interactions in aqueous ionic systems. The classical description of the induction energy is based on electrostatic distributed multipoles up to hexadecapole and distributed polarizabilities up to quadrupole–quadrupole on the O and H atoms of water. The monatomic ions were described by a point charge and a dipole–dipole polarizability, while for the polyatomic ions, distributed multipoles up to hexadecapole and distributed polarizabilities up to quadrupole–quadrupole were used. The accuracy of the classical model is benchmarked against an accurate dataset of 936 (I–W–W) and 2184 (W–W–W) three-body terms for 13 different monatomic and polyatomic cation and anion systems. The classical model shows excellent agreement with the reference second order Moller–Plesset and coupled-cluster single double and perturbative triple [CCSD(T)] three-body energies. The Root-Mean-Square-Errors (RMSEs) for monatomic cations, monatomic anions, and polyatomic ions were 0.29, 0.25, and 0.12 kcal/mol, respectively. The corresponding RMSE for 1744 CCSD(T)/aVTZ three-body (W–W–W) energies, used to train MB-pol, was 0.12 kcal/mol. The accuracy of the proposed classical model demonstrates that the three-body term for aqueous ionic systems can be accurately modeled classically. This approach provides a fast, efficient, and as-accurate path toward modeling the three-body term in aqueous ionic systems that is fully transferable across systems with different ions without the need to fit to tens of thousands of ab initio calculations for each ion to extend existing many-body force fields to interactions between water and ions.},

  abstract = {The description of carrier dynamics in spatially confined semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs), which have enhanced electron–hole and exciton–phonon interactions, is a great challenge for modern computational science. These NCs typically contain thousands of atoms and tens of thousands of valence electrons with discrete spectra at low excitation energies, similar to atoms and molecules, that converge to the continuum bulk limit at higher energies. Computational methods developed for molecules are limited to very small nanoclusters, and methods for bulk systems with periodic boundary conditions are not suitable due to the lack of translational symmetry in NCs. This perspective focuses on our recent efforts in developing a unified atomistic model based on the semiempirical pseudopotential approach, which is parameterized by first-principle calculations and validated against experimental measurements, to describe two of the main nonradiative relaxation processes of quantum confined excitons: exciton cooling and Auger recombination. We focus on the description of both electron–hole and exciton–phonon interactions in our approach and discuss the role of size, shape, and interfacing on the electronic properties and dynamics for II–VI and III–V semiconductor NCs.},

  abstract = {We report fully quantum mechanical simulations of excitation energy transfer within the peripheral light harvesting complex (LH2) of Rhodopseudomonas molischianum at room temperature. The exciton–vibration Hamiltonian comprises the 16 singly excited bacteriochlorophyll states of the B850 (inner) ring and the 8 states of the B800 (outer) ring with all available electronic couplings. The electronic states of each chromophore couple to 50 intramolecular vibrational modes with spectroscopically determined Huang–Rhys factors and to a weakly dissipative bath that models the biomolecular environment. Simulations of the excitation energy transfer following photoexcitation of various electronic eigenstates are performed using the numerically exact small matrix decomposition of the quasiadiabatic propagator path integral. We find that the energy relaxation process in the 24-state system is highly nontrivial. When the photoexcited state comprises primarily B800 pigments, a rapid intra-band redistribution of the energy sharply transitions to a significantly slower relaxation component that transfers 90\% of the excitation energy to the B850 ring. The mixed character B850* state lacks the slow component and equilibrates very rapidly, providing an alternative energy transfer channel. This (and also another partially mixed) state has an anomalously large equilibrium population, suggesting a shift to lower energy by virtue of exciton–vibration coupling. The spread of the vibrationally dressed states is smaller than that of the eigenstates of the bare electronic Hamiltonian. The total population of the B800 band is found to decay exponentially with a 1/ e time of 0.5 ps, which is in good agreement with experimental results.},

An important and difficult challenge along the path toward this goal is to precisely predict how the structure of active systems is modified as their driving forces push them out of equilibrium. Here, we use tools from liquid-state theories to approach this challenge for a classic minimal active matter model. First, we construct a nonequilibrium mean-field framework that can predict the structure of systems of weakly interacting particles. Second, motivated by equilibrium solvation theories, we modify this theory to extend it with surprisingly high accuracy to systems of strongly interacting particles, distinguishing it from most existing similarly tractable approaches. Our results provide insight into spatial organization in strongly interacting out-of-equilibrium systems.},

  abstract = {Polymer crystallization has long been a fascinating problem and is still attracting many researchers. Most of the previous simulations are concentrated on clarifying the universal aspects of polymer crystallization using model linear polymers such as polyethylene. We are recently focusing on a nearly untouched but very interesting problem of chiral selecting crystallization in helical polymers. We previously proposed a stepwise approach using two kinds of helical polymers, simple “bare” helical polymers made of backbone atoms only such as polyoxymethylene (POM) and “general” helical polymers containing complicated side groups such as isotactic polypropylene. We have already reported on the crystallization in oligomeric POM-like helix but have observed only weak chiral selectivity during crystallization. In the present paper, we investigate the crystallization of sufficiently long POM-like polymer both from the isotropic melt and from the highly stretched melt. We find in both cases that the polymer shows a clear chiral selecting crystallization. Specifically, the observation of a single crystal growing from the isotropic melt is very illuminating. It shows that the crystal thickness and the crystal chirality are closely correlated; thicker crystals show definite chirality while thinner ones are mostly mixtures of the R- and the L-handed stems. The single crystal is found to have a marked lenticular shape, where the thinner growth front, since being made of the mixture, shows no chiral selectivity. The final chiral crystal is found to be completed through helix reversal processes within thicker regions.},

  abstract = {Oxygen plasma treatment is commonly used to sterilize gold nanoparticles by removing chemical contaminants from their surface while simultaneously inducing surface activation and functionalization of nanoparticles for biological, electrocatalytic, or electrochemical studies. In this study, we investigate the influence of oxygen plasma treatment on structural and localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) spectral changes of anisotropic gold nanorods (AuNRs) immobilized on an indium tin oxide (ITO) glass substrate. Unlike AuNRs deposited on a glass slide, no noticeable structural change or deformation of AuNRs on ITO was observed while increasing the oxygen plasma treatment time. This result indicates that ITO provides structural stability to AuNRs immobilized on its surface. Additionally, single-particle scattering spectra of AuNRs showed the broadening of LSPR linewidth within 60 s of oxygen plasma treatment as a result of the plasmon energy loss contributed from plasmon damping to ITO due to the removal of capping material from the AuNR surface. Nevertheless, an increase in the surface charge on the AuNR surface was observed by narrowing the LSPR linewidth after 180 s of plasma treatment. The electrochemical study of AuNRs immobilized on ITO electrodes revealed the surface activation and functionalization of AuNRs by increasing plasma treatment. Hence, in this study, a significant understanding of oxygen plasma treatment on AuNRs immobilized on ITO surfaces is provided.},

  abstract = {In this work, the distribution and partition behavior of ionic liquids (ILs) in nanopores with rough surfaces are investigated by a two-dimensional (2D) classical density functional theory model. The model is consistent with the equation of state that combines the perturbed-chain statistical associating fluid theory and the mean spherical approximation theory for bulk fluids. Its performance is verified by comparing the theoretical predictions with the results from molecular simulations. The fast Fourier transform and a hybrid iteration method of Picard iteration and Anderson mixing are used to efficiently obtain the solution of density profile for the sizable 2D system. The molecular parameters for IL-ions are obtained by fitting model predictions to experimental densities of bulk ILs. The model is applied to study the structure and partition of the ILs in nanopores. The results show that the peak of the density profile of counterions near a rough surface is much higher than that near a smooth surface. The adsorption of counterions and removal of co-ions are enhanced by surface roughness. Thus, the nanopore with a rough surface can store more charge. At low absolute surface potential, the partition coefficient for ions on rough surfaces is lower than that on smooth surfaces. At high absolute surface potential, increasing surface roughness leads to an increase in the partition coefficient for counterions and a decrease in the partition coefficient for co-ions.},

  abstract = {The glass formation ability of an alloy depends on two competing processes: glass-transition, on one hand, and crystal nucleation and growth, on the other hand. While these phenomena have been widely studied before in nearly equiatomic Cu–Zr alloys, studies are lacking for solute/solvent-rich ones. In the present work, molecular dynamics simulations show that the addition of a small amount of Zr (1–10 at.\%) to Cu drastically increases the incubation time and slows down crystal growth, thus, leading to an improved glass forming ability. The crystal nucleation and growth processes of a competing face-centered cubic (FCC) Cu crystalline phase are analyzed in detail. In particular, the values of the critical cooling rate, incubation period for crystallization, and growth rate of FCC Cu crystals in these Cu-rich alloys are obtained. The growth of a supersaturated FCC Cu solid solution is found to be polymorphic at the interface (except for alloys with 9 and 10 at.\% Zr) though a Zr concentration gradient is observed within growing crystals at high enough Zr content. The crystal growth rate before crystal impingement is nearly constant in all alloys, though it decreases exponentially with the Zr content. Crystallization kinetics are also analyzed within the existing theories and compared with the experimental values available in the literature.},

In particular, we focus on the calculation of vaporization enthalpies and entropies of seven organic liquids, compare two computational approaches for their calculation, and investigate how these properties are affected by changes in the experimental input data. It is observed that the vaporization enthalpies and entropies show a smooth dependence on changes in the reference density and boiling point. The reference density is found to have only a small influence on the vaporization thermodynamics, whereas the boiling point has a large influence on the vaporization enthalpy but only a small influence on the vaporization entropy. Furthermore, we employed the Gauss--Hermite estimator in order to quantify the uncertainty in thermodynamic functions that stems from inaccuracies in the experimental reference data for the example of the vaporization enthalpy of ( R )-butan-2-ol. We quantify the uncertainty as 30.95 · 10 −3 kJ mol −1 . In addition, we compare the convergence behavior and computational effort of the Gauss–Hermite estimator with the Monte Carlo approach and show the superiority of the former. Using this study, we present how uncertainty quantification can be applied to examples from theoretical chemistry.},

  abstract = {Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to determine the three-phase coexistence line of sI methane hydrates. The MD simulations were carried out at four different pressures (4, 10, 40, and 100 MPa) by using the direct phase coexistence method. In current simulations, water was described by either TIP4P/Ice or “optimal” point charge (OPC) models and methane was described as a simple Lennard-Jones interaction site. Lorentz–Berthelot (LB) combining rules were used to calculate the parameters of the cross interactions. For the OPC model, positive deviations from the energetic LB rule were also considered based on the solubility of methane in water. For the TIP4P/Ice water model, the obtained three phase coexistence temperatures showed good agreement with experiment data at higher pressures, which is consistent with previous predictions. For the OPC water model, simulations using the classic and the modified LB parameters both showed negative deviations to the experimental values. Our results also indicated that the deviation of the T 3 prediction by the OPC model was not closely correlated with the predicted melting point of ice. At 4 MPa, the modified OPC model showed a better prediction of hydrate equilibrium temperature, even better than the prediction by TIP4P/Ice. Considering the relatively higher accuracy in biomolecular MD of the OPC model, it is suggested that this model may have a better performance in hydrate MD simulations of biomolecule-based additives.},

Machine learning-based interatomic potentials have shown promise in overcoming this challenge, unlike earlier embedded atom-based approaches. We introduce a relatively simple and inexpensive approach to develop, train, and validate a neural network-based, wide-ranging interatomic potential transferable across both temperature and pressure. This approach is based on training the potential at high pressures only in the liquid phase and on validating its transferability on the relatively easy-to-calculate cold compression curve. Our approach is demonstrated on the phase diagram of Rb for which we reproduce the cold compression curve over the Rb-I (BCC), Rb-II (FCC), and Rb-V (tI4) phases, followed by the high-pressure melting curve including the re-entry after the maximum and then the minimum at the triple liquid-FCC-BCC point. Furthermore, our potential is able to partially capture even the very recently reported liquid–liquid transition in Rb, indicating the utility of machine learning-based potentials.},

The reaction takes place via a two-step mechanism with the intermediacy of a diamond-core structure analogous to diborane. Good agreement was found between the simulated reaction features and experimental observations, which demonstrate slow kinetics and an equilibrium process for boron species and dimer formation in the case of aluminum-halides. This computational and theoretical study also reveals and quantifies the effect of resonance on the thermodynamic stability of the central intermediate and conceptualizes the extreme stability difference (∼50 kcal mol −1 ) between boron and aluminum diamond-core bridge structures. Through an interaction energy decomposition analysis in combination with electronic structure analyses, we revealed that, beyond the resonance stabilization in free boron-halides, superior electrostatics in aluminum-halides results in the different reactivities, i.e., dimer formation for the latter species whereas substituent exchange for the former ones.},

Two propensity rules for the distribution of the products found in current experiments have been checked, and the mechanism underlying these product-state distributions is explored. Particularly, two main intriguing transition pathways are identified, which may be responsible for the nonlinear distribution of the products vs their respective rotational quantum number. In addition, the TBR rates of these systems are also influenced by details of the interaction potential and relevant nonadiabatic couplings.},

There are no prior measurements for comparison. To check this value and enable reliable extrapolation to other temperatures, we also compute thermal rate constants for this process over the temperature range 298–3000 K via multi-structural canonical variational transition-state theory with small-curvature multidimensional tunneling (MS-CVT/SCT). The CVT/SCT rate constants are derived using a dual-level direct dynamics approach utilizing single-point CCSD(T)-F12b/cc-pVQZ-F12 energies—corrected for core-valence and scalar relativistic effects—and M06-2X/MG3S geometries, gradients, and Hessians—for all stationary and non-stationary points along the reaction path.

[J. Phys. Chem. C 123 , 10291–10299 (2019)] and three new complexes. We utilized local vibrational force constants derived from the local mode theory as a quantitative measure of bond strength complemented with the topological analysis of the electron density and the natural bond orbital analysis. Loftus et al. suggested that nitrile dissociation occurs after light induced singlet–triplet transition of the original complexes and they used as a measure of nitrile release efficiency quantum yields for ligand exchange in water. They observed larger quantum yields for complexes with smaller singlet–triplet energy gaps. The major goal of this work was to assess how the Ru–NC and Ru–L bond strengths in these 15 compounds relate to and explain the experimental data of Loftus et al. , particularly focusing on the question whether there is a direct correlation between Ru–NC bond strength and measured quantum yield. Our study provides the interesting result that the compounds with the highest quantum yields also have the strongest Ru–NC bonds suggesting that breaking the Ru–NC bond is not the driving force for the delivery process rather than the change of the metal framework as revealed by first results of a unified reaction valley approach investigation of the mechanism. Compounds with the highest quantum yield show larger electronic structure changes upon singlet–triplet excitation, i.e., larger changes in bond strength, covalency, and difference between the singlet and triplet HOMOs, with exception of the compound 12. In summary, this work provides new insights into the interplay of local properties and experimental quantum yields forming in synergy a useful tool for fine tuning of existing and future design of new nitrile releasing ruthenium compounds. We hope that this work will bring theoretical and experimental studies closer together and serves as an incubator for future collaboration between computational chemists and their experimental colleagues.},

  abstract = {We demonstrate the first phase stable measurement of a third-order 2Q spectrum using a pulse shaper in the pump–probe geometry. This measurement was achieved by permuting the time-ordering of the pump pulses, thus rearranging the signal pathways that are emitted in the probe direction. The third-order 2Q spectrum is self-heterodyned by the probe pulse. Using this method, one can interconvert between a 1Q experiment and a 2Q experiment by simply reprogramming a pulse shaper or delay stage. We also measure a fifth-order absorptive 2Q spectrum in the pump–probe geometry, which contains similar information as a third-order experiment but does not suffer from dispersive line shapes. To do so, we introduce methods to minimize saturation-induced artifacts of the pulse shaper, improving fifth-order signals. These techniques add new capabilities for 2D spectrometers that use pulse shapers in the pump–probe beam geometry.},

  abstract = {A new heteronuclear decoupling pulse sequence is introduced, dubbed ROtor-Synchronized Phase-Alternated Cycles (ROSPAC). It is based on a partial refocusing of the coherences (spin operator products or cross-terms) [Filip et al. , J. Mag. Reson. 176 , 2 (2005)] responsible for transverse spin-polarization dephasing, on the irradiation of a large pattern of radio-frequencies, and on a significant minimization of the cross-effects implying 1 H chemical-shift anisotropy. Decoupling efficiency is analyzed by numerical simulations and experiments and compared to that of established decoupling sequences [swept-frequency two-pulse phase-modulated (TPPM), TPPM, small phase incremental alternation (SPINAL), refocused Continuous-wave (CW Apa ), and Rotor-Synchronized Hahn-Echo pulse train (RS-HEPT)]. It was found that ROSPAC offers good 1 H offset robustness for a large range of chemical shifts and low radio-frequency (RF) powers, and performs very well in the ultra-fast magic-angle spinning (MAS) regime, where it is almost independent from RF power and permits it to avoid rotary-resonance recoupling conditions ( v 1 = nv r , n = 1, 2). It has the advantage that only the pulse lengths require optimization and has a low duty cycle in the pulsed decoupling regime. The efficiency of the decoupling sequence is demonstrated on a model microcrystalline sample of the model protein domain GB 1 at 100 kHz MAS at 18.8 T.},

Herein, we propose a method for classical molecular dynamics simulations to deal with electrochemical interfaces with polarizable electrodes under the open circuit condition. Less attention has been given to electrochemical circuit conditions in computation despite being often essential for a proper assessment, especially comparison between different models. The present method is based on the chemical potential equalization principle, as is a method developed previously to deal with systems under the closed circuit condition. These two methods can be interconverted through the Legendre transformation so that the difference in the circuit conditions can be compared on the same footing. Furthermore, the electrode polarization effect can be correctly studied by comparing the present method with conventional simulations with the electrodes represented by fixed charges, since both of the methods describe systems under the open circuit condition. The method is applied to a parallel-plate capacitor composed of platinum electrodes and an aqueous electrolyte solution. The electrode polarization effects have an impact on the interfacial structure of the electrolyte solution. We found that the difference in circuit conditions significantly affects the dynamics of the electrolyte solution. The electric field at the charged electrode surface is poorly screened by the nonequilibrium solution structure in the open circuit condition, which accelerates the motion of the electrolyte solution.},

The example of H 3 + is studied, which is an ( E + A ) × ( e + a ) Jahn–Teller and Pseudo-Jahn–Teller system. The PIP-NN diabatic ansatz is based on the symmetric polynomial expansion of Viel and Eisfeld, the coefficients of which are expressed with neural network functions that take permutation-invariant polynomials as input. This PIP-NN-based diabatic ansatz not only preserves the correct symmetry but also provides functional flexibility to accurately reproduce ab initio electronic structure data, thus resulting in excellent fits. The adiabatic energies, energy gradients, and derivative couplings are well reproduced. A good description of the local topology of the conical intersection seam is also achieved. Therefore, this diabatic ansatz completes the PIP-NN based representation of DPEM with correct symmetries and will enable us to diabatize even more complicated systems with complex symmetries.},

While a number of recent studies have reported success in predicting chemical reaction activation energies, less attention has been focused on how the accuracy of ML predictions filters through to predictions of macroscopic observables. Here, we consider the impact of the uncertainty associated with ML prediction of activation energies on observable properties of chemical reaction networks, as given by microkinetics simulations based on ML-predicted reaction rates. After training an ANN to predict activation energies, given standard molecular descriptors for reactants and products alone, we performed microkinetics simulations of three different prototypical reaction networks: formamide decomposition, aldol reactions, and decomposition of 3-hydroperoxypropanal. We find that the kinetic modeling predictions can be in excellent agreement with corresponding simulations performed with ab initio calculations, but this is dependent on the inherent energetic landscape of the networks. We use these simulations to suggest some guidelines for when ML-based activation energies can be reliable and when one should take more care in applications to kinetics modeling.},

  abstract = {A fundamental way to analyze complex multidimensional stochastic dynamics is to describe it as diffusion on a free energy landscape—free energy as a function of reaction coordinates (RCs). For such a description to be quantitatively accurate, the RC should be chosen in an optimal way. The committor function is a primary example of an optimal RC for the description of equilibrium reaction dynamics between two states. Here, additive eigenvectors (addevs) are considered as optimal RCs to address the limitations of the committor. An addev master equation for a Markov chain is derived. A stationary solution of the equation describes a sub-ensemble of trajectories conditioned on having the same optimal RC for the forward and time-reversed dynamics in the sub-ensemble. A collection of such sub-ensembles of trajectories, called stochastic eigenmodes, can be used to describe/approximate the stochastic dynamics. A non-stationary solution describes the evolution of the probability distribution. However, in contrast to the standard master equation, it provides a time-reversible description of stochastic dynamics. It can be integrated forward and backward in time. The developed framework is illustrated on two model systems—unidirectional random walk and diffusion.},

This study focused on the effect of dynamical electron correlation on the spectroscopic constants ( R e , ω e , D e ), and potential energy curves, Δ E ( R ), of the covalently bound AH and AF molecules, A = B–F. The changes in the spectroscopic constants (Δ R e , Δω e , Δ D e ) caused by dynamical correlation are erratic and, at times, even surprising. These changes can be understood based on the dependence of the dynamical electron correlation energies of the AH and AF molecules as a function of the bond distance, i.e., Δ E DEC ( R ). At large R , the magnitude of Δ E DEC ( R ) increases nearly exponentially with decreasing R , but this increase slows as R continues to decrease and, in many cases, even reverses at very short R . The changes in Δ E DEC ( R ) in the region around R e were as unexpected as they were surprising, e.g., distinct minima and maxima were found in the curves of Δ E DEC ( R ) for the most polar molecules. The variations in Δ E DEC ( R ) for R ≲ R e are directly correlated with major changes in the electronic structure of the molecules as revealed by a detailed analysis of the spin-coupled generalized valence bond wave function. The results reported here indicate that we have much to learn about the nature of dynamical electron correlation and its effect on chemical bonds and molecular properties and processes.},

Three approaches are used and compared with each other. The He time-dependent density functional theory method considers the droplet as a continuous medium and accounts for its superfluid character. The ring-polymer molecular dynamics method uses a path-integral description of nuclear motion and incorporates zero-point delocalization while bosonic exchange effects are ignored. Finally, the zero-point averaged dynamics approach is a mixed quantum–classical method in which quantum delocalization is described by attaching a frozen wavefunction to each He atom, equivalent to classical dynamics with effective interaction potentials. All three methods predict that the growth of argon clusters is significantly hindered by the helium host droplet due to the impeding shell structure around the dopants and kinematic effects freezing the growing cluster in metastable configurations. The effects of superfluidity are qualitatively manifested by different collision dynamics of the heliophilic atom at high velocities, as well as quadrupole oscillations that are not seen with particle-based methods, for droplets experiencing a collision with cesium atoms or merging with each other.},

Here, we study the assembly kinetics of such fibers using kinetic Monte Carlo simulation. We focus on the initial lag time of these highly stochastic processes, during which self-assembly is very slow. The lag time distributions turn out to be similar for two very different regimes of polymerization, namely, (a) when polymerization is slow and depolymerization is fast and (b) the opposite case, when polymerization is fast and depolymerization is slow.

Here, the work is defined by the change in energy from a steady state to another state under a time-dependent perturbation. In particular, the work for a quasi-static change is regarded as thermodynamic work. We employ a system–bath model that involves time-dependent perturbations in both the system and the system–bath interaction. We conduct numerical experiments for a three-stroke heat machine (a Kelvin–Planck cycle). For this purpose, we employ the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) approach. These experiments involve an adiabatic transition field that describes the operation of an adiabatic wall between the system and the bath. Thermodynamic–work diagrams for external fields and their conjugate variables, similar to the P –V diagram, are introduced to analyze the work done for the system in the cycle. We find that the thermodynamic efficiency of this machine is zero because the field for the isothermal processes acts as a refrigerator, whereas that for the adiabatic wall acts as a heat engine. This is a numerical manifestation of the Kelvin–Planck statement, which states that it is impossible to derive the mechanical effects from a single heat source. These HEOM simulations serve as a rigorous test of thermodynamic formulations because the second law of thermodynamics is only valid when the work involved in the operation of the adiabatic wall is treated accurately.},

This has allowed us to provide a satisfactory description of molecular systems in triplet states following two methods. One of them adds hydrogen atoms at an infinite distance of the triplet system studied, constituting a singlet supersystem. The energies and reduced density matrices of the triplet system are obtained by removing the contributions of the added atoms from the singlet supersystem results. The second procedure involves variational determination of the two-electron reduced density matrices corresponding to the triplet systems by means of adequate couplings of basis-set functions. Both models have been studied by imposing N -representability conditions on the reduced density matrix calculations.

  abstract = {The spectroscopy of the four-carbon Criegee intermediate, methyl vinyl ketone oxide (MVK-oxide), following UV excitation to the B state (corresponding to the first π * ← π electronic transition), is studied theoretically, which relied on a single reference electronic wave function and a quantum dynamical approach for the nuclear motion. Two interacting electronic states B A ′ 1 and C A ′ 1 ⁠ , together with two nuclear degrees of freedom (O–O stretching and C–O–O bending modes), are considered in the dynamical approach. The computed absorption spectrum is found to agree well with the available experimental recordings. The existence of the weak oscillatory structures in the absorption spectrum is argued likely due to the fact that the excitation energy range of the first π * ← π electronic transition is below the energy barrier of the diabatic B state ( ⁠ ∼ 215 nm) and, thus, below the sufficiently deep well occurring at the intermediate O–O distances. This suggests the recurrences of the wavepacket, which might be considered the origin of the weak oscillatory structures in the absorption spectrum. The computed electronic excitation profile of MVK-oxide is predicted to peak at 373 nm.},

Examples may be provided by self-propelled droplets, gliding bacteria stochastically reversing their propulsion direction, or nonpolar vibrated hoppers. The magnitude of active forcing is regarded as constant, and we include the effect of inertial contributions. Interestingly, this situation can formally be mapped to stochastic motion under (dry, solid) Coulomb friction, however, with a negative friction parameter. Diffusion coefficients are calculated by formal mapping to the situation of a quantum-mechanical harmonic oscillator exposed to an additional repulsive delta-potential.

  abstract = {Chemical relaxation phenomena, including photochemistry and electron transfer processes, form a vigorous area of research in which nonadiabatic dynamics plays a fundamental role. However, for electronic systems with spin degrees of freedom, there are few if any applicable and practical quasiclassical methods. Here, we show that for nonadiabatic dynamics with two electronic states and a complex-valued Hamiltonian that does not obey time-reversal symmetry (as relevant to many coupled nuclear-electronic-spin systems), the optimal semiclassical approach is to generalize Tully’s surface hopping dynamics from coordinate space to phase space. In order to generate the relevant phase-space adiabatic surfaces, one isolates a proper set of diabats, applies a phase gauge transformation, and then diagonalizes the total Hamiltonian (which is now parameterized by both R and P ). The resulting algorithm is simple and valid in both the adiabatic and nonadiabatic limits, incorporating all Berry curvature effects. Most importantly, the resulting algorithm allows for the study of semiclassical nonadiabatic dynamics in the presence of spin–orbit coupling and/or external magnetic fields. One expects many simulations to follow as far as modeling cutting-edge experiments with entangled nuclear, electronic, and spin degrees of freedom, e.g., experiments displaying chiral-induced spin selectivity.},

A theoretical framework is devised to decompose the eigenvalues of ENM Hessian into contributions from individual springs and to compute the sensitivities of positional fluctuations and covariances to spring constant variation. Our linear perturbation approach quantifies the response mechanisms as softness modulation and orientation shift. All contacts of C α positions in SC-ENM have an identical spring constant by fitting the profile of root-of-mean-squared-fluctuation calculated from an all-atom MD simulation, and the same trajectory data are also used to compute the specific spring constant of each contact as an MD-ENM edge weight. We illustrate that the soft-mode reorganization can be understood in terms of gaining weights along the structural contacts of low elastic strengths and loosing magnitude along those of high rigidities. With the diverse mechanical strengths encoded in protein dynamics, MD-ENM is found to have more pronounced long-range couplings and sensitivity responses with orientation shift identified as a key player in driving the specific residues to have high sensitivities. Furthermore, the responses of perturbing the springs of different residues are found to have asymmetry in the action–reaction relationship. In understanding the mutation effects on protein functional properties, such as long-range communications, our results point in the directions of collective motions as a major effector.},

Our simulations are motivated by bacterial microcompartments, which are protein shells found in bacteria that assemble around a complex of enzymes and other components involved in certain metabolic processes. The simulations demonstrate that the relative interaction strengths among the different cargo species play a key role in determining the amount of each species that is encapsulated, their spatial organization, and the nature of the shell assembly pathways. However, the shell protein–shell protein and shell protein–cargo component interactions that help drive assembly and encapsulation also influence cargo composition within certain parameter regimes. These behaviors are governed by a combination of thermodynamic and kinetic effects. In addition to elucidating how natural microcompartments encapsulate multiple components involved within reaction cascades, these results have implications for efforts in synthetic biology to colocalize alternative sets of molecules within microcompartments to accelerate specific reactions. More broadly, the results suggest that coupling between self-assembly and multicomponent liquid–liquid phase separation may play a role in the organization of the cellular cytoplasm.},

The diffusion coefficients were measured directly, i.e., without any model assumptions, by pulsed field gradient nuclear magnetic resonance (PFG-NMR). We find that the diffusion coefficient decreases, as expected, with an increase in both DNA strand length and gel concentration. In addition, we performed Monte Carlo simulations of particle diffusion in a model network of polymer chains, considering our experimental conditions. Together, the Monte Carlo simulations and the PFG-NMR results show that the decrease in diffusion coefficients in the presence of the agarose gel is due to a temporary adhesion of the DNA molecules to the surface of gel fibers. The average adhesion time to a given gel fiber increases with the length of the DNA strands but is independent of the number of gel fibers. The corresponding magnitude of the binding enthalpies of DNA strands to gel fibers indicates that a mixture of van der Waals interactions and hydrogen bonding contributes to the decreased diffusion of DNA in agarose gels.},

  abstract = {Molecular photoswitches are widely used in photopharmacology, where the biomolecular functions are photo-controlled reversibly with high spatiotemporal precision. Despite the success of this field, it remains elusive how the protein environment modulates the photochemical properties of photoswitches. Understanding this fundamental question is critical for designing more effective light-regulated drugs with mitigated side effects. In our recent work, we employed first-principles non-adiabatic dynamics simulations to probe the effects of protein on the trans to cis photoisomerization of phototrexate (PTX), a photochromic analog of the anticancer therapeutic methotrexate that inhibits the target enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). Building upon this study, in this work, we employ multiscale simulations to unravel the full photocycle underlying the light-regulated reversible inhibition of DHFR by PTX, which remains elusive until now. First-principles non-adiabatic dynamics simulations reveal that the cis to trans photoisomerization quantum yield is hindered in the protein due to backward isomerization on the ground-state following non-adiabatic transition, which arises from the favorable binding of the cis isomer with the protein. However, free energy simulations indicate that cis to trans photoisomerization significantly decreases the binding affinity of the PTX. Thus, the cis to trans photoisomerization most likely precedes the ligand unbinding from the protein. We propose the most probable photocycle of the PTX-DHFR system. Our comprehensive simulations highlight the trade-offs among the binding affinity, photoisomerization quantum yield, and the thermal stability of the ligand&#39;s different isomeric forms. As such, our work reveals new design principles of light-regulated drugs in photopharmacology.},

  abstract = {The growth of a tissue, which depends on cell–cell interactions and biologically relevant processes such as cell division and apoptosis, is regulated by a mechanical feedback mechanism. We account for these effects in a minimal two-dimensional model in order to investigate the consequences of mechanical feedback, which is controlled by a critical pressure, p c . A cell can only grow and divide if its pressure, due to interaction with its neighbors, is less than p c . Because temperature is not a relevant variable, the cell dynamics is driven by self-generated active forces (SGAFs) that arise due to cell division. We show that even in the absence of intercellular interactions, cells undergo diffusive behavior. The SGAF-driven diffusion is indistinguishable from the well-known dynamics of a free Brownian particle at a fixed finite temperature. When intercellular interactions are taken into account, we find persistent temporal correlations in the force–force autocorrelation function (FAF) that extends over a timescale of several cell division times. The time-dependence of the FAF reveals memory effects, which increases as p c increases. The observed non-Markovian effects emerge due to the interplay of cell division and mechanical feedback and are inherently a non-equilibrium phenomenon.},

  abstract = {Intermolecular interactions in protein solutions, in general, contain many contributions. If short-range attractions dominate, the state diagram exhibits liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) that is metastable with respect to crystallization. In this case, the extended law of corresponding states (ELCS) suggests that thermodynamic properties are insensitive to details of the underlying interaction potential. Using lysozyme solutions, we investigate the applicability of the ELCS to the static structure factor and how far effective colloidal interaction models can help to rationalize the phase behavior and interactions of protein solutions in the vicinity of the LLPS binodal. The (effective) structure factor has been determined by small-angle x-ray scattering. It can be described by Baxter’s adhesive hard-sphere model, which implies a single fit parameter from which the normalized second virial coefficient b 2 is inferred and found to quantitatively agree with previous results from static light scattering. The b 2 values are independent of protein concentration but systematically vary with temperature and solution composition, i.e., salt and additive content. If plotted as a function of temperature normalized by the critical temperature, the values of b 2 follow a universal behavior. These findings validate the applicability of the ELCS to globular protein solutions and indicate that the ELCS can also be reflected in the structure factor.},

We report several important aspects of the capture process and subsequent translocation of a model DNA polymer through a solid-state nanopore in the presence of an extended electric field using the Brownian dynamics simulation that enables us to record statistics of the conformations at every stage of the translocation process. By releasing the equilibrated DNAs from different equipotentials, we observe that the capture time distribution depends on the initial starting point and follows a Poisson process. The field gradient elongates the DNA on its way toward the nanopore and favors a successful translocation even after multiple failed threading attempts. Even in the limit of an extremely narrow pore, a fully flexible chain has a finite probability of hairpin-loop capture, while this probability decreases for a stiffer chain and promotes single file translocation. Our in silico studies identify and differentiate characteristic distributions of the mean first passage time due to single file translocation from those due to translocation of different types of folds and provide direct evidence of the interpretation of the experimentally observed folds [M. Gershow and J. A. Golovchenko, Nat. Nanotechnol. 2 , 775 (2007) and Mihovilovic et al. , Phys. Rev. Lett. 110 , 028102 (2013)] in a solitary nanopore.

The obtained photocatalysts were characterized by XRD, XPS, diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, STEM, and time-resolved microwave conductivity (TRMC) methods. The photocatalytic activity was tested under UV/vis irradiation for (i) methanol dehydrogenation (during silver deposition), (ii) oxygen evolution with in situ silver deposition, and (iii) oxidative decomposition of acetic acid, as well as under vis irradiation for 2-propanol oxidation. The action spectra of 2-propanol oxidation were also performed. It has been confirmed that modification of titania with silver causes significant improvement of photocatalytic activity under both UV and vis irradiation as silver works as an electron scavenger (TRMC data) and vis activator (possibly by an energy transfer mechanism). The obtained activities differ between titania samples significantly, suggesting that the type of crystalline phase, particle/crystallite sizes, and electron traps’ density are crucial for both the properties of formed silver deposits and resultant photocatalytic activity. It might be concluded that, under UV irradiation, (i) high crystallinity and large specific surface area are recommended for rutile- and anatase-rich samples, respectively, during hydrogen evolution, (ii) mixed crystalline phases cause a high rate of oxygen evolution from water, and (iii) anatase phase with fine silver NPs results in efficient decomposition of acetic acid, whereas under vis irradiation the aggregated silver NPs (broad localized surface plasmon resonance peak) on the rutile phase are promising for oxidation reactions.},

A vital step for those plasmonic applications is the charge transfer at the metal–semiconductor interface. The effect of the light polarization on the charge transfer has not been theoretically investigated so far. Here, we take the Ag–TiO 2 system as a model system to study the polarization effect using time-dependent density functional theory simulations. We find that the charge transfer is sensitive to the light polarization, which has its origin in the polarization-dependent hot carrier distributions. For the linearly polarized light, it shows a sine-square dependence on the polar angle, indicating that the charge transfer response to the linear polarization can be decomposed into components perpendicular and parallel to the interface. We also find that there exists directional charge transfer with a circular light polarization. Our results demonstrate that the light polarization can significantly affect the charge transfer behavior and, thus, offer a new degree of freedom to manipulate the plasmonic applications.},

  abstract = {Stable glasses (SGs) are formed through surface-mediated equilibration (SME) during physical vapor deposition (PVD). Unlike intermolecular interactions, the role of intramolecular degrees of freedom in this process remains unexplored. Here, using experiments and coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that varying dihedral rotation barriers of even a single bond, in otherwise isomeric molecules, can strongly influence the structure and stability of PVD glasses. These effects arise from variations in the degree of surface mobility, mobility gradients, and mobility anisotropy, at a given deposition temperature ( T dep ). At high T dep , flexible molecules have access to more configurations, which enhances the rate of SME, forming isotropic SGs. At low T dep , stability is achieved by out of equilibrium aging of the surface layer. Here, the poor packing of rigid molecules enhances the rate of surface-mediated aging, producing stable glasses with layered structures in a broad range of T dep . In contrast, the dynamics of flexible molecules couple more efficiently to the glass layers underneath, resulting in reduced mobility and weaker mobility gradients, producing unstable glasses. Independent of stability, the flattened shape of flexible molecules can also promote in-plane orientational order at low T dep . These results indicate that small changes in intramolecular relaxation barriers can be used as an approach to independently tune the structure and mobility profiles of the surface layer and, thus, the stability and structure of PVD glasses.},

  abstract = {A molecular level understanding of metal/bulk water interface structure is key for a wide range of processes, including aqueous corrosion, which is our focus, but their buried nature makes experimental investigation difficult and we must mainly rely on simulations. We investigate the Mg(0001)/water interface using second generation Car–Parrinello molecular dynamics (MD) to gain structural information, combined with static density functional theory calculations to probe the atomic interactions and electronic structure (e.g., calculating the potential of zero charge). By performing detailed structural analyses of both metal–surface atoms and the near-surface water, we find that, among other insights: (i) water adsorption causes significant surface roughening (the planar distribution for top-layer Mg has two peaks separated by ≈ 0.6 A ̊ ⁠ ), (ii) strongly adsorbed water covers only ≈ 1 4 of available surface sites, and (iii) adsorbed water avoids clustering on the surface. Static calculations are used to gain a deeper understanding of the structuring observed in MD. For example, we use an energy decomposition analysis combined with calculated atomic charges to show that adsorbate clustering is unfavorable due to Coulombic repulsion between adsorption site surface atoms. Results are discussed in the context of previous simulations carried out on other metal/water interfaces. The largest differences for the Mg(0001)/water system appear to be the high degree of surface distortion and the minimal difference between the metal work function and metal/water potential of zero charge (at least compared to other interfaces with similar metal–water interaction strengths). The structural information, in this paper, is important for understanding aqueous Mg corrosion, as the Mg(0001)/water interface is the starting point for key reactions. Furthermore, our focus on understanding the driving forces behind this structuring leads to important insights for general metal/water interfaces.},

  abstract = {Atomically thin two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have shown great potential for optoelectronic applications, including photodetectors, phototransistors, and spintronic devices. However, the applications of TMD-based optoelectronic devices are severely restricted by their weak light absorption and short exciton lifetime due to their atomically thin nature and strong excitonic effect. To simultaneously enhance the light absorption and photocarrier lifetime of monolayer semiconductors, here, we report 3D/2D perovskite/TMD type II heterostructures by coupling solution processed highly smooth and ligand free CsPbBr 3 film with MoS 2 and WS 2 monolayers. By time-resolved spectroscopy, we show interfacial hole transfer from MoS 2 (WS 2 ) to the perovskite layer occurs in an ultrafast time scale (100 and 350 fs) and interfacial electron transfer from ultrathin CsPbBr 3 to MoS 2 (WS 2 ) in ∼3 (9) ps, forming a long-lived charge separation with a lifetime of &gt;20 ns. With increasing CsPbBr 3 thickness, the electron transfer rate from CsPbBr 3 to TMD is slower, but the efficiency remains to be near-unity due to coupled long-range diffusion and ultrafast interfacial electron transfer. This study indicates that coupling solution processed lead halide perovskites with strong light absorption and long carrier diffusion length to monolayer semiconductors to form a type II heterostructure is a promising strategy to simultaneously enhance the light harvesting capability and photocarrier lifetime of monolayer semiconductors.},

  abstract = {Providing a physically sound explanation of aging phenomena in non-equilibrium amorphous materials is a challenging problem in modern statistical thermodynamics. The slow evolution of physical properties after quenches of control parameters is empirically well interpreted via the concept of material time (or internal clock) based on the Tool–Narayanaswamy–Moynihan model. Yet, the fundamental reasons of its striking success remain unclear. We propose a microscopic rationale behind the material time on the basis of the linear laws of irreversible thermodynamics and its extension that treats the corresponding kinetic coefficients as state functions of a slowly evolving material state. Our interpretation is based on the recognition that the same mathematical structure governs both the Tool model and the recently developed non-equilibrium extension of the self-consistent generalized Langevin equation theory, guided by the universal principles of Onsager’s theory of irreversible processes. This identification opens the way for a generalization of the material-time concept to aging systems where several relaxation modes with very different equilibration processes must be considered, and partially frozen glasses manifest the appearance of partial ergodicity breaking and, hence, materials with multiple very distinct inner clocks.},

The sound dispersion of a monoatomic liquid up to qσ ≅ 2 was almost quantitatively explained by the viscoelasticity in the q = 0 limit when the wavenumber dependence of the heat capacity ratio was taken into account. The situation was similar for a polyatomic molecular liquid for which the intramolecular degrees of freedom were fixed.

  abstract = {Fluids confined in small volumes behave differently than fluids in bulk systems. For bulk systems, a compact summary of the system’s thermodynamic properties is provided by equations of state. However, there is currently a lack of successful methods to predict the thermodynamic properties of confined fluids by use of equations of state, since their thermodynamic state depends on additional parameters introduced by the enclosing surface. In this work, we present a consistent thermodynamic framework that represents an equation of state for pure, confined fluids. The total system is decomposed into a bulk phase in equilibrium with a surface phase. The equation of state is based on an existing, accurate description of the bulk fluid and uses Gibbs’ framework for surface excess properties to consistently incorporate contributions from the surface. We apply the equation of state to a Lennard-Jones spline fluid confined by a spherical surface with a Weeks–Chandler–Andersen wall-potential. The pressure and internal energy predicted from the equation of state are in good agreement with the properties obtained directly from molecular dynamics simulations. We find that when the location of the dividing surface is chosen appropriately, the properties of highly curved surfaces can be predicted from those of a planar surface. The choice of the dividing surface affects the magnitude of the surface excess properties and its curvature dependence, but the properties of the total system remain unchanged. The framework can predict the properties of confined systems with a wide range of geometries, sizes, interparticle interactions, and wall–particle interactions, and it is independent of ensemble. A targeted area of use is the prediction of thermodynamic properties in porous media, for which a possible application of the framework is elaborated.},

The tree-like structure of particle interactions forbids both nontrivial structural motifs and the emergence of a complex free-energy landscape leading to a thermodynamic glass transition, while the finite-dimensional nature of the model prevents the existence of a mode-coupling singularity. Nevertheless, the equilibrium relaxation dynamics is shown to be in excellent agreement with simulations performed in conventional glass-formers. Averaged time correlation functions display a phenomenology typical of supercooled liquids, including the emergence of an excess signal in relaxation spectra at intermediate frequencies. We show that this evolution is accompanied by strong signatures of collective and heterogeneous dynamics that cannot be interpreted in terms of single particle hopping and emerge from dynamic facilitation. Our study demonstrates that an off-lattice interacting particle model with extremely simple structural correlations displays quantitatively realistic glassy dynamics.},

In amorphous Si, a representative covalent amorphous solid, the presence of a medium-range order (MRO) has been intensively discussed. However, the specific atomic arrangement corresponding to the MRO and its relationship with physical properties, such as thermal conductivity, remains elusive. We solved this problem by combining topological data analysis, machine learning, and molecular dynamics simulations. Using persistent homology, we constructed a topological descriptor that can predict thermal conductivity. Moreover, from the inverse analysis of the descriptor, we determined the typical ring features correlated with both the thermal conductivity and MRO. The results could provide an avenue for controlling material characteristics through the topology of the nanostructures.},

Moreover, a careful comparison of the breakdown curves of fragments among the successive generations allowed to establish a decay sequence in the fragmentation of quinoline cation. This enabled us to revisit and refine the understanding of the first generation decay and reassign the origin of a few of the higher generation decay products of quinoline cation. With the help of the accompanying computational work (reported concurrently), we have demonstrated the dominance of two different HCN elimination pathways over previously interpreted mechanisms. For the first time, a specific pathway for acetylene elimination is identified in quinoline + and the role of isomerization in both acetylene as well as hydrogen cyanide loss is also demonstrated. The experiment also established that the acetylene elimination exclusively occurs from the non-nitrogen containing rings of quinoline cation. The formation of a few astronomically important species is also discussed.},

  abstract = {We present a new, novel implementation of the Many-Body Expansion (MBE) to account for the breaking of covalent bonds, thus extending the range of applications from its previous popular usage in the breaking of hydrogen bonds in clusters to molecules. A central concept of the new implementation is the in situ atomic electronic state of an atom in a molecule that casts the one-body term as the energy required to promote it to that state from its ground state. The rest of the terms correspond to the individual diatomic, triatomic, etc., fragments. Its application to the atomization energies of the XH n series, X = C, Si, Ge, Sn and n = 1–4, suggests that the (negative, stabilizing) 2-B is by far the largest term in the MBE with the higher order terms oscillating between positive and negative values and decreasing dramatically in size with increasing rank of the expansion. The analysis offers an alternative explanation for the purported “first row anomaly” in the incremental H n −1 X–H bond energies seen when these energies are evaluated with respect to the lowest energy among the states of the XH n molecules. Due to the “flipping” of the ground/first excited state between CH 2 ( 3 B 1 ground state, 1 A 1 first excited state) and XH 2 , X = Si, Ge, Sn ( 1 A 1 ground state, 3 B 1 first excited state), the overall picture does not exhibit a “first row anomaly” when the incremental bond energies are evaluated with respect to the molecular states having the same in situ atomic states.},

Ab initio calculations are carried out to quantitatively characterize its potential energy surface as a function of the two large amplitude ∠H 1 COH and ∠H 2 COH dihedral angles. It is shown that the radical displays a large amplitude torsional-like motion of its CH 2 group with respect to the OH group. The rotation–torsion levels computed with the help of a 4D Hamiltonian accounting for this torsional-like motion and for the overall rotation exhibit a tunneling splitting, in agreement with recent experimental investigations, and a strong rotational dependence of this tunneling splitting on the rotational quantum number K a due to the rotation–torsion Coriolis coupling. Based on an internal axis method approach, a fitting Hamiltonian accounting for tunneling effects and for the fine and hyperfine structure is built and applied to the fitting of the new (sub)-millimeter wave transitions measured in this work along with previously available high-resolution data. 778 frequencies and wavenumbers are reproduced with a unitless standard deviation of 0.79 using 27 parameters.

  abstract = {Fragmentation-based methods enable electronic structure calculations for large chemical systems through partitioning them into smaller fragments. Here, we have developed and benchmarked a dual exponential operator-based coupled cluster theory to account for high-rank electronic correlation of large chemical systems within the fragment molecular orbital (FMO) framework. Upon partitioning the molecular system into several fragments, the zeroth order reference determinants for each fragment and fragment pair are constructed in a self-consistent manner with two-body FMO expansion. The dynamical correlation is induced through a dual exponential ansatz with a set of fragment-specific rank-one and rank-two operators that act on the individual reference determinants. While the single and double excitations for each fragment are included through the conventional rank-one and rank-two cluster operators, the triple excitation space is spanned via the contraction between the cluster operators and a set of rank-two scattering operators over a few optimized fragment-specific occupied and virtual orbitals. Thus, the high-rank dynamical correlation effects within the FMO framework are computed with rank-one and rank-two parametrization of the wave operator, leading to significant reduction in the number of variables and associated computational scaling over the conventional methods. Through a series of pilot numerical applications on various covalent and non-covalently bonded systems, we have shown the quantitative accuracy of the proposed methodology compared to canonical, as well as FMO-based coupled-cluster single double triple. The accuracy of the proposed method is shown to be systematically improvable upon increasing the number of contractible occupied and virtual molecular orbitals employed to simulate triple excitations.},

Although the energetic consequences of the flat-planes are known, the underlying quantum phase transitions that occur when (spin)charge is redistributed have not been characterized. In this study, we use open subsystems to redistribute (spin)charges in the tilted Hubbard model by imposing suitable Lagrange constraints on the Hamiltonian. We computationally recover the flat-plane conditions and quantify the underlying quantum phase transitions using quantum entanglement measures. The resulting entanglement patterns quantify the phase transition that gives rise to the flat-plane conditions and quantify the complexity required to accurately describe charge redistributions in strongly correlated systems. Our study indicates that entanglement patterns can uncover those phase transitions that have to be modeled accurately if the delocalization and static correlation errors of approximate methods are to be reduced.},

We have used the Fourier transform (FT) of the spin densities to identify the “normal modes” of the electron dynamics. We observe an isomorphic relationship between the electron dynamics normal modes and the nuclear dynamics, seen in the vibrational normal modes. The FT spectra obtained this way show bands that are characteristic of the energy differences between the adiabatic hole states. These bands contain individual peaks that are in one-to-one correspondence with atom pair (+·) ↔ (·+) resonances, which, in turn, stimulate nuclear motion involving the atom pair. With such understanding, we anticipate “designer” coherent superpositions that can drive nuclear motion in a particular direction.},

This gives us a direct insight into finite-size effects, thereby, opening up the possibility for novel domain decompositions and methodological advances. In addition, we present unassailable numerical proof for an effective attraction between two electrons under moderate coupling conditions, without the mediation of an underlying ionic structure. Finally, we compare our exact PIMC results to effective potentials from linear-response theory, and we demonstrate their usefulness for the description of the dynamic structure factor.

One well-known advantage of inner projection methods, which we exploit in our implementation, is that one can avoid storing large V 3 O and V 4 arrays by instead considering three-index intermediates. Furthermore, our implementation does not require the formation and storage of Cholesky vector derivatives. The new implementation is shown to perform well, with less than 10\% of the time spent calculating the gradients in geometry optimizations. Furthermore, the computational time per optimization cycle is significantly lower compared to other implementations based on an inner projection method. We showcase the capabilities of the implementation by optimizing the geometry of the retinal molecule (C 20 H 28 O) at the CCSD/aug-cc-pVDZ level of theory.},

For the excess chemical potential, however, the early MSA formulations (which were widely adopted) only included the terms needed to compute the mean excess chemical potential (or the mean activity coefficient). Other terms for the chemical potential μ i of individual species i were not included because they sum to 0 in the mean chemical potential. Here, we derive these terms to give a complete MSA formulation of the chemical potential. The result is a simple additive term for μ i that we show is a qualitative improvement over the previous MSA version. In addition, our derivation shows that the MSA’s assumption of global charge neutrality is not strictly necessary, so that the MSA is also valid for systems close to neutrality.},

  abstract = {Polarization transfers are crucial building blocks in magnetic resonance experiments, i.e., they can be used to polarize insensitive nuclei and correlate nuclear spins in multidimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The polarization can be transferred either across different nuclear spin species or from electron spins to the relatively low-polarized nuclear spins. The former route occurring in solid-state NMR can be performed via cross polarization (CP), while the latter route is known as dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP). Despite having different operating conditions, we opinionate that both mechanisms are theoretically similar processes in ideal conditions, i.e., the electron is merely another spin-1/2 particle with a much higher gyromagnetic ratio. Here, we show that the CP and DNP processes can be described using a unified theory based on average Hamiltonian theory combined with fictitious operators. The intuitive and unified approach has allowed new insights into the cross-effect DNP mechanism, leading to better design of DNP polarizing agents and extending the applications beyond just hyperpolarization. We explore the possibility of exploiting theoretically predicted DNP transients for electron–nucleus distance measurements—such as routine dipolar-recoupling experiments in solid-state NMR.},

This method combines the input–output and the hierarchical equations of motion formalisms into a double hierarchy of density matrix equations. We show analytically that under weak field excitation relevant to natural photosynthesis conditions, an N-photon Fock state input and a corresponding coherent state input give rise to equal density matrices in the excited manifold. However, an N-photon Fock state input induces no off-diagonal coherence between the ground and excited subspaces, in contrast with the coherences created by a coherent state input. We derive expressions for the probability to absorb a single Fock state photon with or without the influence of phonons. For short pulses (or, equivalently, wide bandwidth pulses), we show that the absorption probability has a universal behavior that depends only upon a system-dependent effective energy spread parameter Δ and an exciton–light coupling constant Γ. This holds for a broad range of chromophore systems and for a variety of pulse shapes. We also analyze the absorption probability in the opposite long pulse (narrow bandwidth) regime. We then derive an expression for the long time emission rate in the presence of phonons and use it to study the difference between collective vs independent emission. Finally, we present a numerical simulation for the LHCII monomer (14-mer) system under single photon excitation that illustrates the use of the double hierarchy equations.},

  abstract = {Proton-transfer (PT) between organic complexes is a common and important biochemical process. Unfortunately, PT energy barriers are difficult to accurately predict using density functional theory (DFT); in particular, using the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) tends to underestimate PT barriers. Moreover, PT typically occurs in environments where dispersion forces contribute to the cohesion of the system; thus, a suitable exchange-correlation functional should accurately describe both dispersion forces and PT barriers. This paper provides benchmark results for the PT barriers of several density functionals, including several variants of the van der Waals density functional (vdW-DF). The benchmark set comprises small organic molecules with inter- and intra-molecular PT. The results show that replacing GGA correlation with a fully non-local vdW-DF correlation increases the PT barriers, making it closer to the quantum chemical reference values. In contrast, including non-local correlations with the Vydrov-Voorhis method or dispersion-corrections at the DFT-D3 or the Tkatchenko–Scheffler level has barely any impact on the PT barriers. Hybrid functionals also increase and improve the energies, resulting in an excellent performance of hybrid versions of vdW-DF-cx and vdW-DF2-B86R. For the formic acid dimer PT system, we analyzed the GGA exchange and non-local correlation contributions. The analysis shows that the repulsive part of the non-local correlation kernel plays a key role in the PT energy barriers predicted with vdW-DF.},

These parameters determine both the slope of the rectilinear diameter of the liquid–vapor binodal and the Zeno-element, which are the core ingredients of the fluid–LG isomorphism. We compare the Zeno-element parameters with the virial Zeno-line parameters, which are commonly used in the literature for the formulation of generalized law of the correspondent states. It is demonstrated that the Zeno-element parameters appear to be sensitive to the liquid state instability when the interaction potential becomes too short-ranged, while the virial ones do not show any peculiarities connected with this specific of the HCAYF.},

  abstract = {Antibodies are important biomolecules that are often designed to recognize target antigens. However, they are expensive to produce and their relatively large size prevents their transport across lipid membranes. An alternative to antibodies is aptamers, short ( ⁠ ∼ 15 − 60 bp) oligonucleotides (and amino acid sequences) with specific secondary and tertiary structures that govern their affinity to specific target molecules. Aptamers are typically generated via solid phase oligonucleotide synthesis before selection and amplification through Systematic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential enrichment (SELEX), a process based on competitive binding that enriches the population of certain strands while removing unwanted sequences, yielding aptamers with high specificity and affinity to a target molecule. Mathematical analyses of SELEX have been formulated in the mass action limit, which assumes large system sizes and/or high aptamer and target molecule concentrations. In this paper, we develop a fully discrete stochastic model of SELEX. While converging to a mass-action model in the large system-size limit, our stochastic model allows us to study statistical quantities when the system size is small, such as the probability of losing the best-binding aptamer during each round of selection. Specifically, we find that optimal SELEX protocols in the stochastic model differ from those predicted by a deterministic model.},

  abstract = {We investigate the application of the imaginary time hierarchical equations of motion method to calculate real time quantum correlation functions. By starting from the path integral expression for the correlated system–bath equilibrium state, we first derive a new set of equations that decouple the imaginary time propagation and the calculation of auxiliary density operators. The new equations, thus, greatly simplify the calculation of the equilibrium correlated initial state that is subsequently used in the real time propagation to obtain the quantum correlation functions. It is also shown that a periodic decomposition of the bath imaginary time correlation function is no longer necessary in the new equations such that different decomposition schemes can be explored. The applicability of the new method is demonstrated in several numerical examples, including the spin-Boson model, the Holstein model, and the double-well model for proton transfer reaction.},

  abstract = {A coherent state phase space representation of operators, based on the Husimi distribution, is used to derive an exact expression for the symmetrized version of thermal correlation functions. In addition to the time and temperature independent phase space representation of the two operators whose correlation function is of interest, the integrand includes a non-negative distribution function where only one imaginary time and one real time propagation are needed to compute it. The methodology is exemplified for the flux side correlation function used in rate theory. The coherent state representation necessitates the use of a smeared Gaussian flux operator whose coherent state phase space representation is identical to the classical flux expression. The resulting coherent state expression for the flux side correlation function has a number of advantages as compared to previous formulations. Since only one time propagation is needed, it is much easier to converge it with a semiclassical initial value representation. There is no need for forward–backward approximations, and in principle, the computation may be implemented on the fly. It also provides a route for analytic semiclassical approximations for the thermal rate, as exemplified by a computation of the transmission factor through symmetric and asymmetric Eckart barriers using a thawed Gaussian approximation for both imaginary and real time propagations. As a by-product, this example shows that one may obtain “good” tunneling rates using only above barrier classical trajectories even in the deep tunneling regime.},

  abstract = {Repeated/cyclic shearing can drive amorphous solids to a steady state encoding a memory of the applied strain amplitude. However, recent experiments find that the effect of such memory formation on the mechanical properties of the bulk material is rather weak. Here, we study the memory effect in a yield stress solid formed by a dense suspension of cornstarch particles in paraffin oil. Under cyclic shear, the system evolves toward a steady state showing training-induced strain stiffening and plasticity. A readout reveals that the system encodes a strong memory of the training amplitude ( γ T ) as indicated by a large change in the differential shear modulus. We observe that memory can be encoded for a wide range of γ T values both above and below the yielding albeit the strength of the memory decreases with increasing γ T . In situ boundary imaging shows strain localization close to the shearing boundaries, while the bulk of the sample moves like a solid plug. In the steady state, the average particle velocity v inside the solid-like region slows down with respect to the moving plate as γ approaches γ T ; however, as the readout strain crosses γ T , v suddenly increases. We demonstrate that inter-particle adhesive interaction is crucial for such a strong memory effect. Interestingly, our system can also remember more than one input only if the training strain with smaller amplitude is applied last.},

  abstract = {Plasmon excitation of metal electrodes is known to enhance important energy related electrochemical transformations in aqueous media. However, the low solubility of nonpolar gases and molecular reagents involved in many energy conversion reactions limits the number of products formed per unit time in aqueous media. In this Communication, we use linear sweep voltammetry to measure how electrochemical H 2 O reduction in a nonaqueous solvent, acetonitrile, is enhanced by excitation of a plasmonic electrode. Plasmonically excited electrochemically roughened Au electrodes are found to produce photopotentials as large as 175 mV, which can be harnessed to lower the applied electrical bias required to drive the formation of H 2 . As the solvent polarity increases, by an increase in the concentration of H 2 O, the measured photopotential rapidly drops off to ∼50 mV. We propose a mechanism by which an increase in the H 2 O concentration increasingly stabilizes the photocharged plasmonic electrode, lowering the photopotential available to assist in the electrochemical reaction. Our study demonstrates that solvent polarity is an essential experimental parameter to optimize plasmonic enhancement in electrochemistry.},

The dataset for each molecule in this database generally consists of tens of thousands of energies and forces obtained from DFT direct dynamics at 500 K. We contrast the datasets from this database for three “small” molecules, ethanol, malonaldehyde, and glycine, with datasets we have generated with specific targets for the potential energy surfaces (PESs) in mind: a rigorous calculation of the zero-point energy and wavefunction, the tunneling splitting in malonaldehyde, and, in the case of glycine, a description of all eight low-lying conformers. We found that the MD17 datasets are too limited for these targets. We also examine recent datasets for several PESs that describe small-molecule but complex chemical reactions. Finally, we introduce a new database, “QM-22,” which contains datasets of molecules ranging from 4 to 15 atoms that extend to high energies and a large span of configurations.},

  abstract = {For polymer chains, the torsional potential is an important intramolecular energy influencing chain flexibility and segmental dynamics. Through molecular dynamics simulations of an atomistic model for melts of cis – trans -1,4-polybutadiene (PBD), we explore the effect of the torsions on conformational properties (bond vector correlations and mean-square internal distances), fundamental thermodynamic quantities (density, compressibility, internal energy, and specific heat), and glass transition temperature T g . This is achieved by systematically reducing the strength of the torsional potential, starting from the chemically realistic chain (CRC) model with the full potential toward the freely rotating chain (FRC) model without the torsional potential. For the equilibrium liquid, we find that the effect of the torsions on polymer conformations is very weak. Still weaker is the influence on the monomer density ρ and isothermal compressibility κ T of the polymer liquid, both of which can be considered as independent of the torsional potential. We show that a van der Waals-like model proposed by Long and Lequeux [Eur. Phys. J. E 4 , 371 (2001)] allows us to describe very well the temperature ( T ) dependence of ρ and κ T . We also find that our data obey the linear relation between 1 / k B T ρ κ T and 1/ T (with the Boltzmann constant k B ) that has recently been predicted and verified on the experiment by Mirigian and Schweizer [J. Chem. Phys. 140 , 194507 (2014)]. For the equilibrium liquid, simulations result in a specific heat, at constant pressure and at constant volume, which increases on cooling. This T dependence is opposite to the one found experimentally for many polymer liquids, including PBD. We suggest that this difference between simulation and experiment may be attributed to quantum effects due to hydrogen atoms and backbone vibrations, which, by construction, are not included in the classical united-atom model employed here. Finally, we also determine T g from the density–temperature curve monitored in a finite-rate cooling process. While the influence of the torsional potential on ρ ( T ) is vanishingly small in the equilibrium liquid, the effect of the torsions on T g is large. We find that T g decreases by about 150 K when going from the CRC to the FRC model.},

The investigation is performed systematically with respect to the adhesion energy density ξ , NP’s diameter D , and NP’s aspect ratio α . At weak ξ , the NP adheres to the membrane through a parallel mode, i.e., its principal axis is parallel to the membrane. However, for relatively large ξ , the NP adheres through a perpendicular mode, i.e., the NP is invaginated, such as its principal axis is nearly perpendicular to the membrane. The value of ξ at the transition from the parallel to the perpendicular mode decreases with increasing the D or α , in agreement with theoretical arguments based on the Helfrich Hamiltonian. As ξ is further increased, the NP undergoes endocytosis, with the value of ξ at the endocytosis threshold that is independent of the aspect ratio but decreases with increasing D . The kinetics of endocytosis depends strongly on ξ and D . While for low values of D , the NP first rotates to a parallel orientation then to a perpendicular orientation. At high values of ξ or D , the NP is endocytosed while in the parallel orientation.},

We explore the extent to which the lipid headgroup packing and associated water organization are affected by the lipid acyl tail unsaturation and chain length. To this end, we employ a combination of surface-sensitive techniques, including sum-frequency generation spectroscopy, surface pressure measurements, and Brewster angle microscopy imaging. Our results reveal that the acyl tail structure critically affects the headgroup phosphate orientational distribution and lipid-associated water molecules, for both PE and PC lipid monolayers at the air/water interface.

As the concentration of LiNO 3 increased, the SHG intensity first increased and then remained unchanged, while the SHG phase changed by about 5°. These results reveal that there was only a small amount of NO 3 − at the interface. The increase of the SHG intensity resulted from the thickening of the interfacial water molecular layer. In addition, we studied the broadening mechanism of the electrochemical stability window (ESW) for the super-concentrated LiNO 3 aqueous electrolyte. During cyclic voltammetry scanning, the potential-dependent SHG curves of the Pt/LiNO 3 interface verify that at the cathodic end of the ESW, as the concentration of LiNO 3 increased, the orientation angle θ of Pt–H changed less and the number density N s of Pt–H gradually decreased, which indicates the decrease of the number of adsorbed H atoms on the Pt electrode surface.

The research also focuses on the origin of green emission from Cs 4 PbBr 6 , which has a bandgap located in the ultraviolet B (UVB) region. So far, both Cs 4 PbBr 6 without visible emission and with green emission have been successfully prepared; however, the origin of green emission remains controversial. Photocurrent response is one of the effective approaches to explore how the photo-excited carriers influence the photo-physical properties of materials. In our study, Cs 4 PbBr 6 particles without visible emission and with green emission were synthesized and their photocurrent response was investigated. The former showed a positive photocurrent response, while the latter showed a negative photocurrent response. The negative response was believed to be due to a built-in electric field constructed by the charged excitons in green-emissive Cs 4 PbBr 6 . From our calculations, numerous vacancies of Br are easier to appear in green-emissive Cs 4 PbBr 6 lattices, which could combine the neutral excitons to form charged excitons.

  abstract = {We investigate the effect of low temperature (cryogenic) thermal cycling on dynamics of a generic model glass via molecular dynamics simulations. By calculating mean squared displacements after a varying number of cycles, a pronounced enhancement of dynamics is observed. This rejuvenation effect is visible already after the first cycle and accumulates upon further cycling in an intermittent way. Our data reveal an overall deformation (buckling of the slab-shaped system) modulated by a heterogeneous deformation field due to deep cryogenic thermal cycling. It is shown via strain maps that deformation localizes in the form of shear-bands, which gradually fill the entire sample in a random and intermittent manner, very much similar to the accumulation effect observed in dynamics. While spatial organization of local strain may be connected to the specific geometry, we argue that the heterogeneity of the structure is the main cause behind rejuvenation effects observed in the present study.},

  abstract = {Probabilities to find a chosen number of electrons in flexible domains of space are calculated for highly correlated wave functions. Quantum mechanics can produce higher probabilities for chemically relevant arrangements of electrons in these regions. However, the probability to have a given arrangement, e.g., that corresponding to chemical formulas (bonds or atoms), is low although being often maximal. Like in valence bond theory, it is useful to consider alternative distributions of electrons. Exchanges of electrons should be considered not only between atoms but also between other types of regions, such as those attributed to lone pairs. It is useful to have definitions flexible enough to allow users to find the most relevant representations. We tentatively suggest a tool (the effective number of parties) to help one make the choice.},

  abstract = {Room-temperature Bose–Einstein condensates (BECs) of exciton polaritons have been realized in organic molecular systems owing to strong light–matter interaction, strong exciton binding energy, and low effective mass of a polaritonic particle. These molecular-exciton-polariton BECs have demonstrated their potential in nonlinear optics and optoelectronic applications. In this study, we first demonstrate that molecular-polariton BECs can be utilized for Bose enhancement of excitation-energy transfer (EET) in a molecular system with an exciton donor coupled to a group of exciton acceptors that are further strongly coupled to a single mode of an optical cavity. Similar to the stimulated emission of light in which photons are bosonic particles, a greater rate of EET is observed if the group of acceptors is prepared in the exciton-polariton BEC state than if the acceptors are initially either in their electronic ground states or in a normal excited state with an equal average number of molecular excitations. The Bose enhancement also manifests itself as the growth of the EET rate with an increasing number of exciton polaritons in the BEC. Finally, a generalization to the EET in many-donor-many-acceptor molecular systems is considered, and a permutation-symmetry-based approach to suppress the EET to the huge manifold of dark states in the acceptor group is proposed to facilitate the Bose-enhanced EET to the polariton BEC.},

  abstract = {We benchmark a set of quantum-chemistry methods, including multitrajectory Ehrenfest, fewest-switches surface-hopping, and multiconfigurational-Ehrenfest dynamics, against exact quantum-many-body techniques by studying real-time dynamics in the Holstein model. This is a paradigmatic model in condensed matter theory incorporating a local coupling of electrons to Einstein phonons. For the two-site and three-site Holstein model, we discuss the exact and quantum-chemistry methods in terms of the Born–Huang formalism, covering different initial states, which either start on a single Born–Oppenheimer surface, or with the electron localized to a single site. For extended systems with up to 51 sites, we address both the physics of single Holstein polarons and the dynamics of charge-density waves at finite electron densities. For these extended systems, we compare the quantum-chemistry methods to exact dynamics obtained from time-dependent density matrix renormalization group calculations with local basis optimization (DMRG-LBO). We observe that the multitrajectory Ehrenfest method, in general, only captures the ultrashort time dynamics accurately. In contrast, the surface-hopping method with suitable corrections provides a much better description of the long-time behavior but struggles with the short-time description of coherences between different Born–Oppenheimer states. We show that the multiconfigurational Ehrenfest method yields a significant improvement over the multitrajectory Ehrenfest method and can be converged to the exact results in small systems with moderate computational efforts. We further observe that for extended systems, this convergence is slower with respect to the number of configurations. Our benchmark study demonstrates that DMRG-LBO is a useful tool for assessing the quality of the quantum-chemistry methods.},

Phys. 154 , 084119 (2021)] for systems involving more than two electrons. The benefit of such an approach relies on its simplicity as efficient numerical–analytical schemes can be set up to compute the two- and three-body integrals occurring in the effective TC Hamiltonian. To obtain accurate ground state energies within a given basis set, the present TC scheme is coupled to the recently proposed TC–full configuration interaction quantum Monte Carlo method [Cohen et al ., J. Chem. Phys. 151 , 061101 (2019)]. We report ground state total energies on the Li–Ne series, together with their first cations, computed with increasingly large basis sets and compare to more elaborate correlation factors involving electron–electron–nucleus coordinates. Numerical results on the Li–Ne ionization potentials show that the use of the single-parameter correlation factor brings on average only a slightly lower accuracy (1.2 mH) in a triple-zeta quality basis set with respect to a more sophisticated correlation factor. However, already using a quadruple-zeta quality basis set yields results within chemical accuracy to complete basis set limit results when using this novel single-parameter correlation factor. Calculations on the H 2 O, CH 2 , and FH molecules show that a similar precision can be obtained within a triple-zeta quality basis set for the atomization energies of molecular systems.},

Moreover, if properly applied, this mean-field Berry force yields roughly the correct asymptotic motion for scattering through an avoided crossing. That being said, within the context of a ground-state calculation, several nuances do arise as far interpreting the Berry force correctly, and as a practical matter, the Berry force diverges near the Coulson–Fischer point (which can lead to numerical instabilities).

  abstract = {Dispersion interactions are one of the components of van der Waals (vdW) forces that play a key role in the understanding of intermolecular interactions in many physical, chemical, and biological processes. The theory of dispersion forces was developed by London in the early years of quantum mechanics. However, it was only in the 1960s that it was recognized that for molecules lacking an inversion center, such as chiral and helical molecules, there are chirality-sensitive corrections to the dispersion forces proportional to the rotatory power known from the theory of circular dichroism and with the same distance scaling law R −6 as the London energy. The discovery of the chirality-induced spin selectivity effect in recent years has led to an additional twist in the study of chiral molecular systems, showing a close relation between spin and molecular geometry. Motivated by it, we propose in this investigation to describe the mutual induction of charge and spin-density fluctuations in a pair A–B of chiral molecules by a simple physical model. The model assumes that the same fluctuating electric fields responsible for vdW forces can induce a magnetic response via a Rashba-like term so that a spin–orbit field acting on molecule B is generated by the electric field arising from charge density fluctuations in molecule A (and vice versa). Within a second-order perturbative approach, these contributions manifest as an effective intermolecular exchange interaction. Although expected to be weaker than the standard London forces, these interactions display the same R −6 distance scaling.},

  abstract = {Mechanical properties of nucleic acids play an important role in many biological processes that often involve physical deformations of these molecules. At sufficiently long length scales (say, above ∼ 20 − 30 base pairs), the mechanics of DNA and RNA double helices is described by a homogeneous Twistable Wormlike Chain (TWLC), a semiflexible polymer model characterized by twist and bending stiffnesses. At shorter scales, this model breaks down for two reasons: the elastic properties become sequence-dependent and the mechanical deformations at distal sites get coupled. We discuss in this paper the origin of the latter effect using the framework of a non-local Twistable Wormlike Chain (nlTWLC). We show, by comparing all-atom simulations data for DNA and RNA double helices, that the non-local couplings are of very similar nature in these two molecules: couplings between distal sites are strong for tilt and twist degrees of freedom and weak for roll. We introduce and analyze a simple double-stranded polymer model that clarifies the origin of this universal distal couplings behavior. In this model, referred to as the ladder model, a nlTWLC description emerges from the coarsening of local (atomic) degrees of freedom into angular variables that describe the twist and bending of the molecule. Different from its local counterpart, the nlTWLC is characterized by a length-scale-dependent elasticity. Our analysis predicts that nucleic acids are mechanically softer at the scale of a few base pairs and are asymptotically stiffer at longer length scales, a behavior that matches experimental data.},

Our implementation not only enables single-point total energy and electronic-structure calculations but also provides access to atomic forces and cell stresses, hence allowing for full structure relaxations of periodic systems. Furthermore, our implementation allows one to deal with non-collinear spin texture, with the spin–orbit coupling (SOC) effect treated self-consistently. The key aspect behind our implementation is a suitable definition of the correlated subspace when multiple atomic orbitals with the same angular momentum are used, and this is addressed via the “Mulliken charge projector” constructed in terms of the first (most localized) atomic orbital within the d / f angular momentum channel. The important Hubbard U and Hund J parameters can be estimated from a screened Coulomb potential of the Yukawa type, with the screening parameter either chosen semi-empirically or determined from the Thomas–Fermi screening model. Benchmark calculations are performed for four late transition metal monoxide bulk systems, i.e., MnO, FeO, CoO, and NiO, and for the 5 d -electron compounds IrO 2 . For the former type of systems, we check the performance of our DFT+ U implementation for calculating bandgaps, magnetic moments, electronic band structures, as well as forces and stresses; for the latter, the efficacy of our DFT+ U +SOC implementation is assessed. Systematic comparisons with available experimental results, especially with the results from other implementation schemes, are carried out, which demonstrate the validity of our NAO-based DFT+ U formalism and implementation.},

Recently, strong light–matter coupling has shown the potential to significantly improve the rates of hot electron driven processes, for instance, in water splitting. In this paper, we demonstrate that inside an optical cavity, the residual interaction between an outgoing free electron and the vacuum field is significant. We further show that since the quantized field is also interacting with the ionized molecule, the free electron and the molecular system are correlated. We develop a theoretical framework to account for the field induced correlation and show that the interaction between the free electron and the field, free electron–field interaction, has sizable effects on the ionization potential of typical organic molecules.},

  abstract = {Physical nature of the chemical bond and potential barrier is studied in terms of energy natural orbitals (ENOs), which are extracted from highly correlated electronic wavefunctions. ENO provides an objective one-electron picture about energy distribution in a molecule, just as the natural orbitals (NOs) represent one electron view about electronic charge distribution. ENO is invariant in the same sense as NO is, that is, ENOs converge to the exact ones as a series of approximate wavefunctions approach the exact one, no matter how the methods of approximation are adopted. Energy distribution analysis based on ENO can give novel insights about the nature of chemical bonding and formation of potential barriers, besides information based on the charge distribution alone. With ENOs extracted from full configuration interaction wavefunctions in a finite yet large enough basis set, we analyze the nature of chemical bonding of three low-lying electronic states of a hydrogen molecule, all being in different classes of the so-called covalent bond. The mechanism of energy lowering in bond formation, which gives a binding energy, is important, yet not the only concern for this small molecule. Another key notion in chemical bonding is whether a potential basin is well generated stiff enough to support a vibrational state(s) on it. Based on the virial theorem in the adiabatic approximation and in terms of the energy and force analyses with ENOs, we study the roles of the electronic kinetic energy and its nuclear derivative(s) on how they determine the curvature (or the force constant) of the potential basins. The same idea is applied to the potential barrier and, thereby, the transition states. The rate constant within the transition-state theory is formally shown to be described in terms of the electronic kinetic energy and the nuclear derivatives only. Thus, the chemical bonding and rate process are interconnected behind the scenes. Besides this aspect, we pay attention to (1) the effects of electron correlation that manifests itself not only in the orbital energy but also in the population of ENOs and (2) the role of nonadiabaticity (diabatic state mixing), resulting in double basins and a barrier on a single potential curve in bond formation. These factors differentiate a covalent bond into subclasses.},

With complex FODs, the Fermi–Löwdin orbitals (FLOs) that are used to evaluate the SIC correction to the total energy become complex. Complex FLO-SIC (cFLOSIC) calculations based on the local spin density approximation produce total energies that are generally lower than the corresponding energies found with FLOSIC restricted to real orbitals (rFLOSIC). The cFLOSIC results are qualitatively similar to earlier Perdew–Zunger SIC (PZ-SIC) calculations using complex orbitals [J. Chem. Phys. 80 , 1972 (1984); Phys. Rev. A 84 , 050501(R) (2011); and J. Chem. Phys. 137 , 124102 (2012)]. The energy lowering stems from the exchange–correlation part of the self-interaction correction. The Hartree part of the correction is more negative in rFLOSIC. The energy difference between real and complex solutions is greater for more strongly hybridized FLOs in atoms and for FLOs corresponding to double and triple bonds in molecules. The case of N 2 is examined in detail to show the differences between the real and complex FLOs. We show that the complex triple-bond orbitals are simple, and physically appealing combinations of π and σ g orbitals that have not been discussed before. Consideration of complex FODs, and resulting unitary transformations, underscores the fact that FLO centroids are not necessarily good guesses for FOD positions in a FLOSIC calculation.},

In this work, we show that this lack of scaling originates from different re-normalized adsorbate valence energies of lower-lying oxygen vs higher-lying carbon. We develop a model for chemisorption of small molecule adsorbates within the d -band model by combining a modified form of the Newns–Anderson hybridization energy with an effective orthogonalization term. We develop a general descriptor to a priori determine if two adsorbates are likely to scale with each other.},

Considering the GW self-energy as an effective Hamiltonian, it is shown that these issues are key signatures of strong correlation in the ( N ± 1)-electron states and can be directly related to the intruder state problem. A simple and efficient regularization procedure inspired by the similarity renormalization group is proposed to avoid such issues and speed up the convergence of partially self-consistent GW calculations.},

  abstract = {This Perspective provides a brief introduction into the theoretical complexity of polaritonic chemistry, which emerges from the hybrid nature of strongly coupled light–matter states. To tackle this complexity, the importance of ab initio methods is highlighted. Based on those, novel ideas and research avenues are developed with respect to quantum collectivity, as well as for resonance phenomena immanent in reaction rates under vibrational strong coupling. Indeed, fundamental theoretical questions arise about the mesoscopic scale of quantum-collectively coupled molecules when considering the depolarization shift in the interpretation of experimental data. Furthermore, to rationalize recent findings based on quantum electrodynamical density-functional theory (QEDFT), a simple, but computationally efficient, Langevin framework is proposed based on well-established methods from molecular dynamics. It suggests the emergence of cavity-induced non-equilibrium nuclear dynamics, where thermal (stochastic) resonance phenomena could emerge in the absence of external periodic driving. Overall, we believe that the latest ab initio results indeed suggest a paradigmatic shift for ground-state chemical reactions under vibrational strong coupling from the collective quantum interpretation toward a more local, (semi)-classically and non-equilibrium dominated perspective. Finally, various extensions toward a refined description of cavity-modified chemistry are introduced in the context of QEDFT, and future directions of the field are sketched.},

  abstract = {We study the stochastic dynamics of the externally regulating gene circuit as an example of an eve-skipped gene stripe in the development of Drosophila . Three gene regulation regimes are considered: an adiabatic phase when the switching rate of the gene from the OFF to ON state is faster than the rate of mRNA degradation; a nonadiabatic phase when the switching rate from the OFF to ON state is slower than that of the mRNA degradation; and a bursting phase when the gene switching is fast and transcription is very fast, while the ON state probability is very low. We found that the rate of thermodynamic cost quantified by the entropy production rate can suppress the fluctuations of the gene circuit. A higher (lower) rate of thermodynamic cost leads to reduced (increased) fluctuations in the number of gene products in the adiabatic (nonadiabatic) regime. We also found that higher thermodynamic cost is often required to sustain the emergence of more gene states and, therefore, more heterogeneity coming from genetic mutations or epigenetics. We also study the stability of the gene state using the mean first passage time from one state to another. We found the monotonic decrease in time, i.e., in the stability of the state, in the transition from the nonadiabatic to adiabatic regimes. Therefore, as the higher rate of thermodynamic cost suppresses the fluctuations, higher stability requires higher thermodynamics cost to maintain.},

As prototypical water-soluble organic substances, we consider neutral poly-glycine, poly-ethylene glycol, and charged monomeric propionic acid. As the water content is reduced, the dielectric constant decreases but does not follow an ideal mixing behavior. The deviations from ideal mixing originate primarily in the non-linear relation between the oligomer mass fraction and collective polarization effects. We find that the dielectric constant is dominated by water polarization, even if the oligomer mass fraction exceeds 50\%. By a double extrapolation of the MD simulation results to the limit of vanishing water fraction and to the limit of infinite oligomeric chain length, we estimate the orientational contribution to the dielectric constant of the pure polymeric melts. By this procedure, we obtain ɛ = 17 ± 2 for polyglycine and ɛ = 1 ± 0.3 for polyethylene glycol. The large difference is rationalized by polarization correlations of glycine units. Interestingly, we find constant temperature simulations to outperform replica exchange simulations in terms of equilibration speed.},

In this article, we show how to obtain such a time-Laplace analysis. We claim that this method can be adapted to numerous DLS experiments dealing with non-equilibrium systems so as to extract the non-stationary distribution of relaxation times. To prove that, we test this time-Laplace method on three different non-equilibrium processes or systems investigated by means of the DLS technique: the cooling kinetics of a colloidal particle solution, the sol–gel transition and the internal dynamics of a living cell nucleus.},

The adsorption details analyzed at 228 K show that, at low coverage of the ice surface, the polar head of the adsorbed molecules tends to optimize its hydrogen bonding with the surrounding water, whereas the aliphatic chain lies more or less parallel to the ice surface. With increasing coverage, the lateral interactions between the adsorbed alcohol molecules lead to the reorientation of the aliphatic chains that tend to become perpendicular to the surface; the adsorbed molecules pointing thus their terminal methyl group up to the gas phase. When compared to the experimental data, the simulated and measured isotherms show a very good agreement, although a small temperature shift between simulations and experiments could be inferred from simulations at various temperatures. In addition, this agreement appears to be better for ethanol and n-propanol than for n-butanol and n-pentanol, especially at the highest pressures investigated, pointing to a possible slight underestimation of the lateral interactions between the largest alcohol molecules by the interaction potential model used. Nevertheless, the global accuracy of the approach used, as tested under tropospheric conditions, opens the way for its use in modeling studies also relevant to another (e.g., astrophysical) context.},

However, a reliable determination of the vibrational relaxation dynamics in the OD stretch region at the air/D 2 O interface has not been yet achieved. Here, we report a study of the vibrational relaxation of the free OD carried out by time-resolved heterodyne-detected vibrational sum frequency generation spectroscopy. The results obtained with the aid of singular value decomposition analysis indicate that the vibrational relaxation (T 1 ) time of the free OD at the air/D 2 O interface and air/isotopically diluted water (HOD-H 2 O) interfaces show no detectable isotopic dilution effect within the experimental error, as in the case of the free OH in the OH stretch region. Thus, it is concluded that the relaxation of the excited free OH/OD predominantly proceeds with their reorientation, negating a major contribution of the intramolecular energy transfer. It is also shown that the T 1 time of the free OD is substantially longer than that of the free OH, further supporting the reorientation relaxation mechanism. The large difference in the T 1 time between the free OD and the free OH (factor of ∼2) may indicate the nuclear quantum effect on the diffusive reorientation of the free OD/OH because this difference is significantly larger than the value expected for a classical rotational motion.},

While network liquids with 30 ≤ x ≤ 40 are characterized by shear relaxation via a network bond scission/renewal process, a Maxwell scaling of the storage (G′) and loss (G″) shear moduli, and a frequency-independent viscosity at low frequencies, a new relaxation process emerges in liquids with intermediate compositions (45 ≤ x ≤ 50). This process is attributed to an interconversion between network and molecular structural moieties. Predominantly molecular liquids with x ≥ 63, on the other hand, are characterized by a departure from Maxwell behavior as the storage modulus shows a linear frequency scaling G′(ω) ∼ ω over nearly the entire frequency range below the G′–G″ crossover and a nearly constant ratio of G″/G′ in the terminal region. Moreover, the dynamic viscosity of these rather fragile molecular liquids shows significant enhancement over that of network liquids at frequencies below the dynamical onset and does not reach a frequency-independent regime even at frequencies that are four orders of magnitude lower than that of the onset. Such power-law relaxation behavior of the molecular liquids is ascribed to an extremely broad distribution of relaxation timescales with the coexistence of rapid rotational motion of individual molecules and cooperative dynamics of transient molecular clusters, with the latter being significantly slower than the shear relaxation timescale.},

The transverse component of the mean square stress exhibits slow spatial decay (measured from the surface) beyond ∼1.8 nm, which was not reported before. The static correlation length obtained from fitting the exponential decay of the transverse mean-square stress with d is 0.75 nm, while the decay time of the stress–stress time correlation function gives a dynamic correlation length of only 0.35 nm. The shortness of the dynamic correlation length seems to arise from the low sensitivity of orientational relaxation to confinement. In the frequency-dependent viscosity, we observe a new peak at about 50 cm −1 that is not present in the bulk. This new peak is prominent even at 3 nm separations. The peak is absent in the bulk, although it is close to the intermolecular –O–O–O– bending mode well known in liquid water. We further explore the relationship between diffusion and viscosity in NCW by varying d .},

Transforming matter on mesoscopic scales facilitates the definition of nanoscale photonic functions in optical glasses. On these timescales, quantum interactions induced by charge non-equilibrium become the main channel for energy uptake and transfer as well as for the material structural change. We apply a first-principles model to determine dynamic distortions of energy bands following the rapid increase in the free-carrier population in an amorphous dielectric excited by an ultrashort laser pulse. Fused silica glass is reproduced using a system of (SiO 4 ) 4− tetrahedra, where density functional theory extended to finite-temperature fractional occupation reproduces ground and photoexcited states. Triggered by electronic charge redistribution, a bandgap narrowing of more than 2 eV is shown to occur in fused silica under geometry relaxation. Calculations reveal that the bandgap decrease results from the rearrangement of atoms altering the bonding strength. Despite an atomic movement impacting strongly the structural stability, the observed change of geometry remains limited to 7\% of the interatomic distance and occurs on the femtosecond timescale. This structural relaxation is thus expected to take place quasi-instantly following the photon energy flux. Moreover, under intense laser pulse excitation, fused silica loses its stability when an electron temperature of around 2.8 eV is reached. A further increase in the excitation energy leads to the collapse of both the structure and bandgap.},

  abstract = {The quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM), developed by Bader and co-workers, is one of the most popular ways of extracting chemical insight from the results of quantum mechanical calculations. One of the basic tasks in QTAIM is to locate the critical points of the electron density and calculate various quantities (density, Laplacian, etc.) on them since these have been found to correlate with molecular properties of interest. If the electron density is given analytically, this process is relatively straightforward. However, locating the critical points is more challenging if the density is known only on a three-dimensional uniform grid. A density grid is common in periodic solids because it is the natural expression for the electron density in plane-wave calculations. In this article, we explore the reconstruction of the electron density from a grid and its use in critical point localization. The proposed reconstruction method employs polyharmonic spline interpolation combined with a smoothing function based on the promolecular density. The critical point search based on this reconstruction is accurate, trivially parallelizable, works for periodic and non-periodic systems, does not present directional lattice bias when the grid is non-orthogonal, and locates all critical points of the underlying electron density in all tests studied. The proposed method also provides an accurate reconstruction of the electron density over the space spanned by the grid, which may be useful in other contexts besides critical point localization.},

  abstract = {Following our preceding work on spherical and linear rotors [C. Stopera and J. A. Morales, J. Chem. Phys. 152 , 134112 (2020)], we reformulate an earlier rotational coherent state (CS) set to obtain a temporally stable (TS) CS set for symmetric rotors. Being TS, the new CSs remain within its own set during dynamics by evolving exclusively through their parameters. The TS CS set is now appropriate to reconstruct quantum rotational properties from classical-mechanics simulations of chemical reactions. Following literature precedents, we enforce temporal stability by incorporating action-angle-related phase factors into two parameters of the original CS set. Proofs and final expressions of the symmetric-rotor CS turn out more intricate than those of its spherical-rotor counterpart. We demonstrate and examine the key properties of the new CS set: continuity, resolution of unity, temporal stability, action identity, minimum uncertainty relationships, and quasi-classical behavior. Regarding the last property, we demonstrate that the body-fixed z-component of the CS angular momentum average evolves exactly as its classical counterpart, and that the x- and y-components display an astonishing analogy with their classical counterparts in terms of functional form, precession angular velocities, amplitudes, and phases. We elucidate some of these properties via computer simulations of a rotating benzene molecule represented with the CS set. We discuss the utilization of this CS set to reconstruct quantum rotational properties of symmetric-rotor molecules from classical-mechanics simulations. The new CS set is appropriate to establish quantum-classical connections for rotational properties in chemical dynamics, statistical mechanics, spectroscopy, nuclear physics, and quantum computing.},

  abstract = {Partition density functional theory is a density embedding method that partitions a molecule into fragments by minimizing the sum of fragment energies subject to a local density constraint and a global electron-number constraint. To perform this minimization, we study a two-stage procedure in which the sum of fragment energies is lowered when electrons flow from fragments of lower electronegativity to fragments of higher electronegativity. The global minimum is reached when all electronegativities are equal. The non-integer fragment populations are dealt with in two different ways: (1) An ensemble approach (ENS) that involves averaging over calculations with different numbers of electrons (always integers) and (2) a simpler approach that involves fractionally occupying orbitals (FOO). We compare and contrast these two approaches and examine their performance in some of the simplest systems where one can transparently apply both, including simple models of heteronuclear diatomic molecules and actual diatomic molecules with two and four electrons. We find that, although both ENS and FOO methods lead to the same total energy and density, the ENS fragment densities are less distorted than those of FOO when compared to their isolated counterparts, and they tend to retain integer numbers of electrons. We establish the conditions under which the ENS populations can become fractional and observe that, even in those cases, the total charge transferred is always lower in ENS than in FOO. Similarly, the FOO fragment dipole moments provide an upper bound to the ENS dipoles. We explain why and discuss the implications.},

In this paper, we investigate the effect of CT states on the absorption spectrum of linear molecular aggregates using a scattering matrix technique that allows us to deal with arbitrarily large systems. The presented theory performs well for both strong and weak mixing of exciton and CT states, bridging the gap between previously employed methods, which are applicable in only one of these limits. In experimental spectra, the homogeneous linewidth is often too large to resolve all optically allowed transitions individually, resulting in a characteristic two-peak absorption spectrum in both the weak- and strong-coupling regime. Using the scattering matrix technique, we examine the contributions of free and bound states in detail. We conclude that the skewness of the high-frequency peak may be used as a new way to identify the exciton–CT-state coupling strength.},

In this work, we present a strategy to implement the NEO method for periodic electronic structure calculations, particularly focused on multicomponent density functional theory (DFT). The NEO-DFT method is implemented in an all-electron electronic structure code, FHI-aims, using a combination of analytical and numerical integration techniques as well as a resolution of the identity scheme to enhance computational efficiency. After validating this implementation, proof-of-concept applications are presented to illustrate the effects of quantized protons on the physical properties of extended systems, such as two-dimensional materials and liquid–semiconductor interfaces. Specifically, periodic NEO-DFT calculations are performed for a trans -polyacetylene chain, a hydrogen boride sheet, and a titanium oxide–water interface. The zero-point energy effects of the protons as well as electron–proton correlation are shown to noticeably impact the density of states and band structures for these systems. These developments provide a foundation for the application of multicomponent DFT to a wide range of other extended condensed matter systems.},

  abstract = {The transient negative-ion resonances found in scattering experiments are important intermediates in many chemical processes. These metastable states correspond to the continuum part of the Hamiltonian of the projectile–target composite system. Usual bound-state electronic structure methods are not applicable for these. In this work, we develop a subspace-projection method in connection with an electron propagator (EP) defined in terms of a complete-active-space self-consistent-field initial state. The target Hamiltonian ( H ̂ ) is perturbed by a complex absorbing potential (CAP) for the analytical continuation of the spectrum of H ̂ to complex eigenvalues associated with the continuum states. The resonance is identified as a pole of the EP, which is stable with respect to variations in the strength of the CAP. The projection into a small subspace reduces the size of the complex matrices to be diagonalized, minimizes the computational cost, and affords some insight into the orbitals that are likely to play some role in the capture of the projectile. Two molecular ( ⁠ Π g 2 N 2 − and 2 Π CO − ) and an atomic shaperesonance ( 2 P Be − ) are investigated using this method. The position and width of the resonances are in good agreement with the previously reported values.},

This model must also account for spin–orbit (SO) coupling. This study is the first step to construct accurate SO coupled PESs, namely, for the C–I dissociation coordinate. The model is based on the Effective Relativistic Coupling by Asymptotic Representation (ERCAR) method developed over the past ten years. The SO-free Hamiltonian is represented in an asymptotic diabatic basis and then combined with an atomic effective relativistic coupling operator determined analytically. In contrast to the previously studied cases (HI, CH 3 I), the diabatic basis states are due to excitations in the phenyl fragment rather than the iodine atom. An accurate analytical model of the ab initio reference data is determined in two steps. The first step is a simple reference model describing the data qualitatively. This reference model is corrected through a trained artificial neural-network to achieve high accuracy. The SO-free and the fine structure states resulting from this ERCAR model are discussed extensively in the context of the photodissociation.},

  abstract = {The high computational scaling with the basis set size and the number of correlated electrons is a bottleneck limiting applications of coupled cluster algorithms, in particular for calculations based on two- or four-component relativistic Hamiltonians, which often employ uncontracted basis sets. This problem may be alleviated by replacing canonical Hartree–Fock virtual orbitals by natural orbitals (NOs). In this paper, we describe the implementation of a module for generating NOs for correlated wavefunctions and, in particular, second order Møller–Plesset perturbation frozen natural orbitals (MP2FNOs) as a component of our novel implementation of relativistic coupled cluster theory for massively parallel architectures [Pototschnig et al. J. Chem. Theory Comput. 17 , 5509, (2021)]. Our implementation can manipulate complex or quaternion density matrices, thus allowing for the generation of both Kramers-restricted and Kramers-unrestricted MP2FNOs. Furthermore, NOs are re-expressed in the parent atomic orbital (AO) basis, allowing for generating coupled cluster singles and doubles NOs in the AO basis for further analysis. By investigating the truncation errors of MP2FNOs for both the correlation energy and molecular properties—electric field gradients at the nuclei, electric dipole and quadrupole moments for hydrogen halides HX (X = F–Ts), and parity-violating energy differences for H 2 Z 2 (Z = O–Se)—we find MP2FNOs accelerate the convergence of the correlation energy in a roughly uniform manner across the Periodic Table. It is possible to obtain reliable estimates for both energies and the molecular properties considered with virtual molecular orbital spaces truncated to about half the size of the full spaces.},

While the wave functions of many systems are dominated by a single electron arrangement that is built from two-center two-electron bonds, some systems require several different arrangements to be well described. In this work, a range of these multi-center bonded molecules are classified and investigated with probability density analysis. The results are compared with valence bond theory calculations and data from collision-induced dissociation experiments.},

  abstract = {C 4n cyclacenes exhibit strong bond-alternation in their equilibrium geometry. In the two equivalent geometries, the system keeps an essentially closed-shell character. The two energy minima are separated by a transition state suppressing the bond-alternation, where the wave function is strongly diradical. This paper discusses the physical factors involved in this energy difference and possible evaluations of the barrier height. The barrier given as the energy difference between the restricted density functional theory (DFT)/B3LYP for the equilibrium and the broken symmetry DFT/B3LYP of the transition state is either negative or small, in contradiction with the most reliable Wave Function Theory calculations. The minimal (two electrons in two molecular orbitals) Complete Active Space self-consistent field (CASSCF) overestimates the barrier, and the subsequent second-order perturbation cancels it. Due to the collective character of the spin-polarization effect, it is necessary to perform a full π CASSCF + second-order perturbation to reach a reasonable value of the barrier, but this type of treatment cannot be applied to large molecules. DFT procedures treating on an equal foot the closed-shell and open-shell geometries have been explored, such as Mixed-Reference Spin-Flip Time-dependent-DFT and a new spin-decontamination proposal, namely, DFT-dressed configuration interaction, but the results still depend on the density functional. M06-2X without or with spin-decontamination gives the best agreement with the accurate wave function results.},

For the first time, the derivation of an effective dipole moment is carried out in a systematic way. This general approach can be implemented quite easily in most of the variational computer codes and turns out to be a clear alternative to the rather involved Van Vleck perturbation method. Symmetry is exploited at all stages to translate first-principles calculations into a set of spectroscopic parameters to be further refined on experiment. We demonstrate on H 2 CO, PH 3 , CH 4 , C 2 H 4 , and SF 6 that the proposed effective model can provide crucial information to spectroscopists within a very short time compared to empirical spectroscopic models.

  abstract = {Modulating the interaction potential between colloids suspended in a fluid can trigger equilibrium phase transitions as well as the formation of non-equilibrium “arrested states,” such as gels and glasses. Faithful representation of such interactions is essential for using simulation to interrogate the microscopic details of non-equilibrium behavior and for extrapolating observations to new regions of phase space that are difficult to explore in experiments. Although the extended law of corresponding states predicts equilibrium phases for systems with short-ranged interactions, it proves inadequate for equilibrium predictions of systems with longer-ranged interactions and for predicting non-equilibrium phenomena in systems with either short- or long-ranged interactions. These shortcomings highlight the need for new approaches to represent and disambiguate interaction potentials that replicate both equilibrium and non-equilibrium phase behavior. In this work, we use experiments and simulations to study a system with long-ranged thermoresponsive colloidal interactions and explore whether a resolution to this challenge can be found in regions of the phase diagram where temporal effects influence material state. We demonstrate that the conditions for non-equilibrium arrest by colloidal gelation are sensitive to both the shape of the interaction potential and the thermal quench rate. We exploit this sensitivity to propose a kinetics-based algorithm to extract distinct arrest conditions for candidate potentials that accurately selects between potentials that differ in shape but share the same predicted equilibrium structure. The algorithm selects the candidate that best matches the non-equilibrium behavior between simulation and experiments. Because non-equilibrium behavior in simulation is encoded entirely by the interparticle potential, the results are agnostic to the particular mechanism(s) by which arrest occurs, and so we expect our method to apply to a range of arrested states, including gels and glasses. Beyond its utility in constructing models, the method reveals that each potential has a quantitatively distinct arrest line, providing insight into how the shape of longer-ranged potentials influences the conditions for colloidal gelation.},

  abstract = {To gain quantitative insight into how the overall strength of the hydrophobic interaction varies with the molecular size, we calculate osmotic second virial coefficients B for hydrophobic spherical molecules of different diameters σ in water based on molecular simulation with corrections to the finite-size and finite-concentration effects. It is shown that B (&lt;0) changes by two orders of magnitude greater as σ increases twofold and its solute-size dependence is best fit by a power law B ∝ σ α with the exponent α ≃ 6, which contrasts with the cubic power law that the second virial coefficients of gases obey. It is also found that values of B for the solutes in a nonpolar solvent are positive but they obey the same power law as in water. A thermodynamic identity for B derived earlier [K. Koga, V. Holten, and B. Widom, J. Phys. Chem. B 119 , 13391 (2015)] indicates that if B is asymptotically proportional to a power of σ , the exponent α must be equal to or greater than 6.},

  abstract = {The study of Brownian ratchets has taught how time-periodic driving supports a time-periodic steady state that generates nonequilibrium transport. When a single particle is transported in one dimension, it is possible to rationalize the current in terms of the potential, but experimental efforts have ventured beyond that single-body case to systems with many interacting carriers. Working with a lattice model of volume-excluding particles in one dimension, we analyze the impact of interactions on a flashing ratchet’s current. To surmount the many-body problem, we employ the time-dependent variational principle applied to binary tree tensor networks. Rather than propagating individual trajectories, the tensor network approach propagates a distribution over many-body configurations via a controllable variational approximation. The calculations, which reproduce Gillespie trajectory sampling, identify and explain a shift in the frequency of maximum current to higher driving frequency as the lattice occupancy increases.},

Machine-learning (ML) interatomic potentials offer a uniquely compelling solution for simulating chemical processes, rare events, and phase transitions associated with these complex interfaces by mixing high scalability with quantum-level accuracy, provided that they can be trained to properly address atomic disorder. To this end, we report the construction and validation of an ML potential that is specifically designed to simulate crystalline, disordered, and amorphous LLZO systems across a wide range of conditions. The ML model is based on a neural network algorithm and is trained using ab initio data. Performance tests prove that the developed ML potential can predict accurate structural and vibrational characteristics, elastic properties, and Li diffusivity of LLZO comparable to ab initio simulations. As a demonstration of its applicability to larger systems, we show that the potential can correctly capture grain boundary effects on diffusivity, as well as the thermal transition behavior of LLZO. These examples show that the ML potential enables simulations of transitions between well-defined and disordered structures with quantum-level accuracy at speeds thousands of times faster than ab initio methods.},

  abstract = {Besides absorbing light, the core antenna complex CP43 of photosystem II is of great importance in transferring excitation energy from the antenna complexes to the reaction center. Excitation energies, spectral densities, and linear absorption spectra of the complex have been evaluated by a multiscale approach. In this scheme, quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics molecular dynamics simulations are performed employing the parameterized density functional tight binding (DFTB) while the time-dependent long-range-corrected DFTB scheme is applied for the excited state calculations. The obtained average spectral density of the CP43 complex shows a very good agreement with experimental results. Moreover, the excitonic Hamiltonian of the system along with the computed site-dependent spectral densities was used to determine the linear absorption. While a Redfield-like approximation has severe shortcomings in dealing with the CP43 complex due to quasi-degenerate states, the non-Markovian full second-order cumulant expansion formalism is able to overcome the drawbacks. Linear absorption spectra were obtained, which show a good agreement with the experimental counterparts at different temperatures. This study once more emphasizes that by combining diverse techniques from the areas of molecular dynamics simulations, quantum chemistry, and open quantum systems, it is possible to obtain first-principle results for photosynthetic complexes, which are in accord with experimental findings.},

Among the key developments in using colloids to address challenges in condensed matter is to resolve the particle coordinates in 3D, allowing a level of analysis usually only possible in computer simulations. However, in amorphous materials, relating mechanical properties to microscopic structure remains problematic. This makes it rather hard to understand, for example, mechanical failure. Here, we address this challenge by studying the contacts and the forces between particles as well as their positions. To do so, we use a colloidal model system (an emulsion) in which the interparticle forces and local stress can be linked to the microscopic structure. We demonstrate the potential of our method to reveal insights into the failure mechanisms of soft amorphous solids by determining local stress in a colloidal gel. In particular, we identify “force chains” of load-bearing droplets and local stress anisotropy and investigate their connection with locally rigid packings of the droplets.},

We demonstrate that our modification enables the SPB theory to accurately predict monovalent ion distributions around a rodlike PE in a wide range of ion and charge distribution conditions in the weak-coupling regime. These include excess salt concentrations up to 1M and ion sizes ranging from small ions, such as Na + or Cl − , to softer and larger ions with a size comparable to the PE diameter.

  abstract = {Many common elastomeric products, including nitrile gloves, are manufactured by coagulant dipping. This process involves the destabilization and gelation of a latex dispersion by an ionic coagulant. Despite widespread application, the physical chemistry governing coagulant dipping is poorly understood. It is unclear which properties of an electrolyte determine its efficacy as a coagulant and which phenomena control the growth of the gel. Here, a novel experimental protocol is developed to directly observe coagulant gelation by light microscopy. Gel growth is imaged and quantified for a variety of coagulants and compared to macroscopic dipping experiments mimicking the industrial process. When the coagulant is abundant, gels grow with a t 1/2 time dependence, suggesting that this phenomenon is diffusion-dominated. When there is a finite amount of coagulant, gels grow to a limiting thickness. Both these situations are modeled as one-dimensional diffusion problems, reproducing the qualitative features of the experiments including which electrolytes cause rapid growth of thick gels. We propose that the gel thickness is limited by the amount of coagulant available, and the growth is, therefore, unbounded when the coagulant is abundant. The rate of the gel growth is controlled by a combination of a diffusion coefficient and the ratio of the critical coagulation concentration to the amount of coagulant present, which in many situations is set by the coagulant solubility. Other phenomena, including diffusiophoresis, may make a more minor contribution to the rate of gel growth.},

Much is known about the macroscopic phase-behaviors of such materials, but how the smaller scale single-chain structures of polyzwitterions respond to external stimuli is not well understood, especially at temperatures close to their phase boundaries. Such chain conformation responses are important in directing larger-scale associative properties. Here, we study the temperature dependent single-chain structure of a model polysulfobetaine, poly[3-(acrylamidopropyl-dimethyl-ammonium) propyl-1-sulfonate], using small angle neutron scattering. In the absence of salt, we find that temperature has a large effect on solvent quality with a decreasing trend from good solvent conditions at 50 °C to poor solvent at 10 °C (a temperature just above the cloud point of 7.6 °C) and an estimated theta temperature of 39 °C. When 100 mM NaCl is present, the solvent quality is good with weak temperature dependence. Without salt present, the polymer chain appears to have a nearly Gaussian coil conformation and the backbone becomes slightly more rigid as the temperature is lowered to the cloud point as determined by the Debye-local rod model on a Kratky plot. The addition of salt has a notable effect on the intra-chain correlations where an increase in chain dimensions to a swollen coil conformation and an increase in chain rigidity is observed at 100 mM NaCl in D 2 O, however, with a negligible temperature dependence.},

We investigated the effect of temperature and loading of SN on ion transport and relaxation phenomenon in PEO-LiTFSI electrolytes. It is observed that SN increases the ionic diffusivities in PEO-based solid polymer electrolytes and makes them suitable for battery applications. Interestingly, the diffusion coefficient of TFSI ions is an order of magnitude higher than the diffusion coefficient of lithium ions across the range of temperatures and loadings investigated. By analyzing different relaxation timescales and examining the underlying transport mechanisms in SN-loaded systems, we find that the diffusivity of TFSI ions correlates excellently with the Li-TFSI ion-pair relaxation timescales. In contrast, our simulations predict distinct transport mechanisms for Li-ions in SN-loaded PEO-LiTFSI electrolytes. Explicitly, the diffusivity of lithium ions cannot be uniquely determined by the ion-pair relaxation timescales but additionally depends on the polymer segmental dynamics. On the other hand, the SN loading induced diffusion coefficient at a given temperature does not correlate with either the ion-pair relaxation timescales or the polymer segmental relaxation timescales.},

By constructing Markov state models (MSMs) at the microstate level, we find that for highly dispersed particles to form a highly aggregated cluster, there are multiple coexisting pathways, which correspond to direct aggregation, or pathways that need to pass through partially aggregated, intermediate states. Varying the range of attraction between nanoparticles is found to significantly affect pathways. As the attraction range becomes narrower, compared to direct aggregation, some pathways that need to pass through partially aggregated intermediate states become more competitive. In addition, from MSMs constructed at the macrostate level, the aggregation rate is found to be counterintuitively lower with a lower free-energy barrier, which is also discussed.},

  abstract = {Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) are rodlike biosourced colloidal particles used as key building blocks in a growing number of materials with innovative mechanical or optical properties. While CNCs form stable suspensions at low volume fractions in pure water, they aggregate in the presence of salt and form colloidal gels with time-dependent properties. Here, we study the impact of salt concentration on the slow aging dynamics of CNC gels following the cessation of a high-shear flow that fully fluidizes the sample. We show that the higher the salt content, the faster the recovery of elasticity upon flow cessation. Most remarkably, the elastic modulus G ′ obeys a time–composition superposition principle: the temporal evolution of G ′ can be rescaled onto a universal sigmoidal master curve spanning 13 orders of magnitude in time for a wide range of salt concentrations. Such a rescaling is obtained through a time-shift factor that follows a steep power-law decay with increasing salt concentration until it saturates at large salt content. These findings are robust to changes in the type of salt and the CNC content. We further show that both linear and nonlinear rheological properties of CNC gels of various compositions, including, e.g., the frequency-dependence of viscoelastic spectra and the yield strain, can be rescaled based on the sample age along the general master curve. Our results provide strong evidence for universality in the aging dynamics of CNC gels and call for microstructural investigations during recovery as well as theoretical modeling of time–composition superposition in rodlike colloids.},

  abstract = {Accurately describing surface temperature effects for the dissociative scattering of H 2 on a metal surface on a quantum dynamical (QD) level is currently one of the open challenges for theoretical surface scientists. We present the first QD simulations of hydrogen dissociating on a Cu(111) surface, which accurately describe all relevant surface temperature effects, using the static corrugation model. The reaction probabilities we obtain show very good agreement with those found using quasi-classical dynamics (QCD), both for individual surface slabs and for an averaged, thus Monte Carlo sampled, set of thermally distorted surface configurations. Rovibrationally elastic scattering probabilities show a much clearer difference between the QCD and QD results, which appears to be traceable back toward thermally distorted surface configurations with very low dissociation probabilities and underlines the importance of investigating more observables than just dissociation. By reducing the number of distorted surface atoms included in the dynamical model, we also show that only including one surface atom, or even three surface atoms, is generally not enough to accurately describe the effects of the surface temperature on dissociation and elastic scattering. These results are a major step forward in accurately describing hydrogen scattering from a thermally excited Cu(111) surface and open up a pathway to better describe reaction and scattering from other relevant crystal facets, such as stepped surfaces, at moderately elevated surface temperatures where quantum effects are expected to play a more important role in the dissociation of H 2 on Cu.},

  abstract = {In spite of the increasing interest in and application of ultrathin film oxides in commercial devices, the understanding of the mechanisms that control the growth of these films at the atomic scale remains limited and scarce. This limited understanding prevents the rational design of novel solutions based on precise control of the structure and properties of ultrathin films. Such a limited understanding stems in no minor part from the fact that most of the available modeling methods are unable to access and robustly sample the nanosecond to second timescales required to simulate both atomic deposition and surface reorganization at ultrathin films. To contribute to this knowledge gap, here we have combined molecular dynamics and adaptive kinetic Monte Carlo simulations to study the deposition and growth of oxide materials over an extended timescale of up to ∼0.5 ms. In our pilot studies, we have examined the growth of binary oxide thin films on oxide substrates. We have investigated three scenarios: (i) the lattice parameter of both the substrate and thin film are identical, (ii) the lattice parameter of the thin film is smaller than the substrate, and (iii) the lattice parameter is greater than the substrate. Our calculations allow for the diffusion of ions between deposition events and the identification of growth mechanisms in oxide thin films. We make a detailed comparison with previous calculations. Our results are in good agreement with the available experimental results and demonstrate important limitations in former calculations, which fail to sample phase space correctly at the temperatures of interest (typically 300–1000 K) with self-evident limitations for the representative modeling of thin films growth. We believe that the present pilot study and proposed combined methodology open up for extended computational support in the understanding and design of ultrathin film growth conditions tailored to specific applications.},

  abstract = {Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are regarded as a possible material platform for quantum information science and related device applications. In TMD monolayers, the dephasing time and inhomogeneity are crucial parameters for any quantum information application. In TMD heterostructures, coupling strength and interlayer exciton lifetimes are also parameters of interest. However, many demonstrations in TMDs can only be realized at specific spots on the sample, presenting a challenge to the scalability of these applications. Here, using multi-dimensional coherent imaging spectroscopy, we shed light on the underlying physics—including dephasing, inhomogeneity, and strain—for a MoSe 2 monolayer and identify both promising and unfavorable areas for quantum information applications. We, furthermore, apply the same technique to a MoSe 2 /WSe 2 heterostructure. Despite the notable presence of strain and dielectric environment changes, coherent and incoherent coupling and interlayer exciton lifetimes are mostly robust across the sample. This uniformity is despite a significantly inhomogeneous interlayer exciton photoluminescence distribution that suggests a bad sample for device applications. This robustness strengthens the case for TMDs as a next-generation material platform in quantum information science and beyond.},

  abstract = {Vibrational dynamics of adsorbates near surfaces plays both an important role for applied surface science and as a model lab for studying fundamental problems of open quantum systems. We employ a previously developed model for the relaxation of a D–Si–Si bending mode at a D:Si(100)-(2 × 1) surface, induced by a “bath” of more than 2000 phonon modes [Lorenz and P. Saalfrank, Chem. Phys. 482 , 69 (2017)], to extend previous work along various directions. First, we use a Hierarchical Effective Mode (HEM) model [Fischer et al. , J. Chem. Phys. 153 , 064704 (2020)] to study relaxation of higher excited vibrational states than hitherto done by solving a high-dimensional system–bath time-dependent Schrödinger equation (TDSE). In the HEM approach, (many) real bath modes are replaced by (much less) effective bath modes. Accordingly, we are able to examine scaling laws for vibrational relaxation lifetimes for a realistic surface science problem. Second, we compare the performance of the multilayer multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree (ML-MCTDH) approach with that of the recently developed coherent-state-based multi-Davydov-D2 Ansatz [Zhou et al. , J. Chem. Phys. 143 , 014113 (2015)]. Both approaches work well, with some computational advantages for the latter in the presented context. Third, we apply open-system density matrix theory in comparison with basically “exact” solutions of the multi-mode TDSEs. Specifically, we use an open-system Liouville–von Neumann (LvN) equation treating vibration-phonon coupling as Markovian dissipation in Lindblad form to quantify effects beyond the Born–Markov approximation.},

  abstract = {Atomistic-level understanding of the interfacial behavior of ionic liquids (ILs) confined in slit-like nanopores is of both fundamental and practical interest. Molecular dynamics (MD) is an efficient and robust approach to characterize the properties of confined systems in contrast with some limitations in direct experimental measurements at low-dimensions. In this research, MD simulations are used to study the biocompatible IL cholinium glycinate, [Cho][Gly], confined between two parallel plates of rutile or graphite, with the separation distance of 24 Å along the z -direction. As expected, both the microscopic local structure and dynamical behavior of the confined IL are very heterogeneous and depend effectively on the position of the ions to the pore walls. The ion z -density profile is used for segmentation of the inter-wall space into a central region and two outer layers. The behavior of ions in the central region is very similar to the bulk IL, while the behavior of the arranged ionic layers adjacent to the pore walls shows the clear deviation from the bulk IL due to confinement. In general, the confined IL shows a “solid-like” dynamics at T = 353 K, especially in the outer layers near the walls as well as in the z -direction. The presence of the “IL-rutile wall” electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bonding (H-bonding) causes a significant difference in the local structure and very sluggish dynamics of the IL adjacent to the rutile walls vs the graphite walls. Simulation reveals a significant decrease in the average number of key cation–anion H-bonds at the outer layers relative to the central regions of both confined systems. The recognized [Cho] + ⋯[Gly] − ⋯[Cho] + bridge structure at the central region is lost in the vicinity of the rutile walls due to inaccessibility of the hydroxyl hydrogen atom, which forms a stable H-bond with the rutile oxygen site. However, another unprecedented [Gly] − bridge is confirmed and preserved near the graphite walls, and [Cho] + cations prefer to stay parallel to the wall surface to form the van der Waals dispersion interactions with the uncharged graphite walls.},

  abstract = {Ionic liquids (ILs) are salts, composed of asymmetric cations and anions, typically existing as liquids at ambient temperatures. They have found widespread applications in energy storage devices, dye-sensitized solar cells, and sensors because of their high ionic conductivity and inherent thermal stability. However, measuring the conductivity of ILs by physical methods is time-consuming and expensive, whereas the use of computational screening and testing methods can be rapid and effective. In this study, we used experimentally measured and published data to construct a deep neural network capable of making rapid and accurate predictions of the conductivity of ILs. The neural network is trained on 406 unique and chemically diverse ILs. This model is one of the most chemically diverse conductivity prediction models to date and improves on previous studies that are constrained by the availability of data, the environmental conditions, or the IL base. Feature engineering techniques were employed to identify key chemo-structural characteristics that correlate positively or negatively with the ionic conductivity. These features are capable of being used as guidelines to design and synthesize new highly conductive ILs. This work shows the potential for machine-learning models to accelerate the rate of identification and testing of tailored, high-conductivity ILs.},

At room temperature and pressure, the collective molecular interactions and dynamics of water molecules may form local structural arrangements that are non-trivial to classify. Here, we employ a data-driven approach built on Smooth Overlap of Atomic Position (SOAP) that allows us to compare and classify how widely used classical models represent liquid water. Macroscopically, the obtained results are rationalized based on water thermodynamic observables. Microscopically, we directly observe how transient ice-like ordered environments may dynamically/statistically form in liquid water, even above freezing temperature, by comparing the SOAP spectra for different ice structures with those of the simulated liquid systems. This confirms recent ab initio -based calculations but also reveals how the emergence of ephemeral local ice-like environments in liquid water at room conditions can be captured by classical water models.},

  abstract = {Despite decades of intense research, whether the transformation of supercooled liquids into glass is a kinetic phenomenon or a thermodynamic phase transition remains unknown. Here, we analyzed optical microscopy experiments on 2D binary colloidal glass-forming liquids and investigated the structural links of a prominent kinetic theory of glass transition. We examined a possible structural origin for localized excitations, which are building blocks of the dynamical facilitation theory—a purely kinetic approach for the glass transition. To accomplish this, we utilize machine learning methods to identify a structural order parameter termed “softness” that has been found to be correlated with reorganization events in supercooled liquids. Both excitations and softness qualitatively capture the dynamical slowdown on approaching the glass transition and motivated us to explore spatial and temporal correlations between them. Our results show that excitations predominantly occur in regions with high softness and the appearance of these high softness regions precedes excitations, thus suggesting a causal connection between them. Thus, unifying dynamical and thermodynamical theories into a single structure-based framework may provide a route to understand the glass transition.},

Symmetrization ( D 5 h ) of the vibrational basis sets leads to simple vibration/pseudorotation Hamiltonians whose solutions lead to good agreement with the experiment at medium resolution, but which miss interesting line fractionation when compared to the high-resolution spectra.

State-to-state scattering images for excitation of NO radicals into various final states were measured with high resolution by combining the Stark deceleration and velocity map imaging techniques. The high image resolution afforded the observation of correlated rotational excitations of NO–CO pairs, which revealed a number of striking scattering phenomena. The so-called “parity-pair” transitions in NO are found to have similar differential cross sections, independent of the concurrent excitation of CO, extending this well-known effect for collisions between NO and rare gas atoms into the realm of bimolecular collisions. Forward scattering is found for collisions that induce a large amount of rotational energy transfer (in either NO, CO, or both), which require low impact parameters to induce sufficient energy transfer. This observation is interpreted in terms of the recently discovered hard collision glory scattering mechanism, which predicts the forward bending of initially backward receding trajectories if the energy uptake in the collision is substantial in relation to the collision energy. The experimental results are in good agreement with the predictions from coupled-channels quantum scattering calculations based on an ab initio NO–CO potential energy surface.},

For our atomistic simulations, we used the embedded atom method. The employed open access program large-scale atomic/molecular massively parallel simulator makes it possible to realize parallel graphical processing unit calculations. We have made a conclusion that the regularities and mechanisms of the nanodroplet coalescence (temperature is higher than the nanoparticle melting temperature) and of the solid nanoparticle sintering differ from each other. We have also concluded that the nanodroplet coalescence may be interpreted as a hydrodynamic phenomenon at the nanoscale whereas sintering of solid nanoparticles is a much more complex phenomenon related to different mechanisms, including collective rearrangements of atoms, the surface diffusion, and other types of diffusion. At the same time, collective rearrangements of atoms relate not only to the solid nanoparticle sintering but also to the nanodroplet coalescence. In general, our molecular dynamics results on sintering of Au nanoparticles consisting of 10 000–30 000 atoms agree with the Ferrando–Minnai kinetic trapping concept that was earlier confirmed in molecular dynamics experiments on Au nanoclusters consisting of about 100 atoms.},

  abstract = {The rotational state resolved photodissociation dynamics of D 2 O via the C ̃ (010) state has been investigated by using the D-atom Rydberg tagging time-of-flight technique combined with a tunable vacuum ultraviolet light source. The D-atom action spectrum of the C ̃ (010) ← X ̃ (000) band and the corresponding time-of-flight (TOF) spectra of D-atom photoproducts formed following the excitation of D 2 O to individual rotational transition have been measured. By comparison with the action spectrum of the C ̃ (000) ← X ̃ (000) band, the bending vibrational constant of the C ̃ state for D 2 O can be determined to be v 2 = 1041.37 ± 0.71 cm −1 . From the TOF spectra, the product kinetic energy spectra, the vibrational state distributions of OD products, and the state resolved anisotropy parameters have been determined. The experimental results indicate a dramatic variation in the OD product state distributions for different rotational excitations. This illuminates that there are two distinctive coupling channels from the C ̃ (010) state to the low-lying electronic states: the homogeneous electronic coupling to the Ã 1 B 1 state, resulting in vibrationally hot OD(X) products, and the Coriolis-type coupling to the B ̃ 1 A 1 state, producing vibrationally cold but rotationally hot OD(X) and OD(A) products. Furthermore, the three-body dissociation channel is confirmed, which is attributed to the C ̃ → 1 A 2 or C ̃ → Ã pathway. In comparison with the previous results of D 2 O photolysis via the C ̃ (000) state, it is found that the v 2 vibration of the parent molecule enhances both the vibrational and rotational excitations of OD products.},

  abstract = {Free energy calculation is fundamentally important in the research of physics, chemistry, and materials. Thermodynamic integration is the most common way to estimate free energies. In the research, we proposed a unified approach using atomic simulations to calculate the free energies of liquid and defective crystals. The new approach is based on thermodynamic integration using two alchemical pathways. Softcore potentials are developed for three-body interatomic potentials to realize the alchemical pathways. Employing the new approach, the free energy of the liquid can be calculated without requiring another reference system. The free energy of the defective crystal can be calculated directly at high temperatures. It avoids the singularity at the integration endpoint caused by the defect diffusion, which is a serious problem in the widely used Einstein crystal method. In addition, the new approach can capture the whole free energy of the defective crystal including the contribution of anharmonic and configurational entropy, which are particularly important at high temperatures. The new method is simple yet effective and can be extended to different materials and more complex liquid and defective crystal systems.},

The effective interaction can be attractive or repulsive, depending on the system parameters. The passive particles form four distinct structural orders for different system parameters, viz., homogeneous structures, disordered cluster, ordered cluster, and crystalline structure. The change in structure is dictated by the change in nature of the effective interaction. We further confirm the four structures using a full microscopic simulation of active and passive mixture.

  abstract = {In this work, we investigate the optimization of Hartree–Fock (HF) orbitals with our recently proposed combined first- and second-order (SO-SCI) method, which was originally developed for multi-configuration self-consistent field (MCSCF) and complete active space SCF (CASSCF) calculations. In MCSCF/CASSCF, it unites a second-order optimization of the active orbitals with a Fock-based first-order treatment of the remaining closed-virtual orbital rotations. In the case of the single-determinant wavefunctions, the active space is replaced by a preselected “second-order domain,” and all rotations involving orbitals in this subspace are treated at second-order. The method has been implemented for spin-restricted and spin-unrestricted Hartree–Fock (RHF, UHF), configuration-averaged Hartree–Fock (CAHF), as well as Kohn–Sham (KS) density functional theory (RKS, UKS). For each of these cases, various choices of the second-order domain have been tested, and appropriate defaults are proposed. The performance of the method is demonstrated for several transition metal complexes. It is shown that the SO-SCI optimization provides faster and more robust convergence than the standard SCF procedure but requires, in many cases, even less computation time. In difficult cases, the SO-SCI method not only speeds up convergence but also avoids convergence to saddle-points. Furthermore, it helps to find spin-symmetry broken solutions in the cases of UHF or UKS. In the case of CAHF, convergence can also be significantly improved as compared to a previous SCF implementation. This is particularly important for multi-center cases with two or more equal heavy atoms. The performance is demonstrated for various two-center complexes with different lanthanide atoms.},

Dissociation curves for hydrogen chains are computed with off-shell RG states and the antisymmetrized product of interacting geminals.

  abstract = {The influence of core–hole delocalization for x-ray photoelectron, x-ray absorption, and x-ray emission spectrum calculations is investigated in detail using approaches including response theory, transition-potential methods, and ground state schemes. The question of a localized/delocalized vacancy is relevant for systems with symmetrically equivalent atoms, as well as near-degeneracies that can distribute the core orbitals over several atoms. We show that the issues relating to core–hole delocalization are present for calculations considering explicit core–hole states, e.g., when using a core-excited or core-ionized reference state or for fractional occupation numbers. As electron correlation eventually alleviates the issues, but even when using coupled-cluster single-double and perturbative triple, there is a notable discrepancy between core-ionization energies obtained with localized and delocalized core–holes (0.5 eV for the carbon K -edge). Within density functional theory, the discrepancy correlates with the exchange interaction involving the core orbitals of the same spin symmetry as the delocalized core–hole. The use of a localized core–hole allows for a reasonably good inclusion of relaxation at a lower level of theory, whereas the proper symmetry solution involving a delocalized core–hole requires higher levels of theory to account for the correlation effects involved in orbital relaxation. For linear response methods, we further show that if x-ray absorption spectra are modeled by considering symmetry-unique sets of atoms, care has to be taken such that there are no delocalizations of the core orbitals, which would otherwise introduce shifts in absolute energies and relative features.},

  abstract = {Energy-related descriptors in machine learning are a promising strategy to predict adsorption properties of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) in the low-pressure regime. Interactions between hosts and guests in these systems are typically expressed as a sum of dispersion and electrostatic potentials. The energy landscape of dispersion potentials plays a crucial role in defining Henry’s constants for simple probe molecules in MOFs. To incorporate more information about this energy landscape, we introduce the Gaussian-approximated Lennard-Jones (GALJ) potential, which fits pairwise Lennard-Jones potentials with multiple Gaussians by varying their heights and widths. The GALJ approach is capable of replicating information that can be obtained from the original LJ potentials and enables efficient development of Gaussian integral (GI) descriptors that account for spatial correlations in the dispersion energy environment. GI descriptors would be computationally inconvenient to compute using the usual direct evaluation of the dispersion potential energy surface. We show that these new GI descriptors lead to improvement in ML predictions of Henry’s constants for a diverse set of adsorbates in MOFs compared to previous approaches to this task.},

  abstract = {Standard quantum master equation techniques, such as the Redfield or Lindblad equations, are perturbative to second order in the microscopic system–reservoir coupling parameter λ . As a result, the characteristics of dissipative systems, which are beyond second order in λ , are not captured by such tools. Moreover, if the leading order in the studied effect is higher-than-quadratic in λ , a second-order description fundamentally fails even at weak coupling. Here, using the reaction coordinate (RC) quantum master equation framework, we are able to investigate and classify higher-than-second-order transport mechanisms. This technique, which relies on the redefinition of the system–environment boundary, allows for the effects of system–bath coupling to be included to high orders. We study steady-state heat current beyond second-order in two models: The generalized spin-boson model with non-commuting system–bath operators and a three-level ladder system. In the latter model, heat enters in one transition and is extracted from a different one. Crucially, we identify two transport pathways: (i) System’s current, where heat conduction is mediated by transitions in the system, with the heat current scaling as j q ∝ λ 2 to the lowest order in λ . (ii) Inter-bath current, with the thermal baths directly exchanging energy between them, facilitated by the bridging quantum system. To the lowest order in λ , this current scales as j q ∝ λ 4 . These mechanisms are uncovered and examined using numerical and analytical tools. We contend that the RC mapping brings, already at the level of the mapped Hamiltonian, much insight into transport characteristics.},

However, our atomistic understanding of the role of the cooperative effects induced by the Ni 5 Ga 3 alloy formation and its Ni 5 Ga 3 /ZrO 2 interface in the CO 2 reduction is still far from satisfactory. In this work, we tackle these questions by employing density functional theory calculations to investigate the adsorption properties of key CO 2 reduction intermediates (CO 2 , H 2 , cis -COOH, trans -COOH, HCOO, CO, HCO, and COH) on Ni 8 , Ga 8 , Ni 5 Ga 3 , (ZrO 2 ) 16 , and Ni 5 Ga 3 /(ZrO 2 ) 16 . We found that Ni containing clusters tended to assume wetting configurations on the (ZrO 2 ) 16 cluster, while the presence of Ga atoms weakens the adsorption energies on the oxide surface. We also observed that CO 2 was better activated on the metal–oxide interfaces and on the oxide surface, where it was able to form CO 3 -like structures. Meanwhile, H 2 activation was only observed on Ni sites, which indicates the importance of distinct adsorption sites that can favor different CO 2 reduction steps. Moreover, the formation of the metal–oxide interface showed to be beneficial for the adsorption of COOH isomers and unfavorable for the adsorption of HCOO.},

We confirm that IPs are typically sloppy, i.e., insensitive to coordinated changes in some parameter combinations. Because the inverse problem in such models is ill-conditioned, parameters are unidentifiable. This presents challenges for traditional statistical methods, as we demonstrate and interpret within both Bayesian and frequentist frameworks. We use information geometry to illuminate the underlying cause of this phenomenon and show that IPs have global properties similar to those of sloppy models from fields, such as systems biology, power systems, and critical phenomena. IPs correspond to bounded manifolds with a hierarchy of widths, leading to low effective dimensionality in the model. We show how information geometry can motivate new, natural parameterizations that improve the stability and interpretation of uncertainty quantification analysis and further suggest simplified, less-sloppy models.},

  abstract = {Kohn–Sham density-functional theory (DFT), the predominant framework for electronic structure computations in chemistry today, has undergone considerable evolution in the past few decades. The earliest DFT approximations were based on uniform electron gas models completely free of empirical parameters. Tremendous improvements were made by incorporating density gradients and a small number of parameters, typically one or two, obtained from fits to atomic data. Incorporation of exact exchange and fitting to molecular data, such as experimental heats of formation, allowed even further improvements. This, however, opened a Pandora’s Box of fitting possibilities, given the limitless choices of chemical reactions that can be fit. The result is a recent explosion of DFT approximations empirically fit to hundreds, or thousands, of chemical reference data. These fitted density functionals may contain several dozen empirical parameters. What has been lost in this fitting trend is physical modeling based on theory . In this work, we present a density functional comprising our best efforts to model exchange–correlation in DFT using good theory. We compare its performance to that of heavily fit density functionals using the GMTKN55 chemical reference data of Goerigk and co-workers [Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 19 , 32184 (2017)]. Our density-functional theory, using only a handful of physically motivated pre-factors, competes with the best heavily fit Kohn–Sham functionals in the literature.},

We report a high-level ab initio study that quantifies the many-body nature of Ce–O bonding with the coordination environment of the Ce center and particularly the roles of the 4 f orbitals. The growing significance of the overlap between Ce 4 f and O 2 p orbitals with the increasing coordination of Ce atoms enhances Ce–O bond covalency and in return directs the molecular geometry. Upon partial reduction from neutral to anionic ceria, the excessive electrons populate the Ce-centered localized 4 f orbital. The interplay between the admixture and localization of the 4 f -block dually modulates bonding patterns of cerium oxide molecules, underlying the importance of many-body interactions between ligands and various lanthanide elements.},

  abstract = {Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) based approaches have been developed in recent years to model the excited-state properties and transition processes of the molecules in the gas-phase and in a condensed medium, such as in a solution and protein microenvironment or near semiconductor and metal surfaces. In the latter case, usually, classical embedding models have been adopted to account for the molecular environmental effects, leading to the multi-scale approaches of TDDFT/polarizable continuum model (PCM) and TDDFT/molecular mechanics (MM), where a molecular system of interest is designated as the quantum mechanical region and treated with TDDFT, while the environment is usually described using either a PCM or (non-polarizable or polarizable) MM force fields. In this Perspective, we briefly review these TDDFT-related multi-scale models with a specific emphasis on the implementation of analytical energy derivatives, such as the energy gradient and Hessian, the nonadiabatic coupling, the spin–orbit coupling, and the transition dipole moment as well as their nuclear derivatives for various radiative and radiativeless transition processes among electronic states. Three variations of the TDDFT method, the Tamm–Dancoff approximation to TDDFT, spin–flip DFT, and spin-adiabatic TDDFT, are discussed. Moreover, using a model system (pyridine–Ag 20 complex), we emphasize that caution is needed to properly account for system–environment interactions within the TDDFT/MM models. Specifically, one should appropriately damp the electrostatic embedding potential from MM atoms and carefully tune the van der Waals interaction potential between the system and the environment. We also highlight the lack of proper treatment of charge transfer between the quantum mechanics and MM regions as well as the need for accelerated TDDFT modelings and interpretability, which calls for new method developments.},

Photoactive yellow protein’s (PYP) reversible photocycle encompasses picosecond isomerization of the light-absorbing chromophore as well as large scale protein backbone motions occurring on a millisecond timescale. Femtosecond-to-millisecond time-resolved mid-infrared spectroscopy is employed here to uncover structural details of photocycle intermediates up to chromophore protonation and the first structural changes leading to the formation of the partially unfolded signaling state pB. The data show that a commonly thought stable transient photocycle intermediate is actually formed after a sequence of several smaller structural changes. We provide residue-specific spectroscopic evidence that protonation of the chromophore on a few hundreds of microseconds timescale is delayed with respect to deprotonation of the nearby E46 residue. That implies that the direct proton donor is not E46 but most likely a water molecule. Such details may assist the ongoing photocycle and protein folding simulation efforts on the complex and wide time-spanning photocycle of the model system PYP.},

The varying light sequences mimic natural conditions, allowing us to probe the real-time response of non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) pathways. Durations of fluctuating light exposure during a fixed total experimental time and prior light exposure of the algae are both found to have a profound effect on NPQ. These observations are rationalized with a quantitative model based on the xanthophyll cycle and the protonation of LHCX1. The model is able to accurately describe the dynamics of non-photochemical quenching across a variety of light sequences. The combined model and observations suggest that the accumulation of a quenching complex, likely zeaxanthin bound to a protonated LHCX1, is responsible for the gradual rise in NPQ. Additionally, the model makes specific predictions for the light sequence dependence of xanthophyll concentrations that are in reasonable agreement with independent chromatography measurements taken during a specific light/dark sequence.},

  abstract = {CP29, a chlorophyll a / b -xanthophyll binding protein, bridges energy transfer between the major LHCII antenna complexes and photosystem II reaction centers. It hosts one of the two identified quenching sites, making it crucial for regulated photoprotection mechanisms. Until now, the photophysics of CP29 has been studied on the purified protein in detergent solutions since spectrally overlapping signals affect in vivo measurements. However, the protein in detergent assumes non-native conformations compared to its physiological state in the thylakoid membrane. Here, we report a detailed photophysical study on CP29 inserted in discoidal lipid bilayers, known as nanodiscs, which mimic the native membrane environment. Using picosecond time-resolved fluorescence and femtosecond transient absorption (TA), we observed shortening of the Chl fluorescence lifetime with a decrease of the carotenoid triplet formation yield for CP29 in nanodiscs as compared to the protein in detergent. Global analysis of TA data suggests a 1 Chl* quenching mechanism dependent on excitation energy transfer to a carotenoid dark state, likely the proposed S*, which is believed to be formed due to a carotenoid conformational change affecting the S 1 state. We suggest that the accessibility of the S* state in different local environments plays a key role in determining the quenching of Chl excited states. In vivo , non-photochemical quenching is activated by de-epoxidation of violaxanthin into zeaxanthin. CP29-zeaxanthin in nanodiscs further shortens the Chl lifetime, which underlines the critical role of zeaxanthin in modulating photoprotection activity.},

This strategy saves time and resources when creating new polymers with improved properties that are increasingly demanded by the market. A quantitative structure–property relationship (QSPR) model for tensile strength at break is presented in this work. The QSPR methodology applied here is based on machine learning tools, visual analytics methods, and expert-in-the-loop strategies. From the whole study, a QSPR model composed of five molecular descriptors that achieved a correlation coefficient of 0.9226 is proposed. We applied visual analytics tools at two levels of analysis: a more general one in which models are discarded for redundant information metrics and a deeper one in which a chemistry expert can make decisions on the composition of the model in terms of subsets of molecular descriptors, from a physical-chemical point of view. In this way, with the present work, we close a contribution cycle to polymer informatics, providing QSPR models oriented to the prediction of mechanical properties related to the tensile test.},

  abstract = {A deep understanding for collective behavior in an active matter system with complex interactions has far-reaching impact in biology. In the present work, we adopt Langevin dynamics simulations to investigate diffusion dynamics and phase separation in an anisotropic active particle system with a tunable biased angle α defined as the deviation between the active force direction and anisotropic orientation. Our results demonstrate that the biased angle can induce super-rotational diffusion dynamics characterized by a power-law relationship between the mean square angle displacement (MSAD) and the time interval Δ t in the form of MSAD ∼ Δ t β with β &gt; 1 and also result in non-trivial phase separation kinetics. As activity is dominant, nucleation time shows a non-monotonic dependence on the biased angle. Moreover, there arises a distinct transition of phase separation, from spinodal decomposition without apparent nucleation time to binodal decomposition with prominent nucleation delay. A significant inhibition effect occurs at right and obtuse angles, where the remarkable super-rotational diffusion prevents particle aggregation, leading to a slow nucleation process. As active force is competitive to anisotropic interactions, the system is almost homogeneous, while, intriguingly, we observe a re-entrant phase separation as a small acute angle is introduced. The prominent super-rotational diffusion under small angles provides an optimum condition for particle adsorption and cluster growth and, thus, accounts for the re-entrance of phase separation. A consistent scenario for the physical mechanism of our observations is achieved by properly considering the modulation of the biased angle on the interplay between activity and anisotropic interactions.},

  abstract = {Assignment and interpretation of the sum-frequency generation vibrational spectra (SFG-VS) depend on the ability to measure and understand the factors affecting the SFG-VS spectral line shape accurately and reliably. In the past, the formulation of the polarization selection rules for SFG-VS and the development of the sub-wavenumber high-resolution broadband SFG-VS (HR-BB-SFG-VS) have provided solutions for many of these needs. However, despite these advantages, HR-BB-SFG-VS have not been widely adopted. The majority of SFG measurements so far still relies on the picosecond (ps) scanning SFG-VS or the conventional broadband SFG-VS (BB-SFG-VS) with the spectral resolution around (mostly above) 10 cm −1 , which also results in less ideal spectral line shape in the SFG spectra due to the temporal and chirp effects of the laser pulses used in experiment. In this study, the temporal and the chirp effects of laser pulses with different profiles in the SFG experiment on the measured SFG-VS spectral line shape are examined through spectral simulation. In addition, the experimental data of a classical model system, i.e., octadecyltrichlorosilane monolayer on glass, obtained from the ps scanning SFG-VS, the BB-SFG-VS, and the HR-BB-SFG-VS measurements are directly compared and examined. These results show that temporal and chirp effects are often significant in the conventional BB-SFG-VS, resulting in line shape distortions and peak position shifts besides spectral broadening. Such temporal and chirp effects are less significant in the ps scanning SFG-VS. For the HR-BB-SFG-VS, spectral broadening and temporal and chirp effects are insignificant, making HR-BB-SFG-VS the choice for accurate and reliable measurement and analysis of SFG-VS.},

  abstract = {Plasmon-driven photocatalysis has emerged as a paradigm-shifting approach, based on which the energy of photons can be judiciously harnessed to trigger interfacial molecular transformations on metallic nanostructure surfaces in a regioselective manner with nanoscale precision. Over the past decade, the formation of aromatic azo compounds through plasmon-driven oxidative coupling of thiolated aniline-derivative adsorbates has become a testbed for developing detailed mechanistic understanding of plasmon-mediated photochemistry. Such photocatalytic bimolecular coupling reactions may occur not only between thiolated aniline-derivative adsorbates but also between their nonthiolated analogs. How the nonthiolated adsorbates behave differently from their thiolated counterparts during the plasmon-driven coupling reactions, however, remains largely unexplored. Here, we systematically compare an alkynylated aniline-derivative, para -ethynylaniline, to its thiolated counterpart, para -mercaptoaniline, in terms of their adsorption conformations, structural flexibility, photochemical reactivity, and transforming kinetics on Ag nanophotocatalyst surfaces. We employ surface-enhanced Raman scattering as an in situ spectroscopic tool to track the detailed structural evolution of the transforming molecular adsorbates in real time during the plasmon-driven coupling reactions. Rigorous analysis of the spectroscopic results, further aided by density functional theory calculations, lays an insightful knowledge foundation that enables us to elucidate how the alteration of the chemical nature of metal–adsorbate interactions profoundly influences the transforming behaviors of the molecular adsorbates during plasmon-driven photocatalytic reactions.},

  abstract = {The transform technique applied to the analysis of doubly resonant sum-frequency generation (DR-SFG) spectra is extended to include Herzberg–Teller (HT) vibronic modes. The experimentally measured overlap spectral function generates all the energy resonant amplitudes of the DR-SFG excitation function for both Franck–Condon (FC) and HT modes. When FC modes dominate the DR-SFG spectra, a methodology is provided to perform efficient curve fitting and orientation analysis in order to extract FC activities of the various vibration modes from experimental spectra with the help of a molecular model. Determination of the FC or HT natures of the vibration modes from DR-SFG data is also shown to be possible through their visible line shapes with an appropriate choice of polarizations. As an example, experimental DR-SFG data suggest that a known HT-active mode in the vibronic structure of Rhodamine 6G monomers exhibits a FC behavior in molecular aggregates.},

  abstract = {Nanopores in graphene, a 2D material, are currently being explored for various applications, such as gas separation, water desalination, and DNA sequencing. The shapes and sizes of nanopores play a major role in determining the performance of devices made out of graphene. However, given an arbitrary nanopore shape, anticipating its creation probability and formation time is a challenging inverse problem, solving which could help develop theoretical models for nanoporous graphene and guide experiments in tailoring pore sizes/shapes. In this work, we develop a machine learning framework to predict these target variables, i.e., formation probabilities and times, based on data generated using kinetic Monte Carlo simulations and chemical graph theory. Thereby, we enable the rapid quantification of the ease of formation of a given nanopore shape in graphene via silicon-catalyzed electron-beam etching and provide an experimental handle to realize it, in practice. We use structural features such as the number of carbon atoms removed, the number of edge atoms, the diameter of the nanopore, and its shape factor, which can be readily extracted from the nanopore shape. We show that the trained models can accurately predict nanopore probabilities and formation times with R 2 values on the test set of 0.97 and 0.95, respectively. Not only that, we obtain physical insight into the working of the model and discuss the role played by the various structural features in modulating nanopore formation. Overall, our work provides a solid foundation for experimental studies to manipulate nanopore sizes/shapes and for theoretical studies to consider realistic structures of nanopores in graphene.},

Our work reveals that the electrochemical performance of KTiOPO 4 as an anode for PIBs is superior to that for SIBs and LIBs, in terms of average voltage and ion diffusion kinetics. The ab initio molecular dynamics simulations indicate that the KTiOPO 4 M x anode exhibits high structural stability, and alkali ion intercalation contributes to accelerating ion diffusion during the charging process. Particularly, the low activation energy of 0.406 eV of K migration on surface KTP(210), obtained by the climbing-image nudged elastic band method, suggests a high-rate capability. The systematical comparison of the performance of KTiOPO 4 as an anode for PIBs, SIBs, and LIBs on the theoretical perspective clarifies that a large channel is not always promising for small radius ion intercalation and diffusion.},

It is a property of crucial importance to study heat transfer processes at both macro- and nanoscales. Therefore, it is essential to accurately model the specific interactions between solids and liquids. Here, we investigate the thermal conductance of gold–water interfaces using polarizable and non-polarizable models. Both models have been fitted to reproduce the interfacial tension of the gold–water interface, but they predict significantly different ITCs. We demonstrate that the treatment of polarization using Drude-like models, widely employed in molecular simulations, leads to a coupling of the solid and liquid vibrational modes that give rise to a significant overestimation of the ITCs. We analyze the dependence of the vibrational coupling with the mass of the Drude particle and propose a solution to the artificial enhancement of the ITC, preserving at the same time the polarization response of the solid. Based on our calculations, we estimate ITCs of 200 MW/(m 2 K) for the water–gold interface. This magnitude is comparable to that reported recently for gold–water interfaces [279 ± 16 MW/(m 2 K)] using atomic fluctuating charges to account for the polarization contribution.},

The competing effect of water molecules for the available hydrogen bonding sites determines the evolution of the properties upon water sorption.

This structure is characterized by two length scales, ξ s and ξ G : ξ s measures the length of heterogeneities in the network structure and ξ G is the size of glassy clusters. Accordingly, the vibrational states (eigenmodes) of such a material also exhibit a multiscale nature with two characteristic frequencies, ω * and ω G , which are associated with ξ s and ξ G , respectively: (i) phonon-like vibrations in the homogeneous medium at ω ω G . Here, we demonstrate that the multiscale characteristics seen in the static structures and vibrational states also extend to the phonon transport properties. Phonon transport exhibits two distinct crossovers at frequencies ω * and ω G (or at wavenumbers of ∼ ξ s − 1 and ∼ ξ G − 1 ⁠ ). In particular, both transverse and longitudinal phonons cross over between Rayleigh scattering at ω ω * ⁠ . Remarkably, the Ioffe–Regel limit is located at the very low frequency of ω * . Thus, phonon transport is localized above ω * , even where phonon-like vibrational states persist. This markedly strong scattering behavior is caused by the sparse, porous structure of the gel.},

This indicates that the transfer state in the dimer of Cs 3 D(SeO 4 ) 2 is dominated by a deuteron hopping in contrast to Cs 3 H(SeO 4 ) 2 , where a proton hopping makes a tiny contribution compared to a phonon-assisted proton tunneling (PAPT) associated with 440-cm −1 def bend .

These methods include both increasingly complex machine learning techniques and increasingly sophisticated descriptors used to describe the environment around particles. In many cases, both the chosen machine learning technique and choice of structural descriptors are varied simultaneously, making it hard to quantitatively compare the performance of different machine learning approaches. Here, we use three different machine learning algorithms—linear regression, neural networks, and graph neural networks—to predict the dynamic propensity of a glassy binary hard-sphere mixture using as structural input a recursive set of order parameters recently introduced by Boattini et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 127 , 088007 (2021)]. As we show, when these advanced descriptors are used, all three methods predict the dynamics with nearly equal accuracy.

PIMD simulations are performed using different values of Planck’s constant h , allowing us to study the behavior of the liquid as nuclear quantum effects (NQE, i.e., atoms delocalization) are introduced, from the classical liquid ( h = 0) to increasingly quantum liquids ( h &gt; 0). By combining the PIMD simulations with the ring-polymer molecular dynamics method, we also explore the dynamics of the classical and quantum liquids. We find that (i) the glass transition temperature of the low-density liquid (LDL) is anomalous, i.e., T g LDL ( P ) decreases upon compression. Instead, (ii) the glass transition temperature of the high-density liquid (HDL) is normal, i.e., T g HDL ( P ) increases upon compression. (iii) NQE shift both T g LDL ( P ) and T g HDL ( P ) toward lower temperatures, but NQE are more pronounced on HDL. We also study the glass behavior of the ring-polymer systems associated with the quantum liquids studied (via the path-integral formulation of statistical mechanics). There are two glass states in all the systems studied, low-density amorphous ice (LDA) and high-density amorphous ice (HDA), which are the glass counterparts of LDL and HDL. In all cases, the pressure-induced LDA–HDA transformation is sharp, reminiscent of a first-order phase transition. In the low-quantum regime, the LDA–HDA transformation is reversible, with identical LDA forms before compression and after decompression. However, in the high-quantum regime, the atoms become more delocalized in the final LDA than in the initial LDA, raising questions on the reversibility of the LDA–HDA transformation.},

Their structures and properties can be tuned by means of external perturbations, thus further broadening their applications. Herein, forces proportional to atomic mass (mass-related field) and atomic charge (electric field) are applied in molecular dynamics simulations to the IL 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide to investigate the origin of the resulting changes in structures and dynamics. The results show that both electric and mass-related fields cause the ion cages to expand and deform, eventually leading to their breakdown to produce a transformation of ILs from the cage structure to a channel-like structure, which results in faster self-diffusion of ions in the directions of the applied force and to a lesser extent other directions. Further comparison of electric and mass-related fields demonstrates that only the electric fields reorientate cations to produce a hydrodynamically favored conformation in the force direction, which shows faster diffusion. The cis isomer of the anion is preferred in the presence of the electric fields, whereas applying the forces proportional to mass does not change the anion conformer equilibrium significantly. The results presented in this work aid in the understanding of how ions adjust their structures to adapt to external perturbations and facilitate the application of ILs as electrolytes.},

To better understand the chemistry of sulfur in the interstellar medium, further abundance modeling using the actual NS + collisional rate coefficients is needed. For this purpose, we have computed the first full 4D potential energy surface of the NS + –H 2 van der Waals complex using the explicitly correlated coupled cluster approach with single, double, and non-iterative triple excitation in conjunction with the augmented-correlation consistent-polarized valence triple zeta basis set. The potential energy surface exhibits a global minimum of 848.24 cm −1 for a planar configuration of the complex. The long-range interaction energy, described using multipolar moments, is sensitive to the orientation of H 2 up to radial distances of ∼50 a 0 . From this new interaction potential, we derived excitation cross sections, induced by collision with ortho - and para -H 2 , for the 15 low-lying rotational levels of NS + using the quantum mechanical close-coupling approach. By thermally averaging these data, we determined downward rate coefficients for temperatures up to 50 K. By comparing them with the previous NS + –H 2 data, we demonstrated that reduced dimensional approaches are not suited for this system. In addition, we found that the CS collisional data underestimate our results by up to an order of magnitude. The differences clearly indicate that the abundance of NS + , in cold dense clouds retrieved from observational spectra, must be reassessed using these new collisional rate coefficients.},

We present a detailed high-resolution rovibrational analysis for cis -formic acid species in the OH stretch ( ν 1 ) fundamental, providing first precision vibrational band origin, rotational constants, and term values, which in conjunction with ab initio calculations at the couple-cluster with single, double, and perturbative triple [CCSD(T)]/ANOn (n = 0, 1, 2) level support the experimental assignments and establish critical points on the potential energy surface for internal rotor trans-to-cis isomerization. Relative intensities for a- and b-type transitions observed in the spectra permit the transition dipole moment components to be determined in the body fixed frame and prove to be in good agreement with ab initio CCSD(T) theoretical estimates but in poor agreement with simple bond-dipole predictions. The observed signal dependence on H 2 in the discharge suggests the presence of a novel H atom radical chemical mechanism for strongly endothermic “up-hill” internal rotor isomerization between trans - and cis -formic acid conformers.},

  abstract = {Interest in ab initio property prediction of π -conjugated polymers for technological applications places significant demand on “cost-effective” and conceptual computational methods, particularly effective, one-particle theories. This is particularly relevant in the case of Kohn–Sham Density Functional Theory (KS-DFT) and its new competitors that arise from correlated orbital theory, the latter defining the QTP family of DFT functionals. This study presents large, ab initio equation of motion-coupled cluster calculations using the massively parallel ACESIII to target the fundamental bandgap of two prototypical organic polymers, trans -polyacetylene (tPA) and polyacene (Ac), and provides an assessment of the new quantum theory project (QTP) functionals for this problem. Further results focusing on the 1 A g ( 1 A g ), 1 B u ( 1 B 2 u ), and 3 B u ( 3 B 2 u ) excited states of tPA (Ac) are also presented. By performing calculations on oligomers of increasing size, extrapolations to the thermodynamic limit for the fundamental and all excitation gaps, as well as estimations of the exciton binding energy, are made. Thermodynamic-limit results for a combination of “optimal” and model geometries are presented. Calculated results for excitations that are adequately described using a single-particle model illustrate the benefits of requiring a KS-DFT functional to satisfy the Bartlett ionization potential theorem.},

Spectroscopic transitions between rovibrational states of ortho and para water are extremely weak due to the tiny hyperfine nuclear-spin – rotation interaction of only ∼30 kHz and, so far, have not been observed. We report the first comprehensive theoretical investigation of the hyperfine effects and ortho–para transitions in H 2 16 O due to nuclear-spin – rotation and spin–spin interactions. We also present the details of our newly developed general variational approach to the simulation of hyperfine effects in polyatomic molecules. Our results for water suggest that the strongest ortho–para transitions with room-temperature intensities on the order of 10 −31 cm/molecule are about an order of magnitude larger than previously predicted values and should be detectable in the mid-infrared ν 2 and near-infrared 2 ν 1 + ν 2 and ν 1 + ν 2 + ν 3 bands by current spectroscopy experiments.},

Recently, it was found that electron impact ionization of ethylene clusters embedded in helium droplets produces diverse carbocations containing three and four carbon atoms, indicating effective ion–molecule reactions. In this work, similar experiments are reported but with the saturated hydrocarbon precursor of ethane. In distinction to ethylene, no characteristic bands of larger covalently bound carbocations were found, indicating inefficient ion–molecule reactions. Instead, the ionization in helium droplets leads to formation of weaker bound dimers, such as (C 2 H 6 )(C 2 H 4 ) + , (C 2 H 6 )(C 2 H 5 ) + , and (C 2 H 6 )(C 2 H 6 ) + , as well as larger clusters containing several ethane molecules attached to C 2 H 4 + , C 2 H 5 + , and C 2 H 6 + ionic cores.

  abstract = {Redistribution of vibrational energy in the adenine–uracil base pair is studied when the base pair undergoes an intermolecular interaction with an overtone-bending vibration excited H 2 O(2 ν bend ) molecule. Energy transfer is calculated using the structural information obtained from density functional theory in the solution of the equations of motion. Intermolecular vibrational energy transfer (VET) from H 2 O(2 ν bend ) to the uracil–NH stretching mode is efficient and rapidly followed by intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution (IVR) resulting from coupling between vibrational modes. An important pathway is IVR carrying energy to the NH-stretching mode of the adenine moiety in a subpicosecond scale, the energy build-up being sigmoidal, when H 2 O interacts with the uracil–NH bond. The majority of intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the base pair and H 2 O are weakened but unbroken during the ultrafast energy redistribution period. Lifetimes of intermolecular HB are on the order of 0.5 ps. The efficiency of IVR in the base pair is due to near-resonance between coupled CC and CN vibrations. The resonance also exists between the frequencies of H 2 O bend and NH stretch, thus facilitating VET. When H 2 O interacts with the NH bond at the adenine end of the base pair, energy flow in the reverse direction to the uracil–NH stretch is negligible, the unidirectionality discussed in terms of the effects of uracil CH stretches. The energy distributed in the CH bonds is found to be significant. The IVR process is found to be nearly temperature independent between 200 and 400 K.},

The D 0 data were obtained for a set of mid-sized organic dimers in their global minima which was located using geometry optimizations that applied ample basis sets together with either the conventional second-order Møller–Plesset (MP2) method or several dispersion-corrected density-functional theory (DFT-D) schemes. The harmonic vibrational zero-point (VZP) and deformation energies from the MP2 calculations were combined with electronic energies from the coupled cluster theory with singles, doubles, and iterative triples [CCSD(T)] extrapolated to the complete basis set (CBS) limit to estimate D 0 with the aim of inspecting values that were most recently measured, and an analogous comparison was performed using the DFT-D data. In at least one case (namely, for the aniline⋯methane cluster), the D 0 estimate that employed the CCSD(T)/CBS energies differed from experiment in the way that could not be explained by a possible deficiency in the VZP contribution. Curiously, one of the DFT-D schemes (namely, the B3LYP-D3/def2-QZVPPD) was able to reproduce all measured D 0 values to within 1.0 kJ/mol from experimental error bars. These findings show the need for further measurements and computations of some of the complexes. In order to facilitate such studies, the physical nature of intermolecular interactions in the investigated dimers was analyzed by means of the DFT-based symmetry-adapted perturbation theory.},

The orientation of a polyatomic molecule is a challenging task, which is at the heart of its quantum control and crucial for many subsequent applications in various fields. Most recent studies focus on the temporary orientation achieved via the quantum revivals. In this study, we reveal the underlying mechanism behind the observed permanent orientation and discuss strategies for a higher degree of permanent orientation. By a careful analysis of symmetry and unitary, it is possible to estimate an upper bound of ⟨ ⟨ cos θ ⟩ ⟩ &lt; ( 2 − 2 ) / 4 ≈ 0.1464 for a molecule in its thermal equilibrium states using a linear field. We show that this bound can be reached for an oblate symmetric-top molecule in the high temperature limit. To demonstrate different possible schemes, we take CHCl 3 as an example. Simply with designed microwave fields, one can permanently orient CHCl 3 with a degree of ⟨cos θ ⟩ ≈ 0.045. We show that this value can be significantly increased by adding one or more pump pulses.},

This method is based on an iterative procedure using linear response to update potentials. All involved quantities, i.e., orbitals, potentials, and response functions, are represented by Gaussian basis functions. In contrast to previous KS inversion methods relying on Gaussian basis sets, the method presented here is numerically stable even for standard basis sets from basis set libraries due to a preprocessing of the auxiliary basis used to represent an exchange–correlation charge density that generates the exchange–correlation potential. The new KS inversion method is applied to reference densities of various atoms and molecules obtained by full configuration interaction or CCSD(T) (coupled cluster singles doubles perturbative triples). The considered examples encompass cases known to be difficult, such as stretched hydrogen or lithium hydride molecules or the beryllium isoelectronic series. For the stretched hydrogen molecule, potentials of benchmark quality are obtained by employing large basis sets. For the carbon monoxide molecule, we show that the correlation potential from the random phase approximation (RPA) is in excellent qualitative and quantitative agreement with the correlation potential from the KS inversion of a CCSD(T) reference density. This indicates that RPA correlation potentials, in contrast to those from semi-local density-functionals, resemble the exact correlation potential. Besides providing exchange–correlation potentials for benchmark purposes, the proposed KS inversion method may be used in density-partition-based quantum embedding and in subsystem density-functional methods because it combines numerical stability with computational efficiency.},

  abstract = {According to Ruedenberg’s classic treatise on the theory of chemical bonding [K. Ruedenberg, Rev. Mod. Phys. 34 , 326–376 (1962)], orbital contraction is an integral consequence of covalent bonding. While the concept is clear, its quantification by quantum chemical calculations is not straightforward, except for the simplest of molecules, such as H 2 + and H 2 . This paper proposes a new, yet simple, approach to the problem, utilizing the modified atomic orbital (MAO) method of Ehrhardt and Ahlrichs [Theor. Chim. Acta 68 , 231 (1985)]. Through the use of MAOs, which are an atom-centered minimal basis formed from the molecular and atomic density operators, the wave functions of the species of interest are re-expanded, allowing the computation of the kinetic energy (and any other expectation value) of free and bonded fragments. Thus, it is possible to quantify the intra- and interfragment changes in kinetic energy, i.e., the effects of contraction. Computations are reported for a number of diatomic molecules H 2 , Li 2 , B 2 , C 2 , N 2 , O 2 , F 2 , CO, P 2 , and Cl 2 and the polyatomics CH 3 –CH 3 , CH 3 –SiH 3 , CH 3 –OH, and C 2 H 5 –C 2 H 5 (where the single bonds between the heavy atoms are studied) as well as dimers of He, Ne, Ar, and the archetypal ionic molecule NaCl. In all cases, it is found that the formation of a covalent bond is accompanied by an increase in the intra-fragment kinetic energy, an indication of orbital contraction and/or deformation.},

The computational downside of this formalism is that trajectories of individual Gaussians are solutions of a coupled system of differential equations, limiting implementation to serial propagation algorithms. To allow for parallelization and acceleration of the computation, independent trajectories based on simplified equations of motion were suggested. Unfortunately, within practical realizations involving finite Gaussian bases, this simplification leads to breaking the energy conservation. We offer a solution for this problem by using Lagrange multipliers to ensure the energy and norm conservation regardless of basis function trajectories or basis completeness.

  abstract = {We present the theory, implementation, and benchmark results for a frozen natural spinors based reduced cost four-component relativistic coupled cluster method. The natural spinors are obtained by diagonalizing the one-body reduced density matrix from a relativistic second-order Møller–Plesset calculation based on a four-component Dirac–Coulomb Hamiltonian. The correlation energy in the coupled cluster method converges more rapidly with respect to the size of the virtual space in the frozen natural spinor basis than that observed in the standard canonical spinors obtained from the Dirac–Hartree–Fock calculation. The convergence of properties is not smooth in the frozen natural spinor basis. However, the inclusion of the perturbative correction smoothens the convergence of the properties with respect to the size of the virtual space in the frozen natural spinor basis and greatly reduces the truncation errors in both energy and property calculations. The accuracy of the frozen natural spinor based coupled cluster methods can be controlled by a single threshold and is a black box to use.},

In particular, we focus on how the interaction with the photonic mode changes the vibrational spectroscopic signature of the electronic state and how this is affected when tuning the cavity frequency and the light–matter coupling strength. For this purpose, we consider different methodologies and investigate the validity of the Born–Oppenheimer approximation in such situations.},

The establishment of the whole framework relies on a general reciprocal-space expression and a generalized Wick’s theorem for the static disorder. Since the numerical cost is independent of the system size, various physical quantities, such as the thermally averaged coherence, Matsubara one-particle Green’s function, and current autocorrelation function, can be efficiently evaluated in the thermodynamic limit (infinite in the system size). The validity and performance of the proposed approach are systematically examined in a broad parameter regime. This approach, combined with proper numerical analytic continuation methods and first-principles calculations, is expected to be a versatile tool toward the calculation of various transport properties, such as mobilities in realistic semiconductors involving multiple electronic energy bands, high-frequency optical and low-frequency acoustic phonons, different forms of dynamic and static disorders, and anisotropy.},

Many types of models rely on descriptions of atom-centered environments, which are associated with an atomic property or with an atomic contribution to an extensive macroscopic quantity. Frameworks in this class can be understood in terms of atom-centered density correlations (ACDC), which are used as a basis for a body-ordered, symmetry-adapted expansion of the targets. Several other schemes that gather information on the relationship between neighboring atoms using “message-passing” ideas cannot be directly mapped to correlations centered around a single atom. We generalize the ACDC framework to include multi-centered information, generating representations that provide a complete linear basis to regress symmetric functions of atomic coordinates, and provide a coherent foundation to systematize our understanding of both atom-centered and message-passing and invariant and equivariant machine-learning schemes.},

  abstract = {The ab initio elongation (ELG) method based on a polymerization concept is a feasible way to perform linear-scaling electronic structure calculations for huge aperiodic molecules while maintaining computational accuracy. In the method, the electronic structures are sequentially elongated by repeating (1) the conversion of canonical molecular orbitals (CMOs) to region-localized MOs (RLMOs), that is, active RLMOs localized onto a region close to an attacking monomer or frozen RLMOs localized onto the remaining region, and the subsequent (2) partial self-consistent-field calculations for an interaction space composed of the active RLMOs and the attacking monomer. For each ELG process, one can obtain local CMOs for the interaction space and the corresponding local orbital energies. Local site information, such as the local highest-occupied/lowest-unoccupied MOs, can be acquired with linear-scaling efficiency by correctly including electronic effects from the frozen region. In this study, we performed a local electronic structure analysis using the ELG method for various DNA block polymers with different sequential patterns. This benchmark aimed to confirm the effectiveness of the method toward the efficient detection of a singular local electronic structure in unknown systems as a future practical application. We discussed the high-throughput efficiency of our method and proposed a strategy to detect singular electronic structures by combining with a machine learning technique.},

Therefore, methods employed to search chemical space need to capture the bonding behavior for a wide range of molecules, including radicals. In this work, we investigate the ability of quantum alchemy to capture the bonding behavior of hypothetical chemical compounds, specifically diatomic molecules involving hydrogen with various electronic structures. We evaluate equilibrium bond lengths, ionization energies, and electron affinities of these fundamental systems. We compare and contrast how well manual quantum alchemy calculations, i.e., quantum mechanics calculations in which the nuclear charge is altered, and quantum alchemy approximations using a Taylor series expansion can predict these molecular properties. Our results suggest that while manual quantum alchemy calculations outperform Taylor series approximations, truncations of Taylor series approximations after the second order provide the most accurate Taylor series predictions. Furthermore, these results suggest that trends in quantum alchemy predictions are generally dependent on the predicted property (i.e., equilibrium bond length, ionization energy, or electron affinity). Taken together, this work provides insight into how quantum alchemy predictions using a Taylor series expansion may be applied to future studies of non-singlet systems as well as the challenges that remain open for predicting the bonding behavior of such systems.},

Automatic atom typing for an arbitrary molecule is often realized by rule-based algorithms, which have to manually encode rules for all types defined in this force field. These are time-consuming and force field-specific. In this study, a method that is independent of a specific force field based on graph representation learning is established for automatic atom typing. The topology adaptive graph convolution network (TAGCN) is found to be an optimal model. The model does not need manual enumeration of rules but can learn the rules just through training using typed molecules prepared during the development of a force field. The test on the CHARMM general force field gives a typing correctness of 91\%. A systematic error of typing by TAGCN is its inability of distinguishing types in rings or acyclic chains. It originates from the fundamental structure of graph neural networks and can be fixed in a trivial way. More importantly, analysis of the rationalization processes of these models using layer-wise relation propagation reveals how TAGCN encodes rules learned during training. Our model is found to be able to type using the local chemical environments, in a way highly in accordance with chemists’ intuition.},

Given the cooperative many-atom nature of these reaction processes, Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation of the associated dynamics is instructive. However, only quite restricted Density Functional Theory (DFT)-level ab initio MD is viable. Thus, for M = Ag and Cu, we instead utilize the DeePMD framework to develop machine-learning derived potentials, retaining near-DFT accuracy for the M–S systems, which should have broad applicability. These potentials are validated by comparison with DFT predictions for various key quantities related to the energetics of S on M(111) surfaces. The potentials are then utilized to perform extensive MD simulations elucidating the above diverse restructuring and reaction processes at step edges. Key observations from MD simulations include the formation of small metal–sulfur complexes, especially MS 2 ; development of a local reconstruction at A-steps featuring an S-decorated {100} motif; and 3D sulfide formation. Additional analysis yields further information on the kinetics for metal–sulfur complex formation, where these complexes can strongly enhance surface mass transport, and on the propensity for sulfide formation.},

When choosing kernels to use in reversible reactions, a key constraint is to ensure that detailed balance of spatial reaction fluxes holds at all points at equilibrium. In this work, we formulate a general partial-integral differential equation model that encompasses several of the commonly used contact reactivity (e.g., Smoluchowski-Collins-Kimball) and volume reactivity (e.g., Doi) particle models. From these equations, we derive a detailed balance condition for the reversible A + B ⇆ C reaction. In bounded domains with no-flux boundary conditions, when choosing unbinding kernels consistent with several commonly used binding kernels, we show that preserving detailed balance of spatial reaction fluxes at all points requires spatially varying unbinding rate functions near the domain boundary. Brownian dynamics simulation algorithms can realize such varying rates through ignoring domain boundaries during unbinding and rejecting unbinding events that result in product particles being placed outside the domain.},

  abstract = {In this work, we present a one-step second-order converger for state-specific (SS) and state-averaged (SA) complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) wave functions. Robust convergence is achieved through step restrictions using a trust-region augmented Hessian (TRAH) algorithm. To avoid numerical instabilities, an exponential parameterization of variational configuration parameters is employed, which works with a nonredundant orthogonal complement basis. This is a common approach for SS-CASSCF and is extended to SA-CASSCF wave functions in this work. Our implementation is integral direct and based on intermediates that are formulated in either the sparse atomic-orbital or small active molecular-orbital basis. Thus, it benefits from a combination with efficient integral decomposition techniques, such as the resolution-of-the-identity or the chain-of-spheres for exchange approximations. This facilitates calculations on large molecules, such as a Ni(II) complex with 231 atoms and 5154 basis functions. The runtime performance of TRAH-CASSCF is competitive with the other state-of-the-art implementations of approximate and full second-order algorithms. In comparison with a sophisticated first-order converger, TRAH-CASSCF calculations usually take more iterations to reach convergence and, thus, have longer runtimes. However, TRAH-CASSCF calculations still converge reliably to a true minimum even if the first-order algorithm fails.},

  abstract = {In this paper, a hybrid density functional valence bond method based on unpaired electron density, called λ-DFVB(U), is presented, which is a combination of the valence bond self-consistent field (VBSCF) method and Kohn–Sham density functional theory. In λ-DFVB(U), the double-counting error of electron correlation is mitigated by a linear decomposition of the electron–electron interaction using a parameter λ, which is a function of an index based on the number of effectively unpaired electrons. In addition, λ-DFVB(U) is based on the approximation that correlation functionals in KS-DFT only cover dynamic correlation and exchange functionals mimic some amount of static correlation. Furthermore, effective spin densities constructed from unpaired density are used to address the symmetry dilemma problem in λ-DFVB(U). The method is applied to test calculations of atomization energies, atomic excitation energies, and reaction barriers. It is shown that the accuracy of λ-DFVB(U) is comparable to that of CASPT2, while its computational cost is approximately the same as VBSCF.},

  abstract = {The search for new superhydrides, promising materials for both hydrogen storage and high temperature superconductivity, made great progress, thanks to atomistic simulations and Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP) algorithms. When they are combined with Density Functional Theory (DFT), these methods are highly reliable and often match a great part of the experimental results. However, systems of increasing complexity (number of atoms and chemical species) become rapidly challenging as the number of minima to explore grows exponentially with the number of degrees of freedom in the simulation cell. An efficient sampling strategy preserving a sustainable computational cost then remains to be found. We propose such a strategy based on an active-learning process where machine learning potentials and DFT simulations are jointly used, opening the way to the discovery of complex structures. As a proof of concept, this method is applied to the exploration of tin crystal structures under various pressures. We showed that the α phase, not included in the learning process, is correctly retrieved, despite its singular nature of bonding. Moreover, all the expected phases are correctly predicted under pressure (20 and 100 GPa), suggesting the high transferability of our approach. The method has then been applied to the search of yttrium superhydrides (YH x ) crystal structures under pressure. The YH 6 structure of space group Im-3m is successfully retrieved. However, the exploration of more complex systems leads to the appearance of a large number of structures. The selection of the relevant ones to be included in the active learning process is performed through the analysis of atomic environments and the clustering algorithm. Finally, a metric involving a distance based on x-ray spectra is introduced, which guides the structural search toward experimentally relevant structures. The global process (active-learning and new selection methods) is finally considered to explore more complex and unknown YH x phases, unreachable by former CSP algorithms. New complex phases are found, demonstrating the ability of our approach to push back the exponential wall of complexity related to CSP.},

  abstract = {Grid Inhomogeneous Solvation Theory (GIST) has proven useful to calculate localized thermodynamic properties of water around a solute. Numerous studies have leveraged this information to enhance structure-based binding predictions. We have recently extended GIST toward chloroform as a solvent to allow the prediction of passive membrane permeability. Here, we further generalize the GIST algorithm toward all solvents that can be modeled as rigid molecules. This restriction is inherent to the method and is already present in the inhomogeneous solvation theory. Here, we show that our approach can be applied to various solvent molecules by comparing the results of GIST simulations with thermodynamic integration (TI) calculations and experimental results. Additionally, we analyze and compare a matrix consisting of 100 entries of ten different solvent molecules solvated within each other. We find that the GIST results are highly correlated with TI calculations as well as experiments. For some solvents, we find Pearson correlations of up to 0.99 to the true entropy, while others are affected by the first-order approximation more strongly. The enthalpy-entropy splitting provided by GIST allows us to extend a recently published approach, which estimates higher order entropies by a linear scaling of the first-order entropy, to solvents other than water. Furthermore, we investigate the convergence of GIST in different solvents. We conclude that our extension to GIST reliably calculates localized thermodynamic properties for different solvents and thereby significantly extends the applicability of this widely used method.},

OO-DFT methods, however, require that each state be individually optimized. In this Communication, we present an approach to generate an approximate core-excited state density for use with the ROKS energy ansatz, which is capable of giving reasonable accuracy without requiring state-specific optimization. This is achieved by fully optimizing the core-hole through the core-ionized state, followed by the use of electron-addition configuration interaction singles to obtain the particle level. This hybrid approach can be viewed as a DFT generalization of the static-exchange (STEX) method and can attain ∼0.6 eV rms error for the K-edges of C–F through the use of local functionals, such as PBE and OLYP. This ROKS(STEX) approach can also be used to identify important transitions for full OO ROKS treatment and can thus help reduce the computational cost of obtaining OO-DFT quality spectra. ROKS(STEX), therefore, appears to be a useful technique for the efficient prediction of x-ray absorption spectra.},

Traditionally, EOM-CC is performed on a closed shell reference state that has a well-described single reference CC wavefunction. In this Communication, we attempt to use low spin open-shell states such as the M S = 0 triplet and open-shell singlet as a reference state. Using this intermediate excited state as a reference state provides us with the benefit of obtaining a doubly excited state, as a single excitation at the cost of EOM-CCSD.},

The excited-state fluorescence decay rate of these molecules is sensitive to the viscosity of their local environment, and by combining pulsed laser excitation with time-resolved fluorescence detection, we can measure viscosities with a time resolution of a few ns. We demonstrate this by measuring in real time the viscosity change in glycerol induced by a nanosecond temperature jump. This new approach makes it possible to measure the viscosity of extremely short-lived states of matter.},

  abstract = {Biotin-labeled proteins are widely used as tools to study protein–protein interactions and proximity in living cells. Proteomic methods broadly employ proximity-labeling technologies based on protein biotinylation in order to investigate the transient encounters of biomolecules in subcellular compartments. Biotinylation is a post-translation modification in which the biotin molecule is attached to lysine or tyrosine residues. So far, biotin-based technologies proved to be effective instruments as affinity and proximity tags. However, the influence of biotinylation on aspects such as folding, binding, mobility, thermodynamic stability, and kinetics needs to be investigated. Here, we selected two proteins [biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP) and FKBP3] to test the influence of biotinylation on thermodynamic and kinetic properties. Apo (without biotin) and holo (biotinylated) protein structures were used separately to generate all-atom structure-based model simulations in a wide range of temperatures. Holo BCCP contains one biotinylation site, and FKBP3 was modeled with up to 23 biotinylated lysines. The two proteins had their estimated thermodynamic stability changed by altering their energy landscape. In all cases, after comparison between the apo and holo simulations, differences were observed on the free-energy profiles and folding routes. Energetic barriers were altered with the density of states clearly showing changes in the transition state. This study suggests that analysis of large-scale datasets of biotinylation-based proximity experiments might consider possible alterations in thermostability and folding mechanisms imposed by the attached biotins.},

In addition, the theory provides analytical expressions for the spinodal corresponding to the onset of motility-induced phase separation and the associated critical point as well as for their dependence on the angular propulsion of the circle swimmers.

Using molecular dynamics of patchy colloids, we model a system of two species of proteins, giving origin to specific heterotypic bonds. We find that concentrations, together with valence and bond strength, control both the size and the growth time rate of the clusters. In particular, if one species is in large excess, it gradually saturates the binding sites of the other species; the system then becomes kinetically arrested and cluster coarsening slows down or stops, thus yielding effective size selection. This phenomenology is observed both in solid and fluid clusters, which feature additional generic homotypic interactions and are reminiscent of the ones observed on biological membranes.},

An individual microswimmer is represented by a squirmer, and various active-stress combinations in a dumbbell are considered. The squirmers are connected by a bond, which does not impose any geometrical restriction on the individual rotational motion. Our simulations reveal a strong influence of the squirmers’ flow fields on the orientation of their propulsion directions, their fluctuations, and the swimming behavior of a dumbbell. The properties of pusher–puller pairs with an equal magnitude of the active stresses depend only weakly on the stress magnitude. This is similar to dumbbells of microswimmers without hydrodynamic interactions. However, for non-equal stress magnitudes, the active stress implies strong orientational correlations of the swimmers’ propulsion directions with respect to each other, as well as the bond vector. The orientational coupling is most pronounced for pairs with large differences in the active-stress magnitude. The alignment of the squirmers’ propulsion directions with respect to each other is preferentially orthogonal in dumbbells with a strong pusher and weak puller, and antiparallel in the opposite case when the puller dominates. These strong correlations affect the active motion of dumbbells, which is faster for strong pushers and slower for strong pullers.},

  abstract = {We present an analytical model describing the transition to a strong coupling regime for an ensemble of emitters resonantly coupled to a localized surface plasmon in a metal–dielectric structure. The response of a hybrid system to an external field is determined by two distinct mechanisms involving collective states of emitters interacting with the plasmon mode. The first mechanism is the near-field coupling between the bright collective state and the plasmon mode, which underpins the energy exchange between the system components and gives rise to exciton-induced transparency minimum in scattering spectra in the weak coupling regime and to emergence of polaritonic bands as the system transitions to the strong coupling regime. The second mechanism is the Fano interference between the plasmon dipole moment and the plasmon-induced dipole moment of the bright collective state as the hybrid system interacts with the radiation field. The latter mechanism is greatly facilitated by plasmon-induced coherence in a system with the characteristic size below the diffraction limit as the individual emitters comprising the collective state are driven by the same alternating plasmon near field and, therefore, all oscillate in phase. This cooperative effect leads to scaling of the Fano asymmetry parameter and of the Fano function amplitude with the ensemble size, and therefore, it strongly affects the shape of scattering spectra for large ensembles. Specifically, with increasing emitter numbers, the Fano interference leads to a spectral weight shift toward the lower energy polaritonic band.},

As is shown, the temperature at the liquid–solid interface and then at the solidification front evolves in a non-monotone way, and when the solidification front appears and starts to move, its velocity is not a function of its temperature. The classical Stefan regime of solidification appears as a limit as the temperature at the solidification front evolves toward the melting temperature.},

Viewed from this perspective, the choline cation and the hydrogen bond donor glycerol, the two major constituents forming this deep eutectic solvent, were studied using nuclear magnetic resonance in a selective manner by means of suitably deuteron-labeled isotopologues. Carried out from far above to far below the glass transition temperature, measurements and analyses of the spin-lattice and spin-spin relaxation times reveal that the reorientational dynamics of the components, i.e., of glycerol as well as of chain deuterated choline chloride are slightly different. Possible implications of this finding regarding the hydrogen-bonding pattern in glyceline are discussed. Furthermore, the deuterated methyl groups in choline chloride are exploited as sensitive probes of glyceline’s supercooled and glassy states. Apart from spin relaxometry, a detailed line shape analysis of the CD 3 spectra yields valuable insights into the broad intermolecular and intramolecular energy barrier distributions present in this binary mixture.},

  abstract = {We characterize a concentrated 7.3 m CaCl 2 solution, combining neutron diffraction with chloride isotopic substitution (Cl-NDIS) in null water and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We elucidate the solution structure, thermodynamic properties, and extent of ion pairing previously suggested as concentration-dependent and often not observed at lower concentrations. Our Cl-NDIS measurements designate the solvent-shared ion pairing as dominant and the contact ion pairing (CIP) as insignificant even under conditions close to the solubility limit. The MD models parameterized against neutron diffraction with calcium isotopic substitution (Ca-NDIS) overestimate CIP despite successfully reproducing most of the Cl-NDIS signal. This drawback originates from the fact that Ca 2+ –Cl − interactions were primarily “hidden” in the Ca-NDIS signal due to overlapping with Ca 2+ –O w and Ca 2+ –H w contributions to the total scattering. Contrary, MD models with moderate CIP and possessing generally good performance at high concentrations fail to reproduce the NDIS measurements accurately. Therefore, the electronic polarization, introduced in most of the recent MD models via scaling ionic charges, resolves some but not all parameterization drawbacks. We conclude that despite improving the quality of MD models “on average,” the question “which model is the best” has not been answered but replaced by the question “which model is better for a given research.” An overall “good” model can still be inappropriate or, in some instances, “bad” and, unfortunately, produce erroneous results. The accurate interpretation of several NDIS datasets, complemented by MD simulations, can prevent such mistakes and help identify the strengths, weaknesses, and convenient applications for corresponding computational models.},

Although density functional theory-based ab initio simulations may circumvent this discrepancy, they are limited in terms of the relevant time and length scales associated with mixing phenomena. Here, we show that the many-body MB-nrg potential, designed to reproduce methane–water interactions with coupled cluster accuracy, successfully captures this phenomenon up to 3 GPa and 500 K with varying methane concentrations. Two-phase simulations and long time scales that are required to fully capture the mixing, affordable due to the speed and accuracy of the MBX software, are assessed. Constructing the methane–water equation of state across the phase diagram shows that the stable mixtures are denser than the sum of their parts at a given pressure and temperature. We find that many-body polarization plays a central role, enhancing the induced dipole moments of methane by 0.20 D during mixing under pressure. Overall, the mixed system adopts a denser state, which involves a significant enthalpic driving force as elucidated by a systematic many-body energy decomposition analysis.},

That model is characterized by additivity of the alpha and beta shear compliance and by a high-frequency decay of the alpha process in proportion to ω −1/2 , where ω is the angular frequency. The fits of the alpha part of this model to the DC704 and DC705 data are compared to fits by a Havriliak–Negami type model, a Barlow–Erginsav–Lamb model, and a Cole–Davidson type model.

It has been only recently applied to study nucleation and crystallization in glass-forming liquids such as silicates, but the optimal set of parameters to drive crystallization and obtain converged free energy surfaces is still unexplored. In this work, we systematically investigated the effects of the simulation conditions to efficiently study the thermodynamics and mechanism of crystallization in highly viscous systems. As a prototype system, we used fused silica, which easily crystallizes to β-cristobalite through MetaD simulations, owing to its simple microstructure. We investigated the influence of the height, width, and bias factor used to define the biasing Gaussian potential, as well as the effects of the temperature and system size on the results. Among these parameters, the bias factor and temperature seem to be most effective in sampling the free energy landscape of melt to crystal transition and reaching convergence more quickly. We also demonstrate that the temperature rescaling from T &gt; T m is a reliable approach to recover free energy surfaces below T m , provided that the temperature gap is below 600 K and the configurational space has been properly sampled. Finally, albeit a complete crystallization is hard to achieve with large simulation boxes, these can be reliably and effectively exploited to study the first stages of nucleation.},

  abstract = {Confined electromagnetic modes strongly couple to collective excitations in ensembles of quantum emitters, producing light–matter hybrid states known as polaritons. Under such conditions, the discrete multilevel spectrum of molecular systems offers an appealing playground for exploring multiphoton processes. This work contrasts predictions from the Tavis–Cummings model in which the material is a collection of two-level systems, with the implications of considering additional energy levels with harmonic and anharmonic structures. We discuss the exact eigenspectrum, up to the second excitation manifold, of an arbitrary number N of oscillators collectively coupled to a single cavity mode in the rotating-wave approximation. Elaborating on our group-theoretic approach [New J. Phys. 23 , 063081 (2021)], we simplify the brute-force diagonalization of N 2 × N 2 Hamiltonians to the eigendecomposition of, at most, 4 × 4 matrices for arbitrary N . We thoroughly discuss the eigenstates and the consequences of weak and strong anharmonicities. Furthermore, we find resonant conditions between bipolaritons and anharmonic transitions where two-photon absorption can be enhanced. Finally, we conclude that energy shifts in the polaritonic states induced by anharmonicities become negligible for large N . Thus, calculations with a single or few quantum emitters qualitatively fail to represent the nonlinear optical response of the collective strong coupling regime. Our work highlights the rich physics of multilevel anharmonic systems coupled to cavities absent in standard models of quantum optics. We also provide concise tabulated expressions for eigenfrequencies and transition amplitudes, which should serve as a reference for future spectroscopic studies of molecular polaritons.},

We first studied the desorption kinetics of dioxygen (O 2 ) on a coronene film and graphite at 15 K using the thermally programed desorption technique. We observed that the desorption of O 2 occurs at a lower temperature on coronene than on graphite. We deduce the binding energies that are 12.5 kJ/mol on graphite and 10.6 kJ/mol on coronene films (pre-exponential factor, 6.88 × 10 14 s −1 ). The graphite surfaces partially covered with coronene show both adsorption energies. In combination with theoretical density function theory (DFT) calculations using graphene and coronene as surfaces, we observe that the experimental results are in good agreement with the theoretical calculations. For the adsorption of the O 2 molecule, two orientations are possible: parallel or perpendicular to the surface. It seems that O 2 is best bound parallel to the surface and has a preference for the internal sites of the coronene.},

  abstract = {High-level quantum chemical computations have provided significant insight into the fundamental physical nature of non-covalent interactions. These studies have focused primarily on gas-phase computations of small van der Waals dimers; however, these interactions frequently take place in complex chemical environments, such as proteins, solutions, or solids. To better understand how the chemical environment affects non-covalent interactions, we have undertaken a quantum chemical study of π – π interactions in an aqueous solution, as exemplified by T-shaped benzene dimers surrounded by 28 or 50 explicit water molecules. We report interaction energies (IEs) using second-order Møller–Plesset perturbation theory, and we apply the intramolecular and functional-group partitioning extensions of symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (ISAPT and F-SAPT, respectively) to analyze how the solvent molecules tune the π – π interactions of the solute. For complexes containing neutral monomers, even 50 explicit waters (constituting a first and partial second solvation shell) change total SAPT IEs between the two solute molecules by only tenths of a kcal mol −1 , while significant changes of up to 3 kcal mol −1 of the electrostatic component are seen for the cationic pyridinium–benzene dimer. This difference between charged and neutral solutes is attributed to large non-additive three-body interactions within solvated ion-containing complexes. Overall, except for charged solutes, our quantum computations indicate that nearby solvent molecules cause very little “tuning” of the direct solute–solute interactions. This indicates that differences in binding energies between the gas phase and solution phase are primarily indirect effects of the competition between solute–solute and solute–solvent interactions.},

A linear IR spectrum in the nitro-stretching mode region shows two major bands and one minor band in DMSO but changes to the two major bands mainly picture when adding water as an antisolvent of HMX, suggesting a transition from well-solvated and less perfect β-conformation to a less-solvated and close-to-perfect β-conformation. The latter bears a similar asymmetric nitro-stretch vibration profile to the β-polymorph in the crystal form. Density functional theory computations of the nitro-stretching vibrations suggest that HMX in DMSO may be in a NO 2 group rotated β-conformation. Two-dimensional IR cross-peak intensity reveals intramolecular energy transfer between the axial and equatorial nitro-groups in the β-HMX on the ps time scale, which is slightly faster in the mixed solvent case.

The main consequence of these electron density rearrangements is the above-mentioned increase in the intrinsic acidity of the azole subunit, evolving from a typical nitrogen base to a very strong nitrogenous acid. This effect is particularly dramatic when the interaction involves the (BeF 2 ) 2 dimer, that is, a Lewis acid much stronger than the monomer. Although the azoles investigated have neighboring N-basic sites, their interaction with the (BeF 2 ) 2 dimer yields a monodentate complex. However, the deprotonated species becomes extra-stabilized because a second N–Be bond is formed, leading to a new five-membered ring, with the result that the azole-(BeF 2 ) 2 complexes investigated become stronger nitrogenous acids than oxyacids such as perchloric acid.},

  abstract = {Beryllium ammonia complexes Be(NH 3 ) 4 are known to bear two diffuse electrons in the periphery of a Be(NH 3 ) 4 2+ skeleton. The replacement of one ammonia with a methyl group forms CH 3 Be(NH 3 ) 3 with one peripheral electron, which is shown to maintain the hydrogenic-type shell model observed for Li(NH 3 ) 4 . Two CH 3 Be(NH 3 ) 3 monomers are together linked by aliphatic chains to form strongly bound beryllium ammonia complexes, (NH 3 ) 3 Be(CH 2 ) n Be(NH 3 ) 3 , n = 1–6, with one electron around each beryllium ammonia center. In the case of a linear carbon chain, this system can be seen as the analog of two hydrogen atoms approaching each other at specific distances (determined by n ). We show that the two electrons occupy diffuse s-type orbitals and can couple exactly as in H 2 in either a triplet or singlet state. For long hydrocarbon chains, the singlet is an open-shell singlet nearly degenerate with the triplet spin state, which transforms to a closed-shell singlet for n = 1 imitating the σ-covalent bond of H 2 . The biradical character of the system is analyzed, and the singlet–triplet splitting is estimated as a function of n based on multi-reference calculations. Finally, we consider the case of bent hydrocarbon chains, which allows the closer proximity of the two diffuse electrons for larger chains and the formation of a direct covalent bond between the two diffuse electrons, which happens for two Li(NH 3 ) 4 complexes converting the open-shell to closed-shell singlets. The energy cost for bending the hydrocarbon chain is nearly compensated by the formation of the weak covalent bond rendering bent and linear structures nearly isoenergetic.},

The observed cationic products are PtO + and PtSO + , with small amounts of PtS + , all formed in endothermic reactions. Modeling the kinetic energy dependent product cross sections allows determination of the product bond dissociation energies (BDEs): D 0 (Pt + –O) = 3.14 ± 0.11 eV, D 0 (Pt + –S) = 3.68 ± 0.31 eV, and D 0 (Pt + –SO) = 3.03 ± 0.12 eV. The oxide BDE agrees well with more precise literature values, whereas the latter two results are the first such measurements. Quantum mechanical calculations were performed for PtO + , PtS + , PtO 2 + , and PtSO + at the B3LYP and coupled-cluster with single, double, and perturbative triple [CCSD(T)] levels of theory using the def2-XZVPPD (X = T, Q) and aug-cc-pVXZ (X = T, Q, 5) basis sets and complete basis set extrapolations. These theoretical BDEs agree well with the experimental values. After including empirical spin–orbit corrections, the product ground states are determined as PtO + ( 4 Σ 3/2 ), PtS + ( 4 Σ 3/2 ), PtO 2 + ( 2 Σ g + ), and PtSO + ( 2 A′). Potential energy profiles including intermediates and transition states for each reaction were also calculated at the B3LYP/def2-TZVPPD level. Periodic trends in the thermochemistry of the group 9 metal chalcogenide cations are compared, and the formation of PtO + from the Pt + + SO 2 reaction is compared with those from the Pt + + O 2 , CO 2 , CO, and NO reactions.},

We recorded pure-rotational hybrid femtosecond/picosecond coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (fs/ps CARS) spectra along the axial centerline of the underexpanded jet, within the barrel shock region upstream of the Mach disk. The dephasing of the pure-rotational Raman coherence was monitored using probe-time-delay scans at different axial positions in the jet, corresponding to varying local temperatures and pressures. The local temperature was obtained by fitting CARS spectra acquired at zero probe time delay, where the impact of collisions was minimal. The measured decay of each available Raman transition was fit to a dephasing constant and corrected for the local pressure, which was obtained from the CARS-measured static temperature and thermodynamic relationships for isentropic expansion from the known stagnation state. Nitrogen self-broadened transitions decayed more rapidly than those broadened in air for all temperatures, corresponding to higher Raman linewidths. In general, the measured S -branch linewidths deviated significantly in absolute and relative magnitudes from those predicted by extrapolating the modified exponential gap model to low temperatures. The temperature dependence of the Raman linewidth for each measured rotational state of nitrogen ( J ≤ 10) and oxygen ( N ≤ 11) was fit to a temperature-dependent power law over the measurable temperature domain (80–200 K) and extrapolated to both higher rotational states and room temperature. The measured and modeled low-temperature linewidth data provided here will aid low temperature gas-phase pressure measurements with fs/ps CARS.},

It was addressed whether stereoinversion competes against other reactions, such as reductive H 2 -elimination or hydride loss, and if so, along which pathway the stereomutation occurs. Importantly, stereoinversion transition structures for the ammonium cation ( C 4 v ) and the tetrahydridoborate anion ( C s ) were identified for the first time. Revisiting methane’s C s symmetric inversion transition structure with the mHEAT+ protocol revealed an activation enthalpy for stereoinversion, in contrast to all earlier studies, which is 5 kJ mol −1 below the C–H bond dissociation enthalpy. Square planar structures were identified lowest in energy only for the inversion of AlH 4 − , but a novel stepwise C s -inversion was discovered for SiH 4 or PH 4 + . Overall, the present contribution delineates essentials of the potential energy surfaces of p -block element hydrides, while structure–energy relations offer design principles for the synthetically emerging field of structurally constrained compounds.},

Pressure has become an effective way to realize high-temperature superconductivity in hydrides, whereas most electrides are semiconducting or insulating at high pressure. Here, we have applied swarm-intelligence structural search to identify a hitherto unknown C 2/ m Li 10 Se electride that is superconducting at high pressure. More interestingly, Li 10 Se is estimated to exhibit the highest T c value of 16 K at 50 GPa, which is the lowest pressure among Li-based chalcogen electrides. This superconducting transition is dominated by Se-related low frequency vibration modes. The increasing electronic occupation of the Se 4 d orbital and the decreasing amount of interstitial anion electrons with pressure heighten their coupling with low-frequency phonons, which is responsible for the enhancement of the T c value. The finding of Li-based chalcogen superconducting electrides provides a reference for the realization of other superconducting electrides at lower pressures.},

In this paper, we investigate the order of magnitude of this approximation on a paradigmatic example: the C 44 elastic constant of diamond and zincblende materials. We estimate the effect of finite-temperature atomic relaxations within the quasi-harmonic approximation by computing ab initio the internal strain tensor from the second derivatives of the Helmholtz free-energy with respect to strain and atomic displacements. We apply our approach to Si and BAs and find a visible difference between the softening of the TDECs computed with the zero-temperature and finite-temperature atomic relaxations. In Si, the softening of C 44 passes from 8.6\% to 4.5\%, between T = 0 K and T = 1200 K. In BAs, it passes from 8\% to 7\%, in the same range of temperatures. Finally, from the computed elastic constant corrections, we derive the temperature-dependent Kleinman parameter, which is usually measured in experiments.},

  abstract = {The restricted active space spin–flip (RAS-SF) formalism is a particular form of single-reference configuration interaction that can describe some forms of strong correlation at a relatively low cost and which has recently been formulated for the description of charge-transfer excited states. Here, we introduce both equilibrium and nonequilibrium versions of a state-specific solvation correction for vertical transition energies computed using RAS-SF wave functions, based on the framework of a polarizable continuum model (PCM). Ground-state polarization is described using the solvent’s static dielectric constant and in the nonequilibrium solvation approach that polarization is modified upon vertical excitation using the solvent’s optical dielectric constant. Benchmark calculations are reported for well-studied models of photo-induced charge transfer, including naphthalene dimer, C 2 H 4 ⋯C 2 F 4 , pentacene dimer, and perylene diimide (PDI) dimer, several of which are important in organic photovoltaic applications. For the PDI dimer, we demonstrate that the charge-transfer character of the excited states is enhanced in the presence of a low-dielectric medium (static dielectric constant ɛ 0 = 3) as compared to a gas-phase calculation ( ɛ 0 = 1). This stabilizes mechanistic traps for singlet fission and helps to explain experimental singlet fission rates. We also examine the effects of nonequilibrium solvation on charge-separated states in an intramolecular singlet fission chromophore, where we demonstrate that the energetic ordering of the states changes as a function of solvent polarity. The RAS-SF + PCM methodology that is reported here provides a framework to study charge-separated states in solution and in photovoltaic materials.},

The main practical advantage of having a variational framework is that it provides a formal and straightforward approach for imposing constraints (e.g., fixed charges on certain atoms or molecular fragments) when computing HI atoms and their properties. Unlike many other variants of the Hirshfeld partitioning scheme, HI charges do not arise naturally from the information-theoretic framework, but only as a reverse-engineered construction of the objective function. However, the procedure we use is quite general and could be applied to other problems as well. We also prove that there is always at least one solution to the HI equations, but we could not prove that its self-consistent equations would always converge for any given initial pro-atom charges. Our numerical assessment of the constrained iterative Hirshfeld method shows that it satisfies many desirable traits of atoms in molecules and has the potential to surpass existing approaches for adding constraints when computing atomic properties.},

Minimum-work protocols in multidimensional control-parameter space have the potential to significantly reduce work relative to one-dimensional control. By numerically minimizing a linear-response approximation to the excess work, we design protocols in control-parameter spaces of a 2D Ising model that efficiently drive the system from the all-down to all-up configuration. We find that such designed multidimensional protocols take advantage of more flexible control to avoid control-parameter regions of high system resistance, heterogeneously input and extract work to make use of system relaxation, and flatten the energy landscape, making accessible many configurations that would otherwise have prohibitively high energy and, thus, decreasing spin correlations. Relative to one-dimensional protocols, this speeds up the rate-limiting spin-inversion reaction, thereby keeping the system significantly closer to equilibrium for a wide range of protocol durations and significantly reducing resistance and, hence, work.},

This framework allows for the calculation of tunneling reaction rates that incorporate the quantum nature of the nuclei and certain types of non-adiabatic effects (NAEs) present in metals. In this paper, we analyze the performance of RPI-EF on model potentials and apply it to realistic systems. For a 1D double-well model, we benchmark the method against numerically exact results obtained from multi-layer multi-configuration time-dependent Hartree calculations. We demonstrate that RPI-EF is accurate for medium and high friction strengths and less accurate for extremely low friction values. We also show quantitatively how the inclusion of NAEs lowers the crossover temperature into the deep tunneling regime, reduces the tunneling rates, and, in certain regimes, steers the quantum dynamics by modifying the tunneling pathways. As a showcase of the efficiency of this method, we present a study of hydrogen and deuterium hopping between neighboring interstitial sites in selected bulk metals. The results show that multidimensional vibrational coupling and nuclear quantum effects have a larger impact than NAEs on the tunneling rates of diffusion in metals. Together with Paper I [Litman et al. , J. Chem. Phys. (in press) (2022)], these results advance the calculations of dissipative tunneling rates from first principles.},

The theoretical modeling of such reactions presents a formidable challenge for theory because nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) can play a prominent role and the coupling of the atomic motion with the electrons in the metal gives rise to important non-adiabatic effects (NAEs) that alter atomic dynamics. In this work, we derive a theoretical framework that captures both NQEs and NAEs and, due to its high efficiency, can be applied to first-principles calculations of reaction rates in high-dimensional realistic systems. More specifically, we develop a method that we coin ring polymer instanton with explicit friction (RPI-EF), starting from the ring polymer instanton formalism applied to a system–bath model. We derive general equations that incorporate the spatial and frequency dependence of the friction tensor and then combine this method with the ab initio electronic friction formalism for the calculation of thermal reaction rates. We show that the connection between RPI-EF and the form of the electronic friction tensor presented in this work does not require any further approximations, and it is expected to be valid as long as the approximations of both underlying theories remain valid.},

  abstract = {The accurate resolution of the chemical properties of strongly correlated systems, such as biradicals, requires the use of electronic structure theories that account for both multi-reference and dynamic correlation effects. A variety of methods exist that aim to resolve the dynamic correlation in multi-reference problems, commonly relying on an exponentially scaling complete-active-space self-consistent-field (CASSCF) calculation to generate reference molecular orbitals (MOs). However, while CASSCF orbitals provide the optimal solution for a selected set of correlated (active) orbitals, their suitability in the quest for the resolution of the total correlation energy has not been thoroughly investigated. Recent research has shown the ability of Kohn–Shan density functional theory to provide improved orbitals for coupled cluster (CC) and Møller–Plesset perturbation theory (MP) calculations. Here, we extend the search for optimal and more cost effective MOs to post-configuration-interaction [post-(CI)] methods, surveying the ability of the MOs obtained with various density functional theory (DFT) functionals, as well as Hartree–Fock and CC and MP calculations to accurately capture the total electronic correlation energy. Applying the anti-Hermitian contracted Schrödinger equation to the dissociation of N 2 , the calculation of biradical singlet–triplet gaps, and the transition states of bicylobutane isomerization, we demonstrate that DFT provides a cost-effective alternative to CASSCF in providing reference orbitals for post-CI dynamic correlation calculations.},

These states are geminal products whose coefficients are solutions of non-linear equations. Previous results showed an un-physical apparent avoided crossing in ground state dissociation curves for hydrogen chains. In this paper, it is shown that each seniority-zero state of the molecular Coulomb Hamiltonian corresponds directly to an RG state. However, the seniority-zero ground state does not correspond to the ground state of a reduced BCS Hamiltonian. The difficulty is in choosing the correct RG state. The systems studied showed a clear choice, and we expect that it should always be possible to reason physically which state to choose.},

  abstract = {Absorption of slow moving electrons by neutral ground state nucleobases has been known to produce resonance metastable states. There are indications that such metastable states may play a key role in DNA/RNA damage. Therefore, herein, we present an ab initio non-Hermitian investigation of the resonance positions and decay rates for the low lying shape-type states of the uracil anion. In addition, we calculate the complex transition dipoles between these resonance states. We employ the resonance via Padé (RVP) method to calculate these complex properties from real stabilization curves by analytical dilation into the complex plane. This method has already been successfully applied to many small molecular systems, and herein, we present the first application of RVP to a medium-sized system. The presented resonance energies are optimized with respect to the size of the basis set and compared with previous theoretical studies and experimental findings. Complex transition dipoles between the shape-type resonances are computed using the optimal basis set. The ability to calculate ab initio energies and lifetimes of biologically relevant systems paves the way for studying reactions of such systems in which autoionization takes place, while the ability to also calculate their complex transition dipoles opens the door for studying photo-induced dynamics of such biological molecules.},

At a fixed level of disparity in interaction strengths, both of the phase transitions can be observed by decreasing the temperature, leading first to the separation of condensates from the bulk phase and then to component demixing inside condensates.

This can be used to quantify the amount of Car S 1 to Chlorophyll (Chl) energy transfer in pigment–protein complexes and plants by observing the chlorophyll fluorescence intensity after TPE in comparison to the intensity observed after direct chlorophyll OPE. A parameter, Φ Coupling Car S1−Chl ⁠ , can be derived that directly reflects relative differences or changes in the Car S 1 → Chl energy transfer of different pigment–protein complexes and even living plants. However, very careful calibrations are necessary to ensure similar OPE and TPE excitation probabilities and transition energies. In plants, the exact same sample spot must be observed at the same time. All this is experimentally quite demanding. Φ Coupling Car S1−Chl also corrects intrinsically for direct chlorophyll TPE caused by larger chlorophyll excesses in the complexes, but recently it turned out that in certain TPE wavelengths ranges, its contribution can be quite large. Fortunately, this finding opens also the possibility of determining Φ Coupling Car S1−Chl in a much easier way by directly comparing values in TPE spectra observed at wavelengths that are either more dominated by Cars or Chls. This avoids tedious comparisons of OPE and TPE experiments and potentially allows measurement at even only two TPE wavelengths. Here, we explored this new approach to determine Φ Coupling Car S1−Chl directly from single TPE spectra and present first examples using known experimental spectra from Cars, Chl a , Chl b , LHC II, and PS 1.},

Here, we measured the fine-structure branching ratios N( 2 D 5/2 )/N( 2 D 3/2 ) produced in the N( 2 D 5/2,3/2 ) + N( 2 D 5/2,3/2 ) channel at the b ′ 1 Σ u + ( v = 20) state of 14 N 2 by using our vacuum ultraviolet (VUV)-pump–VUV-probe time-sliced velocity-mapped ion imaging setup. It is found that 14 N 2 almost exclusively dissociates into the spin–orbit channel N( 2 D 5/2 ) + N( 2 D 3/2 ) at low rotational levels and gradually approaches the statistical or diabatic limit by distributing all possible spin–orbit channels at higher rotational levels. The strongly rotationally dependent fine-structure branching ratios should be due to the increasing strength of nonadiabatic Coriolis interaction among various dissociative states in the so-called “recoupling zone” as J ′ increases. They are supposed to provide unprecedented information on the near threshold photodissociation dynamics of 14 N 2 .},

We show by quantum chemical calculations that isles of graphene in a fluorographene sheet can act as quasi-molecules similar to natural pigments from which the structures similar in function to photosynthetic antennas can be built. The graphene isles retain enough identity so that they can be used as building blocks to which intuitive design principles of natural photosynthetic antennas can be applied. We examine the excited state properties, stability, and interactions of these building blocks. Constraints put on the antenna structure by the two-dimensionality of the material as well as the discrete nature of fluorographene sheet are studied. We construct a hypothetical energetic funnel out of two types of quasi-molecules to show how a limited number of building blocks can be arranged to bridge the energy gap and spatial separation in excitation energy transfer. Energy transfer rates for a wide range of the system–environment interaction strengths are predicted. We conclude that conditions for the near unity quantum efficiency of energy transfer are likely to be fulfilled in fluorographene with the controlled arrangement of quasi-molecules.},

  abstract = {Based on Schreiber’s work on transfer entropy, a molecular theory of nonlinear information transfer between residue pairs in proteins is developed. The joint distribution function for residue fluctuations required by the theory is expressed in terms of tensor Hermite polynomials that conveniently separate harmonic and nonlinear contributions to information transfer. The harmonic part of information transfer is expressed as the difference between time dependent and independent mutual information. Third order nonlinearities are discussed in detail. The amount and speed of information transfer between residues, which are important for understanding allosteric activity in proteins, are discussed. Mutual information between two residues is commonly used for information transfer. While mutual information shows the maximum amount of information that may be transferred between two residues, it does not explain the actual amount of transfer nor the transfer rate of information. For this, dynamic equations of the system are needed. The solution of the Langevin equation and molecular dynamics trajectories are used in the present work for this purpose. Allosteric communication in human NAD-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase is studied as an example. Calculations show that several paths contribute collectively to information transfer. Important residues on these paths are identified. Time resolved information transfer between these residues, their amplitudes, and transfer rates, which are in agreement with time resolved ultraviolet resonance Raman measurements in general, are estimated. Peak values of calculated information transfer, ∼0.01–0.04 bits, are about two orders of magnitude smaller than the information content of residues. They are comparable to mutual information values, however. Estimated transfer rates are in the order of 1–20 megabits per second, and sustained transfer during the activity time-span of proteins may be significant. Information transfer from third order contributions is one to two orders of magnitude smaller than the harmonic terms, showing that harmonic analysis is a good approximation to information transfer.},

  abstract = {Colloids may be treated as “big atoms” so that they are good models for atomic and molecular systems. Colloidal hard disks are, therefore, good models for 2d materials, and although their phase behavior is well characterized, rheology has received relatively little attention. Here, we exploit a novel, particle-resolved, experimental setup and complementary computer simulations to measure the shear rheology of quasi-hard-disk colloids in extreme confinement. In particular, we confine quasi-2d hard disks in a circular “corral” comprised of 27 particles held in optical traps. Confinement and shear suppress hexagonal ordering that would occur in the bulk and create a layered fluid. We measure the rheology of our system by balancing drag and driving forces on each layer. Given the extreme confinement, it is remarkable that our system exhibits rheological behavior very similar to unconfined 2d and 3d hard particle systems, characterized by a dynamic yield stress and shear-thinning of comparable magnitude. By quantifying particle motion perpendicular to shear, we show that particles become more tightly confined to their layers with no concomitant increase in density upon increasing the shear rate. Shear thinning is, therefore, a consequence of a reduction in dissipation due to weakening in interactions between layers as the shear rate increases. We reproduce our experiments with Brownian dynamics simulations with Hydrodynamic Interactions (HI) included at the level of the Rotne–Prager tensor. That the inclusion of HI is necessary to reproduce our experiments is evidence of their importance in transmission of momentum through the system.},

Here, we extend the SCFT to worm-like chains with small persistence lengths, ℓ p , relative to their contour lengths, ℓ c , for which R 0 ≈ 2 ℓ p ℓ c ⁠ . In the limit of ℓ p ≪ ξ , we recover the Gaussian-chain prediction where the segregation depends only on the product ℓ p ℓ c , but for realistic polymer/air surfaces with ξ ∼ ℓ p , the segregation depends separately on the two quantities. Although the surface continues to favor flexible polymers with smaller ℓ p and bulky polymers with shorter ℓ c , the effect of bulkiness is more pronounced. This imbalance can, under specific conditions, lead to anomalous surface segregation of the more extended polymer. For this to happen, the polymer must be bulkier and stiffer, with a stiffness that is sufficient to produce a larger R 0 yet not so rigid as to reverse the surface affinity that favors bulky polymers.},

We have implemented and studied the formula for its use in geometry relaxation of various reference and target molecules. We have also analyzed the convergence of the alchemical force perturbation series as well as basis set effects. Interpolating alchemically predicted energies, forces, and Hessian to a Morse potential yields more accurate geometries and equilibrium energies than when performing a standard Newton–Raphson step. Our numerical predictions for small molecules including BF, CO, N 2 , CH 4 , NH 3 , H 2 O, and HF yield mean absolute errors of equilibrium energies and bond lengths smaller than 10 mHa and 0.01 bohr for fourth order APDFT predictions, respectively.

  abstract = {The adsorption of acetamide on low density amorphous (LDA) ice is investigated by grand canonical Monte Carlo computer simulations at the temperatures 50, 100, and 200 K, characteristic of certain domains of the interstellar medium (ISM). We found that the relative importance of the acetamide–acetamide H-bonds with respect to the acetamide–water ones increases with decreasing temperature. Thus, with decreasing temperature, the existence of the stable monolayer, characterizing the adsorption at 200 K, is gradually replaced by the occurrence of marked multilayer adsorption, preceding even the saturation of the first layer at 50 K. While isolated acetamide molecules prefer to lay parallel to the ice surface to maximize their H-bonding with the surface water molecules, this orientational preference undergoes a marked change upon saturation of the first layer due to increasing competition of the adsorbed molecules for H-bonds with water and to the possibility of their H-bond formation with each other. As a result, molecules stay preferentially perpendicular to the ice surface in the saturated monolayer. The chemical potential value corresponding to the point of condensation is found to decrease linearly with increasing temperature. We provide, in analogy with the Clausius–Clapeyron equation, a thermodynamic explanation of this behavior and estimate the molar entropy of condensed phase acetamide to be 34.0 J/mol K. For the surface concentration of the saturated monolayer, we obtain the value 9.1 ± 0.8 µ mol/m 2 , while the heat of adsorption at infinitely low surface coverage is estimated to be −67.8 ± 3.0 kJ/mol. Our results indicate that the interstellar formation of peptide chains through acetamide molecules, occurring at the surface of LDA ice, might well be a plausible process in the cold (i.e., below 50 K) domains of the ISM; however, it is a rather unlikely scenario in its higher temperature (i.e., 100–200 K) domains.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have transformed the space of molecular and catalyst discovery. Despite the fact that the underlying physics across these domains remain the same, most prior work has focused on building domain-specific models either in small molecules or in materials. However, building large datasets across all domains is computationally expensive; therefore, the use of transfer learning (TL) to generalize to different domains is a promising but under-explored approach to this problem. To evaluate this hypothesis, we use a model that is pretrained on the Open Catalyst Dataset (OC20), and we study the model’s behavior when fine-tuned for a set of different datasets and tasks. This includes MD17, the *CO adsorbate dataset, and OC20 across different tasks. Through extensive TL experiments, we demonstrate that the initial layers of GNNs learn a more basic representation that is consistent across domains, whereas the final layers learn more task-specific features. Moreover, these well-known strategies show significant improvement over the non-pretrained models for in-domain tasks with improvements of 53\% and 17\% for the *CO dataset and across the Open Catalyst Project (OCP) task, respectively. TL approaches result in up to 4× speedup in model training depending on the target data and task. However, these do not perform well for the MD17 dataset, resulting in worse performance than the non-pretrained model for few molecules. Based on these observations, we propose transfer learning using attentions across atomic systems with graph Neural Networks (TAAG), an attention-based approach that adapts to prioritize and transfer important features from the interaction layers of GNNs. The proposed method outperforms the best TL approach for out-of-domain datasets, such as MD17, and gives a mean improvement of 6\% over a model trained from scratch.},

The spinel structures display strong coupling between different order parameters, as a consequence, exhibiting many fascinating properties, such as multiferroicity and superconductivity. Here, we have investigated the structural, magnetic, and vibrational properties of mixed-spinel CoMn 2 O 4 stabilized in distorted tetragonal structures as evidenced from x-ray diffraction measurements. Magnetization measurements reveal two ferrimagnetic phase transitions at 185 and 90 K. Raman scattering measurements reveal the renormalization of phonon parameters for a few phonon modes at low temperatures, arising from spin–phonon coupling. The obtained value for λS 2 is ∼2 cm −1 . The strength of spin–phonon coupling ( λ ) is estimated according to the spins involved in the corresponding lattice vibrations and discussed.},

  abstract = {The effect of trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) on hydrophobic solvation and hydrophobic interactions of methane has been studied with Molecular Dynamics simulations in the temperature range between 280 and 370 K at 1 bar ambient pressure. We observe a temperature transition in the effect of TMAO on the aqueous solubility of methane. At low temperature (280 K), methane is preferentially hydrated, causing TMAO to reduce its solubility in water, while above 320 K, methane preferentially interacts with TMAO, causing TMAO to promote its solubility in water. Based on a statistical-mechanical analysis of the excess chemical potential of methane, we find that the reversible work of creating a repulsive methane cavity opposes the solubility of methane in TMAO/water solution more than in pure water. Below 320 K, this solvent-excluded volume effect overcompensates the contribution of methane–TMAO van der Waals interactions, which promote the solvation of methane and are observed at all temperatures. These van der Waals interactions with the methyl groups of TMAO tip the balance above 320 K where the effect of TMAO on solvent-excluded volume is smaller. We furthermore find that the effective attraction between dissolved methane solutes increases with the increasing TMAO concentration. This observation correlates with a reduction in the methane solubility below 320 K but with an increase in methane solubility at higher temperatures.},

A global analytical potential energy surface is developed to describe the possible pathways with the quasi-classical trajectory method at several collision energies. In addition to S N 2 and proton abstraction, a significant iodine abstraction is identified, leading to the CH 3 + [NH 2 ⋯I] − products. For S N 2, our computations reveal an indirect character as well, promoting the formation of [CH 3 ⋯NH 2 ] complexes. Two novel dominant S N 2 retention pathways are uncovered induced by the rotation of the CH 3 fragment in these latter [CH 3 ⋯NH 2 ] complexes. Moreover, these uncommon routes turn out to be the most dominant retention paths for the NH 2 − + CH 3 I S N 2 reaction.},

  abstract = {A highly excited electronic state of dicopper is observed and characterized for the first time. The [ 39.6 ] 0 u + - X 1 Σ g + ( 0 g + ) system is measured at rotational resolution by using degenerate and two-color resonant four-wave-mixing, as well as laser induced fluorescence spectroscopy. Double-resonance experiments are performed by labeling selected rotational levels of the ground state by tuning the probe laser wavelength to transitions in the well-known (1-0) band of the B 0 u + - X 1 Σ g + ( 0 g + ) electronic system. Spectra obtained by scans of the pump laser in the UV wavelength range were then assigned unambiguously by the stringent double-resonance selection rules. The absence of a Q-band suggests a parallel transition (ΔΩ = 0) and determines the term symbol of the state as 0 u + in Hund’s case (c) notation. The equilibrium constants for 63 Cu 2 are T e = 39 559.921(92) cm −1 , ω e = 277.70(14) cm −1 , B e = 0.104 942(66) cm −1 , and r e = 2.2595(11) Å. These findings are supported by high-level ab initio calculations at the MRCI+Q level, which clearly identifies this state as resulting from a 4p ← 3d transition. In addition, three dark perturber states are found in the v = 1 and v = 2 vibrational levels of the new state. A deperturbation analysis characterizes the interaction and rationalizes the anomalous dips in the excitation spectrum of the [ 39.6 ] 0 u + - X 1 Σ g + ( 0 g + ) system.},

  abstract = {Gaussian process (GP) emulator has been used as a surrogate model for predicting force field and molecular potential, to overcome the computational bottleneck of ab initio molecular dynamics simulation. Integrating both atomic force and energy in predictions was found to be more accurate than using energy alone, yet it requires O (( NM ) 3 ) computational operations for computing the likelihood function and making predictions, where N is the number of atoms and M is the number of simulated configurations in the training sample due to the inversion of a large covariance matrix. The high computational cost limits its applications to the simulation of small molecules. The computational challenge of using both gradient information and function values in GPs was recently noticed in machine learning communities, whereas conventional approximation methods may not work well. Here, we introduce a new approach, the atomized force field model, that integrates both force and energy in the emulator with many fewer computational operations. The drastic reduction in computation is achieved by utilizing the naturally sparse covariance structure that satisfies the constraints of the energy conservation and permutation symmetry of atoms. The efficient machine learning algorithm extends the limits of its applications on larger molecules under the same computational budget, with nearly no loss of predictive accuracy. Furthermore, our approach contains an uncertainty assessment of predictions of atomic forces and energies, useful for developing a sequential design over the chemical input space.},

In this paper, we focus on smaller cyclic molecular anion, c -C 3 H − , an astrophysical candidate, following the detection of larger C n H − carbon chains. From a new three-dimensional potential energy surface, the rotational (de-)excitation of the c -C 3 H − (X 1 A 1 ) anion by collision with He is investigated. The surface is obtained in the supermolecular approach at the CCSD(T)-F12/aug-cc-pVTZ level of theory. Fully quantum close-coupling calculations of inelastic integral cross sections are performed on a grid of collisional energies large enough to ensure the convergence of the state-to-state rate coefficients for the 34 first rotational levels up to j K a , K c = 7 7,0 of c -C 3 H − and temperatures ranging from 5 to 100 K. For this collisional system, rate coefficients exhibit a strong dominance in favor of 2 1,2 → l 1,1 downward transition. This transition was previously used for the detection of the cyclic parent c -C 3 H. The c -C 3 H − –He rate coefficients (∼10 −11 cm 3 s −1 ) are of the same order of magnitude as those of the detected anions C n H − (as C 2 H − , C 4 H − , and C 6 H − ) in collision with He and one order of magnitude smaller than those with H 2 . The critical densities of H 2 were also estimated, and a discussion on the validity of the local thermodynamic equilibrium conditions is carried out. This work represents the contribution to understanding and modeling abundances and chemistry of hydrocarbon radicals, C n H, in astrophysical media.},

The lowest rotational levels of the A 1 Π, v = 6 and b 3 Σ + , v = 5 states of AlF are nearly iso-energetic and interact via spin–orbit coupling. These levels thus have a strongly mixed spin-character and provide a singlet–triplet doorway. We here present a hyperfine resolved spectroscopic study of the A 1 Π, v = 6//b 3 Σ + , v = 5 perturbed system in a jet-cooled, pulsed molecular beam. From a fit to the observed energies of the hyperfine levels, the fine and hyperfine structure parameters of the coupled states and their relative energies as well as the spin–orbit interaction parameter are determined. The standard deviation of the fit is about 15 MHz. We experimentally determine the radiative lifetimes of selected hyperfine levels by time-delayed ionization, Lamb dip spectroscopy, and accurate measurements of the transition lineshapes. The measured lifetimes range between 2 and 200 ns, determined by the degree of singlet–triplet mixing for each level.},

The harmonic variety-based matrix completion (HVMC) algorithm, developed in a previous study [S. J. Quiton et al. , J. Chem. Phys. 153 , 054122 (2020)], exploits the low-rank character of the polynomial expansion of potential energy to recover vibrational frequencies (square roots of eigenvalues of nuclear Hessians) constituting the reaction path using a small sample of its entities. These frequencies are essential for calculating rate coefficients using variational transition state theory with multidimensional tunneling (VTST-MT). HVMC performance is examined for four S N 2 reactions and five hydrogen transfer reactions, with each H-transfer reaction consisting of at least one vibrational mode strongly coupled to the reaction coordinate. HVMC is robust and captures zero-point energies, vibrational free energies, zero-curvature tunneling, and adiabatic ground state and free energy barriers as well as their positions on the reaction coordinate. For medium to large reactions involving H-transfer, with the sole exception of the most complex Ir catalysis system, less than 35\% of total eigenvalue information is necessary for accurate recovery of key VTST-MT observables.},

The method, which we call anisotropic force-matching coarse-graining (AFM-CG), is based on rigorous statistical mechanical principles, enforcing consistency between the coarse-grained and fine-grained phase-space distributions to derive equations for the coarse-grained forces, torques, masses, and moments of inertia in terms of properties of a condensed-phase fine-grained system. We verify the accuracy and efficiency of the method by coarse-graining liquid-state systems of two different anisotropic organic molecules, benzene and perylene, and show that the parameterized coarse-grained models more accurately describe properties of these systems than previous anisotropic coarse-grained models parameterized using other methods that do not account for finite-temperature and many-body effects on the condensed-phase coarse-grained interactions. The AFM-CG method will be useful for developing accurate and efficient dynamical simulation models of condensed-phase systems of molecules consisting of large, rigid, anisotropic fragments, such as liquid crystals, organic semiconductors, and nucleic acids.},

  abstract = {Here, steady-state reaction networks are inspected from the viewpoint of individual tagged molecules jumping among their chemical states upon the occurrence of reactive events. Such an agent-based viewpoint is useful for selectively characterizing the behavior of functional molecules, especially in the presence of bimolecular processes. We present the tools for simulating the jump dynamics both in the macroscopic limit and in the small-volume sample where the numbers of reactive molecules are of the order of few units with an inherently stochastic kinetics. The focus is on how an ideal spatial “compartmentalization” may affect the dynamical features of the tagged molecule. Our general approach is applied to a synthetic light-driven supramolecular pump composed of ring-like and axle-like molecules that dynamically assemble and disassemble, originating an average ring-through-axle directed motion under constant irradiation. In such an example, the dynamical feature of interest is the completion time of direct/inverse cycles of tagged rings and axles. We find a surprisingly strong robustness of the average cycle times with respect to the system’s size. This is explained in the presence of rate-determining unimolecular processes, which may, therefore, play a crucial role in stabilizing the behavior of small chemical systems against strong fluctuations in the number of molecules.},

  abstract = {We recently proposed effective normal modes for excitonically coupled aggregates that exactly transform the energy transfer Hamiltonian into a sum of one-dimensional Hamiltonians along the effective normal modes. Identifying physically meaningful vibrational motions that maximally promote vibronic mixing suggested an interesting possibility of leveraging vibrational-electronic resonance for mediating selective energy transfer. Here, we expand on the effective mode approach, elucidating its iterative nature for successively larger aggregates, and extend the idea of mediated energy transfer to larger aggregates. We show that energy transfer between electronically uncoupled but vibronically resonant donor–acceptor sites does not depend on the intermediate site energy or the number of intermediate sites. The intermediate sites simply mediate electronic coupling such that vibronic coupling along specific promoter modes leads to direct donor–acceptor energy transfer, bypassing any intermediate uphill energy transfer steps. We show that the interplay between the electronic Hamiltonian and the effective mode transformation partitions the linear vibronic coupling along specific promoter modes to dictate the selectivity of mediated energy transfer with a vital role of interference between vibronic couplings and multi-particle basis states. Our results suggest a general design principle for enhancing energy transfer through synergistic effects of vibronic resonance and weak mediated electronic coupling, where both effects individually do not promote efficient energy transfer. The effective mode approach proposed here paves a facile route toward four-wavemixing spectroscopy simulations of larger aggregates without severely approximating resonant vibronic coupling.},

We compute full potential energy curves, excitation energies, ionization energies, electronic configurations, and spectroscopic parameters with large quadruple- ζ and quintuple- ζ quality correlation consistent basis sets. We also investigate equilibrium chemical bonding patterns and effects of correlating core electrons on property predictions. Differences in the ground state electron configuration of HfB(X 4 Σ − ) and HfO(X 1 Σ + ) lead to a significantly stronger bond in HfO than HfB, as judged by both dissociation energies and equilibrium bond distances. We extend our analysis to the chemical bonding patterns of the isovalent HfX (X = O, S, Se, Te, and Po) series and observe similar trends. We also note a linear trend between the decreasing value of the dissociation energy (D e ) from HfO to HfPo and the singlet–triplet energy gap ( ⁠ Δ E S–T ) of the molecule. Finally, we compare these benchmark results to those obtained using density functional theory (DFT) with 23 exchange–correlation functionals spanning multiple rungs of “Jacob’s ladder.” When comparing DFT errors to coupled cluster reference values on dissociation energies, excitation energies, and ionization energies of HfB and HfO, we observe semi-local generalized gradient approximations to significantly outperform more complex and high-cost functionals.},

Here, we demonstrate the judiciously modified density functional theory (jmDFT) approach with non-empirical U and J parameters obtained directly from frontier orbital energetics on a series of transition-metal complexes. We curate a set of nine representative Ti(III) and V(IV) d 1 transition-metal complexes and evaluate their flat-plane errors along the fractional spin and charge lines. We demonstrate that while jmDFT improves upon both DFT+U and semi-local DFT with the standard atomic orbital projectors (AOPs), it does so inefficiently. We rationalize these inefficiencies by quantifying hybridization in the relevant frontier orbitals. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a procedure for computing a molecular orbital projector (MOP) basis for use with jmDFT. We demonstrate this single set of d 1 MOPs to be suitable for nearly eliminating all energetic delocalization and static correlation errors. In all cases, MOP jmDFT outperforms AOP jmDFT, and it eliminates most flat-plane errors at non-empirical values. Unlike DFT+U or hybrid functionals, jmDFT nearly eliminates energetic delocalization and static correlation errors within a non-empirical framework.},

Here, we use the non-local, spherical-averaged density ρ ( r , u ) = ∫ d Ω u 4 π ρ ( r + u ) as a starting point to construct approximate exchange–correlation holes through the factorization ansatz ρ XC ( r , u ) = f ( r , u ) ρ ( r , u ). We present upper and lower bounds to the exchange energy per particle ϵ X ( r ) in terms of ρ ( r , u ). The factor f ( r , u ) is then designed to satisfy various conditions that represent important exchange and correlation effects. We assess the resulting approximations and find that the complex, oscillatory structure of ρ ( r , u ) makes the construction of a corresponding f ( r , u ) very challenging. This conclusion, identifying the main issue of the non-local approximation, is supported by a detailed analysis of the resulting exchange–correlation holes.},

We combine the results of multiple GA runs, each based on different relative weighting of the two descriptors, and rigorously assess GA performance by calculating electron transfer barriers to CO 2 reduction. A large majority of GA predictions exhibit improved performance relative to experimentally studied o -, m -, and p -terphenyl catalysts. Based on stringent cutoffs imposed on the average charge, barrier to electron transfer to CO 2 , and excitation energy, we recommend 25 catalysts for further experimental investigation of viability toward photoredox CO 2 reduction.},

  abstract = {A Brownian bridge is a continuous random walk conditioned to end in a given region by adding an effective drift to guide paths toward the desired region of phase space. This idea has many applications in chemical science where one wants to control the endpoint of a stochastic process—e.g., polymer physics, chemical reaction pathways, heat/mass transfer, and Brownian dynamics simulations. Despite its broad applicability, the biggest limitation of the Brownian bridge technique is that it is often difficult to determine the effective drift as it comes from a solution of a Backward Fokker–Planck (BFP) equation that is infeasible to compute for complex or high-dimensional systems. This paper introduces a fast approximation method to generate a Brownian bridge process without solving the BFP equation explicitly. Specifically, this paper uses the asymptotic properties of the BFP equation to generate an approximate drift and determine ways to correct (i.e., re-weight) any errors incurred from this approximation. Because such a procedure avoids the solution of the BFP equation, we show that it drastically accelerates the generation of conditioned random walks. We also show that this approach offers reasonable improvement compared to other sampling approaches using simple bias potentials.},

At the target inverse temperature, instead of ending the simulation, we incorporate a change of picture away from the interaction picture. The resulting equations of motion have piecewise functions and use the interaction picture in the first phase of a simulation, followed by the application of the Bloch equation once the target inverse temperature is reached.

Through the asymptotic properties of the hole components, we explain how h c I can retrieve the long-range part of electron correlation. We perform an exhaustive analysis of the hydrogen molecule in a minimal basis set, dissecting the hole contributions into spin components. We also analyze the simplest molecule presenting a dispersion interaction and how h c I I helps identify it. The study of several atoms in different spin states reveals that the Coulomb hole components distinguish correlation regimes that are not apparent from the entire hole.

In this case, the electronic structure is described by time-dependent density functional theory, and the corrected linear response is used in conjunction with the polarizable continuum model to account for state-specific solvent effects. The multimode dynamics following the photoexcitation to the locally excited state are simulated by the hybrid Gaussian-multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree method, and temperature effects are included using thermo field theory. The dynamics are connected to the transient absorption spectrum obtained in recent experiments, which is simulated and fully assigned from first principles.

The time-dependent vector and scalar potentials are the signature of the exact factorization, as they guide nuclear dynamics by encoding the complete electronic dynamics and including excited-state effects. Analysis of the potentials is, thus, essential—when possible—to predict the time-dependent behavior of the system of interest. In this work, we employ the exact time-dependent potentials, available for the numerically exactly solvable model used here, to propagate quantum nuclear trajectories representing the isomerization reaction of the retinal chromophore. The quantum trajectories are the best possible trajectory-based description of the reaction when using the exact-factorization formalism and, thus, allow us to assess the performance of the coupled-trajectory, fully approximate schemes derived from the exact-factorization equations.},

Recently, an unsupervised machine learning technique called VAMPNet was introduced to learn the low dimensional representation and the linear dynamical model in an end-to-end manner. VAMPNet is based on the variational approach for Markov processes and relies on neural networks to learn the coarse-grained dynamics. In this paper, we combine VAMPNet and graph neural networks to generate an end-to-end framework to efficiently learn high-level dynamics and metastable states from the long-timescale molecular dynamics trajectories. This method bears the advantages of graph representation learning and uses graph message passing operations to generate an embedding for each datapoint, which is used in the VAMPNet to generate a coarse-grained dynamical model. This type of molecular representation results in a higher resolution and a more interpretable Markov model than the standard VAMPNet, enabling a more detailed kinetic study of the biomolecular processes. Our GraphVAMPNet approach is also enhanced with an attention mechanism to find the important residues for classification into different metastable states.},

  abstract = {An ensemble of identical, intrinsically non-interacting molecules exposed to quantum light is discussed. Their interaction with the quantum light induces interactions between the molecules. The resulting hybrid light–matter states exhibit a complex structure even if only a single vibrational coordinate per molecule is considered. Since all molecules are identical, it is appealing to start from the uniform situation where all molecules possess the same value of this vibrational coordinate. Then, polaritons and dark states follow like in atoms but are functions of this coordinate, and this vibrational degree of freedom makes the physics different from that of atoms. However, despite all molecules being identical, each molecule does have its own vibrational coordinate. It is thus a vital issue to understand the meaning of the uniform situation and how to depart from it and enable one to realistically investigate the ensemble. A rigorous and physically relevant meaning of the polariton energy curves in the uniform situation has been found. It is proven that any point on a polariton energy curve is a (local) minimum or maximum for departing from the uniform situation. It is shown how to explicitly compute the energetic impact of departing from the uniform situation using solely properties of a single free molecule in the absence of the quantum light. The structure of the dark states and their behavior upon departing from the uniform situation are analyzed as well. Useful techniques not used in this topical domain are introduced, and general results on, for example, minimum energy path and symmetry breaking and restoration are obtained. It is shown how to transfer the findings to include several or even many nuclear degrees of freedom per molecule and thus to address the problem of quantum light interacting with many complex molecules. It is demonstrated that the interplay of several vibrational degrees of freedom in a single molecule of the ensemble is expected to lead to additional and, in part, qualitatively different physics. General consequences are discussed.},

  abstract = {Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of complex electrochemical systems, such as ionic liquid supercapacitors, are increasingly including the constant potential method (CPM) to model conductive electrodes at a specified potential difference, but the inclusion of CPM can be computationally expensive. We demonstrate the computational savings available in CPM MD simulations of ionic liquid supercapacitors when the usual non-periodic slab geometry is replaced with fully periodic boundary conditions. We show how a doubled cell approach, previously used in non-CPM MD simulations of charged interfaces, can be used to enable fully periodic CPM MD simulations. Using either a doubled cell approach or a finite field approach previously reported by others, fully periodic CPM MD simulations produce comparable results to the traditional slab geometry simulations with a nearly double speedup in computational time. Indeed, these savings can offset the additional cost of the CPM algorithm, resulting in periodic CPM MD simulations that are computationally competitive with the non-periodic, fixed charge equivalent simulations for the ionic liquid supercapacitors studied here.},

  abstract = {Frenkel excitons are the primary photoexcitations in organic semiconductors and are ultimately responsible for the optical properties of such materials. They are also predicted to form bound exciton pairs, termed biexcitons, which are consequential intermediates in a wide range of photophysical processes. Generally, we think of bound states as arising from an attractive interaction. However, here, we report on our recent theoretical analysis, predicting the formation of stable biexciton states in a conjugated polymer material arising from both attractive and repulsive interactions. We show that in J-aggregate systems, 2J-biexcitons can arise from repulsive dipolar interactions with energies E 2 J &gt; 2 E J , while in H-aggregates, 2H-biexciton states with energies E 2 H &lt; 2 E H can arise corresponding to attractive dipole exciton/exciton interactions. These predictions are corroborated by using ultrafast double-quantum coherence spectroscopy on a [poly(2,5-bis(3-hexadecylthiophene-2-yl)thieno[3,2-b]thiophene)] material that exhibits both J- and H-like excitonic behavior.},

  abstract = {The discovery of molecules with tailored optoelectronic properties, such as specific frequency and intensity of absorption or emission, is a major challenge in creating next-generation organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) and photovoltaics. This raises the following question: How can we predict a potential chemical structure from these properties? Approaches that attempt to tackle this inverse design problem include virtual screening, active machine learning, and genetic algorithms. However, these approaches rely on a molecular database or many electronic structure calculations, and significant computational savings could be achieved if there was prior knowledge of (i) whether the optoelectronic properties of a parent molecule could easily be improved and (ii) what morphing operations on a parent molecule could improve these properties. In this Perspective, we address both of these challenges from first principles. We first adapt the Thomas–Reiche–Kuhn sum rule to organic chromophores and show how this indicates how easily the absorption and emission of a molecule can be improved. We then show how by combining electronic structure theory and intensity borrowing perturbation theory we can predict whether or not the proposed morphing operations will achieve the desired spectral alteration, and thereby derive widely applicable design rules. We go on to provide proof-of-concept illustrations of this approach to optimizing the visible absorption of acenes and the emission of radical OLEDs. We believe that this approach can be integrated into genetic algorithms by biasing morphing operations in favor of those that are likely to be successful, leading to faster molecular discovery and greener chemistry.},

  abstract = {Metalloproteins, known to efficiently transfer electronic charge in biological systems, recently found their utilization in nanobiotechnological devices where the protein is placed into direct contact with metal surfaces. The feasibility of oxidation/reduction of the protein redox sites is affected by the reorganization free energies, one of the key parameters determining the transfer rates. While their values have been measured and computed for proteins in their native environments, i.e., in aqueous solution, the reorganization free energies of dry proteins or proteins adsorbed to metal surfaces remain unknown. Here, we investigate the redox properties of blue copper protein azurin, a prototypical redox-active metalloprotein previously probed by various experimental techniques both in solution and on metal/vacuum interfaces. We used a hybrid quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical computational technique based on density functional theory to explore protein dynamics, flexibility, and corresponding reorganization free energies in aqueous solution, vacuum, and on vacuum gold interfaces. Surprisingly, the reorganization free energy only slightly decreases when azurin is dried because the loss of the hydration shell leads to larger flexibility of the protein near its redox site. At the vacuum gold surfaces, the energetics of the structure relaxation depends on the adsorption geometry; however, significant reduction of the reorganization free energy was not observed. These findings have important consequences for the charge transport mechanism in vacuum devices, showing that the free energy barriers for protein oxidation remain significant even under ultra-high vacuum conditions.},

The approach is based on the principles of linear irreversible thermodynamics, and, in this work, it is applied to study the effects of electric fields on thin films of incompressible diblock copolymers. Enforcement of local incompressibility constraint at all times leads to a local order parameter dependent transport coefficient in the model for the diblock copolymers. The dependence of the transport coefficient on the local order parameter is used to relate it with the diffusion constant of Rouse chains and leads to sensitivity of the model to initial conditions. In addition, transient behavior is found to be affected when compared with an ad hoc model assuming a constant transport coefficient. Numerical results such as electric field induced alignment of lamellae domains due to the field are found to be in qualitative agreement with experiments. This approach opens up a systematic way of developing kinetic models for simulating effects of electrolytes added to thin films containing diblock copolymers in the presence of applied electric fields.},

Herein, two newly synthesized electronic push–pull molecules, CS-14 and CS-15, that consist of carbazole donor and benzothiadiazole acceptor segments are chosen to explore the ultrafast dynamics of intramolecular CT/CS processes. The theoretical calculation results depict an excited-state intramolecular CT character for both dyes, while the dihedral angle between donor and acceptor of CS-14 is larger than that of CS-15 , suggesting a more significant CT character of CS-14 . Furthermore, compared to CS-14 , the bond rotation of CS-15 between donor and π-bridge is restricted by employing the hexatomic ring, indicating the stronger molecular planarization of CS-15 . Ultrafast spectroscopy clearly shows a solvent polarity-dependent excited-state species evolution from CT to CS—the CT character is observed in low-polar toluene solvent, while the feature of the CS state in polar tetrahydrofuran and acetone solvents is captured, which successfully proved a solvent polarity modulated excited-state CT/CS characters. We also found that though the generation of the CS state within CS-14 is slightly faster than that of CS-15 , the charge recombination process of CS-15 with excellent planar conformation is much slower, providing enough time for a higher charge migration efficiency in DSSCs.},

To facilitate effective development, code sharing, and uptake of newly developed dynamics methods, it is important that software implementations can be easily accessed and built upon. Using the Julia programming language, we have developed the NQCDynamics.jl package, which provides a framework for established and emerging methods for performing semiclassical and mixed quantum–classical dynamics in the condensed phase. The code provides several interfaces to existing atomistic simulation frameworks, electronic structure codes, and machine learning representations. In addition to the existing methods, the package provides infrastructure for developing and deploying new dynamics methods, which we hope will benefit reproducibility and code sharing in the field of condensed phase quantum dynamics. Herein, we present our code design choices and the specific Julia programming features from which they benefit. We further demonstrate the capabilities of the package on two examples of chemical dynamics in the condensed phase: the population dynamics of the spin-boson model as described by a wide variety of semiclassical and mixed quantum–classical nonadiabatic methods and the reactive scattering of H 2 on Ag(111) using the molecular dynamics with electronic friction method. Together, they exemplify the broad scope of the package to study effective model Hamiltonians and realistic atomistic systems.},

Here, we fabricate the pyramidal ZnO–Au HNCs and study their unique photophysical properties. Several Au nanospheres are perfectly epitaxially bound with a single ZnO NC owing to the small lattice mismatch between them and there are also ZnO–Au–ZnO sandwiched HNCs. There is a strong coupling between the green defect-associated recombination in the ZnO NC and the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of the Au nanosphere at the interface of the HNC. This leads to resonant defect recombination–LSPR energy transfer and resultant nearly complete quenching of the green defect luminescence of the ZnO NCs in the HNCs, leaving only the UV exciton luminescence. The lifetimes of both the green and UV emission bands decrease significantly in the ZnO–Au HNCs relative to that of the pure ZnO NCs owing to the combined effect of resonance energy transfer and surface plasmon enhanced radiative transition. The exponent of the luminescence intensity–excitation intensity power function for the green emission band is remarkably smaller than unity, and this suggests that the involved defects have an intermediate concentration.},

While the structure and properties of electric double layers in electrolyte solutions near a charged surface are well characterized, there are subtleties in calculating thermodynamic properties from the free energy of a system with charged surfaces. These subtleties arise from the difference in the free energy between systems with constant surface charge and constant surface potential. In this work, we present a systematic, pedagogical framework to properly account for the different specifications on charged bodies in electrolyte solutions. Our approach is fully variational—that is, all free energies, boundary conditions, relevant electrostatic equations, and thermodynamic quantities are systematically derived using variational principles of thermodynamics. We illustrate our approach by considering a simple electrolyte solution between two charged surfaces using the Poisson–Boltzmann theory. Our results highlight the importance of using the proper thermodynamic potential and provide a general framework for calculating thermodynamic properties of electrolyte solutions near charged surfaces. Specifically, we present the calculation of the pressure and the surface tension between two charged surfaces for different boundary conditions, including mixed boundary conditions.},

  abstract = {Ternary semiconductors such as AgInS 2 , with their interesting photocatalytic properties, can serve as building blocks to design light harvesting assemblies. The intraband transitions created by the metal ions extend the absorption well beyond the bandgap transition. The interfacial electron transfer of AgInS 2 with surface bound ethyl viologen under bandgap and sub-bandgap irradiation as probed by steady state photolysis and transient absorption spectroscopy offers new insights into the participation of conduction band and trapped electrons. Capping AgInS 2 with CdS shifts emission maximum to the blue and increases the emission yield as the surface defects are remediated. CdS capping also promotes charge separation as evident from the efficiency of electron transfer to ethyl viologen, which increased from 14\% to 29\%. The transient absorption measurements that elucidate the kinetic aspects of electron transfer processes in AgInS 2 and CdS capped AgInS 2 are presented. The improved performance of CdS capped AgInS 2 offers new opportunities to employ them as photocatalysts.},

  abstract = {Magnesium has attracted growing interest for its use in various applications, primarily due to its abundance, lightweight properties, and relatively low cost. However, one major drawback to its widespread use remains to be its reactivity in aqueous environments, which is poorly understood at the atomistic level. Ab initio density functional theory methods are particularly well suited to bridge this knowledge gap, but the explicit simulation of electrified water/metal interfaces is often too costly from a computational viewpoint. Here, we investigate water/Mg interfaces using the computationally efficient implicit solvent model VASPsol. We show that the Mg (0001), ( ⁠ 10 1 ̄ 0 ⁠ ), and ( ⁠ 10 1 ̄ 1 ⁠ ) surfaces each form different electrochemical double layers due to the anisotropic smoothing of the electron density at their surfaces, following Smoluchowski rules. We highlight the dependence that the position of the diffuse cavity surrounding the interface has on the potential of zero charge and the electron double layer capacitance, and how these parameters are also affected by the addition of explicit water and adsorbed OH molecules. Finally, we calculate the equilibrium potential of Mg 2+ /Mg 0 in an aqueous environment to be −2.46 V vs a standard hydrogen electrode, in excellent agreement with the experiment.},

Here, we conduct quantum transport calculations for a single biphenyl molecule anchored on Au (111) electrodes with thiolate, selenolate, and telluride terminal groups taking into account both dispersive interactions and spin–orbit coupling. The numerical results show that the current through the junction decreases by increasing the atomic number of the chalcogen atom due to nanoscale charge localization as revealed in transmission eigenstates analysis. The effect of spin–orbit coupling becomes more pronounced by increasing the atomic number of the chalcogen atom. Clear current rectification is obtained when the molecule is asymmetrically connected to the electrodes using different chalcogen atoms. These findings can be useful in exploring transport properties of organic molecules adsorbed on metallic surfaces using alternatives to sulfur chalcogen atoms.},

In the Raman dimension, the frequency positions of these cross peaks coincide with the intramolecular bending modes of the CHBr 3 molecules and in the THz dimension with the IR-active lattice modes of the crystal. This work expands the applicability of this new 2D spectroscopic technique to solid samples at cryogenic temperatures. Furthermore, it provides new experimental evidence that the cross peaks, indeed, originate from the coupling between intra- and intermolecular vibrational modes.},

Here, we explore dimerization in this environment using an atomistic model within statistically converged molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories, treating the solvent implicitly through the use of a thermostat, or more explicitly by embedding one monomer in a He 100 cluster. The focus is on the two simplest carboxylic acids, formic and acetic, both of which have been studied experimentally. While the global minimum structure, which comprises two CO⋯HO hydrogen bonds, is predicted to be the most abundant dimer in the absence of the helium solvent, this is no longer the case once helium atoms are included. The simulations confirm the importance of kinetic trapping effects and also shed light on the occurrence of specific dynamical effects, leading to the occasional formation of high-energy structures away from minima, such as saddle configurations. Theoretically predicted infrared spectra, based on the MD statistics, are in good agreement with the experimental spectra.},

The complexes are formed by “ligand exchange” reactions of X − · (H 2 O) n clusters with HOCl molecules at low pressure (∼10 −2 mbar) in a radio frequency ion guide. The spectra generally feature many bands in addition to the fundamentals expected at the double harmonic level. These “extra bands” appear in patterns that are similar to those displayed by the X − · HOD analogs, where they are assigned to excitations of nominally IR forbidden overtones and combination bands. The interactions driving these features include mechanical and electronic anharmonicities. Particularly intense bands are observed for the v = 0 → 2 transitions of the out-of-plane bending soft modes of the HOCl molecule relative to the ions. These involve displacements that act to break the strong H-bond to the ion, which give rise to large quadratic dependences of the electric dipoles (electronic anharmonicities) that drive the transition moments for the overtone bands. On the other hand, overtone bands arising from the intramolecular OH bending modes of HOCl are traced to mechanical anharmonic coupling with the v = 1 level of the OH stretch (Fermi resonances). These interactions are similar in strength to those reported earlier for the X − · HOD complexes.},

The variables that affect the strength of IMHB are determined using kinetic bond orders, QUAO populations, and QUAO hybridizations. Important properties include both the interatomic distance between hydrogen and oxygen participating in the IMHB and the hybridization on the oxygen. The bonding analysis further shows that each intramolecular hydrogen bond is a four-electron three-center bond.

  abstract = {The high catalytic activity of Pt is accompanied by a high affinity for CO, making it extremely susceptible to poisoning. Such CO poisoning limits the use of proton exchange membrane fuel cells. In this work, using global minima search techniques and exhaustive electronic structure characterization, the dopant concentration is pinpointed as a crucial factor to improve the CO tolerance of Pt catalysts. By investigating the PtGe nanoclusters of different sizes and compositions, we found that, for those clusters with roughly the same amount of Pt and Ge, the binding to CO is weakened significantly. The uniqueness of the PtGe equimolar clusters is traced down to the electronic effects. The strong covalency and electrostatic stabilization arising from the advantageous Pt–Ge mixing make the equimolar clusters highly resistant toward CO poisoning and therefore more durable. Importantly, the novel catalysts not only are more resistant to deactivation but also remain catalytically active toward hydrogen oxidation. Representative clusters are additionally deposited on graphene with a pentagon–octagon–pentagon (5-8-5) reconstructed divacancy. The remarkable results of free-standing clusters hold true for surface mounted clusters, in which the interaction with CO is dramatically weakened for those compounds with a Pt:Ge ratio of 1:1. Our results demonstrate that Ge can be a promising alloying agent to mitigate the deactivation of Pt and that the dopant concentration is a critical factor in the design of advanced catalysts.},

We investigate the role of resonance conditions by performing measurements on a series of coumarin fluorophores of varying electronic transition frequencies. To analyze variations in signal strength and signal to background between molecules, we introduce an FEIR brightness metric that normalizes out measurement-specific parameters. We find that the effect of the resonance condition on FEIR brightness can be reasonably well described by the electronic absorption spectrum.

Specifically, microwave irradiation at frequencies ω μ w ∼ ω 0S ± ω 0I , where ω 0S and ω 0I are electron and nuclear Larmor frequencies, respectively, yields enhanced nuclear spin polarization. Following the recent rediscovery of the three-spin solid effect (3SSE) [Tan et al. , Sci.

Previously, it has been shown that Zombie states with fractional occupations of spin orbitals obeyed the correct fermionic creation and annihilation algebra and presented results for real-time evolution [D. V. Shalashilin, J. Chem. Phys. 148 , 194109 (2018)]. In this work, we extend and build on this formalism by developing efficient algorithms for evaluating the Hamiltonian and other operators between Zombie states and address their normalization. We also show how imaginary time propagation can be used to find the ground state of a system. We also present a biasing method, for setting up a basis set of random Zombie states, that allows much smaller basis sizes to be used while still accurately describing the electronic structure Hamiltonian and its ground state and describe a technique of wave function “cleaning” that removes the contributions of configurations with the wrong number of electrons, improving the accuracy further. We also show how low-lying excited states can be calculated efficiently using a Gram–Schmidt orthogonalization procedure. The proposed algorithm of imaginary time propagation on biased random grids of Zombie states may present an alternative to the existing quantum Monte Carlo methods.},

  abstract = {Fermi’s golden rule (GR) describes the leading-order behavior of the reaction rate as a function of the diabatic coupling. Its asymptotic ( ℏ → 0) limit is the semiclassical golden-rule instanton rate theory, which rigorously approximates nuclear quantum effects, lends itself to efficient numerical computation, and gives physical insight into reaction mechanisms. However, the golden rule by itself becomes insufficient as the strength of the diabatic coupling increases, so higher-order terms must be additionally considered. In this work, we give a first-principles derivation of the next-order term beyond the golden rule, represented as a sum of three components. Two of them lead to new instanton pathways that extend the GR case and, among other factors, account for effects of recrossing on the full rate. The remaining component derives from the equilibrium partition function and accounts for changes in potential energy around the reactant and product wells due to diabatic coupling. The new semiclassical theory demands little computational effort beyond a GR instanton calculation. It makes it possible to rigorously assess the accuracy of the GR approximation and sets the stage for future work on general semiclassical nonadiabatic rate theories.},

Understanding how nucleic acids fold and how they transition between different folded structures as they unfold and refold has important implications for biology. This paper reports a theoretical model and computer simulation of the ab initio folding of DNA inverted repeat sequences. The formulation is based on an all-atom conformational model of the sugar-phosphate backbone via chain closure, and it incorporates three major molecular-level driving forces—base stacking, counterion-induced backbone self-interactions, and base pairing—via separate analytical theories designed to capture and reproduce the effects of the solvent without requiring explicit water and ions in the simulation. To accelerate computational throughput, a mixed numerical/analytical algorithm for the calculation of the backbone conformational volume is incorporated into the Monte Carlo simulation, and special stochastic sampling techniques were employed to achieve the computational efficiency needed to fold nucleic acids from scratch. This paper describes implementation details, benchmark results, and the advantages and technical challenges with this approach.},

In this paper, we present a numerically efficient scheme to evaluate the imHEOM utilizing the β -differentiated imHEOM (BD-imHEOM) that are obtained by differentiating the elements of the imHEOM with respect to the inverse temperature. This approach allows us to evaluate the system, system–bath interaction, and heat-bath parts of the PF efficiently. Moreover, we employ a polyharmonic decomposition method to construct a concise hierarchical structure with better convergence, thus reducing the cost of numerical integrations. We demonstrate the proposed approach by compute thermodynamic quantities of a spin-boson system and a 2 × 2 antiferromagnetic triangular spin lattice system with an Ohmic spectral distribution.},

  abstract = {We present efficient algorithms for using selected configuration interaction (sCI) trial wave functions in phaseless auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo (ph-AFQMC). These advances, geared toward optimizing computational performance for longer configuration interaction expansions, allow us to use up to a million configurations in the trial state for ph-AFQMC. In one example, we found the cost of ph-AFQMC per sample to increase only by a factor of about 3 for a calculation with 10 4 configurations compared to that with a single one, demonstrating the tiny computational overhead due to a longer expansion. This favorable scaling allows us to study the systematic convergence of the phaseless bias in auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo calculations with an increasing number of configurations and provides a means to gauge the accuracy of ph-AFQMC with other trial states. We also show how the scalability issues of sCI trial states for large system sizes could be mitigated by restricting them to a moderately sized orbital active space and leveraging the near-cancellation of out of active space phaseless errors.},

  abstract = {We introduce a new theoretical approach for analyzing pump and probe experiments in non-linear systems of optical phonons. In our approach, the effect of coherently pumped polaritons is modeled as providing time-periodic modulation of the system parameters. Within this framework, propagation of the probe pulse is described by the Floquet version of Maxwell’s equations and leads to phenomena such as frequency mixing and resonant parametric production of polariton pairs. We analyze light reflection from a slab of insulating material with a strongly excited phonon-polariton mode and obtain analytic expressions for the frequency-dependent reflection coefficient for the probe pulse. Our results are in agreement with recent experiments by Cartella et al. [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 115 , 12148 (2018)], which demonstrated light amplification in a resonantly excited SiC insulator. We show that, beyond a critical pumping strength, such systems should exhibit Floquet parametric instability, which corresponds to resonant scattering of pump polaritons into pairs of finite momentum polaritons. We find that the parametric instability should be achievable in SiC using current experimental techniques and discuss its signatures, including the non-analytic frequency dependence of the reflection coefficient and the probe pulse afterglow. We discuss possible applications of the parametric instability phenomenon and suggest that similar types of instabilities can be present in other photoexcited non-linear systems.},

  abstract = {Mixed quantum-classical dynamics based on the exact factorization exploits the “derived” electron-nuclear correlation (ENC) term, aiming for the description of quantum coherences. The ENC contains interactions between the phase of electronic states and nuclear quantum momenta, which depend on the spatial shape of the nuclear density. The original surface hopping based on the exact factorization (SHXF) [Ha et al. , J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 9 , 1097 (2018)] exploits frozen Gaussian functions to construct the nuclear density in the ENC term, while the phase of electronic states is approximated as a fictitious nuclear momentum change. However, in reality, the width of nuclear wave packets varies in time depending on the shape of potential energy surfaces. In this work, we present a modified SHXF approach and a newly developed Ehrenfest dynamics based on the exact factorization (EhXF) with time-dependent Gaussian functions and phases by enforcing total energy conservation. We perform numerical tests for various one-dimensional two-state model Hamiltonians. Overall, the time-dependent width of Gaussian functions and the energy conserving phase show a reliable decoherence compared to the original frozen Gaussian-based SHXF and the exact quantum mechanical calculation. In particular, the energy conserving phase is crucial for EhXF to reproduce the correct quantum dynamics.},

In contrast to the original TAO-DFT with the density in an ensemble form, in which each orbital density is weighted with a fractional occupation number, the ground-state density is given by a single-determinant wavefunction, a regular Kohn–Sham (KS) density, and total ground state energy is expressed in the normal KS form with a static correlation energy formulated in terms of the KS orbitals. In post-SCF calculations with rTAO functionals, an efficient energy scanning to quantitatively determine θ is also proposed. The rTAOs provide a promising method to simulate systems with strong static correlation as original TAO, but simpler and more efficient. We show that both rTAO and rTAO-1 is capable of reproducing most results from TAO-DFT without the additional functional E θ used in TAO-DFT. Furthermore, our numerical results support that, without the functional E θ , both rTAO and rTAO-1 can capture correct static correlation profiles in various systems.},

  abstract = {Materials optimization for organic solar cells (OSCs) is a highly active field, with many approaches using empirical experimental synthesis, computational brute force to screen a subset of chemical space, or generative machine learning methods that often require significant training sets. While these methods may find high-performing materials, they can be inefficient and time-consuming. Genetic algorithms (GAs) are an alternative approach, allowing for the “virtual synthesis” of molecules and a prediction of their “fitness” for some property, with new candidates suggested based on good characteristics of previously generated molecules. In this work, a GA is used to discover high-performing unfused non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) based on an empirical prediction of power conversion efficiency (PCE) and provides design rules for future work. The electron-withdrawing/donating strength, as well as the sequence and symmetry, of those units are examined. The utilization of a GA over a brute-force approach resulted in speedups up to 1.8 × 10 12 . New types of units, not frequently seen in OSCs, are suggested, and in total 5426 NFAs are discovered with the GA. Of these, 1087 NFAs are predicted to have a PCE greater than 18\%, which is roughly the current record efficiency. While the symmetry of the sequence showed no correlation with PCE, analysis of the sequence arrangement revealed that higher performance can be achieved with a donor core and acceptor end groups. Future NFA designs should consider this strategy as an alternative to the current A-D-A′-D-A architecture.},

To do this, we perform real-time propagations of helium atom wavefunction using quantum chemistry methods coupled to Gaussian basis sets. Calculations are performed within the real-time time-dependent configuration interaction framework at two levels of theory: time-dependent configuration interaction with single excitations (uncorrelated method) and time-dependent full configuration interaction (fully correlated method). The electronic wavefunction is expanded in Dunning basis sets supplemented with functions adapted to describing highly excited and continuum states. We also compare the time-dependent configuration interaction results with grid-based propagations of the helium atom within the single-active-electron approximation. Our results show that when including the dynamical electron correlation, a noticeable improvement to the description of high harmonic generation (HHG) can be achieved in terms of, e.g., a more constant intensity in the lower energy part of the harmonic plateau. However, such effects can be captured only if the basis set used suffices to reproduce the most basic features, such as the HHG cutoff position, at the uncorrelated level of theory.},

  abstract = {We present a density functional theory (DFT)-based, quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) implementation with long-range electrostatic embedding achieved by direct real-space integration of the particle-mesh Ewald (PME) computed electrostatic potential. The key transformation is the interpolation of the electrostatic potential from the PME grid to the DFT quadrature grid from which integrals are easily evaluated utilizing standard DFT machinery. We provide benchmarks of the numerical accuracy with choice of grid size and real-space corrections and demonstrate that good convergence is achieved while introducing nominal computational overhead. Furthermore, the approach requires only small modification to existing software packages as is demonstrated with our implementation in the OpenMM and Psi4 software. After presenting convergence benchmarks, we evaluate the importance of long-range electrostatic embedding in three solute/solvent systems modeled with QM/MM. Water and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (BMIM/BF 4 ) ionic liquid were considered as “simple” and “complex” solvents, respectively, with water and p -phenylenediamine (PPD) solute molecules treated at the QM level of theory. While electrostatic embedding with standard real-space truncation may introduce negligible errors for simple systems such as water solute in water solvent, errors become more significant when QM/MM is applied to complex solvents such as ionic liquids. An extreme example is the electrostatic embedding energy for oxidized PPD in BMIM/BF 4 for which real-space truncation produces severe errors even at 2–3 nm cutoff distances. This latter example illustrates that utilization of QM/MM to compute redox potentials within concentrated electrolytes/ionic media requires carefully chosen long-range electrostatic embedding algorithms with our presented algorithm providing a general and robust approach.},

  abstract = {Flexoelectricity is an electromechanical coupling phenomenon that can generate noticeable electric polarization in dielectric materials for nanoscale strain gradients. It is gaining increasing attention because of its potential applications and the fact that experimental results were initially an order of magnitude higher than initial theoretical predictions. This stimulated intense experimental and theoretical research to investigate flexoelectric coefficients in dielectric materials such as two-dimensional materials. In this study, we concentrate on the calculation of the flexoelectric coefficients of 2D-MoS 2 due to a model using self-consistently determined charges and dipoles on the atoms. More specifically, we study the importance of two contributions that were neglected/omitted in previous papers using this model, namely, the charge term in the total polarization and the conservation of electric charge through a Lagrange multiplier. Our calculations demonstrate that the results for flexoelectric coefficients computed with this improved definition of polarization agree better with experimental measurements, provided that consistent definitions for signs are used. Additionally, we show how two physical contributions with opposite signs compete to give net values of flexoelectric coefficients that can be either positive or negative depending on their relative importance and give net values for the case of MoS 2 .},

The convergence of this expansion depends strongly on the definition of the underlying bodies, which essentially decompose the correlation space into fragments. The different definitions considered here comprise mode-based bodies, excitation level-based bodies, and energy-based bodies. An analysis of the convergence behavior revealed that accounting for resonances within these definitions is mandatory and leads to a substantial improvement of the convergence, that is, the expansions can be truncated at lower orders. Benchmark calculations and systematic comparisons of the different body definitions for a small set of molecules, i.e., ketene, ethene, and diborane, have been conducted to study the overall performance of these iVCI implementations with respect to accuracy and central processing unit time.},

The wave function optimization algorithm features an original scheme to create initial orbitals for the geminal functions in a black-box fashion. The implementation is employed to examine the accuracy of the geminal linear response for singlet excitation energies of small and medium-sized molecules. In systems dominated by dynamic correlation, geminal models constitute only a minor improvement with respect to time-dependent Hartree–Fock.

  abstract = {We study the dynamics of pure oleic acid and grafted oleic acid synthesized by decomposing iron oleate into oleic acid grafted iron oxide nanoparticles. Our quasielastic neutron scattering study shows that oleic acid dominantly performs translational diffusion at room temperature. On the other hand, in nanocomposites, constraints imposed by grafting and crowding of neighboring chains restrict the grafted oleic acid to uniaxial rotation. Interestingly, it also manifests mobility in grafted oleic acid below the crystallization temperature of pure oleic acid. The data from grafted oleic acid could be effectively described using a uniaxial rotational diffusion model with an additional elastic scattering contribution. This kind of elastic scattering arises due to the restricted bond mobility and increases with decreasing temperature. The radius of rotation obtained from the fitted data agrees very well with the geometry of the molecule and grafting density. These results open possibilities of research on the confined surfactant systems, which could be analyzed using the approach described here.},

  abstract = {Melting of DNA sequences may occur through a few major intermediate states, whose influence on the melting curve has been discussed previously, while their effect on the kinetics has not been explored thoroughly. Here, we chose a simple DNA sequence, forming a hairpin in its native (zipped) state, and study it using molecular dynamic (MD) simulations and a model integrating the Gaussian network model with bond-binding energies—the Gaussian binding energy (GBE) model. We find two major partial denaturation states, a bubble state and a partial unzipping state. We demonstrate the influence of these two states on the closing–opening base pair dynamics, as probed by a tagged bond auto-correlation function (ACF). We argue that the latter is measured by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy experiments, in which one base of the pair is linked to a fluorescent dye, while the complementary base is linked to a quencher, similar to the experiment reported by Altan-Bonnet et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 90 , 138101 (2003)]. We find that tagging certain base pairs at temperatures around the melting temperature results in a multi-step relaxation of the ACF, while tagging other base pairs leads to an effectively single-step relaxation, albeit non-exponential. Only the latter type of relaxation has been observed experimentally, and we suggest which of the other base pairs should be tagged in order to observe multi-step relaxation. We demonstrate that this behavior can be observed with other sequences and argue that the GBE can reliably predict these dynamics for very long sequences, where MD simulations might be limited.},

  abstract = {On approaching the glass transition, a dense colloid exhibits a dramatic slowdown with minute structural changes. Most microscopy experiments directly follow the motion of individual particles in real space, whereas scattering experiments typically probe the collective dynamics in reciprocal space at variable wavevector q . Multiscale studies of glassy dynamics are experimentally demanding and, thus, seldom performed. By using two-dimensional hard-sphere colloids at various area fractions ϕ , we show here that Differential Dynamic Microscopy (DDM) can be effectively used to measure the collective dynamics of a glassy colloid in a range of q within a single experiment. As ϕ is increased, the single decay of the intermediate scattering functions is progressively replaced by a more complex relaxation that we fit to a sum of two stretched-exponential decays. The slowest process, corresponding to the long-time particle escapes from caging, has a characteristic time τ s = 1/( D L q 2 ) with diffusion coefficient D L ∼ ( ϕ c − ϕ ) 2.8 ⁠ , and ϕ c ≃ 0.81. The fast process exhibits, instead, a non-Brownian scaling of the characteristic time τ f ( q ) and a relative amplitude a ( q ) that monotonically increases with q . Despite the non-Brownian nature of τ f ( q ), we succeed in estimating the short-time diffusion coefficient D cage , whose ϕ -dependence is practically negligible compared to the one of D L . Finally, we extend DDM to measure the q -dependent dynamical susceptibility χ 4 ( q , t ), a powerful yet hard-to-access multiscale indicator of dynamical heterogeneities. Our results show that DDM is a convenient tool to study the dynamics of colloidal glasses over a broad range of time and length scales.},

Here, we study the frame-guided assembly in a two-dimensional membrane via computer simulations based on a single-bead coarse grained surfactant model in continuous space. In agreement with the experiment, the assembly process already starts for surfactant concentrations below the critical micelle concentration. Furthermore, upon increasing temperature, the formation process gets more delocalized. Additionally, the assembly process of the resulting membrane plane is modeled by a lattice gas model. It displays a similar phenomenology but additionally allows for the derivation of analytical mean-field predictions. In this way, a fundamental understanding of frame-guided assembly can be gained.},

  abstract = {Protein self-assembly into amyloid fibrils underlies several neurodegenerative conditions, including Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. It has become apparent that the small oligomers formed during this process constitute neurotoxic molecular species associated with amyloid aggregation. Targeting the formation of oligomers represents, therefore, a possible therapeutic avenue to combat these diseases. However, it remains challenging to establish which microscopic steps should be targeted to suppress most effectively the generation of oligomeric aggregates. Recently, we have developed a kinetic model of oligomer dynamics during amyloid aggregation. Here, we use this approach to derive explicit scaling relationships that reveal how key features of the time evolution of oligomers, including oligomer peak concentration and lifetime, are controlled by the different rate parameters. We discuss the therapeutic implications of our framework by predicting changes in oligomer concentrations when the rates of the individual microscopic events are varied. Our results identify the kinetic parameters that control most effectively the generation of oligomers, thus opening a new path for the systematic rational design of therapeutic strategies against amyloid-related diseases.},

However, the question to what extent these quasi-2D systems indeed represent 2D systems is rarely brought up. Here, we use computer simulations that take into account hydrodynamic interactions to show that dense quasi-2D colloidal bi-disperse hard-sphere suspensions exhibit much more rapid diffusion and relaxation than their 2D counterparts at the same area fraction. This difference is induced by the additional vertical space in the quasi-2D samples in which the small colloids can move out of the 2D plane, therefore allowing overlap between particles in the projected trajectories. Surprisingly, this difference in the dynamics can be accounted for if, instead of using the surface density, one characterizes the systems by means of a suitable structural quantity related to the radial distribution function. This implies that in the two geometries, the relevant physics for glass formation is essentially identical. Our results provide not only practical implications on 2D colloidal experiments but also interesting insights into the 3D-to-2D crossover in glass-forming systems.},

In this work, we investigate the emerging dynamics of particles featuring ligands that selectively bind receptors decorating an interface. The formation of a ligand – receptor complex leads to a molecular bridge anchoring the particle to the surface. We consider systems with reversible bridges in which ligand – receptor pairs bind/unbind with finite reaction rates. For a given set of bridges, the particle can explore a tiny fraction of the surface as the extensivity of the bridges is finite. We show how, at timescales longer than the bridges’ lifetime, the average position of the particle diffuses away from its initial value. We distill our findings into two analytic equations for the sliding diffusion constant of particles carrying mobile and fixed ligands. We quantitatively validate our theoretical predictions using reaction–diffusion simulations. We compare our findings with results from recent literature studies and discuss the molecular parameters that likely affect the particle’s mobility most. Our results, along with recent literature studies, will allow inferring the microscopic parameters at play in complex biological systems from experimental trajectories.},

Herein, we use an extended hydrophobic solute as a model system to study the effect of urea and methanol on the density fluctuations in the solute’s solvation shell and the resulting thermodynamics. On strengthening the solute–water/cosolute repulsive interaction, we observe distinct trends in the mutual affinities between various species in, and the thermodynamic properties of, the solvation shell. These trends strongly follow the respective trends in the preferential adsorption of urea and methanol: solute–water/cosolute repulsion strengthens, urea accumulation decreases, and methanol accumulation increases. Preferential accumulation of urea is found to quench the density fluctuations around the extended solute, leading to a decrease in the compressibility of the solvation shell. In contrast, methanol accumulation enhances the density fluctuations, leading to an increase in the compressibility. The mode of action of urea and methanol seems to be strongly coupled to their hydration behavior. The observations from this simple model is discussed in relation to urea driven swelling and methanol induced collapse of some well-known thermo-responsive polymers.},

We designed a specific structure of the HC-PC; a semiconductor core in which thermalization of photo-generated carriers is significantly suppressed is surrounded by a shell whose bandgap is wider than that of the core. Among the photo-generated hot carriers in the core, only carriers whose energies are larger than the shell bandgap are extracted passing through the shell to the active sites on the shell surface. Thus, the shell functions as an energy-selective contact. We calculated the upper bounds of the rates of the carrier supply from the core to the active sites using a newly constructed detailed-balance model including partial thermalization and nonradiative recombination of the carriers. It has been revealed that the HC-PCs can yield higher carrier-supply rates and thus potentially higher solar-to-chemical energy conversion efficiencies for H 2 and CO production than those of conventional photocatalysts with the assistance of intraband transition and Auger recombination/impact ionization. It should be noted, however, that one of the necessary conditions for efficient hot-carrier extraction is sufficiently large carrier density in the core, which, in turn, requires concentrated solar illumination by several hundreds. This would raise rate-limiting problems of activities of the chemical reactions induced by the photo-generated carriers and material-transfer properties.},

Motivated by earlier work that showed an exceptionally high intra-plane thermal conductivity in diamane, in this work, we investigate the interfacial thermal resistance ( R ) between graphene and diamane using non-equilibrium classical molecular dynamics simulations. The calculated R for a pristine graphene and AB-stacked diamane at room temperature is 1.89 × 10 −7 K m 2 /W, which is comparable to other common graphene/semi-conductor bilayers. These results are understood in terms of the overlap of the phonon density of states between the graphene and diamane layers. We further explore the impact of stacking pattern, system temperature, coupling strength, in-plane tensile strain, and hydrogenation ratio on R . Intriguingly, we find that unlike single layer diamane, where the intra-plane thermal conductively is reduced by ∼50\% under 5\% strain, the inter-plane thermal conductance of the graphene–diamane bilayer is enhanced by ∼50\% under 8\% strain. The difference is caused by the opposite behavior between the inter- and intra-layer conductances as phonon relaxation time is decreased. The high intra-plane thermal conductivity and low inter-plane thermal resistance shows the high potential of using graphene–diamane heterostructures in electronic applications.},

At the chemisorption stage, iodine first forms a ( 3 × 3 ) R30° structure. Further iodine dosing leads to continuous commensurate–incommensurate phase transition, taking place via the formation of striped superheavy domain walls. As a result, the uniaxially compressed (13 × 3 -R30°) phase is formed at an iodine coverage ( θ ) of 0.38 ML. At θ &gt; 0.38 ML, first-order phase transition begins, leading to the formation of hexagonal moiré-like phases, which exhibit an anomalously large corrugation in STM (0.8–2.3 Å). In the range of 0.40–0.43 ML, the compression of hexagonal phases occurs, which ends at the formation of the (7 × 7)R21.8° structure at saturation. The DFT calculations allow us to explain the anomalous atomic corrugation of the hexagonal phases by the strong violation of the atomic structure of the substrate including up to ten layers of silver. Iodine dosing above 0.43 ML leads to the growth of 2D islands of silver iodide. The STM images of the silver iodide surface demonstrate a clear visible hexagonal superstructure with a periodicity of 25 Å superimposed with a quasi-hexagonal atomic modulation. DFT calculations of the atomic structure of AgI islands point to the formation of a sandwich-like double layer honeycomb structure similar to the case of I/Ag(100).},

  abstract = {Sum-frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy is frequently used to investigate the structure of monolayer films of long-chain fatty acids at the air–water interface. Although labeled a non-invasive technique, introducing intense SFG lasers onto liquid interfaces has the potential to perturb them. In the present work, narrowband picosecond SFG is used to study the structural changes that occur in palmitic acid and per-deuterated palmitic acid monolayers at the air–water interface in response to the high field strengths inherent to SFG spectroscopy. In order to determine structural changes and identify measurement artifacts, the changes in specific resonance intensities were measured in real-time and over a broad range of surface concentrations from films spread onto a stationary Langmuir trough. Using narrowband instead of broadband SFG minimizes the overlap of the incident infrared beam in the lipid C–H stretching region with resonances from the water sub-phase. Nevertheless, narrowband SFG still generates a thermal gradient at the surface, which produces a significant decrease in local concentration in the area of the laser spot caused by Bérnard–Marangoni convection originating in the sub-phase. The decrease in concentration results in an increase in the conformational disorder and a decrease in the tilt angle of lipid tails. Crucially, it is shown that, even at the highest monolayer concentrations, this gives rise to a measurement effect, which manifests itself as a dependence on the spectral acquisition time. This effect should be taken into account when interpreting the structure of monolayer films on liquid surfaces deduced from their SFG spectra.},

  abstract = {When subject to cyclic forcing, amorphous solids can reach periodic, repetitive states, where the system behaves plastically, but the particles return to their initial positions after one or more forcing cycles, where the latter response is called multi-periodic. It is known that plasticity in amorphous materials is mediated by local rearrangements called “soft spots” or “shear transformation zones.” Experiments and simulations indicate that soft spots can be modeled as hysteretic two-state entities interacting via quadrupolar displacement fields generated when they switch states and that these interactions can give rise to multi-periodic behavior. However, how interactions facilitate multi-periodicity is unknown. Here, we show, using a model of random interacting two-state systems and molecular dynamics simulations, that multi-periodicity arises from oscillations in the magnitudes of the switching field of soft spots, which cause soft spots to be active during some forcing cycles and idle during others. We demonstrate that these oscillations result from cooperative effects facilitated by the frustrated interactions between the soft spots. The presence of such mechanisms has implications for manipulating memory in frustrated hysteretic systems.},

  abstract = {The spatiotemporal correlations of the local stress tensor in supercooled liquids are studied both theoretically and by molecular dynamics simulations of a two-dimensional (2D) polydisperse Lennard-Jones system. Asymptotically exact theoretical equations defining the dynamical structure factor and all components of the stress correlation tensor for low wave-vector q are presented in terms of the generalized ( q -dependent) shear and longitudinal relaxation moduli, G ( q , t ) and K ( q , t ). We developed a rigorous approach (valid for low q ) to calculate K ( q , t ) in terms of certain bulk correlation functions (for q = 0), the static structure factor S ( q ), and thermal conductivity κ . The proposed approach takes into account both the thermostatting effect and the effect of polydispersity. The theoretical results for the ( q , t )-dependent stress correlation functions are compared with our simulation data, and an excellent agreement is found for q b ̄ ≲ 0.5 (with b ̄ being the mean particle diameter) both above and below the glass transition without any fitting parameters. Our data are consistent with recently predicted (both theoretically and by simulations) long-range correlations of the shear stress quenched in heterogeneous glassy structures.},

  abstract = {The amphiphilicity and denaturation efficiency of urea can be tuned via alkylation. Although the interaction of alkylureas with water and proteins has been studied in detail, hydration of 1-methylurea has remained elusive, precluding the isolation of the effect of an individual methyl group. Here, we study water dynamics in the hydration shell of 1-methylurea (1-MU) using infrared absorption and ultrafast infrared spectroscopies. We find that 1-MU hardly affects the hydrogen-bond distribution of water as probed by the OD stretching vibration of HOD molecules. Polarization resolved infrared pump–probe experiments reveal that 1-MU slows down the rotational dynamics of up to 3 water molecules in its hydration shell. A comparison to earlier results for other alkylureas suggests that further alkylation does not necessarily slow down the rotational dynamics of additional water molecules. Two-dimensional infrared experiments show that 1-MU markedly slows down the hydrogen-bond fluctuation dynamics of water, yet similar to what has been found for urea and dimethylureas. Remarkably, (alkyl-)ureas that share a similar effect on water’s hydrogen-bond fluctuation dynamics have a similar (modest) protein denaturation tendency. As such, not only the hydrophobicity but also hydration of hydrophilic fragments of alkylureas may be relevant to explain their function toward biomolecules.},

  abstract = {Thermodiffusion is the migration of a species due to a temperature gradient and is the driving phenomenon in many applications ranging from early cancer detection to uranium enrichment. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can be a useful tool for exploring the rather complex thermodiffusive behavior of species, such as proteins and ions. However, current MD models of thermodiffusion in aqueous ionic solutions struggle to quantitatively predict the Soret coefficient, which indicates the magnitude and direction of species migration under a temperature gradient. In this work, we aim to improve the accuracy of MD thermodiffusion models by assessing how well different water models can recreate thermodiffusion in a benchmark aqueous NaCl solution. We tested four of the best available rigid non-polarizable water models (TIP3P-FB, TIP4P-FB, OPC3, and OPC) and the commonly used TIP3P and SPC/E water models for their ability to predict the inversion temperature and Soret coefficient in 0.5, 2, and 4M aqueous NaCl solutions. Each water model predicted a noticeably different ion distribution yielding different inversion temperatures and magnitudes of the Soret coefficient. By comparing the modeled Soret coefficients to published experimental values, we determine TIP3P-FB to be the water model that best recreates thermodiffusion in aqueous NaCl solutions. Our findings can aid future works in selecting the most accurate rigid non-polarizable water model, including water and ion parameters for investigating thermodiffusion through MD simulations.},

Depending on the ratio between the strength of the soft shell barrier and the activity, we find two regimes: If this ratio is much larger or smaller than 1, the observed behavior is comparable with ABPs interacting via a single length scale potential. If this ratio is similar to 1, the two length scales are relevant for both structure and dynamical properties. On the structural side, when the system exhibits a motility induced phase separation, the dense phase is characterized by new and more complex structures compared with the hexatic phase observed in single length scale systems. From the dynamic analysis, we find, to our knowledge, the first manifestation of a dynamic heterogeneity in active particles, reminiscent of the glassy dynamics widely studied in passive colloids.},

In this article, we assess the impact of the choice of truncation scheme when comparing water in homogeneous and inhomogeneous environments. Specifically, we use explicit free energy calculations and a simple mean field analysis to demonstrate that using the “cut-and-shift” version of the Lennard-Jones potential (common to most simple point charge models of water) results in a systematic increase in the melting temperature of ice I h . In addition, by drawing an analogy between a change in cutoff and a change in pressure, we use existing literature data for homogeneous ice nucleation at negative pressures to suggest that enhancements due to heterogeneous nucleation may have been overestimated by several orders of magnitude.},

A higher correlation correction is computed at coupled-cluster single double triple quadruple level for 2000 points and is considered alongside other more minor corrections due to relativity, core-valence correlation, and Born–Oppenheimer failure. The analytical surface constructed uses 500 constants to reproduce the ab initio points with a standard deviation of 0.3 cm −1 . Vibration–rotation–inversion energy levels of the HF dimer are computed for this PES by variational solution of the nuclear-motion Schrödinger equation using the program WAVR4. Calculations over an extended range of rotationally excited states show very good agreement with the experimental data. In particular, the known empirical rotational constants B for the ground vibrational states are predicted to better than about 2 MHz. B constants for excited vibrational states are reproduced several times more accurately than by previous calculations. This level of accuracy is shown to extend to higher excited inter-molecular vibrational states v and higher excited rotational quantum numbers ( J , K a ).},

Polyad truncations and energy ceilings are used to control the size of the vibrational basis to facilitate accurate computations of the OH stretch and HOH bend intramolecular transitions of the water dimer ( ⁠ H 2 16 O) 2 . Advantages and potential pitfalls of the applied approximations are highlighted. The importance of choices related to the treatment of the kinetic energy operator in reduced-dimensional calculations and the accuracy of different water dimer PESs are discussed. A range of different reduced-dimensional computations are performed to investigate the wavenumber shifts in the intramolecular transitions caused by the coupling between the intra- and intermolecular modes. With the use of symmetry, full 12-dimensional vibrational energy levels of the water dimer are calculated, predicting accurately the experimentally observed intramolecular fundamentals. It is found that one can also predict accurate intramolecular transition wavenumbers for the water dimer by combining a set of computationally inexpensive reduced-dimensional calculations, thereby guiding future effective-Hamiltonian treatments.},

Its IR experimental spectrum, reported in the literature, is of difficult and controversial assignment. In particular, the experimental signal at 3559 cm −1 associated with the OH stretch is interesting because it is inconsistent with the global minimum, trans -proline conformer. This suggests the possibility that multiple conformers may contribute to the IR spectrum. The same conclusion is obtained by investigating the splitting of the CO stretch at 1766 and 1789 cm −1 and other, more complex spectroscopic features involving CH stretches and COH/CNH bendings. In this work, we perform full-dimensional, on-the-fly adiabatically switched semiclassical initial value representation simulations employing the ab initio dft-d3 -B3LYP level of theory with aug-cc-pVDZ basis set.

This means that the virtual exciton transitions between the nanocrystals of close sizes are governed only by the dipole–dipole interaction of nanocrystals even in very dense ensembles, while the contributions of all other higher-order multipoles are negligibly small. Based on a simple isotropic model of the envelope function approximation and neglecting the electron–hole interaction inside each nanocrystal, we have computed the rate of the resonant exciton transfer between two nanocrystals. Using the obtained result, we have estimated, for some arbitrarily chosen nanocrystal, the total rate of the exciton non-radiative annihilation caused by the possibility of its resonant virtual transitions into all other nanocrystals of the ensemble. The total rate dependence on the nanocrystal size is determined only by the size distribution function of nanocrystals in the ensemble.},

  abstract = {Photosystem I (PSI), a naturally occurring supercomplex composed of a core part and a light-harvesting antenna, plays an essential role in the photosynthetic electron transfer chain. Evolutionary adaptation dictates a large variability in the type, number, arrangement, and absorption of the Chlorophylls (Chls) responsible for the early steps of light-harvesting and charge separation. For example, the specific location of long-wavelength Chls (referred to as red forms ) in the cyanobacterial core has been intensively investigated, but the assignment of the chromophores involved is still controversial. The most red-shifted Chl a form has been observed in the trimer of the PSI core of the cyanobacterium Spirulina platensis , with an absorption centered at ∼740 nm. Here, we apply two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy to study photoexcitation dynamics in isolated trimers and monomers of the PSI core of S. platensis . By means of global analysis, we resolve and compare direct downhill and uphill excitation energy transfer (EET) processes between the bulk Chls and the red forms, observing significant differences between the monomer (lacking the most far red Chl form at 740 nm) and the trimer, with the ultrafast EET component accelerated by five times, from 500 to 100 fs, in the latter. Our findings highlight the complexity of EET dynamics occurring over a broad range of time constants and their sensitivity to energy distribution and arrangement of the cofactors involved. The comparison of monomeric and trimeric forms, differing both in the antenna dimension and in the extent of red forms, enables us to extract significant information regarding PSI functionality.},

The method is tested by fitting ground electronic state potential energy surfaces for small to medium sized semi-rigid molecules, i.e., HFCO, HONO, and HCOOH, based on ab initio computations at the coupled-cluster single double and perturbative triples-F12/cc-pVTZ-F12 or MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ levels of theory. Vibrational eigenstates are computed using block improved relaxation in the Heidelberg multi-configurational time dependent Hartree package and compared to available experimental and theoretical data. The new potential energy surfaces are compared to the best ones currently available for these molecules in terms of accuracy, including resulting vibrational states, required number of sampling points, and number of fitting parameters.

FS algorithms identify descriptors from a candidate pool (i.e., feature space) built by feature engineering (FE) steps that construct complex features from the system’s fundamental physical properties. Recursive FE, which involves repeated FE operations on the feature space, is necessary to build features with sufficient complexity to capture the physical behavior of a system. However, this approach creates a highly correlated feature space that contains millions or billions of candidate features. Such feature spaces are computationally demanding to process using traditional FS approaches that often struggle with strong collinearity. Herein, we address this shortcoming by developing a new method that interleaves the FE and FS steps to progressively build and select powerful descriptors with reduced computational demand. We call this method iterative Bayesian additive regression trees (iBART), as it iterates between FE with unary/binary operators and FS with Bayesian additive regression trees (BART). The capabilities of iBART are illustrated by extracting descriptors for predicting metal–support interactions in catalysis, which we compare to those predicted in our previous work using other state-of-the-art FS methods (i.e., least absolute shrinkage and selection operator + l 0 , sure independence screening and sparsifying operator, and Bayesian FS). iBART matches the performance of these methods yet uses a fraction of the computational resources because it generates a maximum feature space of size O (10 2 ), as opposed to O (10 6 ) generated by one-shot FE/FS methods.},

Host–guest binding free energies have been calculated using the recently developed virtual double system single box approach, based on the enhanced sampling of the bound and unbound end-states followed by fast switching nonequilibrium alchemical simulations [M. Macchiagodena et al. , J. Chem. Theory Comput. 16 , 7160 (2020)]. As far as Pearson and Kendall coefficients are concerned, performances were acceptable and, in general, better than those we submitted for calixarenes, cucurbituril-like open cavitand, and beta-cyclodextrines in previous SAMPL host–guest challenges, confirming the reliability of nonequilibrium approaches for absolute binding free energy calculations. In comparison with previous submissions, we found a rather large mean signed error that we attribute to the way the finite charge correction was addressed through the assumption of a neutralizing background plasma.},

  abstract = {Real space chemical bonding descriptors, such as the electron localization function or the Laplacian of the electron density, have been widely used in electronic structure theory thanks to their power to provide chemically intuitive spatial images of bonded and non-bonded interactions. This capacity stems from their ability to display the shell structure of atoms and its distortion upon molecular formation. Here, we examine the spatial position of the N electrons of an atom at the maximum of the square of the wavefunction, the so-called Born maximum, as a shell structure descriptor for ground state atoms with Z = 1–36, comparing it to other available indices. The maximization is performed with the help of variational quantum Monte Carlo calculations. We show that many electron effects (mainly Pauli driven) are non-negligible, that Born shells are closer to the nucleus than any other of the examined descriptors, and that these shells are very well preserved in simple molecules.},

  abstract = {The affordable, accurate, and generalizable prediction of spectroscopic observables plays a key role in the analysis of increasingly complex experiments. In this article, we develop and deploy a deep neural network—XANESNET—for predicting the lineshape of first-row transition metal K-edge x-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra. XANESNET predicts the spectral intensities using only information about the local coordination geometry of the transition metal complexes encoded in a feature vector of weighted atom-centered symmetry functions. We address in detail the calibration of the feature vector for the particularities of the problem at hand, and we explore the individual feature importance to reveal the physical insight that XANESNET obtains at the Fe K-edge. XANESNET relies on only a few judiciously selected features—radial information on the first and second coordination shells suffices along with angular information sufficient to separate satisfactorily key coordination geometries. The feature importance is found to reflect the XANES spectral window under consideration and is consistent with the expected underlying physics. We subsequently apply XANESNET at nine first-row transition metal (Ti–Zn) K-edges. It can be optimized in as little as a minute, predicts instantaneously, and provides K-edge XANES spectra with an average accuracy of ∼ ±2\%–4\% in which the positions of prominent peaks are matched with a &gt; 90\% hit rate to sub-eV (∼0.8 eV) error.},

Here, we derive and implement, for the first time, the static and dynamic Bethe–Salpeter equations when one considers T -matrix quasiparticle energies and a T -matrix-based kernel. The performance of the static scheme and its perturbative dynamical correction are assessed by computing the neutral excited states of molecular systems.

  abstract = {The delicate interplay between functional-driven and density-driven errors in density functional theory (DFT) has hindered traditional density functional approximations (DFAs) from providing an accurate description of water for over 30 years. Recently, the deep-learned DeepMind 21 (DM21) functional has been shown to overcome the limitations of traditional DFAs as it is free of delocalization error. To determine if DM21 can enable a molecular-level description of the physical properties of aqueous systems within Kohn–Sham DFT, we assess the accuracy of the DM21 functional for neutral, protonated, and deprotonated water clusters. We find that the ability of DM21 to accurately predict the energetics of aqueous clusters varies significantly with cluster size. Additionally, we introduce the many-body MB-DM21 potential derived from DM21 data within the many-body expansion of the energy and use it in simulations of liquid water as a function of temperature at ambient pressure. We find that size-dependent functional-driven errors identified in the analysis of the energetics of small clusters calculated with the DM21 functional result in the MB-DM21 potential systematically overestimating the hydrogen-bond strength and, consequently, predicting a more ice-like local structure of water at room temperature.},

Due to this interaction, a layer of mutually bonded colloids around the obstacles is formed. The network becomes nonuniform, with colloid particles locally centered on the obstacles.

Many of these materials share a highly disordered microstructure and can undergo large deformations before damage becomes visible at the macroscopic level. Despite their widespread presence, we still lack a clear picture of how the network structure controls the fracture processes of these soft materials. In this Perspective, we will focus on progress and open questions concerning fracture at the mesoscopic scale, in which the network architecture is clearly resolved, but neither the material-specific atomistic features nor the macroscopic sample geometries are considered. We will describe concepts regarding the network elastic response that have been established in recent years and turn out to be pre-requisites to understand the fracture response. We will mostly consider simulation studies, where the influence of specific network features on the material mechanics can be cleanly assessed. Rather than focusing on specific systems, we will discuss future challenges that should be addressed to gain new fundamental insights that would be relevant across several examples of soft network materials.},

  abstract = {Monolayer films have shown promise as a lubricating layer to reduce friction and wear of mechanical devices with separations on the nanoscale. These films have a vast design space with many tunable properties that can affect their tribological effectiveness. For example, terminal group chemistry, film composition, and backbone chemistry can all lead to films with significantly different tribological properties. This design space, however, is very difficult to explore without a combinatorial approach and an automatable, reproducible, and extensible workflow to screen for promising candidate films. Using the Molecular Simulation Design Framework (MoSDeF), a combinatorial screening study was performed to explore 9747 unique monolayer films (116 964 total simulations) and a machine learning (ML) model using a random forest regressor, an ensemble learning technique, to explore the role of terminal group chemistry and its effect on tribological effectiveness. The most promising films were found to contain small terminal groups such as cyano and ethylene. The ML model was subsequently applied to screen terminal group candidates identified from the ChEMBL small molecule library. Approximately 193 131 unique film candidates were screened with approximately a five order of magnitude speed-up in analysis compared to simulation alone. The ML model was thus able to be used as a predictive tool to greatly speed up the initial screening of promising candidate films for future simulation studies, suggesting that computational screening in combination with ML can greatly increase the throughput in combinatorial approaches to generate in silico data and then train ML models in a controlled, self-consistent fashion.},

Real-time time-dependent density functional tight-binding (RT-TDDFTB) calculations provide details of the quantum dynamical processes at an electronic/atomistic level with attosecond resolution. The computational efficiency of RT-TDDFTB allows us to examine electronic dynamics up to picosecond time scales. With time scales varying over six orders of magnitude, we provide insight into interactions between the nanoparticle and laser and between nanoparticles. Our results show that the coupling between nanoparticle monomers is dependent on the separation distance between the nanoparticles in the dimer. As the interparticle distance is varied, the dipole–dipole interactions and electronic excitation transfer mechanisms are markedly different. At large distances (from 50 to 20 Å), the energy transfer from NP1 to NP2 becomes more efficient as the interparticle distance decreases. The total dipole moment of the Ag 14 nanoparticle dimer increases linearly at an interparticle distance of 20 Å and reaches its maximum after 1.2 ps. The electronic excitation transfer is also the most efficient at 20 Å. At short distances, back-transfer effects reduce the ability of the dimer and NP1 to accept energy from the incident electric field. We attribute the distance-dependent features of the nanoparticle dimer to the beating between the laser acting on NP1 and the back transfer from NP2 to NP1.},

  abstract = {Understanding the fundamental mechanisms that underlie the synthesis of fullerene molecules in the interstellar medium (ISM) and in the environments of astrophysical objects is an open question. In this regard, using classical molecular dynamics, we demonstrate the possibility of in situ formation of fullerene molecules, such as C 60 from graphite, which is known to occur in the ISM, in particular, circumstellar environments. Specifically, when graphite is subjected to thermal and mechanical stimuli that are typical of circumstellar shells, we find that the graphite sheet edges undergo significant restructuring and curling, leading to edge-induced interlayer-interactions and formation of mechanically strained five-membered-ring structural units. These units serve as precursors for the formation of fullerene structures, such as pristine and metastable C 60 molecules. The pathways leading to molecular C 60 formation consist of a series of steps that involve bond-breakage and subsequent local rearrangement of atoms, with the activation energy barriers of the rate-limiting step(s) being comparable to the energetics of Stone–Wales rearrangement reactions. The identified chemical pathways provide fundamental insights into the mechanisms that underlie C 60 formation. Moreover, they clearly demonstrate that top-down synthesis of C 60 from graphitic sources is a viable synthesis route at conditions pertaining to circumstellar matter.},

  abstract = {Photochemical reactions on semiconductors are anisotropic, since they occur with different rates on surfaces of different orientations. Understanding the origin of this anisotropy is crucial to engineering more efficient photocatalysts. In this work, we use hybrid density functional theory to identify the surfaces associated with the largest number of photo-generated carriers in different semiconductors. For each material, we create a spherical heat map of the probability of optical transitions at different wave vectors. These maps allow us to identify the directions associated with the majority of the photo-generated carriers and can, thus, be used to make predictions about the most reactive surfaces for photochemical applications. The results indicate that it is generally possible to correlate the heat maps with the anisotropy of the bands observed in conventional band structure plots, as previously suggested. However, we also demonstrate that conventional band structure plots do not always provide all the information and that taking into account the contribution of all possible transitions weighted by their transition dipole moments is crucial to obtain a complete picture.},

Here, we computationally examine the beginnings of exciton condensation in a double layer composed of coronene, a seven-benzene-ring patch of graphene. As a function of interlayer separation, we compute the exciton population in a single coherent quantum state, showing that the population peaks around 1.8 at distances near 2 Å. Visualization reveals interlayer excitons at the separation distance of the condensate. We determine the exciton population as a function of the twist angle between two coronene layers to reveal the magic angles at which the condensation peaks. As with previous recent calculations showing some exciton condensation in hexacene double layers and benzene stacks, the present two-electron reduced-density-matrix calculations with coronene provide computational evidence for the ability to realize exciton condensation in molecular-scale analogs of extended systems such as the graphene double layer.},

It has been observed that the photoluminescence (PL) decay of QDs near plasmonic nanostructures differs when the excitation wavelength is varied, but the exact mechanism is still unclear today. Here, we studied the excitation wavelength dependence of the PL decay of CdSe/CdS core/shell QDs near plasmonic gold nanoparticles at the single QD level. With the aid of statistical science, we demonstrated that the PL decay of a single QD near gold nanoparticles is generally faster when the QD is excited spectrally close to the localized surface plasmon resonance of gold nanoparticles. This excitation wavelength dependence is mainly caused by the varied proportion of photons coming from biexciton emission, which is the result of different local electric field enhancement by gold nanoparticles upon excitation.},

Apart from the unidirectional homogeneous square icing patterns considered in previous studies, the multidirectional partitioned square icing patterns are discovered in this study and characterized by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Square icing parameters are proposed to quantitatively distinguish the partitioned patterns from the homogeneous patterns and the liquid water. The number of graphene monolayers n is varied in this study, and the results show that it is more energetically favorable to form partitioned square icing patterns when the water molecules are confined between graphite sheets ( n ≥ 2) compared to graphene ( n = 1). This phenomenon is insensitive to n as long as n ≥ 2 because of the short-range nature of the interaction between water molecules and the carbon substrate. Moreover, it is energetically unfavorable to form partitioned square icing patterns for a single layer of water molecules even for n ≥ 2, verifying that the interaction between layers of water molecules is another dominant factor in the formation of partitioned structures. The conversion from partitioned structure to homogeneous square patterns is investigated by changing the pressure and the temperature. Based on the comprehensive MD simulations, this study unveils the formation mechanism of the partitioned square icing patterns.},

  abstract = {Among amorphous states, glass is defined by relaxation times longer than the observation time. This nonergodic nature makes the understanding of glassy systems an involved topic, with complex aging effects or responses to further out-of-equilibrium external drivings. In this respect, active glasses made of self-propelled particles have recently emerged as a stimulating systems, which broadens and challenges our current understanding of glasses by considering novel internal out-of-equilibrium degrees of freedom. In previous experimental studies we have shown that in the ergodicity broken phase, the dynamics of dense passive particles first slows down as particles are made slightly active, before speeding up at larger activity. Here, we show that this nonmonotonic behavior also emerges in simulations of soft active Brownian particles and explore its cause. We refute that the deadlock by emergence of active directionality model we proposed earlier describes our data. However, we demonstrate that the nonmonotonic response is due to activity enhanced aging and thus confirm the link with ergodicity breaking. Beyond self-propelled systems, our results suggest that aging in active glasses is not fully understood.},

  abstract = {The use of high-pressure synthesis conditions to produce I-bearing aluminoborosilicate represents a promising issue for the immobilization of 129 I radioisotope. Furthermore, iodine appears to be more solubilized in glasses under its iodate (I 5+ ) form rather than its iodide (I − ) form. Currently, the local atomic environment for iodine is poorly constrained for I − and virtually unknown for I 5+ or I 7+ . We used I K-edge x-ray absorption spectroscopy conducted at 20 K for determining the local atomic environment of iodine dissolved as I − , I 5+ , and I 7+ in a series of aluminoborosilicate glasses. We determined that I − is surrounded by either Na + or Ca 2+ in agreement with previous studies. The signal collected from EXAFS reveals that I 5+ is surrounded invariably by three oxygen atoms forming an IO 3 − cluster charge compensated by Na + and/or Ca 2+ . The I–O distance in iodate dissolved in glass is comparable to the I–O distance in crystalline compounds at ∼1.8 Å. The distance to the second nearest neighbor (Na + or Ca 2+ ) is also constant at ∼3.2 Å. This derived distance is identical to the distance between I − and Na + or Ca 2+ in the case of iodide local environment. For one sample containing iodate and periodate, the distinction between the local environment of I 5+ and I 7+ could not be made, suggesting that both environments have comparable EXAFS signals.},

  abstract = {The nature of the hydrogen substructure of a deuterated and deuterium chloride (DCI)-doped ice VI sample after cooling at 1.8 GPa has been a topic of recent interest—especially because the novel ice polymorph ice XIX was discovered in the course of such studies. We here investigate deuterated samples containing 5\% H 2 O using Raman spectroscopy to probe for transitions associated with rearrangement of D-atoms in ice XIX. The protocol involving heating at subambient pressure (10 mbar) in this study follows closely the one used in our earlier neutron diffraction study. Heating of ice XIX induces a complex cascade of processes involving both ordering and disordering of D atoms. Our Raman spectra demonstrate that the transition sequence is ice XIX → ice VI ‡ → ice XV, in accordance with our earlier neutron diffraction result. First signs for ice XIX decay are evident at 100 K, while ice XV build-up is seen only at 108 K and above. Between 100 and 108 K, a transiently disordered D-substructure appears, where at 108 K, ice VI ‡ forms from ice XIX and simultaneously decays to produce ice XV—thereby establishing a dynamic equilibrium. Using isothermal, time-resolved Raman spectroscopy in real time, we here determine rate constants, Avrami exponents, and activation energies for both slow processes, ice XIX decay and ice XV build-up. The first transition in this sequence, ice XIX decay, is faster than the second transition, ice XV build-up, so that ice VI ‡ accumulates. On the basis of the Johnson–Mehl–Avrami–Kolmogorov data obtained from the isothermal Raman experiment, we additionally report kinetic models for the development of fractions of ices XIX, XV, and VI ‡ in non-isothermal heating experiments at different heating rates. These models consider the two coupled first-order transitions as separated processes, where the phase fractions are calculated for incrementally small temperature (or time) steps. These models compare favorably with our previous observations for slowly or rapidly heated ice XIX samples, such as in calorimetry or neutron diffraction experiments.},

However, mathematical and supervised learning methods mostly rely on specific descriptors of local structures and can only be applied to particular packing configurations. In this work, we propose an improved unsupervised learning method, which is descriptor-free, for local structure identification in particle packing. The point cloud is used as the input of the improved method, which directly comes from spatial positions of particles and does not rely on specific descriptors. The improved method constructs an autoencoder based on the point cloud network combined with Gaussian mixture models for dimension reduction and clustering. Numerical examples show that the improved method performs well in local structure identification of quasicrystal disk and sphere packings, achieving comparable accuracy with previous methods. For disordered packings, which have been considered having nearly no local structures, the improved method identifies a nontrivial seven-neighbor motif in the maximally dense random packing of disks and finds acentric structural motifs in the random close packing of spheres, which demonstrate the ability on identification of new and unknown local structures. The improved unsupervised learning method would help obtain information from massive simulation and experimental results as well as devising new order parameters for particle packings.},

Here, we have used machine learning on existing experimental data to construct robust models to produce meaningful predictions across a broad range of cation and anion chemical structures. Specifically, we used previously collated experimental data for the viscosity and conductivity of protic ILs [T. L. Greaves and C. J. Drummond, Chem. Rev. 115 , 11379–11448 (2015)] as the inputs for multiple linear regression and neural network models.

A selection of ten new protic ILs was then prepared, which validated the usefulness of the models. Overall, this work shows that relatively sparse data can be used productively to predict physicochemical properties of vast arrays of ILs.},

Experiments at 1 molal salt concentration were carried out to determine the TMD of these solutions. We also performed molecular dynamics simulations to estimate the TMD at 1 and 2 m with the Madrid-2019 force field, which uses the TIP4P/2005 water model and scaled charges for the ions, finding an excellent agreement between experiment and simulation. All the salts studied in this work shift the TMD of the solution to lower temperatures and flatten the density vs temperature curves (when compared to pure water) with increasing salt concentration. The shift in the TMD depends strongly on the nature of the electrolyte. In order to explore this dependence, we have evaluated the contribution of each ion to the shift in the TMD concluding that Na + , Ca 2+ , and S O 4 2 − seem to induce the largest changes among the studied ions. The volume of the system has been analyzed for salts with the same anion and different cations. These curves provide insight into the effect of different ions upon the structure of water. We claim that the TMD of electrolyte solutions entails interesting physics regarding ion–water and water–water interactions and should, therefore, be considered as a test property when developing force fields for electrolytes. This matter has been rather unnoticed for almost a century now and we believe it is time to revisit it.},

  abstract = {We present here the results of high-pressure broadband dielectric spectroscopy (BDS) measurements for a mixture of liquid-crystalline drug itraconazole (ITZ) and glycerol (GLY) at a critical concentration of 5\% w/w in which the nematic order is eliminated. In the investigated system, smectic-A to isotropic phase transition leaves a clear fingerprint on the dielectric response, allowing for a phase diagram creation using BDS data. By following the α -relaxation dynamics under different thermodynamic conditions, we provide insights into the effect of pressure on temperature and the phenomenology of smectic-A to the isotropic phase transition. Additional measurements of specific volume as a function of pressure and temperature provide us with a deeper insight into material properties that could be analyzed comprehensively via the equation of state. We proved the validity of the density scaling concept, showing that the mixture’s complexity does not exclude thermodynamic scaling of dynamic properties related to the α -process in the smectic-A phase. The low value of scaling exponent γ = 2.00 ± 0.02 and a high ratio of the activation energy at constant volume, E V , to the activation enthalpy at constant pressure, H P , indicate that temperature is a dominant variable controlling α-relaxation dynamics in the ordered smectic-A phase of the ITZ-GLY mixture.},

  abstract = {It has been experimentally demonstrated that reaction rates for molecules embedded in microfluidic optical cavities are altered when compared to rates observed under “ordinary” reaction conditions. However, precise mechanisms of how strong coupling of an optical cavity mode to molecular vibrations affects the reactivity and how resonance behavior emerges are still under dispute. In the present work, we approach these mechanistic issues from the perspective of a thermal model reaction, the inversion of ammonia along the umbrella mode, in the presence of a single–cavity mode of varying frequency and coupling strength. A topological analysis of the related cavity Born–Oppenheimer potential energy surface in combination with quantum mechanical and transition state theory rate calculations reveals two quantum effects, leading to decelerated reaction rates in qualitative agreement with experiments: the stiffening of quantized modes perpendicular to the reaction path at the transition state, which reduces the number of thermally accessible reaction channels, and the broadening of the barrier region, which attenuates tunneling. We find these two effects to be very robust in a fluctuating environment, causing statistical variations of potential parameters, such as the barrier height. Furthermore, by solving the time-dependent Schrödinger equation in the vibrational strong coupling regime, we identify a resonance behavior, in qualitative agreement with experimental and earlier theoretical work. The latter manifests as reduced reaction probability when the cavity frequency ω c is tuned resonant to a molecular reactant frequency. We find this effect to be based on the dynamical localization of the vibro-polaritonic wavepacket in the reactant well.},

  abstract = {A pure rotational spectrum of methyl p -tolyl sulfoxide (MTSO) was studied using chirped-pulse Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy in the frequency range of 18–26 GHz. A single conformer was unambiguously observed in the supersonic jet expansion, which is consistent with the conformational analysis performed using quantum-chemical calculations. Rotational transitions were split into two components of A and E symmetries due to the low-barrier internal rotation of the ring methyl group [ V 3 = 11.0178(23) cm −1 ]. The low energy barrier for the methyl top internal rotation implies an electron-withdrawing effect of the group at the opposite side of the phenyl ring, in comparison with other para -substituted toluenes. The effective ground state ( r 0 ) geometry was derived using the rotational constants from the parent species and the 34 S and eight 13 C singly substituted isotopologues. Compared to two other sulfoxides, methyl phenyl sulfoxide and methyl 4-nitrophenyl sulfoxide, the sulfoxide group in MTSO is slightly more twisted with respect to the plane of the phenyl ring, which could be attributed to the moderate electron-donating effect of the p -methyl group. Furthermore, the pyramidal inversion that interconverts the handedness at the sulfur stereogenic center was explored in the electronic ground (S 0 ) and excited (S 1 ) states with nudged elastic band and time-dependent density functional theory methods. It was found that the pyramidal inversion in S 1 is easier than in S 0 , showing that optical excitation to S 1 will facilitate an effectively barrier-free inversion.},

  abstract = {The interaction between excited states of a molecule and excited states of a metal nanostructure (e.g., plasmons) leads to hybrid states with modified optical properties. When plasmon resonance is swept through molecular transition frequency, an avoided crossing may be observed, which is often regarded as a signature of strong coupling between plasmons and molecules. Such strong coupling is expected to be realized when 2|⟨ U ⟩|/ ℏ Γ &gt; 1, where ⟨ U ⟩ and Γ are the molecule–plasmon coupling and the spectral width of the optical transition, respectively. Because both ⟨ U ⟩ and Γ strongly increase with decreasing distance between a molecule and a plasmonic structure, it is not obvious that this condition can be satisfied for any molecule–metal surface distance. In this work, we investigate the behavior of ⟨ U ⟩ and Γ for several geometries. Surprisingly, we find that if the only contributions to Γ are lifetime broadenings associated with the radiative and nonradiative relaxation of a single molecular vibronic transition, including effects on molecular radiative and nonradiative lifetimes induced by the metal, the criterion 2|⟨ U ⟩|/ ℏ Γ &gt; 1 is easily satisfied by many configurations irrespective of the metal–molecule distance. This implies that the Rabi splitting can be observed in such structures if other sources of broadening are suppressed. Additionally, when the molecule–metal surface distance is varied keeping all other molecular and metal parameters constant, this behavior is mitigated due to the spectral shift associated with the same molecule–plasmon interaction, making the observation of Rabi splitting more challenging.},

We introduce an interface between the PLUMED code that computes free-energy landscapes and enhanced-sampling algorithms and the Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE) module, which includes several ab initio electronic structure codes. The interface is validated with a Lennard-Jones cluster free-energy landscape calculation by averaging multiple short metadynamics trajectories. We use this interface and analysis to estimate the free-energy landscape of Ag 5 and Ag 6 clusters at 10, 100, and 300 K with the radius of gyration and coordination number as collective variables, finding at most tens of meV in error. Relative free-energy differences between the planar and non-planar isomers of both clusters decrease with temperature in agreement with previously proposed stabilization of non-planar isomers. Interestingly, we find that Ag 6 is the smallest silver cluster where entropic effects at room temperature boost the non-planar isomer probability to a competing state. The new ASE-PLUMED interface enables simulating nanosystem electronic properties under more realistic temperature-dependent conditions.},

  abstract = {We report a surface hopping approach in which the implemented linear vibronic coupling Hamiltonian is constructed and the electronic wavefunction is propagated in the reciprocal space. The parameters of the linear vibronic coupling model, including onsite energies, phonon frequencies, and electron–phonon couplings, are calculated with density-functional theory and density-functional perturbation theory and interpolated in fine sampling points of the Brillouin zone with maximally localized Wannier functions. Using this approach, we studied the relaxation dynamics of the photo-excited hot carrier in a one-dimensional periodic carbon chain. The results show that the completeness of the number of Hilbert space k points and the number of phonon q points plays an important role in the hot carrier relaxation processes. By calculating the relaxation times of hot carriers under different reciprocal space sampling and extrapolating with the stretched–compressed exponential function, the relaxation times of hot electrons and holes in the quasi-continuous energy band are obtained. By considering the feedback effect in the hopping processes and analyzing the time-dependent phonon energy in different normal modes, we found that the long-wave longitudinal optical phonons play a major role in the relaxation dynamics of hot electrons and holes. We, therefore, provided herein an efficient and accurate approach for modeling the photophysical processes in periodic solid-state material systems.},

Phys. Chem. Lett. 11 , 8735 (2020)]. This result confirmed the classical Kurland–McGarvey theory. In the present contribution, we elaborate on these results. In particular, we provide a detailed derivation of the PDA both from the Van den Heuvel–Soncini equation for the chemical shielding tensor and from a spin Hamiltonian approximation. Furthermore, we discuss in detail the PDA within the approximate density functional theory and Hartree–Fock theories. In our previous work, we assumed a relatively crude effective nuclear charge approximation for the spin–orbit coupling operator. Here, we overcome this assumption by demonstrating that the derivation is also possible within the fully relativistic Dirac equation and even without the assumption of a specific form for the Hamiltonian. Crucial ingredients for the general derivation are a Hamiltonian that respects gauge invariance, the multipolar gauge, and functional derivatives of the Hamiltonian, where it is possible to identify the first functional derivative with the electron number current density operator. The present work forms an important foundation for future extensions of the Kurland–McGarvey theory beyond the PDA, including induced magnetic quadrupole and higher moments to describe the magnetic hyperfine field.},

Numerical results are presented for time-dependent Hartree–Fock and density-functional theory, the second-order algebraic diagrammatic construction method, and linear-response coupled-cluster theory with singles and approximate doubles. We can support the finding that the common choice of placing the gauge origin in the center of mass of a molecule in conventional length-gauge calculations involving chiroptical properties might not be optimal and show that LG(OI) is a valuable alternative for the origin-independent calculation of ECD spectra. We show that, for a limited test set, the convergence of the rotatory strengths calculated with the LG(OI) approach toward the basis-set limit tends to be faster than for the established velocity gauge representation. Relationships between the sum-over-states expression of the optical rotation in the LG(OI) framework and its representation in terms of response functions are analyzed.},

  abstract = {Diamine-functionalized M 2 (dobpdc) (M = Mg, Mn, Fe, Co, Zn) metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are among a growing class of crystalline solids currently being intensively investigated for carbon capture as they exhibit a novel cooperative and selective CO 2 adsorption mechanism and a step-shaped isotherm. To understand their CO 2 adsorption behavior, ab initio calculations with near-chemical accuracy (∼6 kJ/mol, an average experimental error) are required. Here, we present density functional theory (DFT) calculations of CO 2 adsorption in m-2-m–Zn 2 (dobpdc) (m-2-m = N , N ′-dimethylethyle-nediamine and dobpdc 4− = 4,4′-dioxidobiphenyl-3,3′-dicarboxylate) with different exchange–correlation functionals, including semilocal functionals [Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) and two revised PBE functionals], semiempirical pairwise corrections (D3 and Tkatchenko–Scheffler), nonlocal van der Waals (vdW) correlation functionals—vdW-optB88 (or vdW-DF-optB88), vdW-DF1, vdW-DF2, vdW-DF2-B86R (or rev-vdW-DF2), vdW-DF-cx (and vdW-DF-cx0), and revised VV10—and the strongly constrained and appropriately normed (SCAN) meta-generalized gradient approximation (GGA). Overall, we find that revPBE+D3 and RPBE+D3 show the best balance of performance for both the lattice parameters and the CO 2 binding enthalpy of m-2-m–Zn 2 (dobpdc). revPBE+D3 and RPBE+D3 predict the m-2-m–Zn 2 (dobpdc) lattice parameters to within 1.4\% of experiment and predict CO 2 binding enthalpies of −68 kJ/mol, which compare reasonably well with the experiment (−57 kJ/mol). Although PBE (−57.7 kJ/mol), vdW-DF1 (−49.6 kJ/mol), and vdW-DF2 (−44.3 kJ/mol) are also found to predict the CO 2 binding enthalpy with good accuracy, they overestimate lattice parameters and bond lengths. The other functionals considered predict the lattice parameters with the same accuracy as revPBE+D3 and RPBE+D3, but they overbind CO 2 by around 26–50 kJ/mol. We find that the superior performance of revPBE+D3 and RPBE+D3 is sustained for the formation enthalpy and the lattice parameters of ammonium carbamate, a primary product of the cooperative CO 2 insertion in diamine-functionalized M 2 (dobpdc) MOFs. Moreover, we find that their performance is derived from their larger repulsive exchange contributions to the CO 2 binding enthalpy than the other functionals at the relevant range of the reduced density gradient value for the energetics of CO 2 adsorption in the m-2-m–Zn 2 (dobpdc) MOF. A broader examination of the performance of RPBE+D3 for the structural parameters and CO 2 binding enthalpies of 13 diamine-functionalized Mg 2 (dobpdc) MOFs further demonstrates that RPBE+D3 successfully reproduces experimental CO 2 binding enthalpies and reveals a logarithmic relationship between the step pressure and the CO 2 binding enthalpy of the diamine-functionalized Mg 2 (dobpdc) MOFs, consistent with experiments where available. The results of our benchmarking study can help guide the further development of versatile vdW-corrected DFT methods with predictive accuracy.},

  abstract = {Non-covalent bonding patterns are commonly harvested as a design principle in the field of catalysis, supramolecular chemistry, and functional materials to name a few. Yet, their computational description generally neglects finite temperature and environment effects, which promote competing interactions and alter their static gas-phase properties. Recently, neural network potentials (NNPs) trained on density functional theory (DFT) data have become increasingly popular to simulate molecular phenomena in condensed phase with an accuracy comparable to ab initio methods. To date, most applications have centered on solid-state materials or fairly simple molecules made of a limited number of elements. Herein, we focus on the persistence and strength of chalcogen bonds involving a benzotelluradiazole in condensed phase. While the tellurium-containing heteroaromatic molecules are known to exhibit pronounced interactions with anions and lone pairs of different atoms, the relevance of competing intermolecular interactions, notably with the solvent, is complicated to monitor experimentally but also challenging to model at an accurate electronic structure level. Here, we train direct and baselined NNPs to reproduce hybrid DFT energies and forces in order to identify what the most prevalent non-covalent interactions occurring in a solute-Cl − –THF mixture are. The simulations in explicit solvent highlight the clear competition with chalcogen bonds formed with the solvent and the short-range directionality of the interaction with direct consequences for the molecular properties in the solution. The comparison with other potentials (e.g., AMOEBA, direct NNP, and continuum solvent model) also demonstrates that baselined NNPs offer a reliable picture of the non-covalent interaction interplay occurring in solution.},

  abstract = {The link between the static dielectric constant and the microscopic intermolecular interactions is the Kirkwood g 1 factor, which depends on the orientational structure of the fluid. Over the years, there have been several attempts to provide an accurate description of the orientational structure of dipolar fluids using molecular theories. However, these approaches were either limited to mean-field approximations for the pair correlation function or, more recently, limited to adjusting the orientational dependence to simulation data. Here, we derive a theory for the dielectric constant of dipolar hard-sphere fluids using the augmented modified mean-field approximation. Qualitative agreement is achieved throughout all relevant thermodynamic states, as demonstrated by a comparison with simulation data from the literature. Excellent quantitative agreement can be obtained using a single empirical scaling factor, the physical origin of which is analyzed and accounted for. In order to predict the dielectric constant of the Stockmayer fluid (Lennard-Jones plus dipole potential), we use an adjusted version of the expression for the dipolar hard-sphere fluid. Comparing theoretical predictions with newly generated simulation data, we show that it is possible to obtain excellent agreement with simulation by performing the calculations at a corresponding state using the same scaling factor. Finally, we compare the theoretical orientational structure of the Stockmayer fluid with that obtained from simulations. The simulated structure is calculated following a post-processing methodology that we introduce by deriving an original expression that relates the proposed theory to the histogram of relative dipole angles.},

  abstract = {A measure of chemical similarity is only useful if it implies similarity in some relevant property space. Typically, similarity calculations operate by assigning each molecule a chemical fingerprint: a fixed-length vector of bits where the on-bits signify the presence of a certain feature. Common fingerprinting schemes, such as extended-connectivity fingerprints, are by definition general and fail to capture much of the domain-specific theory that underpins similarity in a specific domain. In this work, a hierarchical fingerprinting scheme is developed that is bespoke to a database of ∼4500 organic molecules and their cognate optical absorption spectral properties. Our fingerprinting scheme incorporates molecular fragmentation and domain-specific chemical intuition into an algorithm that categorizes each fragment as being one of a core chemical group, a substituent, or a bridge. The algorithm is applied to every molecule in the database to generate a pool of chemically relevant fragments that are labeled according to their structural category. The fingerprint of each molecule is then composed of a nested Python dictionary specifying the unique identifiers of its constituent fragment entities and the structural links between them to give a hierarchical molecular encoding scheme. Four case studies show the application of our fingerprinting scheme to the subject database. In each case, the clustered molecules display a host of interesting chemical trends. The application that was used to develop and implement this bespoke fingerprinting scheme, referred to as ChemCluster, also exposes a host of other cheminformatics tools pertaining to this database, a selection of which is demonstrated in this work. The enhanced similarity comparisons afforded by our fingerprinting scheme, as well as the large repository of categorized fragments generated during its development, constitute the first step toward using this database in a data-driven materials discovery workflow.},

This paper resolved basic issues to extract interface signals from the calculation. These issues stem from the boundary to restrict the bulk region, which renders the practical computation feasible at a finite and affordable cost. The boundary is found to have significant influences on the time correlation functions, which is closely related to the quadrupole contribution in the nonlinear susceptibility. Thus, we thoroughly examined these influences to establish a proper treatment in performing reliable spectroscopic analysis. We elucidated the distinction of the present boundary effects from the quadrupole contribution and also established a proper center of molecule to minimize the quadrupole effect in the time correlation functions. In the case of liquid water, the proper center was found to be close to the center of mass of a water molecule.},

  abstract = {A method for obtaining appropriate reaction coordinates is required to identify transition states distinguishing the product and reactant in complex molecular systems. Recently, abundant research has been devoted to obtaining reaction coordinates using artificial neural networks from deep learning literature, where many collective variables are typically utilized in the input layer. However, it is difficult to explain the details of which collective variables contribute to the predicted reaction coordinates owing to the complexity of the nonlinear functions in deep neural networks. To overcome this limitation, we used Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods of the Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanation (LIME) and the game theory-based framework known as Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). We demonstrated that XAI enables us to obtain the degree of contribution of each collective variable to reaction coordinates that is determined by nonlinear regressions with deep learning for the committor of the alanine dipeptide isomerization in vacuum. In particular, both LIME and SHAP provide important features to the predicted reaction coordinates, which are characterized by appropriate dihedral angles consistent with those previously reported from the committor test analysis. The present study offers an AI-aided framework to explain the appropriate reaction coordinates, which acquires considerable significance when the number of degrees of freedom increases.},

  abstract = {We present an embedded fragment approach for high-level quantum chemical calculations on local features in periodic systems. The fragment is defined as a set of localized orbitals (occupied and virtual) corresponding to a converged periodic Hartree–Fock solution. These orbitals serve as the basis for the in-fragment post-Hartree–Fock treatment. The embedding field for the fragment, consisting of the Coulomb and exchange potential from the rest of the crystal, is included in the fragment’s one-electron Hamiltonian. As an application of the embedded fragment approach, we investigate the performance of full configuration interaction quantum Monte Carlo (FCIQMC) with the adaptive shift. As the orbital choice, we use the natural orbitals from the distinguishable cluster method with singles and doubles. FCIQMC is a stochastic approximation to the full CI method and can be routinely applied to much larger active spaces than the latter. This makes this method especially attractive in the context of open shell defects in crystals, where fragments of adequate size can be rather large. As a test case, we consider dissociation of a fluorine atom from a fluorographane surface. This process poses a challenge for high-level electronic structure models as both the static and dynamic correlations are essential here. Furthermore, the active space for an adequate fragment (32 electrons in 173 orbitals) is already quite large even for FCIQMC. Despite this, FCIQMC delivers accurate dissociation and total energies.},

The methodology provides a strategy to map interatomic or intermolecular potentials obtained from ab initio quantum-chemistry calculations to the corresponding Mie potentials that can be used within the SAFT-VR Mie EoS. The inclusion of corrections for quantum and many-body effects allows for an excellent, fully predictive description of the vapor–liquid envelope and other bulk thermodynamic properties of noble gases; this description is of similar or superior quality to that obtained using SAFT-VR Mie with parameters regressed in the traditional way using experimental thermodynamic-property data. The methodology is extended to an anisotropic species, methane, where similar levels of accuracy are obtained. The efficacy of using less-accurate quantum-chemistry methods in this methodology is explored, showing that these methods do not provide satisfactory results, although we note that the description is nevertheless substantially better than those obtained using the conductor-like screening model for describing real solvents (COSMO-RS), the only other fully predictive ab initio method currently available. Overall, the reliance on thermophysical data is completely dispensed with, providing the first extensible, wholly predictive SAFT-type EoSs.},

The induced electronic current density vector field designated by this procedure, invariant of the origin for any point of the molecular domain, is obtained via a computational scheme, formally annihilating the diamagnetic contribution of the conventional common-origin approach based on perturbation theory. In a preliminary application of the theoretical methods outlined in the present work, the simple molecule of lithium hydride has been investigated. Particular attention has been paid to the structure of induced electronic current density for several values of the magnetic field frequency by investigating equilibrium points of four different types, organized in stagnation lines, which constitute its stagnation graph, i.e., a topological fingerprint of the vector field conveying complete information in the condensed form, to verify the fulfillment of fundamental requirements, e.g., the continuity equation and the Poincaré–Hopf theorem on spherical and toroidal surfaces.},

In this paper, we carry out this task in the case of spin systems. We compute the entanglement indicators from actual experimental data obtained from three liquid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments and compare them with standard entanglement measures calculated from the corresponding density matrices, both experimentally reconstructed and numerically computed. The gross features of entanglement dynamics and spin squeezing properties are found to be reproduced by these entanglement indicators. However, the extent to which these indicators and spin squeezing track the entanglement during time evolution of the multipartite systems in the NMR experiments is very sensitive to the precise nature and strength of interactions as well as the manner in which the full system is partitioned into subsystems. We also use the IBM quantum computer to implement equivalent circuits that capture the dynamics of the multipartite system in one of the NMR experiments and carry out a similar comparative assessment of the performance of tomographic indicators. This exercise shows that these indicators can estimate the degree of entanglement without necessitating detailed state reconstruction procedures, establishing the advantage of the tomographic approach.},

The QP energies from LOSC, instead of commonly used G 0 W 0 and ev GW , are directly used in BSE. We show that the BSE/LOSC approach greatly outperforms the commonly used BSE/ G 0 W 0 approach for predicting excitations with different characters. For the calculations of Truhlar–Gagliardi test set containing valence, charge transfer, and Rydberg excitations, BSE/LOSC with the Tamm–Dancoff approximation provides a comparable accuracy to time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) and BSE/ev GW . For the calculations of Stein CT test set and Rydberg excitations of atoms, BSE/LOSC considerably outperforms both BSE/ G 0 W 0 and TDDFT approaches with a reduced starting point dependence. BSE/LOSC is, thus, a promising and efficient approach to calculate excitation energies for molecular systems.},

Initial excitation in the Q x band results in a transfer to the Q y band in less than 60 fs. Upon the ultrafast transfer, regardless of the excitation frequency within the Q x band, the quasi-transient absorption spectra are very similar. This observation indicates that Chl a ’s Q x to Q y transfer is not frequency selective. Using a simple model, we determined that this is not due to the lifetime broadening of the ultrafast transfer but predominantly due to a lack of correlation between the PSII core complex’s Chl a Q x and Q y bands. We suggest the origin to be the intrinsic loss of correlation during the Q x to Q y internal conversion as observed in previous studies of molecular Chl a dissolved in solvents.},

  abstract = {Photosystem II (PSII) is the pigment–protein complex driving the photoinduced oxidation of water and reduction of plastoquinone in all oxygenic photosynthetic organisms. Excitations in the antenna chlorophylls are photochemically trapped in the reaction center (RC) producing the chlorophyll–pheophytin radical ion pair P + Pheo − . When electron donation from water is inhibited, the oxidized RC chlorophyll P + acts as an excitation quencher, but knowledge on the kinetics of quenching is limited. Here, we used femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy to compare the excitation dynamics of PSII with neutral and oxidized RC (P + ). We find that equilibration in the core antenna has a major lifetime of about 300 fs, irrespective of the RC redox state. Two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy revealed additional slower energy equilibration occurring on timescales of 3–5 ps, concurrent with excitation trapping. The kinetics of PSII with open RC can be described well with previously proposed models according to which the radical pair P + Pheo − is populated with a main lifetime of about 40 ps, which is primarily determined by energy transfer between the core antenna and the RC chlorophylls. Yet, in PSII with oxidized RC (P + ), fast excitation quenching was observed with decay lifetimes as short as 3 ps and an average decay lifetime of about 90 ps, which is shorter than the excited-state lifetime of PSII with open RC. The underlying mechanism of this extremely fast quenching prompts further investigation.},

Here, we propose such a new mesoscopic model for the dynamics and flow of ferrofluids, where we couple the multi-particle collision dynamics method as a solver for the fluctuating hydrodynamics equations to the stochastic magnetization dynamics of suspended magnetic nanoparticles. This hybrid model is validated by reproducing the magnetoviscous effect in Poiseuille flow, obtaining the rotational viscosity in quantitative agreement with theoretical predictions. We also illustrate the new method for the benchmark problem of flow around a square cylinder. Interestingly, we observe that the length of the recirculation region is increased, whereas the drag coefficient is decreased in ferrofluids when an external magnetic field is applied compared with the field-free case at the same effective Reynolds number. The presence of thermal fluctuations and the flexibility of this particle-based mesoscopic method provide a promising tool to investigate a broad range of flow phenomena of magnetic fluids, and the method could also serve as an efficient way to simulate solvent effects when colloidal particles are immersed in ferrofluids.},

However, the final crystallinities, crystalline bond orientations, chain-folding probabilities, residual stresses, and crystallite morphologies at high enough strains appear as the same at each temperature, irrelevant to the initially amorphous and semicrystalline polymers, indicating that the common post-growth melting-reorganization processes determine the final products. In addition, both final products harvest the highest crystallinities in the middle temperature region because the postgrowth stage yields the vast nuclei followed with less extent of crystal growth in the low temperature region and few nuclei followed with large extent of crystal growth in the high temperature region. Our observations imply that a large enough strain can effectively remove the thermal history of polymers, similar to the thermal treatment at a high enough temperature; therefore, the fracture strength of semicrystalline polymers depends upon their final structures in stretching, not related to their nascent semicrystalline structures.},

  abstract = {In a neuron network, synapses update individually using local information, allowing for entirely decentralized learning. In contrast, elements in an artificial neural network are typically updated simultaneously using a central processor. Here, we investigate the feasibility and effect of desynchronous learning in a recently introduced decentralized, physics-driven learning network. We show that desynchronizing the learning process does not degrade the performance for a variety of tasks in an idealized simulation. In experiment, desynchronization actually improves the performance by allowing the system to better explore the discretized state space of solutions. We draw an analogy between desynchronization and mini-batching in stochastic gradient descent and show that they have similar effects on the learning process. Desynchronizing the learning process establishes physics-driven learning networks as truly fully distributed learning machines, promoting better performance and scalability in deployment.},

  abstract = {The origin of melt memory effects associated with semicrystalline polymers and the physical parameters involved in this process have been widely studied in the literature. However, a comprehensive understanding of the role of intermolecular interactions on melt memory is still being developed. For this purpose, we have considered aliphatic polyesters and we have incorporated amide and additional ester groups. Inserting these additional functional groups, the strength of the intermolecular interactions increases widening the melt memory effect. Not only the presence of the functional groups but also the position of these groups in the repeating unit plays a role in the melt memory effect as it impacts the strength of the intermolecular interactions in the crystals. The study of the effect of intermolecular interactions has been extended to successive self-nucleation and annealing thermal fractionation experiments to explore for the first time the role of intermolecular forces on the fractionation capacity of linear polymers. We demonstrated that intermolecular interactions act as intrinsic defects interrupting the crystallizable chain length, thus facilitating thermal fractionation. Overall, this work sheds light on the role of intermolecular interactions on the crystallization behavior of a series of aliphatic polyesters.},

  abstract = {In standard molecular junctions, a molecular structure is placed between and connected to metal leads. Understanding how mechanical tuning in such molecular junctions can change heat conductance has interesting applications in nanoscale energy transport. In this work, we use nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations to address the effect of stretching on the phononic contribution to the heat conduction of molecular junctions consisting of single long-chain alkanes and various metal leads, such as Ag, Au, Cu, Ni, and Pt. The thermal conductance of such junctions is found to be much smaller than the intrinsic thermal conductance of the polymer and significantly depends on the nature of metal leads as expressed by the metal–molecule coupling and metal vibrational density of states. This behavior is expected and reflects the mismatch of phonon spectra at the metal molecule interfaces. As a function of stretching, we find a behavior similar to what was observed earlier [M. Dinpajooh and A. Nitzan, J. Chem. Phys. 153 , 164903 (2020)] for pure polymeric structures. At relatively short electrode distances, where the polyethylene chains are compressed, it is found that the thermal conductances of the molecular junctions remain almost constant as one stretches the polymer chains. At critical electrode distances, the thermal conductances start to increase, reaching the values of the fully extended molecular junctions. Similar behaviors are observed for junctions in which several long-chain alkanes are sandwiched between various metal leads. These findings indicate that this behavior under stretching is an intrinsic property of the polymer chain and not significantly associated with the interfacial structures.},

  abstract = {The integration of confined exciton and localized surface plasmon in a hybrid nanostructure has recently stimulated extensive interests. The mechanistic insights into the elusive exciton–plasmon interplay at the nanoscale are of both fundamental and applicable values. Herein, by taking a hybrid WSe 2 /CuFeS 2 system as a prototype, in which the excitonic semiconductor WSe 2 nanosheets are interfaced with the plasmonic semiconductor CuFeS 2 nanocrystals to form a heterostructure, we design and perform an ultrafast dynamics study to glean information in this regard. Specifically, the band-alignment relationship between the two components enables the contrasting case studies in which the excitonic excited states of WSe 2 are pre-selected to be on-/off-resonant with the plasmon band of CuFeS 2 . As revealed by the joint observations from steady-state absorption and photoexcitation-dependent/temperature-dependent femtosecond time-resolved transient absorption (fs-TA) spectroscopy, an effective energy transfer process occurs in this exciton–plasmon system where the energy donor (acceptor) is the excitonic WSe 2 (plasmonic CuFeS 2 ) and its efficiency is modulated by the exciton–plasmon coupling strength. Furthermore, as inferred from the temperature-dependent fs-TA analysis, the opening of such an energy-transfer channel turns out to take place during the early phase of plasmon decay (∼1 ps). In addition, the activation energy of energy transfer for a specific exciton-state-selected case is estimated (∼200 meV). This work provides a dynamics perspective to the plasmon semiconductor-involved exciton–plasmon interplay that features excited-state selectivity of exciton band and, hence, would be of guiding value for rational design and optimization of relevant applications based on exciton–plasmon manipulation.},

  abstract = {Crystal nucleation rates have been measured in the supercooled melts of two richly polymorphic glass-forming liquids: ROY and nifedipine (NIF). ROY or 5-methyl-2-[(2-nitrophenyl)amino]-3-thiophenecarbonitrile is known for its crystals of red, orange, and yellow colors and many polymorphs of solved structures (12). Of the many polymorphs, ON (orange needles) nucleates the fastest with the runner up (Y04) trailing by a factor of 10 3 when compared under the same mobility-limited condition, while the other unobserved polymorphs are slower yet by at least 5 orders of magnitude. Similarly, of the six polymorphs of NIF, γ ′ nucleates the fastest, β ′ is slower by a factor of 10, and the rest are slower yet by at least 5 decades. In both systems, the faster-nucleating polymorphs are not built from the lowest-energy conformers, while they tend to have higher energies and lower densities and thus greater similarity to the liquid phase by these measures. The temperature ranges of this study covered the glass transition temperature T g of each system, and we find no evidence that the nucleation rate is sensitive to the passage of T g . At the lowest temperatures investigated, the rates of nucleation and growth are proportional to each other, indicating that a similar kinetic barrier controls both processes. The classical nucleation theory provides an accurate description of the observed nucleation rates if the crystal growth rate is used to describe the kinetic barrier for nucleation. The quantitative rates of both nucleation and growth for the competing polymorphs enable prediction of the overall rate of crystallization and its polymorphic outcome.},

  abstract = {Heterogeneous nucleation of ice from supercooled water is the process responsible for triggering nearly all ice formation in the natural environment. Understanding of heterogeneous ice nucleation is particularly key for understanding the formation of ice in clouds, which impacts weather and climate. While many effective ice nucleators are known, the mechanisms of their actions remain poorly understood. Some inorganic nucleators have been found to nucleate ice at warmer temperatures in dilute ammonium solution than in pure water. This is surprising, analogous to salty water melting at a warmer temperature than pure water. Here, the magnitude of this effect is rationalized as being due to thermodynamically favorable ammonium-induced disordering of the hydrogen bond network of ice critical clusters formed on inorganic ice nucleators. Theoretical calculations are shown to be consistent with new experimental measurements aimed at finding the maximum magnitude of the effect. The implication of this study is that the ice-nucleating sites and surfaces of many inorganic ice nucleators are either polar or charged and, therefore, tend to induce formation of hydrogen-ordered ice clusters. This work corroborates various literature reports, indicating that some inorganic ice nucleators are most effective when nominally neutral, and implies a commonality in mechanism between a wide range of inorganic ice nucleators.},

We verify that the sound damping coefficients calculated from our expression agree very well with results from independent simulations of sound attenuation. Small wavevector analysis of our expression shows that sound attenuation is primarily determined by the non-affine displacements’ contribution to the sound wave propagation coefficient coming from the frequency shell of the sound wave. Our expression involves only quantities that pertain to solids’ static configurations. It can be used to evaluate the low-temperature sound damping coefficients without directly simulating sound attenuation.},

The high temperatures involved make their experimental determination problematic, and the development of both macroscopic thermodynamic correlations and predictive molecular-based methodologies are complicated by the requirement to appropriately incorporate the chemically reacting vapor-phase species. We derive a general thermodynamic-based atomistic simulation framework for molten salt VLE prediction and show its application to NaCl. Its input quantities are temperature-dependent ideal-gas free energy data for the vapor phase reactions and density and residual chemical potential data for the liquid. If these are not available experimentally, the former may be predicted using standard electronic structure software, and the latter may be predicted by means of classical atomistic simulation methodology. The framework predicts the temperature dependence of vapor pressure, coexisting phase densities, vapor phase composition, and vaporization enthalpy. It also predicts the concentrations of vapor phase species present in minor amounts (such as the free ions), quantities that are extremely difficult to measure experimentally. We furthermore use the results to obtain an approximation to the complete VLE binodal dome and the critical properties. We verify the framework for molten NaCl, for which experimentally based density and chemical potential data are available in the literature. We then apply it to the analysis of NaCl simulation data for two commonly used atomistic force fields. The framework can be readily extended to molten salt mixtures and to ionic liquids.},

Predissociation of the stored complex has been invoked by excitation of the degenerate ν 2 mode of the H 3 + sub-unit using a pulsed optical parametric oscillator system. An assignment of the experimental spectrum became possible through one-to-one correlations with bands of the spectrum theoretically predicted in Paper I [Harding et al. , J. Chem. Phys. 156 , 144307 (2022)]. 19 bands have been assigned and analyzed, and the energy term diagram of the lower states of this floppy molecular complex has been derived from combination differences (CDs) in the experimental spectrum. Ground state combination differences (GSCDs) reveal a large part of the energy term diagram for the He– H 3 + complex in its vibrational ground state, v = 0. Experimental and theoretical term energies agree within experimental accuracy for the rotational fine structure associated with the total angular momentum quantum number J and the parity e / f as well as for the coarse spacing of the lowest K states of the complex. This favorable comparison shows that the potential energy surface (PES) calculated in Paper I is accurate. The barriers between the three equivalent global minima in this PES are relatively low and the He– H 3 + complex is extremely floppy, with nearly unhindered internal rotation of the H 3 + sub-unit. The resulting Coriolis interactions couple the internal and end-over-end rotation of the complex and contribute significantly to the energy terms. They are observed both in experiment and theory and are, e.g., the origin of different rotational constants for states of e and f parity. Also in this respect, experiment and theory agree very well. Despite the assignment and analysis of many bands of the extremely rich IR spectrum of He– H 3 + ⁠ , higher levels of excitation, including the complex stretching mode, need further attention.},

The potential has three equivalent global minima with depth D e = 455.3 cm −1 for He in the plane of H 3 + ⁠ , three equatorial saddle points that separate these minima with barriers of 159.5 cm −1 , and two axial saddle points with energies of 243.1 cm −1 above the minima.

Wave function plots of the VRT states show that they may be characterized as weakly hindered internal rotor states, delocalized over the three minima in the potential and with considerable amplitude at the barriers. Most of them are dominated by the j k = 1 0 and 1 1 rotational ground states of o H 3 + and p H 3 + ⁠ , with the intermolecular stretching mode excited up to v = 4 inclusive.

Our results also suggest the presence of a parallel, concerted dissociation mechanism to produce nickel dicarbonyl in a triplet excited state, which likely dissociates to nickel monocarbonyl. Mechanisms for the formation of these photoproducts in multiple electronic excited states are theoretically predicted with one-dimensional cuts through the potential energy surfaces and computation of spin–orbit coupling constants using equation of motion coupled cluster methods (EOM-CC) and coupled cluster theory with single and double excitations (CCSD).

RF is generally found to be highly competitive with vibrational emission. The behaviors predicted for clusters of various sizes and archetypal structures indicate that the IR emission spectra are strongly influenced by RF, an energy gap law being obtained for the evolution of the RF rate constant depending on the electronic excitation state. The present results are relevant to the photophysics of the interstellar medium and could contribute to elucidating the carriers of the extended red emission bands and the continuum emission lying below the aromatic infrared bands believed to originate from mixed aromatic–aliphatic compounds.},

However, the dynamical catalytic effects during the reaction process remain unclear. Herein, we investigate the dynamic coupling effect of elementary reactions with the structural fluctuations of sub-nanometer Au clusters with different sizes using ab initio molecular dynamics and the free energy calculation method. It was found that the adsorption-induced solid-to-liquid phase transitions of the cluster catalysts give rise to abnormal entropy increase, facilitating the proceeding of reaction, and this phase transition catalysis exists in a range of clusters with different sizes. Moreover, clusters with different sizes show different transition temperatures, resulting in a non-trivial size effect. These results unveil the dynamic effect of catalysts and help understand cluster catalysis to design better catalysts rationally.},

  abstract = {The transport of free electrons in a water environment is still poorly understood. We show that additional insight can be brought about by investigating fragmentation patterns of finite-size particles upon electron impact ionization. We have developed a composite protocol aiming to simulate fragmentation of water clusters by electrons with kinetic energies in the range of up to 100 eV. The ionization events for atomistically described molecular clusters are identified by a kinetic Monte Carlo procedure. We subsequently model the fragmentation with classical molecular dynamics simulations, calibrated by non-adiabatic quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics simulations of the ionization process. We consider one-electron ionizations, energy transfer via electronic excitation events, elastic scattering, and also the autoionization events through intermolecular Coulombic decay. The simulations reveal that larger water clusters are often ionized repeatedly, which is the cause of substantial fragmentation. After losing most of its energy, low-energy electrons further contribute to fragmentation by electronic excitations. The simultaneous measurement of cluster size distribution before and after the ionization represents a sensitive measure of the energy transferred into the system by an incident electron.},

However, in many cases, crossing a CI does not have direct observables, making studies of CIs experimentally challenging. Herein, the theoretically predicted double CIs by cis–trans twisting and cyclization in tetraphenyl ethylene, a well-known aggregation-induced emission molecule, are investigated with excitation dependent ultrafast UV/IR spectroscopy and fluorescence. Both the fluorescence quantum yield and the efficiency of cyclization are found to be smaller with a shorter excitation wavelength. An abrupt change occurs at about 300–310 nm. The results imply that crossing the twisting CI has a larger barrier than the cyclization CI, and the cis–trans twisting motion is probably involved with large solvation reorganization.},

The electron density is calculated along the interatomic distance in a pseudopotential and a dispersion potential.

  abstract = {Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation is a powerful tool for understanding the dynamics and structure of matter. Since the resolution of MD is atomic-scale, achieving long timescale simulations with femtosecond integration is very expensive. In each MD step, numerous iterative computations are performed to calculate energy based on different types of interaction and their corresponding spatial gradients. These repetitive computations can be learned and surrogated by a deep learning model, such as a Graph Neural Network (GNN). In this work, we developed a GNN Accelerated MD (GAMD) model that directly predicts forces, given the state of the system (atom positions, atom types), bypassing the evaluation of potential energy. By training the GNN on a variety of data sources (simulation data derived from classical MD and density functional theory), we show that GAMD can predict the dynamics of two typical molecular systems, Lennard-Jones system and water system, in the NVT ensemble with velocities regulated by a thermostat. We further show that GAMD’s learning and inference are agnostic to the scale, where it can scale to much larger systems at test time. We also perform a comprehensive benchmark test comparing our implementation of GAMD to production-level MD software, showing GAMD’s competitive performance on the large-scale simulation.},

  abstract = {Despite the incredible progress of experimental techniques, protein structure determination still remains a challenging task. Due to the rapid improvements of computer technology, simulations are often used to complement or interpret experimental data, particularly for sparse or low-resolution data. Many such in silico methods allow us to obtain highly accurate models of a protein structure either de novo or via refinement of a physical model with experimental restraints. One crucial question is how to select a representative member or ensemble out of the vast number of computationally generated structures. Here, we introduce such a method. As a representative task, we add co-evolutionary contact pairs as distance restraints to a physical force field and want to select a good characterization of the resulting native-like ensemble. To generate large ensembles, we run replica-exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) on five mid-sized test proteins and over a wide temperature range. High temperatures allow overcoming energetic barriers while low temperatures perform local searches of native-like conformations. The integrated bias is based on co-evolutionary contact pairs derived from a deep residual neural network to guide the simulation toward native-like conformations. We shortly compare and discuss the achieved model precision of contact-guided REMD for mid-sized proteins. Finally, we discuss four robust ensemble-selection algorithms in great detail, which are capable to extract the representative structure models with a high certainty. To assess the performance of the selection algorithms, we exemplarily mimic a “blind scenario,” i.e., where the target structure is unknown, and select a representative structural ensemble of native-like folds.},

The performance of two different strategies for scaling third-order contributions to the ADC secular matrix is evaluated. Both considered schemes employ a single tuning parameter and conserve general properties inherent to all ADC methods, such as hermiticity and size-consistency. The first approach, scaled-matrix ADC[(2) + x (3)], scales all contributions first occurring in ADC(3) equally and leads to an improvement of the accuracy of excitation energies compared to ADC(3) for x = 0.4–0.5. However, with respect to excited state dipole moments, this method provides lower accuracy than ADC(3). The second scaling approach, MP[(1) + x (2)] − ISR(3), scales the second order contributions of the ground-state wavefunction and derives a rigorous ADC scheme via the intermediate state representation formalism. Although the error in excitation energies is not improved, this method provides insight into the relevance of the individual terms of the ADC(3) matrix and indicates that the MP(2) wavefunction is, indeed, the optimal reference wavefunction for deriving a third-order single-reference ADC scheme.},

  abstract = {Conformational dynamics of biomolecules are of fundamental importance for their function. Single-molecule studies of Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET) between a tethered donor and acceptor dye pair are a powerful tool to investigate the structure and dynamics of labeled molecules. However, capturing and quantifying conformational dynamics in intensity-based smFRET experiments remains challenging when the dynamics occur on the sub-millisecond timescale. The method of multiparameter fluorescence detection addresses this challenge by simultaneously registering fluorescence intensities and lifetimes of the donor and acceptor. Together, two FRET observables, the donor fluorescence lifetime τ D and the intensity-based FRET efficiency E , inform on the width of the FRET efficiency distribution as a characteristic fingerprint for conformational dynamics. We present a general framework for analyzing dynamics that relates average fluorescence lifetimes and intensities in two-dimensional burst frequency histograms. We present parametric relations of these observables for interpreting the location of FRET populations in E –τ D diagrams, called FRET-lines. To facilitate the analysis of complex exchange equilibria, FRET-lines serve as reference curves for a graphical interpretation of experimental data to (i) identify conformational states, (ii) resolve their dynamic connectivity, (iii) compare different kinetic models, and (iv) infer polymer properties of unfolded or intrinsically disordered proteins. For a simplified graphical analysis of complex kinetic networks, we derive a moment-based representation of the experimental data that decouples the motion of the fluorescence labels from the conformational dynamics of the biomolecule. Importantly, FRET-lines facilitate exploring complex dynamic models via easily computed experimental observables. We provide extensive computational tools to facilitate applying FRET-lines.},

We show that tapered copolymers belong to the Brazovskii “universality class,” where fluctuations play a dominant role. Consequently, the order-to-disorder transition has a very weak, fluctuation-induced first-order character. The ordering kinetics of the lamellar phase from the supercooled disordered melt revealed several distinct differences associated with the range of metastability (increased), the timescales (bimodal), and the exact mechanism of ordering. The results are discussed in terms of the reduced interaction parameter and the introduction of structural defects within the lamellar grains.},

Here, we perform computer simulations to study the migration of a 2D active colloidal cell (ACC), which consists of active particles enclosed by a passive vesicle, in a heterogeneous environment composed of two adjoining uniform regions with different attributes (influencing the persistent length of the active particle). We find that the ACC can migrate unidirectionally across the interface separating the heterogeneous region and behave tactically. Interestingly, the tactic motion of the ACC is qualitatively different from that of the constituent active particles themselves. In addition, the ACC may also experience a directed drift along the interface of the heterogeneous environment. The tactic behavior of the ACC can be explained by analyzing the pressure distribution on the cell membrane exerted by the enclosed active particles. The findings provide insights into understanding the taxis of biological cells and designing biomimetic cells with environment-sensitive capabilities.},

The horizontal growth of the tubular structure undergoes spontaneous symmetry breaking, where instabilities develop on the surface of the chitosan tubules. Transformation of folds into wrinkles and finally to a smooth tube takes place by varying the orientation of the container.

Unfortunately, changing φ by varying an external parameter, e.g., temperature T as in molecular glass formers, is not possible, unless one uses thermosensitive colloidal particles, such as the popular poly( N -isopropylacrylamide) (PNiPAM) microgels. These, however, have several drawbacks, including high deformability, osmotic deswelling, and interpenetration, which complicate their use as a model system to study the colloidal glass transition. Here, we propose a new system consisting of a colloidal suspension of non-deformable spherical silica nanoparticles, in which PNiPAM hydrogel spheres of ∼ 100 − 200 μ m size are suspended. These non-colloidal “mesogels” allow for controlling the sample volume effectively available to the silica nanoparticles and hence their φ , thanks to the T -induced change in mesogels’ volume. Using optical microscopy, we first show that the mesogels retain their ability to change size with T when suspended in Ludox suspensions, similarly as in water. We then show that their size is independent of the sample thermal history such that a well-defined, reversible relationship between T and φ may be established. Finally, we use space-resolved dynamic light scattering to demonstrate that, upon varying T , our system exhibits a broad range of dynamical behaviors across the glass transition and beyond, comparable with those exhibited by a series of distinct silica nanoparticle suspensions of various φ .},

Largely validated empirical force-fields are employed to run ns-long simulations and extract general trends for several properties, at increasing size and in a wide temperature range. This work shows that, for the considered type-II superionic conductors, the diffusivity dramatically depends on the system size and that the superionic regime is shifted to larger temperatures in smaller cells. Furthermore, only simulations of several hundred atoms are able to capture the experimentally observed, characteristic change in the activation energy of the diffusion process, occurring at the order–disorder transition to the superionic regime. Finite-size effects on ion diffusion are instead much weaker in α -AgI. The thermal conductivity is found generally smaller for smaller cells, where the temperature-independent (Allen-Feldman) regime is also reached at significantly lower temperatures. The finite-size effects on the thermal motion of the non-mobile ions composing the solid matrix follow the simple law that holds for solids.},

  abstract = {In this work, a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method was developed for the synthesis of transition metal dichalcogenide alloy monolayers, with a composition gradient in the radial direction. The composition gradient was achieved by controlling the substrate cooling rate during the CVD growth. The two types of alloys, namely, WS 2(1−x) Se 2x and MoS 2(1−x) Se 2x , were found to exhibit an opposite composition gradient. This is attributed to their different cohesive energies. A two-dimensional Ising model is used to explain the growth mechanism, where two ends of the composition were modeled as a magnetically ordered phase and a paramagnetic phase. The composition as a function of substrate temperature is then represented by the thermal magnetization curve.},

  abstract = {Dimerization of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) is an important, yet poorly understood, step in the on-surface synthesis of graphene (nanoribbon), soot formation, and growth of carbonaceous dust grains in the interstellar medium (ISM). The on-surface synthesis of graphene and the growth of carbonaceous dust grains in the ISM require the chemical dimerization in which chemical bonds are formed between PAH monomers. An accurate and cheap method of exploring structure rearrangements is needed to reveal the mechanism of chemical dimerization on surfaces. This work has investigated the chemical dimerization of two dehydrogenated PAHs (coronene and pentacene) on graphene via an evolutionary algorithm augmented by machine learning surrogate potentials and a set of customized structure operators. Different dimer structures on surfaces have been successfully located by our structure search methods. Their binding energies are within the experimental errors of temperature programmed desorption measurements. The mechanism of coronene dimer formation on graphene is further studied and discussed.},

  abstract = {In the present study, using dynamic mean field theory complemented by grand canonical molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate the extent to which the density distributions encountered during the dynamics of capillary condensation are related to those distributions at equilibrium or metastable equilibrium in a system at fixed average density (canonical ensemble). We find that the states encountered can be categorized as out of equilibrium or quasi-equilibrium based on the magnitude of the driving force for mass transfer. More specifically, in open-ended slit pores, pore filling via double bridging is an out of equilibrium process, induced by the dynamics of the system, while pore filling by single bridge formation is connected to a series of configurations that are equilibrium configurations in the canonical ensemble and that cannot be observed experimentally by a standard adsorption process, corresponding to the grand canonical ensemble. Likewise, in closed cap slits, the formation of a liquid bridge near the pore opening and its subsequent growth while the initially detached meniscus from the capped end remains immobilized are out of equilibrium processes that occur at large driving forces. On the other hand, at small driving forces, there is a continuous acceleration of the detached meniscus from the capped end, which is associated with complete reversibility in the limit of an infinitesimally small driving force.},

  abstract = {Pd-doped ceria is highly active in promoting oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions and also a model single atom catalyst (SAC). By performing density functional theory calculations corrected by on-site Coulomb interactions, we systematically studied the physicochemical properties of the Pd-doped CeO 2 (111) surface and the catalytic methanol to formaldehyde reaction on the surface. Two different configurations were located for the Pd dopant, and the calculated results showed that doping of Pd will make the surface more active with lower oxygen vacancy formation energies than the pristine CeO 2 (111). Moreover, two different pathways for the dehydrogenation of CH 3 OH to HCHO on the Pd-doped CeO 2 (111) were determined, one of which is the conventional two-step process (stepwise pathway) with the O–H bond of CH 3 OH being broken first followed by the C–H bond cleavage, while the other is a novel one-step process (concerted pathway) involving the two H being dissociated from CH 3 OH simultaneously even with a lower energy barrier than the stepwise one. With electronic and structural analyses, we showed that the direct reduction of Pd 4+ to Pd 2+ through the transfer of two electrons can outperform the separated Ce 4+ to Ce 3+ processes with the help of configurational evolution at the Pd site, which is responsible for the existence of such one-step dehydrogenation process. This novel mechanism may provide an inspiration for constructing ceria-based SAC with unique ODH activities.},

  abstract = {Salt aqueous solutions are relevant in many fields, ranging from biological systems to seawater. Thus, the availability of a force-field that is able to reproduce the thermodynamic and dynamic behavior of salt aqueous solutions would be of great interest. Unfortunately, this has been proven challenging, and most of the existing force-fields fail to reproduce much of their behavior. In particular, the diffusion of water or the salt solubility are often not well reproduced by most of the existing force-fields. Recently, the Madrid-2019 model was proposed, and it was shown that this force-field, which uses the TIP4P/2005 model for water and non-integer charges for the ions, provides a good description of a large number of properties, including the solution densities, viscosities, and the diffusion of water. In this work, we assess the performance of this force-field on the evaluation of the freezing point depression. Although the freezing point depression is a colligative property that at low salt concentrations depends solely on properties of pure water, a good model for the electrolytes is needed to accurately predict the freezing point depression at moderate and high salt concentrations. The coexistence line between ice and several salt aqueous solutions (NaCl, KCl, LiCl, MgCl 2 , and Li 2 SO 4 ) up to the eutectic point is estimated from direct coexistence molecular dynamics simulations. Our results show that this force-field reproduces fairly well the experimentally measured freezing point depression with respect to pure water freezing for all the salts and at all the compositions considered.},

  abstract = {The formulation of the mean-field infinite-dimensional solution of hard sphere glasses is a significant milestone for theoretical physics. How relevant this description might be for understanding low-dimensional glass-forming liquids, however, remains unclear. These liquids indeed exhibit a complex interplay between structure and dynamics, and the importance of this interplay might only slowly diminish as dimension d increases. A careful numerical assessment of the matter has long been hindered by the exponential increase in computational costs with d . By revisiting a once common simulation technique involving the use of periodic boundary conditions modeled on D d lattices, we here partly sidestep this difficulty, thus allowing the study of hard sphere liquids up to d = 13. Parallel efforts by Mangeat and Zamponi [Phys. Rev. E 93 , 012609 (2016)] have expanded the mean-field description of glasses to finite d by leveraging the standard liquid–state theory and, thus, help bridge the gap from the other direction. The relatively smooth evolution of both the structure and dynamics across the d gap allows us to relate the two approaches and to identify some of the missing features that a finite- d theory of glasses might hope to include to achieve near quantitative agreement.},

We show that Na + ions can be released in solution, while Ca 2+ cannot leave the surface of CNBS glass. This release is correlated with the vacancy energy of Ca 2+ and Na + cations. Here, we found that the CNBS structure with the Na + cation vacancy is energetically more favorable than the structure with the Ca 2+ cation vacancy. The calcium adsorption site has been shown to have a greater affinity for water than can be found in the case of the sodium site, demonstrating that affinity may not be considered a major factor controlling the release of cations from the glass to the solution.},

The cMUPICO method allows for clearly displaying coincident channels for dissociation channels containing three more fragments with unequal charge states, invisible in the traditional PIPICO. As a demonstration, three-body fragmentation dynamics of CO 2 in strong IR laser fields is analyzed, and 11 dissociation channels are effectively identified, five of which are first found with cMUPICO. The present results show that cMUPICO is a powerful and practical tool for distinguishing various dissociation channels with multiply charged multi-photoions.},

We recorded 25 rotational transitions with an absolute accuracy of better than 20 MHz, assigned 56 hyperfine lines, and determined precise rotational, fine, and hyperfine structure parameters for the A 2 Π state. The radiative lifetime of the A 2 Π state was determined to be 7.2(3) ns, in good agreement with ab initio calculations. The transition isotope shift between bosonic isotopologues of the molecule is recorded and compared to predicted values within the Born–Oppenheimer approximation.

We present a computational study that examines the prospect of using electrostatic free energy measurements to detect 3D conformational properties of nucleic acid molecules in solution. As an example, we consider the conformational difference between A- and B-form double helices whose structures differ in the values of two key parameters—the helical radius and rise per basepair. Mapping the double helix onto a smooth charged cylinder reveals that electrostatic free energies for molecular helices can, indeed, be described by two parameters: the axial charge spacing and the radius of a corresponding equivalent cylinder. We show that electrostatic free energies are also sensitive to the local structure of the molecular interface with the surrounding electrolyte. A free energy measurement accuracy of 1\%, achievable using the escape time electrometry (ET e ) technique, could be expected to offer a measurement precision on the radius of the double helix of approximately 1 Å. Electrostatic free energy measurements may, therefore, not only provide information on the structure and conformation of biomolecules but could also shed light on the interfacial hydration layer and the size and arrangement of counterions at the molecular interface in solution.},

In this paper, the use of computational optimal transport is investigated for such a problem. In the optimal transport literature, the comparison of a discrete and a continuous spectrum is referred to as semi-discrete optimal transport and is a situation where a metric such as least-squares may be difficult to define except under special conditions. The merits of an optimal transport approach for this problem are investigated using the transport distance defined for the semi-discrete case. A tutorial on semi-discrete optimal transport for molecular spectra is included in this paper, and several well-chosen synthetic spectra are investigated to demonstrate the utility of computational optimal transport for the semi-discrete case. Among several types of investigations, we include calculations showing how the frequency resolution of the continuous spectrum affects the transport distance between a discrete and a continuous spectrum. We also use the transport distance to measure the distance between a continuous experimental electronic absorption spectrum of SO 2 and a theoretical stick spectrum for the same system. The comparison of the theoretical and experimental SO 2 spectra also allows us to suggest a theoretical value for the band origin that is closer to the observed band origin than previous theoretical values.},

  abstract = {Understanding the excited state properties of molecules provides insight into how they interact with light. These interactions can be exploited to design compounds for photochemical applications, including enhanced spectral conversion of light to increase the efficiency of photovoltaic cells. While chemical discovery is time- and resource-intensive experimentally, computational chemistry can be used to screen large-scale databases for molecules of interest in a procedure known as high-throughput virtual screening. The first step usually involves a high-speed but low-accuracy method to screen large numbers of molecules (potentially millions), so only the best candidates are evaluated with expensive methods. However, use of a coarse first-pass screening method can potentially result in high false positive or false negative rates. Therefore, this study uses machine learning to calibrate a high-throughput technique [eXtended Tight Binding based simplified Tamm-Dancoff approximation (xTB-sTDA)] against a higher accuracy one (time-dependent density functional theory). Testing the calibration model shows an approximately sixfold decrease in the error in-domain and an approximately threefold decrease in the out-of-domain. The resulting mean absolute error of ∼0.14 eV is in line with previous work in machine learning calibrations and out-performs previous work in linear calibration of xTB-sTDA. We then apply the calibration model to screen a 250k molecule database and map inaccuracies of xTB-sTDA in chemical space. We also show generalizability of the workflow by calibrating against a higher-level technique (CC2), yielding a similarly low error. Overall, this work demonstrates that machine learning can be used to develop a cost-effective and accurate method for large-scale excited state screening, enabling accelerated molecular discovery across a variety of disciplines.},

  abstract = {Accurate and efficient simulation of the thermodynamics and kinetics of protein–ligand interactions is crucial for computational drug discovery. Multiensemble Markov Model (MEMM) estimators can provide estimates of both binding rates and affinities from collections of short trajectories but have not been systematically explored for situations when a ligand is decoupled through scaling of non-bonded interactions. In this work, we compare the performance of two MEMM approaches for estimating ligand binding affinities and rates: (1) the transition-based reweighting analysis method (TRAM) and (2) a Maximum Caliber (MaxCal) based method. As a test system, we construct a small host–guest system where the ligand is a single uncharged Lennard-Jones (LJ) particle, and the receptor is an 11-particle icosahedral pocket made from the same atom type. To realistically mimic a protein–ligand binding system, the LJ ϵ parameter was tuned, and the system was placed in a periodic box with 860 TIP3P water molecules. A benchmark was performed using over 80 µ s of unbiased simulation, and an 18-state Markov state model was used to estimate reference binding affinities and rates. We then tested the performance of TRAM and MaxCal when challenged with limited data. Both TRAM and MaxCal approaches perform better than conventional Markov state models, with TRAM showing better convergence and accuracy. We find that subsampling of trajectories to remove time correlation improves the accuracy of both TRAM and MaxCal and that in most cases, only a single biased ensemble to enhance sampled transitions is required to make accurate estimates.},

  abstract = {We derive a set of generalized master equations (GMEs) to study charge transport dynamics in molecular junctions using the Nakajima–Zwanzig–Mori projection operator approach. In the new GME, time derivatives of population on each quantum state of the molecule, as well as the tunneling current, are calculated as the convolution of time non-local memory kernels with populations on all system states. The non-Markovian memory kernels are obtained by combining the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) method and a previous derived Dyson relation for the exact kernel. A perturbative expansion of these memory kernels is then calculated using the extended HEOM developed in our previous work [M. Xu et al ., J. Chem. Phys. 146 , 064102 (2017)]. By using the resonant level model and the Anderson impurity model, we study properties of the exact memory kernels and analyze convergence properties of their perturbative expansions with respect to the system–bath coupling strength and the electron–electron repulsive energy. It is found that exact memory kernels calculated from HEOM exhibit short memory times and decay faster than the population and current dynamics. The high order perturbation expansion of the memory kernels can give converged results in certain parameter regimes. The Padé and Landau–Zener resummation schemes are also found to give improved results over low order perturbation theory.},

The coherence partition of QSL is much bigger than the population partition of QSL. Our study gives us the possibilities to manipulate dynamics of quantum states locally by employing the coherent destruction of tunneling, which is significant in quantum information process.

  abstract = {The kinetics of a dynamical system dominated by two metastable states is examined from the perspective of the activated-dynamics reactive flux formalism, Markov state eigenvalue spectral decomposition, and committor-based transition path theory. Analysis shows that the different theoretical formulations are consistent, clarifying the significance of the inherent microscopic lag-times that are implicated, and that the most meaningful one-dimensional reaction coordinate in the region of the transition state is along the gradient of the committor in the multidimensional subspace of collective variables. It is shown that the familiar reactive flux activated dynamics formalism provides an effective route to calculate the transition rate in the case of a narrow sharp barrier but much less so in the case of a broad flat barrier. In this case, the standard reactive flux correlation function decays very slowly to the plateau value that corresponds to the transmission coefficient. Treating the committor function as a reaction coordinate does not alleviate all issues caused by the slow relaxation of the reactive flux correlation function. A more efficient activated dynamics simulation algorithm may be achieved from a modified reactive flux weighted by the committor. Simulation results on simple systems are used to illustrate the various conceptual points.},

  abstract = {Recent work has demonstrated the promise of using machine-learned surrogates, in particular, Gaussian process (GP) surrogates, in reducing the number of electronic structure calculations (ESCs) needed to perform surrogate model based (SMB) geometry optimization. In this paper, we study geometry meta-optimization with GP surrogates where a SMB optimizer additionally learns from its past “experience” performing geometry optimization. To validate this idea, we start with the simplest setting where a geometry meta-optimizer learns from previous optimizations of the same molecule with different initial-guess geometries. We give empirical evidence that geometry meta-optimization with GP surrogates is effective and requires less tuning compared to SMB optimization with GP surrogates on the ANI-1 dataset of off-equilibrium initial structures of small organic molecules. Unlike SMB optimization where a surrogate should be immediately useful for optimizing a given geometry, a surrogate in geometry meta-optimization has more flexibility because it can distribute its ESC savings across a set of geometries. Indeed, we find that GP surrogates that preserve rotational invariance provide increased marginal ESC savings across geometries. As a more stringent test, we also apply geometry meta-optimization to conformational search on a hand-constructed dataset of hydrocarbons and alcohols. We observe that while SMB optimization and geometry meta-optimization do save on ESCs, they also tend to miss higher energy conformers compared to standard geometry optimization. We believe that further research into characterizing the divergence between GP surrogates and potential energy surfaces is critical not only for advancing geometry meta-optimization but also for exploring the potential of machine-learned surrogates in geometry optimization in general.},

As a result, we evaluate a variety of path-based partition functions and free energies by using the formalism of statistical mechanics. They allow us to calculate the timescales of a given enzymatic reaction, even in the absence of an explicit boundary condition that is necessary for the equilibrium ensemble. We also consider the large deviation theory under a closed-boundary condition of the fixed observation time to quantify the enzyme–substrate unbinding rates. The result demonstrates the presence of a phase-separation-like, bimodal behavior in unbinding events at a finite timescale, and the behavior vanishes as its rate function converges to a single phase in the long-time limit.},

The original CDVR approach and its multi-layer extension show a hierarchical structure: the size of the grids employed at the different layers increases when moving from an upper layer to a lower one. In this work, a non-hierarchical CDVR approach, which uses identically structured quadratures at all layers of the MCTDH wavefunction representation, is introduced. The non-hierarchical CDVR approach crucially reduces the number of grid points required, compared to the hierarchical CDVR, shows superior scaling properties, and yields identical results for all three representations showing the same topology.

  abstract = {Under vibrational strong coupling (VSC), the formation of molecular polaritons may significantly modify the photo-induced or thermal properties of molecules. In an effort to understand these intriguing modifications, both experimental and theoretical studies have focused on the ultrafast dynamics of vibrational polaritons. Here, following our recent work [Li et al ., J. Chem. Phys. 154 , 094124 (2021)], we systematically study the mechanism of polariton relaxation for liquid CO 2 under a weak external pumping. Classical cavity molecular dynamics (CavMD) simulations confirm that polariton relaxation results from the combined effects of (i) cavity loss through the photonic component and (ii) dephasing of the bright-mode component to vibrational dark modes as mediated by intermolecular interactions. The latter polaritonic dephasing rate is proportional to the product of the weight of the bright mode in the polariton wave function and the spectral overlap between the polariton and dark modes. Both these factors are sensitive to parameters such as the Rabi splitting and cavity mode detuning. Compared to a Fermi’s golden rule calculation based on a tight-binding harmonic model, CavMD yields a similar parameter dependence for the upper polariton relaxation lifetime but sometimes a modest disagreement for the lower polariton. We suggest that this disagreement results from polariton-enhanced molecular nonlinear absorption due to molecular anharmonicity, which is not included in our analytical model. We also summarize recent progress on probing nonreactive VSC dynamics with CavMD.},

Lett. 11 , 8208–8215 (2020)] is used to create three global hybrid functionals with varying admixtures of Hartree–Fock “exact” exchange (HFX). The resulting functionals r 2 SCANh (10\% HFX), r 2 SCAN0 (25\% HFX), and r 2 SCAN50 (50\% HFX) are combined with the semi-classical D4 London dispersion correction. The new functionals are assessed for the calculation of molecular geometries, main-group, and metalorganic thermochemistry at 26 comprehensive benchmark sets. These include the extensive GMTKN55 database, ROST61, and IONPI19 sets. It is shown that a moderate admixture of HFX leads to relative improvements of the mean absolute deviations for thermochemistry of 11\% (r 2 SCANh-D4), 16\% (r 2 SCAN0-D4), and 1\% (r 2 SCAN50-D4) compared to the parental semi-local meta-GGA. For organometallic reaction energies and barriers, r 2 SCAN0-D4 yields an even larger mean improvement of 35\%. The computation of structural parameters (geometry optimization) does not systematically profit from the HFX admixture. Overall, the best variant r 2 SCAN0-D4 performs well for both main-group and organometallic thermochemistry and is better or on par with well-established global hybrid functionals, such as PW6B95-D4 or PBE0-D4. Regarding systems prone to self-interaction errors (SIE4x4), r 2 SCAN0-D4 shows reasonable performance, reaching the quality of the range-separated ω B97X-V functional. Accordingly, r 2 SCAN0-D4 in combination with a sufficiently converged basis set [def2-QZVP(P)] represents a robust and reliable choice for general use in the calculation of thermochemical properties of both main-group and organometallic chemistry.},

Methods that account for temperature dependence, such as Mermin–Kohn–Sham finite-temperature density functional theory and free energy density functional theory, are now employed with more regularity and available in many standard code packages. However, approximations from zero-temperature density functional theory are still often used in temperature-dependent simulations using thermally weighted electronic densities as an input to exchange–correlation functional approximations, a practice known to miss temperature-dependent effects in the exchange–correlation free energy of these systems. In this work, the temperature-dependent adiabatic connection is demonstrated and analyzed using a well-known parameterization of the uniform electron gas free energy. Useful tools based on this formalism for analyzing and constraining approximations of the exchange–correlation at zero temperature are leveraged for the finite-temperature case. Inspired by the Lieb–Oxford inequality, which provides a lower bound for the ground-state exchange–correlation energy, bounds for the exchange–correlation at finite temperatures are approximated for various degrees of electronic correlation.},

  abstract = {The presence of a high density of excited electronic states in the immediate vicinity of the optically bright state of a molecule paves the way for numerous photo-relaxation channels. In transition-metal complexes, the presence of heavy atoms results in a stronger spin–orbit coupling, which enables spin forbidden spin-crossover processes to compete with the spin-allowed internal conversion processes. However, no matter how effectively the states cross around the Franck–Condon region, the degree of vibronic coupling, of both relativistic and non-relativistic nature, drives the population distribution among these states. One such case is demonstrated in this work for the intermediate-spin Fe(III) trigonal-bipyramidal complex. A quantum dynamical investigation of the photo-deactivation mechanism in the Fe(III) system is presented using the multi-configurational time-dependent Hartree approach based on the vibronic Hamiltonian whose coupling terms are derived from the state-averaged complete active space self-consistent field/complete active space with second-order perturbation theory (CASPT2) calculations and spin–orbit coupling of the scalar-relativistic CASPT2 states. The results of this study show that the presence of a strong (non-relativistic) vibronic coupling between the optically bright intermediate-spin state and other low-lying states of the same spin-multiplicity overpowers the spin–orbit coupling between the intermediate-spin and high-spin states, thereby lowering the chances of spin-crossover while exhibiting ultrafast relaxation among the intermediate-spin states. In a special case, where the population transfer pathway via the non-relativistic vibronic coupling is blocked, the probability of the spin-crossover is found to increase. This suggests that a careful modification of the complex by incorporation of heavier atoms with stronger relativistic effects can enhance the spin-crossover potential of Fe(III) intermediate-spin complexes.},

These errors are significantly reduced by removing self-interaction using the Perdew–Zunger self-interaction correction (PZ-SIC) in the Fermi–Löwdin Orbital (FLO) SIC framework. In the case of FLO-PBE, typical errors are reduced to less than 0.1 eV. Analysis of the results using DFT energies evaluated on self-interaction-corrected densities [DFT(@FLO)] indicates that the density-driven contributions to the FLO-DFT adsorption energy corrections are roughly the same size in DFT = LSDA and PBE, but the total corrections due to removing self-interaction are larger in LSDA.},

  abstract = {A theory of barrier crossing rate on a multidimensional reaction energy surface is presented. The theory is a generalization of the earlier theoretical schemes to higher dimensions, with the inclusion of non-Markovian friction along both the reactive and the nonreactive coordinates. The theory additionally includes the bilinear coupling between the reactive and the nonreactive modes at the Hamiltonian level. Under suitable conditions, we recover the rate expressions of Langer and Hynes and establish a connection with the rate treatment of Pollak. Within the phenomenology of generalized Langevin equation description, our formulation provides an improvement over the existing ones because we explicitly include both the non-Markovian effects along the reaction coordinate and the bilinear coupling at the Hamiltonian level. At intermediate-to-large friction, an increase in dimensionality by itself tends to reduce the rate, while the inclusion of the memory effects increases the rate. The theory predicts an increase in rate when off-diagonal friction terms are included. We present a model calculation to study isomerization of a stilbene-like molecule using the prescription of Hochstrasser and co-workers on a two-dimensional reaction energy surface, employing Zwanzig–Bixon hydrodynamic theory of frequency-dependent friction. The calculated rate shows a departure from the predictions of Langer’s theory and also from the two-dimensional transition state theory.},

  abstract = {Two-dimensional Raman and hybrid terahertz-Raman spectroscopic techniques provide invaluable insight into molecular structures and dynamics of condensed-phase systems. However, corroborating experimental results with theory is difficult due to the high computational cost of incorporating quantum-mechanical effects in the simulations. Here, we present the equilibrium–nonequilibrium ring-polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD), a practical computational method that can account for nuclear quantum effects on the two-time response function of nonlinear optical spectroscopy. Unlike a recently developed approach based on the double Kubo transformed (DKT) correlation function, our method is exact in the classical limit, where it reduces to the established equilibrium-nonequilibrium classical molecular dynamics method. Using benchmark model calculations, we demonstrate the advantages of the equilibrium–nonequilibrium RPMD over classical and DKT-based approaches. Importantly, its derivation, which is based on the nonequilibrium RPMD, obviates the need for identifying an appropriate Kubo transformed correlation function and paves the way for applying real-time path-integral techniques to multidimensional spectroscopy.},

We show that the relevant conformational characteristics of copolymers can be probabilistically inferred from their coherent scattering cross sections without any restriction imposed by model assumptions.

  abstract = {Computational studies of ultrafast photoinduced processes give valuable insights into the photochemical mechanisms of a broad range of compounds. In order to accurately reproduce, interpret, and predict experimental results, which are typically obtained in a condensed phase, it is indispensable to include the condensed phase environment in the computational model. However, most studies are still performed in vacuum due to the high computational cost of state-of-the-art non-adiabatic molecular dynamics (NAMD) simulations. The quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) solvation method has been a popular model to perform photodynamics in the liquid phase. Nevertheless, the currently used QM/MM embedding techniques cannot sufficiently capture all solute–solvent interactions. In this Perspective, we will discuss the efficient ΔSCF electronic structure method and its applications with respect to the NAMD of solvated compounds, with a particular focus on explicit quantum mechanical solvation. As more research is required for this method to reach its full potential, some challenges and possible directions for future research are presented as well.},

  abstract = {Protein–ligand interactions are crucial for a wide range of physiological processes. Many cellular functions result in these non-covalent “bonds” being mechanically strained, and this can be integral to proper cellular function. Broadly, two classes of force dependence have been observed—slip bonds, where the unbinding rate increases, and catch bonds, where the unbinding rate decreases. Despite much theoretical work, we cannot predict for which protein–ligand pairs, pulling coordinates, and forces a particular rate dependence will appear. Here, we assess the ability of MD simulations combined with enhanced sampling techniques to probe the force dependence of unbinding rates. We show that the infrequent metadynamics technique correctly produces both catch and slip bonding kinetics for model potentials. We then apply it to the well-studied case of a buckyball in a hydrophobic cavity, which appears to exhibit an ideal slip bond. Finally, we compute the force-dependent unbinding rate of biotin–streptavidin. Here, the complex nature of the unbinding process causes the infrequent metadynamics method to begin to break down due to the presence of unbinding intermediates, despite the use of a previously optimized sampling coordinate. Allowing for this limitation, a combination of kinetic and free energy computations predicts an overall slip bond for larger forces consistent with prior experimental results although there are substantial deviations at small forces that require further investigation. This work demonstrates the promise of predicting force-dependent unbinding rates using enhanced sampling MD techniques while also revealing the methodological barriers that must be overcome to tackle more complex targets in the future.},

Here, we revisit the coherent dynamics and clarify different types of coherences in the energy transfer processes of LHCII using a joint method of the high-S/N transient grating and two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy. We find that the electronic coherence decays completely within 50 fs at room temperature. The vibrational coherences of chlorophyll a dominate over oscillations within 1 ps, whereas a low-frequency mode of 340 cm −1 with a vibronic mixing character may participate in vibrationally assisted energy transfer between chlorophylls a . Our results may suggest that vibronic mixing is relevant for rapid energy transfer processes among chlorophylls in LHCII.},

  abstract = {Using self-consistent field theory, we study the effect of reversible cross-linking on the nucleation behavior of a binary polymer blend where only one of the components is able to form cross-links. To control the total number of cross-links and their distribution, we introduce a position-dependent cross-linking probability function that is characterized mainly by two parameters, the magnitude and the width. In the weakly cross-linked region, where the product of the magnitude and width, I , is small, the nucleation behavior is classical-like and the profile of the free energy excess is unimodal. In contrast, in the strongly cross-linked region, the profile of the free energy excess becomes bimodal, and the free energy minimum specifies a metastable nucleus. In a certain I , the free energy barrier for the metastable nucleus turns to be negative, which means it becomes more stable. In both cases, the free energy barrier of the critical nucleus is lower than that without cross-linking, indicating that cross-linking always facilitates nucleation although the dynamic behavior may be different when a metastable nucleus is involved during the nucleation process. The free energy analysis demonstrates that the interaction energy rather than the entropy is responsible for the properties of the critical nucleus. Our study provides an easy alternative way for the control of the nucleation behavior and may attract practical interest.},

We demonstrate that shallow density modulations with identical amplitudes and wavevectors that have been prepared by different processes exhibit different nonexponential decay behaviors. Thus, in contrast to the popular assumption of dynamic self-consistent field theory, the density alone does not suffice to characterize the configuration of the polymer system. We provide an analytic description within Linear-Response Theory (LRT) and the Rouse model that quantitatively agree with the results of the particle-based simulations. LRT is equivalent to a generalized model-B dynamics with an Onsager coefficient that is nonlocal in space and time. Alternatively, the Rouse description can be cast into a dynamic density-functional theory that uses the full probability distribution of single-chain configurations as a dynamic variable and yields a memory-free description of the dynamics that quantitatively accounts for the dependence on the preparation process. An approximate scheme that only considers the joint distribution of the first two Rouse modes—the ellipsoid model—is also explored.},

Above this density, the dynamics are irreversible and the disks do not return to the same positions after each cycle. The critical density depends strongly on the angle θ between the driving direction and a symmetry axis of the obstacle array, with the highest critical densities appearing at commensurate angles such as θ = 0° and θ = 45° and the lowest critical densities falling at θ = arctan (0.618), the inverse of the golden ratio, where the flow is the most degenerate.

Software toolkits that can automate the procedure to set up high-throughput explicit-solvent quantum chemistry (QC) calculations for arbitrary solutes and solvents in an open-source framework are still lacking. We developed AutoSolvate, an open-source toolkit, to streamline the workflow for QC calculation of explicitly solvated molecules. It automates the solvated-structure generation, force field fitting, configuration sampling, and the final extraction of microsolvated cluster structures that QC packages can readily use to predict molecular properties of interest. AutoSolvate is available through both a command line interface and a graphical user interface, making it accessible to the broader scientific community. To improve the quality of the initial structures generated by AutoSolvate, we investigated the dependence of solute–solvent closeness on solute/solvent identities and trained a machine learning model to predict the closeness and guide initial structure generation. Finally, we tested the capability of AutoSolvate for rapid dataset curation by calculating the outer-sphere reorganization energy of a large dataset of 166 redox couples, which demonstrated the promise of the AutoSolvate package for chemical discovery efforts.},

In quasi-two-dimensional (2D) hybrid organic–inorganic perovskites (HOIPs), tightly bound excitons are found to diffuse within 2D layers rapidly with a non-monotonic temperature dependence. Surprisingly, the interlayer exciton diffusion is quite effective as well despite the large interlayer distance. This is in sharp contrast to electron transport, where the interlayer mobility is several orders of magnitude smaller than the intralayer one. Here, we show that the unusual exciton diffusion behaviors can be systematically modeled via the excitonic band structure arising from a long-range dipolar coupling. Coherent exciton motion is interrupted by scattering of impurities at low temperatures and of acoustic/optical phonons at high temperatures. Acoustic and optical phonons modulate the dipole–dipole distance and the dipole orientation, respectively. The ratio of intralayer and interlayer diffusion constants, D xx / D zz , is comparable to a z / a x with a z and a x being the interlayer and intralayer lattice constants of 2D HOIPs, respectively. The efficient and omnidirectional exciton diffusion suggests a great potential of 2D HOIPs in novel excitonic and polaritonic applications.},

Here, we systematically investigate the distance-dependent resonance energy transfer in alkyl-terminated silicon nanocrystals for the first time. Silicon nanocrystal solids with inter-dot distances varying from 3 to 5 nm are fabricated by varying the length and surface coverage of alkyl ligands in solution-phase and gas-phase functionalized silicon nanocrystals. The inter-dot energy transfer rates are extracted from steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence measurements, enabling a direct comparison to theoretical predictions. Our results reveal that the distance-dependent energy transfer rates in Si NCs decay faster than predicted by the Förster mechanism, suggesting higher-order multipole interactions.},

  abstract = {The O vacancy (Ov) formation energy, E Ov , is an important property of a metal-oxide, governing its performance in applications such as fuel cells or heterogeneous catalysis. These defects are routinely studied with density functional theory (DFT). However, it is well-recognized that standard DFT formulations (e.g., the generalized gradient approximation) are insufficient for modeling the Ov, requiring higher levels of theory. The embedded cluster method offers a promising approach to compute E Ov accurately, giving access to all electronic structure methods. Central to this approach is the construction of quantum(-mechanically treated) clusters placed within suitable embedding environments. Unfortunately, current approaches to constructing the quantum clusters either require large system sizes, preventing application of high-level methods, or require significant manual input, preventing investigations of multiple systems simultaneously. In this work, we present a systematic and general quantum cluster design protocol that can determine small converged quantum clusters for studying the Ov in metal-oxides with accurate methods, such as local coupled cluster with single, double, and perturbative triple excitations. We apply this protocol to study the Ov in the bulk and surface planes of rutile TiO 2 and rock salt MgO, producing the first accurate and well-converged determinations of E Ov with this method. These reference values are used to benchmark exchange–correlation functionals in DFT, and we find that all the studied functionals underestimate E Ov , with the average error decreasing along the rungs of Jacob’s ladder. This protocol is automatable for high-throughput calculations and can be generalized to study other point defects or adsorbates.},

Classical EQCM at different scan rates of the potential revealed the complex electrogravimetric behavior likely due to multi-species participation at different temporal scales. Thereafter, in order to better understand the behavior of each species (ions, counter ions, and co-ions) in the charge compensation mechanism, the electrogravimetric impedance spectroscopy analysis (also called ac -electrogravimetry) was pursued. Ac -electrogravimetry revealed the role of each species where Na + cations and Cl − anions as well as protons participate in the charge compensation mechanism of the CNT/P o PD composite with different kinetics and proportions. The water molecules with opposite flux direction with the cations are also detected, suggesting their exclusion during cationic species transfer. Having analyzed ac -electrogravimetry responses in depth, the synergistic interaction between the CNT and P o PD is highlighted, revealing the improved accessibility of species to new sites in the composite.},

  abstract = {Helium atom scattering and density-functional theory (DFT) are used to characterize the phonon band structure of the (3 × 1)-O surface reconstruction of Nb(100). Innovative DFT calculations comparing surface phonons of bare Nb(100) to those of the oxide surface show increased resonances for the oxide, especially at higher energies. Calculated dispersion curves align well with experimental results and yield atomic displacements to characterize polarizations. Inelastic helium time-of-flight measurements show phonons with mixed longitudinal and shear-vertical displacements along both the ⟨ 1 ̄ 00 ⟩, Γ ̄ X ̄ and ⟨ 11 ̄ 0 ⟩, Γ ̄ M ̄ symmetry axes over the entire first surface Brillouin zone. Force constants calculated for bulk Nb, Nb(100), and the (3 × 1)-O Nb(100) reconstruction indicate much stronger responses from the oxide surface, particularly for the top few layers of niobium and oxygen atoms. Many of the strengthened bonds at the surface create the characteristic ladder structure, which passivates and stabilizes the surface. These results represent, to our knowledge, the first phonon dispersion data for the oxide surface and the first ab initio calculation of the oxide’s surface phonons. This study supplies critical information for the further development of advanced materials for superconducting radiofrequency cavities.},

Here, we focus on a microscopic system in which there is only one liquid droplet at most. In this case, we can develop an equilibrium theory for the formation of the droplet in the gas phase using the classical nucleation theory. We use the van der Waals fluid model with surface tension and calculate the size fluctuation of the droplet for various confinement conditions, NVT (in which the volume V of the system is fixed), NPT (in which the pressure P of the system is fixed), and NBT (in which the system is confined in a nano-bubble immersed in a host liquid, where both V and P can fluctuate). We show that in the NBT system, the size flexibility along with space confinement induces a wealth of properties that are not found in NVT and NPT. It exhibits richer phase behaviors: a stable droplet appears and coexists with the pure gas phase and/or pure liquid phase. When compared to the NVT system, the NBT system shows not only the oscillatory fluctuation between the two stable states but also a large fluctuation in the total volume and the pressure.},

We deploy nudged elastic band simulation to determine the minimum energy path and give properties of the crystallization path. In this confined system, depletion effects, which could also be caused by slow material transport in the solution, prevent the post-critical cluster from further growth, and the crystalline state would only be stable at larger cluster sizes. Fluctuation of the higher coupling strength of the crystalline state enables further growth until the crystalline cluster is in equilibrium with the solvent, and this way, a second barrier is crossed. From the parameters and setup, we find necessary conditions for the occurrence of two-step nucleation in our system. These findings can be adapted to real systems as biomineralization, colloidal crystallization, and the solidification of metals.},

  abstract = {Some binary mixtures, such as specific alcohol–alkane mixtures or even water–tbutanol, exhibit two humps “camel back” shaped Kirkwood–Buff integrals (KBIs). This is in sharp contrast with the usual KBIs of binary mixtures having a single extremum. This extremum is interpreted as the region of maximum concentration fluctuations, usually occurs in binary mixtures presenting appreciable micro-segregation, and corresponds to where the mixture exhibits a percolation of the two species domains. In this paper, it is shown that two extrema occur in binary mixtures when one species forms “meta-particle” aggregates, the latter acts as a meta-species, and they have their own concentration fluctuations, hence their own KBI extremum. This “meta-extremum” occurs at a low concentration of the aggregate-forming species (such as alcohol in alkane) and is independent of the other usual extremum observed at mid-volume fraction occupancy. These systems are a good illustration of the concept of the duality between concentration fluctuations and micro-segregation.},

For comparison, a triruthenium undecacarbonyl hydride salt was also synthesized and studied in neat solution to identify the potential influence of the confined solvent environment on the dynamics experienced by carbon monoxide ligands. The vibrational lifetime was found to be significantly decreased for both hydride species relative to the dodecacarbonyl compound. Conversely, spectral diffusion of the CO vibrations was measured to be faster for the parent compound. The most significant dynamic changes occurred upon transformation from the starting compound to the hydride, while only minor differences were observed between the dynamics of the freely dissolved and sol–gel encapsulated hydrides. The results suggest that the structural change to the hydride has the largest impact on the dynamics and that its improved catalytic properties likely do not originate from confined solvent effects.},

  abstract = {A reformulation of the Green–Kubo expressions for the transport coefficients of liquids in terms of a probability distribution function (PDF) of short trajectory contributions, which were named “viscuits,” has been explored in a number of recent publications. The viscuit PDF, P , is asymmetric on the two sides of the distribution. It is shown here using equilibrium 3D and 2D molecular dynamics simulations that the viscuit PDF of a range of simple molecular single component and mixture liquid and solid systems can be expressed in terms of the same intrinsic PDF ( P 0 ), which is derived from P with the viscuit normalized by the standard deviation separately on each side of the distribution. P 0 is symmetric between the two sides and can be represented for not very small viscuit values by the same gamma distribution formulated in terms of a single disposable parameter. P 0 tends to an exponential in the large viscuit wings. Scattergrams of the viscuits and their associated single trajectory correlation functions are shown to distinguish effectively between liquids, solids, and glassy systems. The so-called viscuit square root method for obtaining the transport coefficients is shown to be a useful probe of small and statistically zero self-diffusion coefficients of molecules in the liquid and solid states, respectively. The results of this work suggest that the transport coefficients have a common underlying physical origin, reflecting at a coarse-grained level the traversal statistics of the system through its high-dimensioned potential energy landscape.},

This work extends the one-dimensional SCMFD approach to three dimensions and introduces a variable time step (3D-vt-SCMFD), enabling the modeling of a considerably wider range of different collision environments. We demonstrate the performance of the augmented method by modeling a varied set of test systems: ideal gas mixtures, Poiseuille flow of argon, and expansion of gas into high vacuum. For the gas mixtures, the 3D-vt-SCMFD method reproduces the properties (mean free path, mean free time, collision frequency, and temperature) in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions. From the Poiseuille flow simulations, we extract flow profiles that agree with the solution to the Navier–Stokes equations in the high-density limit and resemble free molecular flow at low densities, as expected. The measured viscosity from 3D-vt-SCMF is ∼15\% lower than the theoretical prediction from Chapman–Enskog theory. The expansion of gas into vacuum is examined in the effusive regime and at the hydrodynamic limit. In both cases, 3D-vt-SCMDF simulations produce gas beam density, velocity, and temperature profiles in excellent agreement with analytical models. In summary, our tests show that 3D-vt-SCMFD is robust and computationally efficient, while also illustrating the diversity of systems the SCMFD model can be successfully applied to.},

Single-determinant-Jastrow (SDJ) trial wavefunctions for triplet states, two-determinant-Jastrow (2DJ) trial wavefunctions for the singlet states, and multi-determinant-Jastrow (MDJ) trial wavefunctions are employed in DMC calculations using restricted open-shell B3LYP (ROB3LYP) orbitals, complete-active-space self-consistent field (CASSCF) orbitals, state-average CASSCF orbitals, or frozen-CASSCF orbitals. Our results show that DMC energies using either SDJ/2DJ or MDJ with ROB3LYP orbitals are close to or lower than those with the other orbitals for organic diradicals, while they are not very sensitive to the employed orbitals for diatomic diradicals. Furthermore, using MDJ can reduce DMC energies to some extent for most of the investigated organic diradicals and some diatomic diradicals. The importance of MDJ on DMC energies can be estimated based on the percentage of main determinants in the CASCI wavefunction. On the other hand, singlet–triplet gaps can be calculated reasonably with DMC using MDJ with a mean absolute error of less than 2 kcal/mol with all these orbitals. CASCI wavefunctions using density functional theory orbitals are preferred in constructing MDJ trial wavefunctions in practical DMC calculations since it is easier to obtain such wavefunctions than CASSCF methods.},

A laser/radio frequency multiple resonance ionization scheme is employed to determine the hyperfine splittings in the a 3 Π 1 , v = 5 level. The experimentally derived hyperfine parameters are compared to the outcome of quantum chemistry calculations. A spectral line with a width of 1.27 kHz is recorded between hyperfine levels in the a 3 Π, v = 0 state.

  abstract = {Isotope substitution is an important experimental technique that offers deep insight into reaction mechanisms, as the measured kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) can be directly compared with theory. For multiple proton transfer processes, there are two types of mechanisms: stepwise transfer and concerted transfer. The Bell–Limbach model provides a simple theory to determine whether the proton transfer mechanism is stepwise or concerted from KIEs. Recent scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) experiments have studied the proton switching process in water tetramers on NaCl(001). Theoretical studies predict that this process occurs via a concerted mechanism; however, the experimental KIEs resemble the Bell–Limbach model for stepwise tunneling, raising questions on the underlying mechanism or the validity of the model. We study this system using ab initio instanton theory, and in addition to thermal rates, we also considered microcanonical rates, as well as tunneling splittings. The instanton theory predicts a concerted mechanism, and the KIEs for tunneling rates (both thermal and microcanonical) upon deuteration are consistent with the Bell–Limbach model for concerted tunneling but could not explain the experiments. For tunneling splittings, partial and full deuteration change the size of it in a similar fashion to how they change the rates. We further examined the Bell–Limbach model in another system, porphycene, which has both stepwise and concerted tunneling pathways. The KIEs predicted by instanton theory are again consistent with the Bell–Limbach model. This study highlights differences between KIEs in stepwise and concerted tunneling and the discrepancy between theory and recent STM experiments. New theory/experiments are desired to settle this problem.},

We show how the novel spin-unpaired donor–acceptor interactions lead to weakened bonding in the supramolecular domain of polyradical (ClO 2 ) n homoclusters and aqueous ClO 2 (H 2 O) n heteroclusters. Despite feeble binding energies and large inter-radical separations, the polyradical clusters are found to maintain coherent spin patterns in each cluster component, attesting to the quantal donor–acceptor nature of their interactions and the cooperative and anticooperative couplings that govern intra- and intermolecular spin distributions in such spin-clusters.},

  abstract = {The conformational landscape of myrtenol (2-pinen-10-ol) and its robustness upon hydration were investigated theoretically and experimentally by employing a synergic combination of quantum chemical calculations and Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy coupled to a supersonic jet expansion. Relaxed potential energy surfaces have been carried out, and the lowest energy conformers of the monomer were found to be associated with different geometries of the hydroxymethyl group from those previously reported [Sedo et al. , J. Mol. Spectrosc. 356 , 32 (2019)]. Geometry optimizations and harmonic vibrational frequency calculations allowed characterization of the equilibrium structure of the possible conformers of myrtenol. Among the nine predicted structures, four have been observed, analyzed, and identified. The controversy on the geometry was solved with the deuteration of the hydroxyl group, which led to the determination of substitution ( r s ) geometry, in agreement with the present theoretical results. Interestingly, the four observed conformers exhibit the same orientation of OH as in the allyl alcohol molecule. Furthermore, hydrogen bonding linking myrtenol to water was studied. One monohydrate has been observed and identified. Non-covalent interactions and natural bond orbital analysis were performed to depict the interactions responsible for the stabilization of the observed structure. We conclude that the structure of the hydroxymethyl group is robust and does not change upon hydration.},

  abstract = {Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance can be enhanced using unpaired electron spins with a method known as dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP). Fundamentally, DNP involves ensembles of thousands of spins, a scale that is difficult to match computationally. This scale prevents us from gaining a complete understanding of the spin dynamics and applying simulations to design sample formulations. We recently developed an ab initio model capable of calculating DNP enhancements in systems of up to ∼1000 nuclei; however, this scale is insufficient to accurately simulate the dependence of DNP enhancements on radical concentration or magic angle spinning (MAS) frequency. We build on this work by using ab initio simulations to train a hybrid model that makes use of a rate matrix to treat nuclear spin diffusion. We show that this model can reproduce the MAS rate and concentration dependence of DNP enhancements and build-up time constants. We then apply it to predict the DNP enhancements in core–shell metal-organic-framework nanoparticles and reveal new insights into the composition of the particles’ shells.},

Although the DFT/TDDFT methods are widely used, the electronic structures of molecules, especially large molecules, calculated with these methods are known to be strongly dependent on the functionals and the parameters used in the functionals. Here, we optimize the range-separated parameter, μ , of the CAM-B3LYP functional of Chl a and Chl b to reproduce the experimental excitation energy differences of these Chl molecules in solution. The optimal values of μ for Chl a and Chl b are smaller than the default value of μ and that for bacteriochlorophyll a , indicating the change in the electronic distribution, i.e., an increase in electron delocalization, within the molecule. We find that the electronic distribution of Chl b with an extra formyl group is different from that of Chl a . We also find that the polarity of the solution and hydrogen bond cause the decrease in the excitation energies and the increase in the widths of excitation energy distributions of Chl a and Chl b . The present results are expected to be useful for understanding the electronic properties of each pigment molecule in a local heterogeneous environment, which will play an important role in the excitation energy transfer in light-harvesting complex II.},

  abstract = {Nanoscale infrared (IR) resonators with sub-diffraction limited mode volumes and open geometries have emerged as new platforms for implementing cavity quantum electrodynamics at room temperature. The use of IR nanoantennas and tip nanoprobes to study strong light–matter coupling of molecular vibrations with the vacuum field can be exploited for IR quantum control with nanometer spatial and femtosecond temporal resolution. In order to advance the development of molecule-based quantum nanophotonics in the mid-IR, we propose a generally applicable semi-empirical methodology based on quantum optics to describe light–matter interaction in systems driven by mid-IR femtosecond laser pulses. The theory is shown to reproduce recent experiments on the acceleration of the vibrational relaxation rate in infrared nanostructures. It also provides physical insights on the implementation of coherent phase rotations of the near-field using broadband nanotips. We then apply the quantum framework to develop general tip-design rules for the experimental manipulation of vibrational strong coupling and Fano interference effects in open infrared resonators. We finally propose the possibility of transferring the natural anharmonicity of molecular vibrational levels to the resonator near-field in the weak coupling regime to implement intensity-dependent phase shifts of the coupled system response with strong pulses and develop a vibrational chirping model to understand the effect. The semi-empirical quantum theory is equivalent to first-principles techniques based on Maxwell’s equations, but its lower computational cost suggests its use as a rapid design tool for the development of strongly coupled infrared nanophotonic hardware for applications ranging from quantum control of materials to quantum information processing.},

The optimized mean trajectory (OMT) approximation allows the calculation of spectroscopic response functions from trajectories produced by the classical limit of a mapping Hamiltonian that includes physical nuclear degrees of freedom and other effective degrees of freedom representing discrete vibronic states. Here, we develop a thermofield OMT (TF-OMT) approach in which the OMT procedure is applied to a temperature-dependent classical Hamiltonian determined from the thermofield-transformed quantum mapping Hamiltonian. Initial conditions for bath nuclear degrees of freedom are sampled from a zero-temperature distribution. Calculations of two-dimensional electronic spectra and two-dimensional vibrational–electronic spectra are performed for models that include excitonically coupled electronic states. The TF-OMT calculations agree very closely with the corresponding OMT results, which, in turn, represent well benchmark calculations with the hierarchical equations of motion method.},

  abstract = {Machine learning models for the potential energy of multi-atomic systems, such as the deep potential (DP) model, make molecular simulations with the accuracy of quantum mechanical density functional theory possible at a cost only moderately higher than that of empirical force fields. However, the majority of these models lack explicit long-range interactions and fail to describe properties that derive from the Coulombic tail of the forces. To overcome this limitation, we extend the DP model by approximating the long-range electrostatic interaction between ions (nuclei + core electrons) and valence electrons with that of distributions of spherical Gaussian charges located at ionic and electronic sites. The latter are rigorously defined in terms of the centers of the maximally localized Wannier distributions, whose dependence on the local atomic environment is modeled accurately by a deep neural network. In the DP long-range (DPLR) model, the electrostatic energy of the Gaussian charge system is added to short-range interactions that are represented as in the standard DP model. The resulting potential energy surface is smooth and possesses analytical forces and virial. Missing effects in the standard DP scheme are recovered, improving on accuracy and predictive power. By including long-range electrostatics, DPLR correctly extrapolates to large systems the potential energy surface learned from quantum mechanical calculations on smaller systems. We illustrate the approach with three examples: the potential energy profile of the water dimer, the free energy of interaction of a water molecule with a liquid water slab, and the phonon dispersion curves of the NaCl crystal.},

From our results and analyses, in the lowest energy configurations, CO 2 binds via a chemisorption mechanism on Fe, Co, Ni, Ru, Rh, Pd, Os, Ir, and Pt (adsorption energy from −0.49 eV on Pt up to −1.40 eV on Os), where CO 2 breaks its linearity and adopts an angular configuration due to the charge transfer from the clusters toward the C atom in the adsorbed CO 2 . In contrast, it binds via physisorption on Cu, Ag, and Au and maintains its linearity due to a negligible charge transfer toward CO 2 and has a small adsorption energy (from −0.17 eV on Cu up to −0.18 eV on Ag). There is an energetic preference for twofold bridge TM sites, which favors binding of C with two TM atoms, which enhances the charge transfer ten times than on the top TM sites (onefold). We identified that the strength of the CO 2 –TM 8 interaction increases when the energy values of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the TM 8 are closer to the energy values of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital of CO 2 , which contributes to maximize the charge transfer toward the molecule. Beyond the energy position of the HOMO states, the delocalization of 5 d orbitals plays an important role in the adsorption strength in TM, especially for the iron group, e.g., the adsorption energies are −1.08 eV (Fe, 3 d ), −1.19 eV (Ru, 4 d ), and −1.40 eV (Os, 5 d ).},

  abstract = {An accurate description of the electron correlation energy in closed- and open-shell molecules is shown to be obtained by a second-order perturbation theory (PT) termed REMP. REMP is a hybrid of the Retaining the Excitation degree (RE) and the Møller–Plesset (MP) PTs. It performs particularly encouragingly in an orbital-optimized variant (OO-REMP) where the reference wavefunction is given by an unrestricted Slater determinant whose spin orbitals are varied such that the total energy becomes a minimum. While the approach generally behaves less satisfactorily with unrestricted Hartree–Fock references, reasonable performance is observed for restricted Hartree–Fock and restricted open-shell Hartree–Fock references. Inclusion of single excitations to OO-REMP is investigated and found—as in similar investigations—to be dissatisfying as it deteriorates performance. For the non-multireference subset of the accurate W4-11 benchmark set of Karton et al. [Chem. Phys. Lett. 510 , 165–178 (2011)], OO-REMP predicts most atomization and reaction energies with chemical accuracy (1 kcal mol −1 ) if complete-basis-set extrapolation with augmented and core-polarized basis sets is used. For the W4-11 related test-sets, the error estimates obtained with the OO-REMP method approach those of coupled-cluster with singles, doubles and perturbative triples [CCSD(T)] within 20\%–35\%. The best performance of OO-REMP is found for a mixing ratio of 20\%:80\% MP:RE, which is essentially independent of whether radical stabilization energies, barrier heights, or reaction energies are investigated. Orbital optimization is shown to improve the REMP approach for both closed and open shell cases and outperforms coupled-cluster theory with singles and doubles (CCSD), spin-component scaled Møller-Plesset theory at second order (SCS-MP2), and density functionals, including double hybrids in all the cases considered.},

  abstract = {High-quality lattice resonances in arrays of infrared antennas operating in an open-cavity regime form polariton states by means of strong coupling to molecular vibrations. We studied polaritons formed by carbonyl stretching modes of (poly)methyl methacrylate on resonant antenna arrays using femtosecond 2DIR spectroscopy. At a normal incidence of excitation light, doubly degenerate antenna-lattice resonances (ALRs) form two polariton states: a lower polariton and an upper polariton. At an off-normal incidence geometry of 2DIR experiments, the ALR degeneracy is lifted and, consequently, the polariton energies are split. We spectrally resolved and tracked the time-dependent evolution of a cross-peak signal associated with the excitation of reservoir states and the unidirectional transfer of the excess energy to lower polaritons. Bi-exponential decay of the cross-peak suggests that a reversible energy exchange between the bright and dark lower polaritons occurs with a characteristic transfer time of ∼200 fs. The cross-peak signal further decays within ∼800 fs, which is consistent with the relaxation time of the carbonyl stretching vibration and with the dephasing time of the ALR. An increase in the excitation pulse intensity leads to saturation of the cross-peak amplitude and a modification of the relaxation dynamics. Using quantum-mechanical modeling, we found that the kinetic scheme that captures all the experimental observations implies that only the bright lower polariton accepts the energy from the reservoir, suggesting that transfer occurs via a mechanism involving dipole–dipole interaction. An efficient reservoir-to-polariton transfer can play an important role in developing novel room-temperature quantum optical devices in the mid-infrared wavelength region.},

This work presents a method for studying cholesteric phases in the highly successful self-consistent field theory of worm-like chains, offering a new way of studying many biologically relevant molecules. The method involves an effective Hamiltonian with a chiral term inspired by the Oseen–Frank (OF) model of liquid crystals. This method is then used to examine the formation of cholesteric phases in chiral-nematic worm-like chains as a function of polymer flexibility, as well as the optimal cholesteric pitch and distribution of polymer segment orientations. Our approach not only allows for the determination of the isotropic–cholesteric transition and segment distributions, beyond what the OF model promises, but also explicitly incorporates polymer flexibility into the study of the cholesteric phase, offering a more complete understanding of the behavior of semiflexible chiral-nematic polymers.},

By employing novel crystal-avoiding simulations, metastable equilibrium dynamics is probed in the absence of complications associated with size polydispersity. Based on a highly accurate structural input from integral equation theory, ECNLE theory is found to describe well the simulated density and temperature dependences of the alpha relaxation time of atomic fluids using a single system-specific parameter, a c , that reflects the nonuniversal relative importance of local cage and collective elastic barriers. For polymer fluids, the explicit dynamical effect of local chain connectivity is modeled at the fundamental dynamic free energy trajectory level based on a different parameter, N c , that quantifies the degree of intramolecular correlation of bonded segment activated barrier hopping. For the flexible chain model studied, a physically intuitive value of N c ≈ 2 results in good agreement between simulation and theory. A direct comparison between atomic and polymeric systems reveals that chain connectivity can speed up activated segmental relaxation due to weakening of equilibrium packing correlations but can slow down relaxation due to local bonding constraints. The empirical thermodynamic scaling idea for the alpha time is found to work well at high densities or temperatures but fails when both density and temperature are low. The rich and subtle behaviors revealed from simulation for atomic and polymeric WCA fluids are all well captured by ECNLE theory.},

We demonstrate the state-of-the-art accuracy, high efficiency, scalability, and universality of this package by learning not only energies (with or without forces) but also dipole moment vectors and polarizability tensors in various molecular, reactive, and periodic systems. An interface between a trained model and LAMMPs is provided for large scale molecular dynamics simulations.

  abstract = {Monolayer and two-dimensional (2D) systems exhibit rich phase behavior, compared with 3D systems, in particular, due to the hexatic phase playing a central role in melting scenarios. The attraction range is known to affect critical gas–liquid behavior (liquid–liquid in protein and colloidal systems), but the effect of attraction on melting in 2D systems remains unstudied systematically. Here, we have revealed how the attraction range affects the phase diagrams and melting scenarios in a 2D system. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we have considered the generalized Lennard-Jones system with a fixed repulsion branch and different power indices of attraction from long-range dipolar to short-range sticky-sphere-like. A drop in the attraction range has been found to reduce the temperature of the gas–liquid critical point, bringing it closer to the gas–liquid–solid triple point. At high temperatures, attraction does not affect the melting scenario that proceeds through the cascade of solid–hexatic (Berezinskii–Kosterlitz–Thouless) and hexatic–liquid (first-order) phase transitions. In the case of dipolar attraction, we have observed two triple points inherent in a 2D system: hexatic–liquid–gas and crystal–hexatic–gas, the temperature of the crystal–hexatic–gas triple point is below the hexatic–liquid–gas triple point. This observation may have far-reaching consequences for future studies, since phase diagrams determine possible routes of self-assembly in molecular, protein, and colloidal systems, whereas the attraction range can be adjusted with complex solvents and external electric or magnetic fields. The results obtained may be widely used in condensed matter, chemical physics, materials science, and soft matter.},

We show that strong coupling of the picocavity vacua with a specific vibronic sideband in the molecular emission spectrum results in a significant variation of the effective refractive index of the metamaterial relative to a molecule-free scenario due to a vacuum-induced Autler–Townes effect. For a realistic molecular disorder model, we demonstrate that cross-phase modulation of optical fields as weak as 10 kW/cm 2 is feasible using dilute ensembles of molecular picocavities at room temperature, provided that the confined vacuum is not resonantly driven by the external probe field.

We extract the position and intensity of individual peaks corresponding to either intra- or inter-molecular vibrational modes and examine their dependence on the electrode potential. The observed trends suggest that the molecular reconfiguration mechanism is distinct between cations and anions. BMPy + is found to always adsorb on the Au electrode surface via the pyrrolidinium ring while the alkyl chains strongly change their orientation at different potentials. In contrast, TFSI − is observed to have pronounced position shifts but negligible orientation changes as we sweep the electrode potential.

The origin of these signatures, their fate far from equilibrium and at high temperatures, and the underlying nature of the glassy “state” far from equilibrium remain unsettled. Here, we simulate physical aging of polymeric glasses, driven much farther from equilibrium and at much higher temperatures than possible in experimental melt-quenched glasses. While these glasses exhibit Kovacs’ signatures of glassy aging at sufficiently low temperatures, these signatures disappear above the onset T A of non-Arrhenius equilibrium dynamics, suggesting that T A demarcates an upper bound to genuinely glassy states. Aging times in glasses after temperature up-jumps are found to obey an Arrhenius law interpolating between equilibrium dynamics at T A and at the start of the temperature up-jump, providing a zero-parameter rule predicting their aging behavior and identifying another unrecognized centrality of T A to aging behavior. This differs qualitatively from behavior of our glasses produced by temperature down-jumps, which exhibit a fractional power law decoupling relation with equilibrium dynamics. While the Tool–Narayanaswamy–Moynihan model can predict the qualitative single-temperature behavior of these systems, we find that it fails to predict the disappearance of Kovacs signatures above T A and the temperature dependence of aging after large temperature up-jumps. These findings highlight a need for new theoretical insights into the aging behavior of glasses at ultra-high fictive temperatures and far from equilibrium.},

We decompose translational diffusion into components along and orthogonal to the long axis of the molecule. Rotational diffusion is decomposed into tumbling and spinning motions about this axis. Our analysis yields four corresponding diffusion coefficients which are related to diagonal entries in the complete 6 × 6 diffusion tensor accounting for the three rotational and three translational degrees of freedom and for the potential coupling between them. However, coupling between different degrees of freedom is expected to be minimal for a natural choice of the molecular body-fixed axis, so then off-diagonal entries in the tensor are negligible. This expectation is supported by a hydrodynamic analysis of the diffusion tensor which treats the liquid surrounding the molecule being tracked as a viscous continuum. Thus, the EFP MD analysis provides a comprehensive characterization of diffusion and also reveals expected shortcomings of the hydrodynamic treatment, particularly for rotational diffusion, when applied to neat liquids.},

After quenching below the liquid–liquid critical point, the ST2 model spontaneously separates into low-density liquid (LDL) and high-density liquid phases, respectively. The LDL phase, which is characterized by lower molecular mobility and enhanced structural order, fosters the formation of a sub-critical ice nucleus that, after a stabilization time, develops into the critical nucleus and grows. Polymorphic selection coincides with the development of the sub-critical nucleus and favors the formation of cubic (Ic) over hexagonal (Ih) ice. We rationalize polymorphic selection in terms of geometric arguments based on differences in the symmetry of second neighbor shells of ice Ic and Ih, which are posited to favor formation of the former. The rapidly growing critical nucleus absorbs both Ic and Ih crystallites dispersed in the liquid phase, a crystal with stacking faults. Our results are consistent with, and expand upon, recent observations of non-classical nucleation pathways in several systems.},

  abstract = {Magnesium plays a vital role in a large variety of biological processes. To model such processes by molecular dynamics simulations, researchers rely on accurate force field parameters for Mg 2+ and water. OPC is one of the most promising water models yielding an improved description of biomolecules in water. The aim of this work is to provide force field parameters for Mg 2+ that lead to accurate simulation results in combination with OPC water. Using 12 different Mg 2+ parameter sets that were previously optimized with different water models, we systematically assess the transferability to OPC based on a large variety of experimental properties. The results show that the Mg 2+ parameters for SPC/E are transferable to OPC and closely reproduce the experimental solvation free energy, radius of the first hydration shell, coordination number, activity derivative, and binding affinity toward the phosphate oxygens on RNA. Two optimal parameter sets are presented: MicroMg yields water exchange in OPC on the microsecond timescale in agreement with experiments. NanoMg yields accelerated exchange on the nanosecond timescale and facilitates the direct observation of ion binding events for enhanced sampling purposes.},

Our results demonstrate that chemi-ionization is strongly suppressed (enhanced) for non-spin-conserving (spin-conserving) collisions at thermal energies. These findings are in good agreement with a model based on spin angular momentum coupling of the prepared atomic states to the quasi-molecular states. Small deviations from the model indicate the contribution of the 4 Σ + channel to the reaction rate, which is in violation of spin conservation.},

Herein, we describe a ML workflow to predict ee of an important class of catalytic asymmetric transformation, namely, the relay Heck (RH) reaction. A random forest ML model, built using quantum chemically derived mechanistically relevant physical organic descriptors as features, is found to predict the ee remarkably well with a low root mean square error of 8.0 ± 1.3. Importantly, the model is effective in predicting the unseen variants of an asymmetric RH reaction. Furthermore, we predicted the ee for thousands of unexplored complementary reactions, including those leading to a good number of bioactive frameworks, by engaging different combinations of catalysts and substrates drawn from the original dataset. Our ML model developed on the available examples would be able to assist in exploiting the fuller potential of asymmetric RH reactions through a priori predictions before the actual experimentation, which would thus help surpass the trial and error loop to a larger degree.},

In addition to the profound effect of cluster size on activity and with Cu 4 outstanding from the studied series, Cu 4 clusters supported on SiO 2 provide an example of tuning selectivity through support effects when this particular catalyst also produces cyclohexadiene with about 30\% selectivity. Titania-supported Cu 5 and Cu 7 clusters supported on TiO 2 produce a high fraction of cyclohexadiene in contrast to their neighbors, while Cu 4 and Cu 6 solely produce benzene without any combustion, thus representing odd–even oscillation of selectivity with the number of atoms in the cluster.},

  abstract = {Direct frequency comb spectroscopy was utilized to measure the vibrational absorption spectrum of diiodomethane, CH 2 I 2 , from 2960 to 3125 cm −1 . The data were obtained using a CH 2 I 2 concentration of (6.8 ± 1.3) × 10 15 molecule cm −3 and a total pressure of 10–300 mbar with either nitrogen or argon as the bath gas. The rovibrational spectra of two fundamental transitions, ν 6 and ν 1 , were recorded and analyzed. We suggest that a significant contribution to the observed congested spectra is due to the population in excited vibrational states of the low energy ν 4 I–C–I bend, resulting in transitions 6 1 0 4 n n and 1 1 0 4 n n , where the integer n is the initial vibrational level v = 1–5. PGOPHER was used to fit the experimental spectrum, allowing for rotational constants and other spectral information to be reported. In addition, it was found that the peak widths for the observed transitions were limited by pressure broadening, resulting in a pressure broadening parameter of (0.143 ± 0.006) cm −1 atm −1 by N 2 and (0.116 ± 0.006) cm −1 atm −1 by Ar.

First, we show some problems that emerge when analyzing the experimental data with the classical formulation, which does not distinguish between free and trapped carriers and hence only gives average quantities for the transport parameters. We show that using a more general framework, taking into account the multiple trapping of carriers within a density of localized states, allows for an accurate description. Since it includes the density of states (DOS) of the material, it enables the possibility to test different DOS models proposed in the past for halide perovskite thin films. We check whether these models give rise to the type of curves we have measured under different experimental conditions. Finally, we propose a new model for the DOS in the forbidden gap, which results in the best fit found for the measurements performed. This allows us to give ranges of values for the parameters that define the DOS, which, as far as we know, are given for the first time.},

We illustrate this fact through the analysis of the Jarzynski equality (JE), whose derivation for Hamiltonian systems suggests that the equilibrium free-energy variations can be computational or experimentally determined in almost any kind of non-equilibrium processes. This apparent generality is surprising in a mechanical theory. Analytically, we show that the quantity called “work” in the Hamiltonian derivation of the JE is neither a thermodynamic quantity nor mechanical work, except in special circumstances to be singularly assessed. Through molecular dynamics simulations of elastic and plastic deformations induced via nano-indentation of crystalline surfaces that fall within the formal framework of the JE, we illustrate that the JE cannot be verified and that the results of this verification are process dependent.},

  abstract = {The emission of an Auger electron is the predominant relaxation mechanism of core-vacant states in molecules composed of light nuclei. In this non-radiative decay process, one valence electron fills the core vacancy, while a second valence electron is emitted into the ionization continuum. Because of this coupling to the continuum, core-vacant states represent electronic resonances that can be tackled with standard quantum-chemical methods only if they are approximated as bound states, meaning that Auger decay is neglected. Here, we present an approach to compute Auger decay rates of core-vacant states from coupled-cluster and equation-of-motion coupled-cluster wave functions combined with complex scaling of the Hamiltonian or, alternatively, complex-scaled basis functions. Through energy decomposition analysis, we illustrate how complex-scaled methods are capable of describing the coupling to the ionization continuum without the need to model the wave function of the Auger electron explicitly. In addition, we introduce in this work several approaches for the determination of partial decay widths and Auger branching ratios from complex-scaled coupled-cluster wave functions. We demonstrate the capabilities of our new approach by computations on core-ionized states of neon, water, dinitrogen, and benzene. Coupled-cluster and equation-of-motion coupled-cluster theory in the singles and doubles approximation both deliver excellent results for total decay widths, whereas we find partial widths more straightforward to evaluate with the former method.},

The resulting mixed deterministic–stochastic BCMF algorithm (BCMF-ws) is benchmarked in a series of standard scattering problems with potential wells on the excited-state surfaces, which are common in realistic systems. In all investigated cases, BCMF-ws holds the same high accuracy while the computational time is reduced about two orders of magnitude compared to the original BCMF-w and BCMF-s algorithms, thus promising for nonadiabatic dynamics simulations of general systems.},

  abstract = {Hydrogen tunneling plays a critical role in many biologically and chemically important processes. The nuclear–electronic orbital multistate density functional theory (NEO-MSDFT) method was developed to describe hydrogen transfer systems. In this approach, the transferring proton is treated quantum mechanically on the same level as the electrons within multicomponent DFT, and a nonorthogonal configuration interaction scheme is used to produce delocalized vibronic states from localized vibronic states. The NEO-MSDFT method has been shown to provide accurate hydrogen tunneling splittings for fixed molecular systems. Herein, the NEO-MSDFT analytical gradients for both ground and excited vibronic states are derived and implemented. The analytical gradients and semi-numerical Hessians are used to optimize and characterize equilibrium and transition state geometries and to generate minimum energy paths (MEPs), for proton transfer in the deprotonated acetylene dimer and malonaldehyde. The barriers along the resulting MEPs are lower when the transferring proton is quantized because the NEO-MSDFT method inherently includes the zero-point energy of the transferring proton. Analysis of the proton densities along the MEPs illustrates that the proton density can exhibit symmetric or asymmetric bilobal character associated with symmetric or slightly asymmetric double-well potential energy surfaces and hydrogen tunneling. Analysis of the contributions to the intrinsic reaction coordinate reveals that changes in the C–O bond lengths drive proton transfer in malonaldehyde. This work provides the foundation for future reaction path studies and direct nonadiabatic dynamics simulations of a wide range of hydrogen transfer reactions.},

Specifically, we proposed the covalent basis vector framework to define the permanent multipoles and derived closed-form energy and force expressions to facilitate an efficient implementation of pGM electrostatics. In this study, we move forward to derive the pGM internal stress tensor for constant pressure MD simulations with the pGM electrostatics. Three different formulations are presented for the flexible, rigid, and short-range screened systems, respectively. The analytical formulations were implemented in the SANDER program in the Amber package and were first validated with the finite-difference method for two different boxes of pGM water molecules. This is followed by a constant temperature and constant pressure MD simulation for a box of 512 pGM water molecules. Our results show that the simulation system stabilized at a physically reasonable state and maintained the balance with the externally applied pressure. In addition, several fundamental differences were observed between the pGM and classic point charge models in terms of the simulation behaviors, indicating more extensive parameterization is necessary to utilize the pGM electrostatics.},

  abstract = {Ergodicity (or at least the tantalizing promise of it) is a core animating principle of molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations: Put simply, sample for long enough (in time), and you will make representative visits to states of a system all throughout phase space, consistent with the desired statistical ensemble. However, one is not guaranteed a priori that the chosen window of sampling in a production run is sufficiently long to avoid problematically non-ergodic observations; one is also not guaranteed that successive measurements of an observable are statistically independent of each other. In this paper, we investigate several particularly striking and troublesome examples of statistical correlations in MD simulations of nanoconfined fluids, which have profound implications on the quantification of uncertainty for transport phenomena in these systems. In particular, we show that these correlations can lead to confidence intervals on the fluid self-diffusion coefficient that are dramatically overconfident and estimates of this transport quantity that are simply inaccurate. We propose a simple approach—based on the thermally accelerated decorrelation of fluid positions and momenta—that ameliorates these issues and improves our confidence in MD measurements of nanoconfined fluid transport properties. We demonstrate that the formation of faithful confidence intervals for measurements of self-diffusion under nanoscale confinement typically requires at least 20 statistically independent samples, and potentially more depending on the sampling technique used.},

  abstract = {The intermediate Hamiltonian Fock-space coupled-cluster methods at the singles and doubles level (IHFSCCSD) for excitation energies in the (1p, 1h) sector, double ionization potentials in the (0p, 2h) sector, and double electron attachments in the (2p, 0h) sector of the Fock space are implemented based on the CCSD method with spin–orbit coupling (SOC) included in the post-Hartree–Fock treatment using a closed-shell reference in this work. The active space is chosen to contain those orbitals that have the largest contribution to principal ionized or electron-attached states obtained from the equation-of-motion coupled-cluster calculations. Both time-reversal symmetry and spatial symmetry are exploited in the implementation. Our results show that the accuracy of IHFSCCSD results is closely related to the active space, and the sufficiency of the active space can be assessed from the percentage of transitions within the active space. In addition, unreasonable results may be encountered when the ionized or electron-attached states with a somewhat larger contribution from double excitations are included to determine the active space and cluster operators in the (0p, 1h) or (1p, 0h) sector of the Fock space. A larger active space may be required to describe SO splitting reliably than that in the scalar-relativistic calculations in some cases. The IHFSCCSD method with SOC developed in this work can provide reliable results for heavy-element systems when a sufficient active space built upon the principal ionization potential/electron affinity states is adopted.},

  abstract = {Quantifying charge-state transition energy levels of impurities in semiconductors is critical to understanding and engineering their optoelectronic properties for applications ranging from solar photovoltaics to infrared lasers. While these transition levels can be measured and calculated accurately, such efforts are time-consuming and more rapid prediction methods would be beneficial. Here, we significantly reduce the time typically required to predict impurity transition levels using multi-fidelity datasets and a machine learning approach employing features based on elemental properties and impurity positions. We use transition levels obtained from low-fidelity (i.e., local-density approximation or generalized gradient approximation) density functional theory (DFT) calculations, corrected using a recently proposed modified band alignment scheme, which well-approximates transition levels from high-fidelity DFT (i.e., hybrid HSE06). The model fit to the large multi-fidelity database shows improved accuracy compared to the models trained on the more limited high-fidelity values. Crucially, in our approach, when using the multi-fidelity data, high-fidelity values are not required for model training, significantly reducing the computational cost required for training the model. Our machine learning model of transition levels has a root mean squared (mean absolute) error of 0.36 (0.27) eV vs high-fidelity hybrid functional values when averaged over 14 semiconductor systems from the II–VI and III–V families. As a guide for use on other systems, we assessed the model on simulated data to show the expected accuracy level as a function of bandgap for new materials of interest. Finally, we use the model to predict a complete space of impurity charge-state transition levels in all zinc blende III–V and II–VI systems.},

Very few CC methods are designed to provide a confidence level on their predictions, and most users still rely improperly on the mean absolute error as an accuracy metric. The development of reliable UQ methods is essential, notably for CC to be used confidently in industrial processes. A review of the CC-UQ literature shows that there is no common standard procedure to report or validate prediction uncertainty. I consider here analysis tools using concepts (calibration and sharpness) developed in meteorology and machine learning for the validation of probabilistic forecasters. These tools are adapted to CC-UQ and applied to datasets of prediction uncertainties provided by composite methods, Bayesian ensembles methods, and machine learning and a posteriori statistical methods.},

  abstract = {Many crystal structure prediction protocols only concern themselves with the electronic energy of molecular crystals. However, vibrational contributions to the free energy ( F vib ) can be significant in determining accurate stability rankings for crystal candidates. While force-field studies have been conducted to gauge the magnitude of these free-energy corrections, highly accurate results from quantum mechanical methods, such as density-functional theory (DFT), are desirable. Here, we introduce the PV17 set of 17 polymorphic pairs of organic molecular crystals, for which plane wave DFT is used to calculate the vibrational free energies and free-energy differences (Δ F vib ) between each pair. Our DFT results confirm that the vibrational free-energy corrections are small, having a mean value of 1.0 kJ/mol and a maximum value of 2.3 kJ/mol for the PV17 set. Furthermore, we assess the accuracy of a series of lower-cost DFT, semi-empirical, and force-field models for computing Δ F vib that have been proposed in the literature. It is found that calculating F vib using the Γ-point frequencies does not provide Δ F vib values of sufficiently high quality. In addition, Δ F vib values calculated using various approximate methods have mean absolute errors relative to our converged DFT results of equivalent or larger magnitude than the vibrational free-energy corrections themselves. Thus, we conclude that, in a crystal structure prediction protocol, it is preferable to forego the inclusion of vibrational free-energy corrections than to estimate them with any of the approximate methods considered here.},

To perform a multireference perturbation theory with large active space of molecular aggregates, an efficient low-rank approximation is applied to the complete active space self-consistent field reference functions. It is known that kinetic rates of electron-exchange processes, such as singlet fission, triplet–triplet annihilation, and triplet exciton transfer, are not sufficiently explained by the direct term of the diabatic couplings but efficiently mediated by the low-lying charge transfer states if the two molecules are in close proximity. It is presented in this paper, however, that regardless of the distance of the molecules, the direct term is considerably underestimated by up to three orders of magnitude without the dynamical electron correlation, i.e., the diabatic states expressed in the active space are not adequate to quantitatively reproduce the electron-exchange processes.},

Most current MLPs rely on atomic energy contributions given as a function of the local chemical environments. Frequently, in addition to total energies, atomic forces are also used to construct the potentials, as they provide detailed local information about the PES. Since many systems are too large for electronic structure calculations, obtaining reliable reference forces from smaller subsystems, such as molecular fragments or clusters, can substantially simplify the construction of the training sets. Here, we propose a method to determine structurally converged molecular fragments, providing reliable atomic forces based on an analysis of the Hessian. The method, which serves as a locality test and allows us to estimate the importance of long-range interactions, is illustrated for a series of molecular model systems and the metal–organic framework MOF-5 as an example for a complex organic–inorganic hybrid material.},

  abstract = {For chemical reactions that occur via the rearrangement of atoms from a configuration about one minimum (reactant, R) of the potential energy surface (PES) to a configuration about another minimum (product, P), an exact relation between the Helmholtz reaction free energy (Δ F RP ) and the free-energy profile (FEP) can be derived. Since the FEP assumes a form similar to that of the PES along the minimum energy path between R and P, there is an unfortunate tendency to regard the FEP as the “free-energy” analog of the minimum energy path and consequently to equate Δ F RP to the difference between the values of the FEP at the minima corresponding to R and P. Analytic treatments of one- and two-dimensional models are presented that show how this mistaken idea leads to errors. In effect, treating the FEP by analogy with the minimum energy path neglects the role of entropy. The FEP is a function of a collective variable (CV), which must be chosen to describe the course of the rearrangement consistently with the exact relation between Δ F RP and the FEP. For large systems of common interest, the PES is often so complex that a straightforward way of choosing a CV is lacking. Consequently, one is forced to make an educated guess. A criterion for judging the quality of the guess is proposed and applied to a two-dimensional model.},

Multipole decomposition is widely used to analyze the role of the multipoles in the resonance excitations, radiation, and scattering of electromagnetic waves. However, previous studies have not addressed the validity and accuracy of the multipole decomposition around the lattice resonance. The applicability of the exact multipole decomposition based on spherical harmonics expansion has not been demonstrated around the lattice resonance with the strong multipole coupling. This work studies the two-dimensional periodic arrays of both plasmonic and dielectric nanospheres and compares the multipole decomposition results with the analytic ones around their lattice resonances. We study both the effective polarizabilities of multipoles and the scattering spectra of the structures. The analytical results are calculated from the coupled dipole–quadrupole model. This study demonstrates that the exact multipole decomposition agrees well with the numerical simulation around lattice resonances. Only a small number of multipoles are required to represent the results accurately.},

This atomic-level variability is central to the unique properties of these alloys but makes their modeling challenging. We combine atomistic simulations using many body potentials with machine learning to develop predictive models of various atomic properties of CrFeCoNiCu-based CCAs: relaxed vacancy formation energy, atomic-level cohesive energy, pressure, and volume. A fingerprint of the local atomic environments is obtained combining invariants associated with the local atomic geometry and periodic-table information of the atoms involved. Importantly, all descriptors are based on the unrelaxed atomic structure; thus, they are computationally inexpensive to compute. This enables the incorporation of these models into macroscopic simulations. The models show good accuracy and we explore their ability to extrapolate to compositions and elements not used during training.},

  abstract = {The insulin hormone is stored in the hexameric form and dissociates to the dimeric form and finally to the active monomeric form. When insulin secretion is impaired, thereby affecting various metabolic processes, as a final response, insulin analogs are subcutaneously injected before meals to facilitate glucose metabolism. Depending on the molecular details, analogs are rapid or slow acting based on the dissociation rate of the dimer to monomer. Insulin aspart is a recombinant human insulin analog, acting faster than regular human insulin. Despite its practical and elementary importance, the process of insulin aspart dimer dissociation is relatively unknown. Here, we combined molecular dynamics simulations and umbrella sampling to characterize the energetic and structural features of dissociation of the insulin aspart dimer. Like previous studies on human insulin (another well studied analog), insulin aspart can also display a wide spectrum of pathways for dimer dissociation from dissociation happening without a major change in the monomer structure to dissociation that is coupled with unfolding of a protein. Additionally, water plays a vital role in the dissociation of the insulin aspart by stabilizing the monomers in the dissociated state. Our study shows the molecular details, such as the variation in the structure and orientation and conformational changes along the minimum energy pathways in the process of dissociation of the insulin aspart dimer.},

  abstract = {Azido-modified alanine residues (AlaN 3 ) are environment-sensitive, minimally invasive infrared probes for the site-specific investigation of protein structure and dynamics. Here, the capability of the label is investigated to query whether or not a ligand is bound to the active site of lysozyme and how the spectroscopy and dynamics change upon ligand binding. The results demonstrate specific differences for center frequencies of the asymmetric azide stretch vibration, the longtime decay, and the static offset of the frequency fluctuation correlation function (FFCF)—all of which are experimental observables—between the ligand-free and the ligand-bound N 3 -labeled protein. The center-frequency shifts range from 1 to 8 cm −1 , which is detectable from state-of-the art experiments. Similarly, the nonvanishing static component Δ 0 of the FFCF between ligand-free and ligand-bound protein can differ by up to a factor of 2.5. This makes the azide label a versatile and structurally sensitive probe to report on the dynamics of proteins in a variety of environments and for a range of different applications. Ligand-induced differences in the dynamics are also mapped onto changes in the local and through-space coupling between residues by virtue of dynamical cross correlation maps. This demonstrates that the position where the label is placed also influences the local and global protein motions.},

  abstract = {The diagonal anharmonicity of an amide I mode of protein backbones plays a critical role in a protein’s vibrational dynamics and energy transfer. However, this anharmonicity of long-chain peptides and proteins in H 2 O environment is still lacking. Here, we investigate the anharmonicity of the amide I band of proteins at the lipid membrane/H 2 O interface using a surface-sensitive pump–probe setup in which a femtosecond infrared pump is followed by a femtosecond broadband sum frequency generation vibrational spectroscopy probe. It is found that the anharmonicity of the amide I mode in ideal α-helical and β-sheet structures at hydrophobic environments is 3–4 cm −1 , indicating that the amide I mode in ideal α-helical and β-sheet structures is delocalized over eight peptide bonds. The anharmonicity increases as the bandwidth of the amide I mode increases due to the exposure of peptide bonds to H 2 O. More H 2 O exposure amounts lead to a larger anharmonicity. The amide I mode of the peptides with large H 2 O exposure amounts is localized in one to two peptide bonds. Our finding reveals that the coupling between the amide I mode and the H 2 O bending mode does not facilitate the delocalization of the amide I mode along the peptide chain, highlighting the impact of H 2 O on energy transfer and structural dynamics of proteins.},

  abstract = {The photosynthetic reaction center of heliobacteria (hRC) is a homodimeric chromoprotein responsible for light harvesting and photoelectric conversion. The fluorescence of the hRC is radiated from a bacteriochlorophyll (Bchl) g having the lowest energy level, called red-Bchl g . The homodimeric architecture of the hRC indicates that it includes two red-Bchls g arranged symmetrically in pairs. Red-Bchl g is a fluorescent probe useful for monitoring the energy transfer network in the RC. Here, we show the fluorescence polarization dependences of two red-Bchls g , individually measured with selective excitation of chlorophyll a serving as the primary electron acceptor. The two red-Bchls g exhibit almost the same polarization dependences. Based on the polarization dependence and structural data of the hRC, we propose a candidate molecule for red-Bchl g . The fluorescence spectra of single hRCs represent the spectral heterogeneity reflecting the local conformational inhomogeneity. A time series of the fluorescence spectra indicates occasional peak shifts between blue- and red-shifted states without significant changes in the fluorescence intensity. The spectral fluctuation is interpreted to be due to the local conformational dynamics around a Bchl g mediating the energy transfer, switching the terminal energy acceptor between two red-Bchls g . In conclusion, while the energy transfer network in the RC can be perturbed by microscopic dynamics, the total energy transfer efficiency, i.e., the light-harvesting function, is rather robust. The functional robustness may be due to multiple energy transfer pathways composed of many antenna pigments in the RC.},

Here, metal-sensitive structural changes in the isotopically labeled light-harvesting 1 reaction center (LH1-RC) complexes from the thermophilic purple sulfur bacterium Thermochromatium ( Tch .) tepidum were investigated by perfusion-induced attenuated total reflection (ATR) Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The ATR-FTIR difference spectra induced by exchanges between native Ca 2+ and exogenous Ba 2+ exhibited interconvertible structural and/or conformational changes in the metal binding sites at the LH1 C-terminal region. Most of the characteristic Ba 2+ /Ca 2+ difference bands were detected even when only Ca ions were removed from the LH1-RC complexes, strongly indicating the pivotal roles of Ca 2+ in maintaining the LH1-RC structure of Tch. tepidum . Upon 15 N-, 13 C- or 2 H-labeling, the LH1-RC complexes exhibited characteristic 15 N/ 14 N-, 13 C/ 12 C-, or 2 H/ 1 H-isotopic shifts for the Ba 2+ /Ca 2+ difference bands. Some of the 15 N/ 14 N or 13 C/ 12 C bands were also sensitive to further 2 H-labelings. Given the band frequencies and their isotopic shifts along with the structural information of the Tch. tepidum LH1-RC complexes, metal-sensitive FTIR bands were tentatively identified to the vibrational modes of the polypeptide main chains and side chains comprising the metal binding sites. Furthermore, important new IR marker bands highly sensitive to the LH1 BChl a conformation in the Ca 2+ -bound states were revealed based on both ATR-FTIR and near-infrared Raman analyses. The present approach provides valuable insights concerning the dynamic equilibrium between the Ca 2+ - and Ba 2+ -bound states statically resolved by x-ray crystallography.},

Under small oscillations, poorly annealed materials display shear-annealing , while ultra-stabilized materials are insensitive to them. Yet, beyond a critical oscillation amplitude, both kinds of materials display a discontinuous transition to the same mixed state composed of a fluid shear-band embedded in a marginal solid. Quantitative relations between uniform shear and the steady-state reached with this protocol are established.

  abstract = {Polyelectrolyte solutions have been proposed as a method to improve the efficiency of lithium-ion batteries by increasing the cation transference number because the polymer self-diffusion coefficient is much lower than that of the counterion. However, this is not necessarily true for the polymer mobility. In some cases, negative transference numbers have been reported, which implies that the lithium ions are transporting to the same electrode as the anion, behavior that is often attributed to a binding of counterions to the polyion. We use a simple model where we bind some counterions to the polymer via harmonic springs to investigate this phenomenon. We find that both the number of bound counterions and the strength of their binding alter the transference number, and, in some cases, the transference number is negative. We also investigate how the transference number depends on the Manning parameter, the ratio of the Bjerrum length to charge separation along the chain. By altering the Manning parameter, the transference number can almost be doubled, which suggests that charge spacing could be a way to increase the transference number of polyelectrolyte solutions.},

The theoretical treatment deals with the preparation of a photoexcited system under two different conditions, by steady light absorption with a cutoff and by a light pulse, and describes the following relaxation of electronic densities. On the computational modeling, results are presented for electronic density of states, light absorbance, and relaxation dynamics, comparing results for Ag and Ag 2 adsorbates. The aim of this work is to provide insight on the dynamics and magnitude of relaxation rates for a surface with adsorbed open- and closed-shell Ag species to determine whether the advantages in using them to enhance light absorbance remain valid in the presence of charge density relaxation. Different behaviors can be expected depending on whether the adsorbate particles (Ag metal clusters in our present choice) have electronic open-shell or closed-shell structures. Calculated electron and hole lifetimes are given for pure TiO 2 (110), Ag/TiO 2 (110), and Ag 2 /TiO 2 (110). The present results, while limited to chosen structures and photon wavelengths, show that relaxation rates are noticeably different for electrons and holes, but comparable in magnitude for pure and adsorbate surfaces. Overall, the introduction of the adsorbates does not lead to rapid loss of charge carriers, while they give large increases in light absorption. This appears to be advantageous for applications to photocatalysis.},

Existing QD films, however, are mainly made of either toxic or heavy-metal-based materials, limiting their applications and the commercialization of devices. In this theoretical study, we provide a detailed analysis of the transport properties of “green” colloidal QD films (In-based and Ga-based), identifying possible alternatives to their currently used toxic counterparts. We show how changing the composition, stoichiometry, and the distance between the QDs in the array affects the resulting carrier mobility for different operating temperatures. We find that InAs QD films exhibit high carrier mobilities, even higher compared to previously modeled CdSe (zb) QD films. We also provide the first insights into the transport properties of properly passivated InP and GaSb QD films and envisage how realistic systems could benefit from those properties. Ideally passivated InP QD films can exhibit mobilities an order of magnitude larger compared to what is presently achievable experimentally, which show the smallest variation with (i) increasing temperature when the QDs in the array are very close and (ii) an increasing interdot distance at low operating temperatures (70 K), among the materials considered here, making InP a potentially ideal replacement for PbS. Finally, we show that by engineering the QD stoichiometry, it is possible to enhance the film’s transport properties, paving the way for the synthesis of higher performance devices.},

Although Pt and Rh are among the most studied catalysts for aqueous-phase phenol hydrogenation, the reason why certain facets are active for ECH and TCH is not fully understood. Herein, we identify the active facet of Pt and Rh catalysts for aqueous-phase hydrogenation of phenol and explain the origin of the size-dependent activity trends of Pt and Rh nanoparticles. Phenol adsorption energies extracted on the active sites of Pt and Rh nanoparticles on carbon by fitting kinetic data show that the active sites adsorb phenol weakly. We predict that the turnover frequencies (TOFs) for the hydrogenation of phenol to cyclohexanone on Pt(111) and Rh(111) terraces are higher than those on (221) stepped facets based on density functional theory modeling and mean-field microkinetic simulations. The higher activities of the (111) terraces are due to lower activation energies and weaker phenol adsorption, preventing high coverages of phenol from inhibiting hydrogen adsorption. We measure that the TOF for ECH of phenol increases as the Rh nanoparticle diameter increases from 2 to 10 nm at 298 K and −0.1 V vs the reversible hydrogen electrode, qualitatively matching prior reports for Pt nanoparticles. The increase in experimental TOFs as Pt and Rh nanoparticle diameters increase is due to a larger fraction of terraces on larger particles. These findings clarify the structure sensitivity and active site of Pt and Rh for the hydrogenation of phenol and will inform the catalyst design for the hydrogenation of bio-oils.},

It is further revealed that around the PZC, the change in the surface charge density is dominated by the change in the coverage of chemisorbed water molecules, while EDL charging is the main cause of the change in the surface charge density at potential away from the PZC, thus leading to an S-shaped charge–potential relation and a maximum interface capacitance around PZC. Our results make up for the current lack of the atomic-scale understanding of the EDL microstructures and charge–potential relation on the real electrode surfaces with plentiful step and defect sites.},

  abstract = {It is generally not straightforward to apply molecular-thermodynamic theories to fluids with short-ranged attractive forces between their constituent molecules (or particles). This especially applies to perturbation theories, which, for short-ranged attractive fluids, typically must be extended to high order or may not converge at all. Here, we show that a recent first-order perturbation theory, the uv -theory, holds promise for describing such fluids. As a case study, we apply the uv -theory to a fluid with pair interactions defined by the Lennard-Jones spline potential, which is a short-ranged version of the LJ potential that is known to provide a challenge for equation-of-state development. The results of the uv -theory are compared to those of third-order Barker–Henderson and fourth-order Weeks–Chandler–Andersen perturbation theories, which are implemented using Monte Carlo simulation results for the respective perturbation terms. Theoretical predictions are compared to an extensive dataset of molecular simulation results from this (and previous) work, including vapor–liquid equilibria, first- and second-order derivative properties, the critical region, and metastable states. The uv -theory proves superior for all properties examined. An especially accurate description of metastable vapor and liquid states is obtained, which might prove valuable for future applications of the equation-of-state model to inhomogeneous phases or nucleation processes. Although the uv -theory is analytic, it accurately describes molecular simulation results for both the critical point and the binodal up to at least 99\% of the critical temperature. This suggests that the difficulties typically encountered in describing the vapor–liquid critical region are only to a small extent caused by non-analyticity.},

  abstract = {Extending on the previous work by Riera et al. [J. Chem. Theory Comput. 16 , 2246–2257 (2020)], we introduce a second generation family of data-driven many-body MB-nrg models for CO 2 and systematically assess how the strength and anisotropy of the CO 2 –CO 2 interactions affect the models’ ability to predict vapor, liquid, and vapor–liquid equilibrium properties. Building upon the many-body expansion formalism, we construct a series of MB-nrg models by fitting one-body and two-body reference energies calculated at the coupled cluster level of theory for large monomer and dimer training sets. Advancing from the first generation models, we employ the charge model 5 scheme to determine the atomic charges and systematically scale the two-body energies to obtain more accurate descriptions of vapor, liquid, and vapor–liquid equilibrium properties. Challenges in model construction arise due to the anisotropic nature and small magnitude of the interaction energies in CO 2 , calling for the necessity of highly accurate descriptions of the multidimensional energy landscape of liquid CO 2 . These findings emphasize the key role played by the training set quality in the development of transferable, data-driven models, which, accurately representing high-dimensional many-body effects, can enable predictive computer simulations of molecular fluids across the entire phase diagram.},

  abstract = {The temperature of maximum density, T MD , of aqueous solutions of tert -butanol has been experimentally determined in the pressure range of 0–300 bars and up to 0.025 tert -butanol mole fraction. At atmospheric pressure, this quantity increases for low alcohol mole fractions, reaches a maximum at intermediate concentrations, and then quickly falls. The new experimental results are basically in agreement with previous data in the literature by Wada and Umeda [G. Wada and S. Umeda, Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. 35 , 646 (1962)], except at very low mole fractions, where these authors reported a stronger density anomaly. Our measurements also confirm the known effect of pressure, p , on the variation in the temperature of maximum density with respect to that of pure water, Δ T MD : this quantity increases with p over the whole composition range. In addition, molecular dynamics simulations were performed between 0 and 2000 bars and from 238 to 328 K using a recently proposed model for the tert -butanol/water system. It has been found that our model reproduces qualitatively the experimental behavior of the Δ T MD , but for pressures above 1000 bars. A detailed structural analysis showed that the addition of tert -butanol promotes the low density water structure, and this promotion is somewhat hampered as the temperature increases at high pressure (Δ T MD &gt; 0) and mostly independent of temperature at low pressures (Δ T MD &lt; 0). Our analysis shows that the ultimate factor determining changes in the T MD is the temperature dependence of the low density water structure enhancement. We have also carried out a local structure analysis in which in addition to solid-like structures, low density liquid water ones have also been considered.},

We find that the shape and internal structure of tactoids are strongly affected by the size of the droplets. The monotonically increasing degree of nematic order with increasing particle density that characterizes the bulk nematic phase is locally violated and more so the smaller the tactoid. We also investigate the impact of an external quadrupolar alignment field on tactoids and find that this tends to make the director field more uniform, but not to very significantly increase the tactoid’s aspect ratio. This agrees with recent theoretical predictions yet is at variance with experimental observations and dynamical simulations. We explain this discrepancy in terms of competing relaxation times.},

In the thermal energy range, long-lived molecular negative ions, unstable with respect to autoneutralization and dehalogenation, have been registered. Examination of the kinetics of these decay processes led us to the conclusion that the most probable structure for molecular negative ions is that with an extended C–Br bond, which was predicted earlier using quantum-chemical calculations. Estimates have shown that the BrdUrd molecule owns a significant electronic affinity of 0.93–1.38 eV. The most intense fragmentation channel leads to the abundant formation of Br − ions. The dissociative electron attachment cross section for Br − ions formation was estimated to amount to no less than 1.65 × 10 −15 cm 2 , indirectly implying a fairly intense formation of complementary highly reactive deoxyuridine-5-yl particles. These particles are known to be responsible for the radiosensitizing properties of BrdUrd.},

Thus, we provide, in this study, a new PES of the CO 2 –He van der Waals complex calculated with the coupled-cluster method and a complete basis set extrapolation in order to provide rotational rate coefficients that are as accurate as possible. The PES accuracy was tested through the calculations of bound state transition frequencies and pressure broadening coefficients that were compared to experimental data. An excellent agreement was globally found. Then, revised collisional data were provided for the 10–300 K temperature range. Rate coefficients were compared to previously computed ones and are found to be up to 50\% greater than previously provided ones. These differences can induce non-negligible consequences for the modeling of CO 2 abundance in astrophysical media.},

We present new spectroscopic measurements on single polycyclic aromatic molecules of dibenzoterrylene embedded in an organic crystal made of para -dichlorobenzene. To do this, we use narrow-band continuous-wave lasers and combine spectroscopy methods based on fluorescence excitation and stimulated emission depletion to assess individual vibrational linewidths in the electronic ground state at a resolution of ∼30 MHz dictated by the linewidth of the electronic excited state. In this fashion, we identify several exceptionally narrow vibronic levels with linewidths down to values around 2 GHz. Additionally, we sample the distribution of vibronic wavenumbers, relaxation rates, and Franck–Condon factors, in both the electronic ground and excited states for a handful of individual molecules. We discuss various noteworthy experimental findings and compare them with the outcome of density functional theory calculations. The highly detailed vibronic spectra obtained in our work pave the way for studying the nanoscopic local environment of single molecules. The approach also provides an improved understanding of the vibrational relaxation mechanisms in the electronic ground state, which may help create long-lived vibrational states for applications in quantum technology.},

  abstract = {Conformational polymorphs of organic molecular crystals represent a challenging test for quantum chemistry because they require careful balancing of the intra- and intermolecular interactions. This study examines 54 molecular conformations from 20 sets of conformational polymorphs, along with the relative lattice energies and 173 dimer interactions taken from six of the polymorph sets. These systems are studied with a variety of van der Waals-inclusive density functionals theory models; dispersion-corrected spin-component-scaled second-order Møller–Plesset perturbation theory (SCS-MP2D); and domain local pair natural orbital coupled cluster singles, doubles, and perturbative triples [DLPNO-CCSD(T)]. We investigate how delocalization error in conventional density functionals impacts monomer conformational energies, systematic errors in the intermolecular interactions, and the nature of error cancellation that occurs in the overall crystal. The density functionals B86bPBE-XDM, PBE-D4, PBE-MBD, PBE0-D4, and PBE0-MBD are found to exhibit sizable one-body and two-body errors vs DLPNO-CCSD(T) benchmarks, and the level of success in predicting the relative polymorph energies relies heavily on error cancellation between different types of intermolecular interactions or between intra- and intermolecular interactions. The SCS-MP2D and, to a lesser extent, ω B97M-V models exhibit smaller errors and rely less on error cancellation. Implications for crystal structure prediction of flexible compounds are discussed. Finally, the one-body and two-body DLPNO-CCSD(T) energies taken from these conformational polymorphs establish the CP1b and CP2b benchmark datasets that could be useful for testing quantum chemistry models in challenging real-world systems with complex interplay between intra- and intermolecular interactions, a number of which are significantly impacted by delocalization error.},

  abstract = {Hybrid methods that combine molecular dynamics methods capable of analyzing dynamics with Monte Carlo (MC) methods that can efficiently treat thermodynamically stable states are valuable for understanding complex chemical processes in which an equilibrium state is reached through many elementary processes. The hybrid MC (HMC) method is one such promising method; however, it often fails to sample configurations properly from the canonical multimodal distribution due to the rugged potential energy surfaces. In this paper, we extend the HMC method to overcome this difficulty. The new method, which is termed potential scaling HMC (PS-HMC), makes use of an artificially modulated trajectory to propose a new configuration. The trajectory is generated from Hamilton’s equations, but the potential energy surface is scaled to be gradually flattened and then recovered to the original surface, which facilitates barrier-crossing processes. We apply the PS-HMC method to three kinds of molecular processes: the thermal motion of argon particles, butane isomerization, and an atom transfer chemical reaction. These applications demonstrate that the PS-HMC method is capable of correctly constructing the canonical ensemble with a multimodal distribution. The sampling efficiency and accepted trajectories are examined to clarify the features of the PS-HMC method. Despite the potential scaling, many reactive atom transfer trajectories (elementary processes) pass through the vicinity of the minimum energy path. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the method can properly imitate the relaxation process owing to the inherent configurational continuity. By comparing the PS-HMC method with other relevant methods, we can conclude that the new method is a unique approach for studying both the dynamic and thermodynamic aspects of chemical processes.},

  abstract = {The optical properties of small spheroidal metallic nanoparticles can be simply studied within the quasistatic/electrostatic approximation, but this is limited to particles much smaller than the wavelength. A number of approaches have been proposed to extend the range of validity of this simple approximation to a range of sizes more relevant to applications in plasmonics, where resonances play a key role. The most common approach, called the modified long-wavelength approximation, is based on physical considerations of the dynamic depolarization field inside the spheroid, but alternative empirical expressions have also been proposed, presenting better accuracy. Recently, an exact Taylor expansion of the full electromagnetic solution has been derived [Majic et al. , Phys. Rev. A 99 , 013853 (2019)], which should arguably provide the best approximation for a given order. We here compare the merits of these approximations to predict orientation-averaged extinction/scattering/absorption spectra of metallic spheroidal nanoparticles. The Taylor expansion is shown to provide more accurate predictions over a wider range of parameters (aspect ratio and prolate/oblate shape). It also allows us to consider quadrupole and octupole resonances. This simple approximation can therefore be used for small and intermediate-size nanoparticles in situations where computing the full electromagnetic solution is not practical.},

In their conventional form, the range separation is controlled by a constant parameter. Turning this constant into a density functional leads to a locally space-dependent range-separation function and thus a more powerful and flexible range-separation approach. In this work, we explore the self-consistent implementation of a local range-separated hybrid, taking into account a one-electron self-interaction correction and the behavior under uniform density scaling. We discuss different forms of the local range-separation function that depend on the electron density, its gradient, and the kinetic energy density. For test sets of atomization energies, reaction barrier heights, and total energies of atoms, we demonstrate that our best model is a clear improvement over common global range-separated hybrid functionals and can compete with density functionals that contain multiple empirical parameters. Promising results for equilibrium bond lengths, harmonic vibrational frequencies, and vertical ionization potentials further underline the potential and flexibility of our approach.},

  abstract = {Vibrational spectroscopy is a useful technique for probing chemical environments. The development of models that can reproduce the spectra of nitriles and azides is valuable because these probes are uniquely suited for investigating complex systems. Empirical vibrational spectroscopic maps are commonly employed to obtain the instantaneous vibrational frequencies during molecular dynamics simulations but often fail to adequately describe the behavior of these probes, especially in its transferability to a diverse range of environments. In this paper, we demonstrate several reasons for the difficulty in constructing a general-purpose vibrational map for methyl thiocyanate (MeSCN), a model for cyanylated biological probes. In particular, we found that electrostatics alone are not a sufficient metric to categorize the environments of different solvents, and the dominant features in intermolecular interactions in the energy landscape vary from solvent to solvent. Consequently, common vibrational mapping schemes do not cover all essential interaction terms adequately, especially in the treatment of van der Waals interactions. Quantum vibrational perturbation (QVP) theory, along with a combined quantum mechanical and molecular mechanical potential for solute–solvent interactions, is an alternative and efficient modeling technique, which is compared in this paper, to yield spectroscopic results in good agreement with experimental FTIR. QVP has been used to analyze the computational data, revealing the shortcomings of the vibrational maps for MeSCN in different solvents. The results indicate that insights from QVP analysis can be used to enhance the transferability of vibrational maps in future studies.},

  abstract = {Projected Hartree–Fock theory provides an accurate description of many kinds of strong correlations but does not properly describe weakly correlated systems. On the other hand, single-reference methods, such as configuration interaction or coupled cluster theory, can handle weakly correlated problems but cannot properly account for strong correlations. Ideally, we would like to combine these techniques in a symmetry-projected coupled cluster approach, but this is far from straightforward. In this work, we provide an alternative formulation to identify the so-called disentangled cluster operators, which arise when we combine these two methodological strands. Our formulation shows promising results for model systems and small molecules.},

  abstract = {The theory of hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) is one of the standard methods to give exact evaluations of the dynamics as coupled to harmonic oscillator environments. However, the theory is numerically demanding due to its hierarchy, which is the set of auxiliary elements introduced to capture the non-Markovian and non-perturbative effects of environments. When system–bath coupling becomes relatively strong, the required computational resources and precision move beyond the regime that can be currently handled. This article presents a new representation of HEOM theory in which the hierarchy is mapped into a continuous space of a collective bath coordinate and several auxiliary coordinates as the form of the quantum Fokker–Planck equation. This representation gives a rigorous time evolution of the bath coordinate distribution and is more stable and efficient than the original HEOM theory, particularly when there is a strong system–bath coupling. We demonstrate the suitability of this approach to treat vibronic system models coupled to environments.},

The unusual energy errors between different wave functional methods were also verified in other closed-shell metallophilic systems and even were taken as a label of metallophilic interaction. Here, we performed a benchmark study on a collection of structures with weak interactions, sp–sp bonds, sp–d bonds, and d–d bonds, to investigate the influence factor of the errors of HF and MP2 methods. It was found that the large energy errors of HF and MP2 methods were not specified for closed-shell interactions, and the errors could also be very large for many covalent bonds, which was strongly related to the azimuthal quantum number of interaction orbitals. Compared to the CCSD(T) method, the MP2 method weakens the s–s covalent interactions slightly, strengthens the p–p covalent interactions slightly, and overestimates the d–d covalent interactions largely (can be −170 kcal/mol for the Re–Re quadruple bond). This benchmark study suggests that the special energy errors in metallophilicity may result from the participation of d orbitals. Benchmark studies on various density functional methods were also given for calculating binding energies of d–d bonds.},

The corresponding analytical nuclear gradients and non-adiabatic couplings are also derived. Furthermore, we show how the new method can be entirely formulated in terms of seven basic operations, which allows the implementation to benefit from existing high-performance libraries on graphical processing units.

This variational formulation is compared with the non-variational one in terms of few selected observables showing the underlying distinctiveness of the two approaches.

  abstract = {Within any molecule or cluster containing one or more positively charged sites, families of Rydberg orbitals exist. Free electrons can attach directly, and anionic reagents with low electron binding energy can transfer an electron into one of these orbitals to form a neutral Rydberg radical. The possibilities that such a radical could form a covalent bond either to another Rydberg radical or to a radical holding its electron in a conventional valence orbital are considered. This Perspective overviews two roles that Rydberg radicals can play, both of which have important chemical consequences. Attachment of an electron into excited Rydberg orbitals is followed by rapid (∼10 −6 s) relaxation into the lowest-energy Rydberg orbital to form the ground state radical. Although the excited Rydberg species are stable with respect to fragmentation, the ground-state species is usually quite fragile and undergoes homolytic bond cleavage (e.g., –R 2 NH dissociates into –R 2 N + H or into –RNH + R) by overcoming a very small barrier on its potential energy surface, thus generating reactive radicals (H or R). Here, it is shown that as a result of this fragility, any covalent bonds formed by Rydberg radicals are weak and the molecules they form are susceptible to exothermic fragmentations that involve quite small activation barriers. Another role played by Rydberg species arises when the Coulomb potentials provided by the (one or more) positive site(s) in the molecule stabilize low-energy anti-bonding orbitals (e.g., σ* orbitals of weak σ bonds or low-lying π* orbitals) to the extent that electron attachment into these Coulomb-stabilized orbitals is rendered exothermic. In such cases, the overlap of the Rydberg orbitals on the positive site(s) with the σ* or π* orbitals allows either a free electron or a weakly bound electron to an anionic reagent that is attracted toward the positive site by its Coulomb force to be guided/transferred into the σ* or π* orbital instead. After attaching to such an anti-bonding orbital, bond cleavage occurs again, generating reactive radical species. Because of the large radial extent of Rydberg orbitals, this class of bond cleavage events can occur quite distant from the positively charged group. In this Perspective, several examples of both types of phenomena are given for illustrative purposes.},

In this study, we constructed a biohybrid LH system composed of an LH complex (LH2) from Rhodoblastus acidophilus strain 10050 and a hydrophobic fluorophore ATTO647N (ATTO) as an extrinsic antenna in the lipid bilayer. Through the addition of ATTOs into a solution of LH2-reconstituted lipid vesicles, ATTOs were incorporated into the hydrophobic interior of the lipid bilayer to configure the non-covalently self-assembled biohybrid LH. Steady-state fluorescence spectroscopy clearly showed efficient energy transfer from ATTO to B850 bacteriochlorophylls in LH2. Femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy revealed that the energy transfer took place in the time range of 3–13 ps, comparable to that of the covalently linked LH2-ATTO that we previously reported. In addition, the biohybrid LH system exhibited a much higher antenna effect than the LH2-ATTO system because of the higher loading level of ATTO in the membrane. These findings suggest that the facile self-assembled biohybrid LH system is a promising system for constructing LH for solar-energy conversion.},

Nanogel particles can take forms ranging from relatively symmetric sponge-like compact structures to relatively anisotropic open fractal structures observed in some nanogel clusters and in some self-associating polymers in solutions, such as aggrecan solutions under physiologically relevant conditions. We hypothesize that this broad “spectrum” of branched polymer structures derives from the degree of regularity of bonding in the network defining these structures. Accordingly, we systematically introduce bonding defects in an initially perfect network having a lattice structure in three and two topological dimensions corresponding to “sponge” and “sheet” structures, respectively. The introduction of bonding defects causes these “closed” and relatively compact nanogel particles to transform near a well-defined bond percolation threshold into “open” fractal objects with the inherent anisotropy of randomly branched polymers. Moreover, with increasing network decimation, the network structure of these polymers acquires other configurational properties similar to those of randomly branched polymers. In particular, the mass scaling of the radius of gyration and its eigenvalues, as well as hydrodynamic radius, intrinsic viscosity, and form factor for scattering, all undergo abrupt changes that accompany these topological transitions. Our findings support the idea that randomly branched polymers can be considered to be equivalent to perforated sheets from a “universality class” standpoint. We utilize our model to gain insight into scattering measurements made on aggrecan solutions.},

In this work, we develop coarse-grained (CG) models for PSS and PVBTMA with explicit CG water and with sodium and chloride counterions, respectively. We benchmark the CG models via a comparison with atomistic simulations for single chains. We find that the choice of the topology and the partial charge distribution of the CG model, both play a crucial role in the ability of the CG model to reproduce results from atomistic simulations. There are dramatic consequences, e.g., collapse of polyions, with injudicious choices of the local charge distribution. The polyanions and polycations exhibit a similar conformational and dynamical behavior, suggesting that the sign of the polyion charge does not play a significant role.},

The key feature is to organize the forces perpendicular to the chain backbone according to specific patterns (sequences). We characterize the physical properties of this model and perform, using a number of numerical techniques, an in-depth statistical analysis of structure and dynamics of the emerging conformations. We discovered a number of interesting features, including the existence of a direct correspondence between the sequence of the active forces and the structure of folded conformations, and we discover the existence of an ensemble of highly mobile compact structures capable of moving from conformation to conformation.

  abstract = {Surface diffusion has been measured in the glass of an organic semiconductor, MTDATA, using the method of surface grating decay. The decay rate was measured as a function of temperature and grating wavelength, and the results indicate that the decay mechanism is viscous flow at high temperatures and surface diffusion at low temperatures. Surface diffusion in MTDATA is enhanced by 4 orders of magnitude relative to bulk diffusion when compared at the glass transition temperature T g . The result on MTDATA has been analyzed along with the results on other molecular glasses without extensive hydrogen bonds. In total, these systems cover a wide range of molecular geometries from rod-like to quasi-spherical to discotic and their surface diffusion coefficients vary by 9 orders of magnitude. We find that the variation is well explained by the existence of a steep surface mobility gradient and the anchoring of surface molecules at different depths. Quantitative analysis of these results supports a recently proposed double-exponential form for the mobility gradient: log D ( T , z ) = log D v ( T ) + [log D 0 − log D v ( T )]exp(− z /ξ), where D ( T , z ) is the depth-dependent diffusion coefficient, D v ( T ) is the bulk diffusion coefficient, D 0 ≈ 10 −8 m 2 /s, and ξ ≈ 1.5 nm. Assuming representative bulk diffusion coefficients for these fragile glass formers, the model reproduces the presently known surface diffusion rates within 0.6 decade. Our result provides a general way to predict the surface diffusion rates in molecular glasses.},

The structural characteristics were first evaluated for dense silica polymorphs, for which reliable low-temperature experiments are available. Due to the significant errors in experimentally determined atomic positions of siliceous zeolites, lattice parameters and the cell volume were proposed as reliable descriptors for the structural assessment of zeolite frameworks. In this regard, the most consistently performing (systematically underestimating/overestimating) methods are the Sanders–Leslie–Catlow (SLC) force field and the PBEsol density functional. The best overall agreement with the experiment is observed for PBEsol-D2. However, it is a result of fortuitous error cancellations rather than improved description upon adding dispersion correction. We proposed two approaches to estimate accurate cell volumes of siliceous materials from theoretical data: (i) using the SLC and PBEsol volumes as lower and upper bounds and (ii) using a structural response to the dispersion correction along with the SLC compressibility as an additional criterion.},

Understanding the heterogeneous dynamics of protein adsorption on surfaces with varying roughness is experimentally challenging. In this work, we use single-molecule fluorescence microscopy to study the adsorption of α-lactalbumin protein on the glass substrate covered with a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) with varying surface concentrations. Two distinct interaction mechanisms are observed: localized adsorption/desorption and continuous-time random walk (CTRW). We investigate the origin of these two populations by simultaneous single-molecule imaging of substrates with both bare glass and SAM-covered regions. SAM-covered areas of substrates are found to promote CTRW, whereas glass surfaces promote localized motion. Contact angle measurements and atomic force microscopy imaging show that increasing SAM concentration results in both increasing hydrophobicity and surface roughness. These properties lead to two opposing effects: increasing hydrophobicity promotes longer protein flights, but increasing surface roughness suppresses protein dynamics resulting in shorter residence times. Our studies suggest that controlling hydrophobicity and roughness, in addition to electrostatics, as independent parameters could provide a means to tune desirable or undesirable protein interactions with surfaces.},

  abstract = {The chemical versatility and modular nature of Metal–Organic Frameworks (MOFs) make them unique hybrid inorganic–organic materials for several important applications. From a computational point of view, ab initio modeling of MOFs is a challenging and demanding task, in particular, when the system reaches the size of gigantic MOFs as MIL-100 and MIL-101 (where MIL stands for Materials Institute Lavoisier) with several thousand atoms in the unit cell. Here, we show how such complex systems can be successfully tackled by a recently proposed class of composite electronic structure methods revised for solid-state calculations. These methods rely on HF/density functional theory hybrid functionals (i.e., PBEsol0 and HSEsol) combined with a double-zeta quality basis set. They are augmented with semi-classical corrections to take into account dispersive interactions (D3 scheme) and the basis set superposition error (gCP). The resulting methodologies, dubbed “sol-3c,” are cost-effective yet reach the hybrid functional accuracy. Here, sol-3c methods are effectively applied to predict the structural, vibrational, electronic, and adsorption properties of some of the most common MOFs. Calculations are feasible even on very large MOFs containing more than 2500 atoms in the unit cell as MIL-100 and MIL-101 with reasonable computing resources. We propose to use our composite methods for the routine in silico screening of MOFs targeting properties beyond plain structural features.},

  abstract = {Silicon carbide is an important wide-bandgap semiconductor with wide applications in harsh environments and its applications rely on a reliable surface, with dry or wet oxidation to form an insulating layer at temperatures ranging from 850 to 1250 °C. Here, we report that the SiC quantum dots (QDs) with dimensions lying in the strong quantum confinement regime can be naturally oxidized at a much lower temperature of 220 °C to form core/shell and heteroepitaxial SiC/SiO 2 QDs with well crystallized silica nanoshells. The surface silica layer enhances the radiative transition rate of the core SiC QD by offering an ideal carrier potential barrier and diminishes the nonradiative transition rate by reducing the surface dangling bonds, and, as a result, the quantum yield is highly improved. The SiC/SiO 2 QDs are very stable in air, and they have better biocompatibility for cell-labeling than the bare SiC QDs. These results pave the way for constructing SiC-based nanoscale electronic and photonic devices.},

  abstract = {We conduct a molecular study on the structural chirality in Langmuir monolayers composed of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) using in situ nonlinear optical spectroscopies, including second harmonic generation (SHG) and sum frequency generation (SFG). Chiral SHG response is observed from L-DPPC monolayers at moderate surface pressures and almost vanishes at a high surface pressure. SFG spectra of L-DPPC monolayers show chiral features that can be assigned to the terminal CH 3 groups and the CH 2 groups attached to the chiral center atom. This means that these achiral moieties form chiral superstructures at the interface. Along with increasing surface pressure, the structural chirality of CH 3 groups shows a similar trend as that of chiral SHG, but CH 2 chirality increases monotonically. Furthermore, in a racemic DPPC monolayer with a moderate surface pressure, both chiral SHG and chiral SFG of CH 3 groups are absent, whereas chiral SFG of CH 2 groups is clearly present, indicating that L- and D-DPPC are diastereomers at the air/water interface and interfacial CH 2 prefers a certain orientation regardless of the molecular handedness. A molecular mechanism is proposed to explain the origin of the structural chirality in DPPC monolayers.},

  abstract = {Many essential processes occur at soft interfaces, from chemical reactions on aqueous aerosols in the atmosphere to biochemical recognition and binding at the surface of cell membranes. The spatial arrangement of molecules specifically at these interfaces is crucial for many of such processes. The accurate determination of the interfacial molecular orientation has been challenging due to the low number of molecules at interfaces and the ambiguity of their orientational distribution. Here, we combine phase- and polarization-resolved sum-frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy to obtain the molecular orientation at the interface. We extend an exponentially decaying orientational distribution to multiple dimensions, which, in conjunction with multiple SFG datasets obtained from the different vibrational modes, allows us to determine the molecular orientation. We apply this new approach to formic acid molecules at the air–water interface. The inferred orientation of formic acid agrees very well with ab initio molecular dynamics data. The phase-resolved SFG multimode analysis scheme using the multidimensional orientational distribution thus provides a universal approach for obtaining the interfacial molecular orientation.},

  abstract = {Graphitic carbon nitride (GCN) has attracted significant attention due to its excellent performance in photocatalytic applications. Non-metal doping of GCN has been widely used to improve the efficiency of the material as a photocatalyst. Using a combination of time-domain density functional theory with nonadiabatic molecular dynamics, we study the charge carrier dynamics in oxygen and boron doped GCN systems. The reported simulations provide a detailed time-domain mechanistic description of the charge separation and recombination processes that are of fundamental importance while evaluating the photovoltaic and photocatalytic performance of the material. The appearance of smaller energy gaps due to the presence of dopant states improves the visible light absorption range of the doped systems. At the same time, the nonradiative lifetimes are shortened in the doped systems as compared to the pristine GCN. In the case of boron doped at a carbon (B–C–GCN), the charge recombination time is very long as compared to the other two doped systems owing to the smaller electron–phonon coupling strength between the valence band maximum and the trap state. The results suggest B–C–GCN as the most suitable candidate among three doped systems studied in this work for applications in photocatalysis. This work sheds light into the influence of dopants on quantum dynamics processes that govern GCN performance and, thus, guides toward building high-performance devices in photocatalysis.},

The electrochromic properties are evaluated by UV–vis spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and chronoamperometry. These tests show that FTO exhibits electrochromism with a respectable coloration efficiency ( η = 47.9 cm 2 /C at 637 nm). DFT study indicates that lithium remains ionized in the lattice, raising the Fermi level about 0.7 eV deep into the conduction band. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is used to study chemical bonding and oxidation states. XPS analysis of the Sn 3d core levels reveals that lithium insertion in FTO induces a shift of 350 meV in the Sn 3d states, suggesting that lithium is incorporated into the SnO 2 lattice.},

The relaxation dynamics were recorded at a constant pressure of 500 bars and in the temperature range between 300 and 600 K, thereby covering the liquid-to-near-critical region of the solvent. The excited state of the ν 3 -mode is deactivated in two competing pathways: (i) direct relaxation to the ground state with resonant transfer of the excess vibrational energy into the bending–librational continuum of the water solvent and (ii) relaxation to the bending fundamental state with transfer into the intramolecular bending mode of H 2 O. The rate of pathway (i) decreases with increasing temperature, from ∼1/(9 ps) at 300 K to ∼(1/16 ps) at 600 K and obeys Fermi’s golden rule strictly, provided that the spectral density of energy-accepting solvent states is derived from the stationary infrared absorption profile of H 2 O. The rate of pathway (ii) is 1/(23 ps) and assumed to be temperature-independent within our data analysis. Finally, the bending fundamental of CO 2 can also relax to the ground state by resonantly transferring the remaining excess energy to the librational fundamentals of the solvent.},

Classical molecular dynamics simulations were also performed, allowing us to characterize bulk liquid phases at the nanoscopic level, analyzing the fluid’s structuring, void distribution, and dynamics.

In this work, we revisit a simple theoretical model of the β -relaxation, i.e., the first step of the relaxation dynamics. The model, first introduced by Cavagna et al. [J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 36 , 10721 (2003)], describes the dynamics of the system in the neighborhood of a saddle point of the potential energy surface. We extend the model to account for density–density correlation functions and for the four-point dynamic susceptibility. We obtain analytical results for a simple schematic model, making contact with related results for p -spin models and with the predictions of inhomogeneous mode-coupling theory. Building on recent computational advances, we also explicitly compare the model predictions against overdamped Langevin dynamics simulations of a glass-forming liquid close to the mode-coupling crossover. The agreement is quantitative at the level of single-particle dynamic properties only up to the early β -regime. Due to its inherent harmonic approximation, however, the model is unable to predict the dynamics on the time scale relevant for structural relaxation. Nonetheless, our analysis suggests that the agreement with the simulations may be largely improved if the modes’ spatial localization is properly taken into account.},

Localized proton dynamics for the five distinct hydrogen sites were observed and identified in this study. Their temperature evaluation over ten orders of magnitude in time was followed by means of quasielastic neutron scattering, dielectric spectroscopy, and ab initio molecular dynamics. Two out of the five hydrogen sites are geometrically isolated and are not suitable for long-range proton conduction. Nevertheless, the detected dc conductivity points to long-range charge transport at elevated temperatures, which occurs most likely (1) over H4–H4 sites between semihelical HB chains (interchain-exchanges) and (2) by rotations of O1–H1 and site-exchanging H4–O10–O5 groups along each semihelical HB chain (intrachain-exchanges). The latter dynamics freeze into a proton-glass state at low temperatures. Rotational and site-exchanging motions of HOH and OH ligands seem to be facilitated by collective motions of framework polyhedra, which we detected by inelastic neutron scattering.},

Lett. 11 , 1729 (2020)], we have determined the nonequilibrium distribution of the solvent where its dynamics, expressed by a friction, is considered in two limiting regimes of fast and slow solvent relaxation. In dependence of the nonequilibrium solvent dynamics, we investigate now the electrical, thermal, and thermoelectric properties of the molecular junction. We show that by suitable tuning of the friction, we can reduce the heat dissipation into the solvent and enhance the heat transfer between the electrodes. Interestingly, we find that the Seebeck coefficient grows significantly by adapting the solvent friction in both regimes.},

  abstract = {Photodissociation dynamics of the OH bond of phenol is studied with an optimally shaped laser pulse. The theoretical model consists of three electronic states (the ground electronic state, ππ * state, and πσ * state) in two nuclear coordinates (the OH stretching coordinate as a reaction coordinate, r, and the CCOH dihedral angle as a coupling coordinate, θ ). The optimal UV laser pulse is designed using the genetic algorithm, which optimizes the total dissociative flux of the wave packet. The latter is calculated in the adiabatic asymptotes of the S 0 and S 1 electronic states of phenol. The initial state corresponds to the vibrational levels of the electronic ground state and is defined as | n r , n θ ⟩, where n r and n θ represent the number of nodes along r and θ , respectively. The optimal UV field excites the system to the optically dark πσ * state predominantly over the optically bright ππ * state with the intensity borrowing effect for the |0, 0⟩ and |0, 1⟩ initial states. For the |0, 0⟩ initial condition, the photodissociation to the S 1 asymptotic channel is favored slightly over the S 0 asymptotic channel. Addition of one quantum of energy along the coupling coordinate increases the dissociation probability in the S 1 channel. This is because the wave packet spreads along the coupling coordinate on the πσ * state and follows the adiabatic path. Hence, the S 1 asymptotic channel gets more ( ⁠ ∼ 11\%) dissociative flux as compared to the S 0 asymptotic channel for the |0, 1⟩ initial condition. The |1, 0⟩ and |1, 1⟩ states are initially excited to both the ππ * and πσ * states in the presence of the optimal UV pulse. For these initial conditions, the S 1 channel gets more dissociative flux as compared to the S 0 channel. This is because the high energy components of the wave packet readily reach the S 1 channel. The central frequency of the optimal UV pulse for the |0, 0⟩ and |0, 1⟩ initial states has a higher value as compared to the |1, 0⟩ and |1, 1⟩ initial states. This is explained with the help of an excitation mechanism of a given initial state in relation to its energy.},

  abstract = {The detachment loss dynamics between rubidium atoms (Rb) and oxygen anions (O − ) are studied in a hybrid atom–ion trap. The amount of excited rubidium present in the atomic ensemble is actively controlled, providing a tool to tune the electronic quantum state of the system and, thus, the anion–neutral interaction dynamics. For a ground state Rb interacting with O − , the detachment induced loss rate is consistent with zero, while the excited state Rb yields a significantly higher loss rate. The results are interpreted via ab initio potential energy curves and compared to the previously studied Rb–OH − system, where an associative electronic detachment reactive loss process hinders the sympathetic cooling of the anion. This implies that with the loss channels closed for ground-state Rb and O − anion, this system provides a platform to observe sympathetic cooling of an anion with an ultracold heavy buffer gas.},

  abstract = {The unimolecular photodissociation dynamics of acetone spanning the entire S 1 ← S 0 absorption spectrum have been reinvestigated, with a focus on mechanisms that produce CO. At excitation wavelengths of λ &gt; 305.8 nm, all photoproducts are formed on the S 0 state after internal conversion. A roaming mechanism forming C 2 H 6 + CO is active in the window λ = 311.2–305.8 nm. From λ = 305.8 to 262 nm, little or no CO is produced with the photochemistry dominated by the Norrish-type I C–C bond cleavage on the lowest excited triplet state, T 1 . At higher energy ( λ &lt; 262 nm), an increasing fraction of CH 3 CO radicals from the primary reaction have sufficient internal energy to spontaneously decompose to CH 3 + CO. A new model is presented to account for the kinetic energy distribution of the secondary CH 3 radical, allowing us to determine the height of the energetic barrier to CH 3 CO decomposition as 68 ± 4 kJ mol −1 , which lies midway between previous measurements. The fraction of CO from triple fragmentation rises smoothly from 260 to 248 nm. We see no evidence of the return of roaming, or any other S 0 reaction, in this higher energy region of the first electronic absorption band.},

  abstract = {We numerically isolate the limits of validity of the Landauer approximation to describe charge transport along molecular junctions in condensed phase environments. To do so, we contrast Landauer with exact time-dependent non-equilibrium Green’s function quantum transport computations in a two-site molecular junction subject to exponentially correlated noise. Under resonant transport conditions, we find Landauer accuracy to critically depend on intramolecular interactions. By contrast, under nonresonant conditions, the emergence of incoherent transport routes that go beyond Landauer depends on charging and discharging processes at the electrode–molecule interface. In both cases, decreasing the rate of charge exchange between the electrodes and molecule and increasing the interaction strength with the thermal environment cause Landauer to become less accurate. The results are interpreted from a time-dependent perspective where the noise prevents the junction from achieving steady-state and from a fully quantum perspective where the environment introduces dephasing in the dynamics. Using these results, we analyze why the Landauer approach is so useful to understand experiments, isolate regimes where it fails, and propose schemes to chemically manipulate the degree of transport coherence.},

  abstract = {In this paper, the nature of interactions between two cyanocarbons—tetracyanoethylene (TCNE) and fumaronitrile (FN)—and a series of four secondary amines possessing a general formula C 4 H x N (x = 5–11) is thoroughly scrutinized. For all of the TCNE–amine pairs, tricyanovinylation (TCV) reaction is observed; however, only for pyrrole, it is accompanied with a visible charge-transfer (CT) complex formation—no such chemical individuals, characteristic for TCNE, have been noticed for aliphatic and alicyclic amines. On the contrary, FN forms such complexes with all the amines studied. Interestingly, a rather unexpected reaction of FN with alicyclic amines has been observed. The recorded electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra indicate the presence of both TCNE ●− and FN ●− radicals in the analyzed samples, assigned to a complete charge (electron) transfer process within the CT complexes, whose efficiency can be additionally enhanced by photoirradiation. The origination of the former radical, whose presence is observed also in the TCNE–diethylamine mixture, is as well proposed to result indirectly from the TCV reaction, occurring for this system. Finally, the superhyperfine structure of EPR spectra, indicating the existence of some secondary interactions of the radicals with surrounding compounds, is discussed. Formation of CT complexes and tricyanovinylates has been investigated and characterized with UV–Vis spectroscopy, while the presence of (cyano)radicals in the analyzed mixtures has been evidenced by (photoinduced) EPR measurements. Interpretation of the experimental results is also supplemented with computer simulations including density functional theory calculations.},

  abstract = {Plasmonic metallic nanoparticles are commonly used in (bio-)sensing applications because their localized surface plasmon resonance is highly sensitive to changes in the environment. Although optical detection of scattered light from single particles provides a straightforward means of detection, the two-photon luminescence (TPL) of single gold nanorods (GNRs) has the potential to increase the sensitivity due to the large anti-Stokes shift and the non-linear excitation mechanism. However, two-photon microscopy and spectroscopy are restricted in bandwidth and have been limited by the thermal stability of GNRs. Here, we used a scanning multi-focal microscope to simultaneously measure the two-photon excitation spectra of hundreds of individual GNRs with sub-nanometer accuracy. By keeping the excitation power under the melting threshold, we show that GNRs were stable in intensity and spectrum for more than 30 min, demonstrating the absence of thermal reshaping. Spectra featured a signal-to-noise ratio of &gt;10 and a plasmon peak width of typically 30 nm. Changes in the refractive index of the medium of less than 0.04, corresponding to a change in surface plasmon resonance of 8 nm, could be readily measured and over longer periods. We used this enhanced spectral sensitivity to measure the presence of neutravidin, exploring the potential of TPL spectroscopy of single GNRs for enhanced plasmonic sensing.},

A novel visualization framework is proposed to analyze individual many-body contributions to the correlation energy, providing detailed maps of this complex’s highly correlated electronic structure. This technique is used to parse the numerous interactions of two low-lying triplet states ( 3 A 2g and 3 E g ) and to show that strong metal d–d and macrocycle π–π orbital interactions preferentially stabilize the 3 A 2g state. d–π interactions, on the other hand, preferentially stabilize the 3 E g state and primarily appear when correlating six electrons at a time. Ultimately, the Fe(II)–porphyrin model’s full set of 88 valence electrons are correlated in 275 orbitals, showing the interactions up to the 4-body level, which covers the great majority of correlations in this system.},

We report on the implementation of a Monte Carlo wave packet algorithm in the Heidelberg version of the Multi-Configuration Time-Dependent Hartree (MCTDH) program package, which is henceforth extended to treat stochastic dissipative dynamics. The Lindblad operator is represented as a sum of products of one-dimensional operators. The new form of the operator is not restricted to the MCTDH formalism and could be used with other multidimensional quantum dynamical methods. As a benchmark system, a two-dimensional coupled oscillators model representing the internal stretch and the surface–molecule distance in the O 2 /Pt(111) system coupled to a Markovian bath of electron–hole-pairs is used. The simulations reveal the interplay between coherent intramolecular coupling due to anharmonic terms in the potential and incoherent relaxation due to coupling to an environment. It is found that thermalization of the system can be approximately achieved when the intramolecular coupling is weak.},

We analyze the performance of the projected CAP-EOM-CC scheme against the conventional scheme, where the CAP is incorporated starting from the Hartree–Fock level, for various small and medium sized molecules, and investigate its sensitivity to various parameters.

  abstract = {Significant effort has been devoted to benchmarking isotropic hyperfine coupling constants for both wavefunction and density-based approaches in recent years, as accurate theoretical predictions aid the fitting of experimental model Hamiltonians. However, literature examining the predictive quality of a Density Functional Theory (DFT) functional abiding by the Bartlett IP condition is absent. In an attempt to rectify this, we report isotropic hyperfine coupling constant predictions of 24 commonly used DFT functionals on a total of 56 radicals, with the intent of exploring the successes and failures of the Quantum Theory Project (QTP) line of DFT functionals (i.e., CAM-QTP00, CAM-QTP01, CAM-QTP02, and QTP17) for this property. Included in this benchmark study are both small and large organic radicals as well as transition metal complexes, all of which have been studied to some extent in prior work. Subsequent coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) and CCSD withperturbative triples [CCSD(T)] calculations on small and large organic radicals show modest improvement as compared to prior work and offer an additional avenue for evaluation of DFT functional performance. We find that the QTP17 and CAM-QTP00 functionals consistently underperform, despite being parameterized to satisfy an IP eigenvalue condition primarily focused on inner shell electrons. On the other hand, the CAM-QTP01 functional is the most accurate functional in both organic radical datasets. Furthermore, both CAM-QTP01 and CAM-QTP02 are the most accurate functionals tested on the transition metal dataset. A significant portion of functionals were found to have comparable errors (within 5–15 MHz), but the hybrid class of DFT functionals maintains a consistently optimal balance between accuracy and precision across all datasets.},

In this paper, we discuss the impact of higher-order terms originating in double commutators. In analogy to previous studies, we consider the case when only one- and two-body interactions are included in the downfolded Hamiltonians. We demonstrate the efficiency of the many-body expansions involving single and double commutators for the unitary extension of the downfolded Hamiltonians on the example of the beryllium atom, and bond-breaking processes in the Li 2 and H 2 O molecules. For the H 2 O system, we also analyze energies obtained with downfolding procedures as functions of the active space size.},

We present a density matrix based method for Kohn–Sham calculations at high temperatures that eliminates the need for diagonalization entirely, thus reducing the cost of such calculations significantly. Specifically, we develop real-space expressions for the electron density, electronic free energy, Hellmann–Feynman forces, and Hellmann–Feynman stress tensor in terms of an orthonormal auxiliary orbital basis and its density kernel transform, the density kernel being the matrix representation of the density operator in the auxiliary basis. Using Chebyshev filtering to generate the auxiliary basis, we next develop an approach akin to Clenshaw–Curtis spectral quadrature to calculate the individual columns of the density kernel based on the Fermi operator expansion in Chebyshev polynomials and employ a similar approach to evaluate band structure and entropic energy components. We implement the proposed formulation in the SPARC electronic structure code, using which we show systematic convergence of the aforementioned quantities to exact diagonalization results, and obtain significant speedups relative to conventional diagonalization based methods. Finally, we employ the new method to compute the self-diffusion coefficient and viscosity of aluminum at 116 045 K from Kohn–Sham quantum molecular dynamics, where we find agreement with previous more approximate orbital-free density functional methods.},

The ASOP simulation starts by enumerating a series of composition grids, then utilizes SSW-NN to explore the configuration and composition spaces of surface phases, and relies on the Monte Carlo scheme to focus on energetically favorable compositions. The method is applied to silver surface oxide formation under the catalytic ethene epoxidation conditions. The known phases of surface oxides on Ag(111) are reproduced, and new phases on Ag(100) are revealed, which exhibit novel structure features that could be critical for understanding ethene epoxidation. Our results demonstrate that the ASOP method provides an automated and efficient way for probing complex surface structures that are beneficial for designing new functional materials under working conditions.},

To quantify the plasmonic character of the excitations obtained from TD-DFT, the energy-based plasmonicity index is generalized to the framework of DFT, validated on simple systems such as the sodium Na 20 chain and the silver Ag 20 compound, and subsequently successfully applied to more complex molecules. We also compare the quantum mechanical TD-DFT simulations to those obtained from a classical Mie theory that relies on macroscopic electrodynamics to model the light–matter interaction. This comparison allows us to distinguish those features that can be explained classically from those that require a quantum-mechanical treatment. Finally, a double-shell system obtained by placing a C 60 buckyball inside the hollow spherical gold particle is further considered. It is found that the double-shell, while increasing the overall plasmonic character of the excitations, leads to significantly lowered absorption cross sections.},

  abstract = {The Δ natural orbital (ΔNO) two-electron density matrix (2-RDM) and energy expression are derived from a multideterminantal wave function. The approximate ΔNO 2-RDM is combined with an on-top density functional and a double-counting correction to capture electron correlation. A trust-region Newton’s method optimization algorithm for the simultaneous optimization of ΔNO orbitals and occupancies is introduced and compared to the previous iterative diagonalization algorithm. The combination of ΔNO and two different on-top density functionals, Colle–Salvetti (CS) and Opposite-spin exponential cusp and Fermi-hole correction (OF), is assessed on small hydrogen clusters and compared to density functional, single-reference coupled-cluster, and multireference perturbation theory (MRMP2) methods. The ΔNO-CS and ΔNO-OF methods outperform the single-reference methods and are comparable to MRMP2. However, there is a distinct qualitative error in the ΔNO potential energy surface for H 4 compared to the exact. This discrepancy is explained through analysis of the ΔNO orbitals, occupancies, and the two-electron density.},

  abstract = {One-particle Green’s functions obtained from the self-consistent solution of the Dyson equation can be employed in the evaluation of spectroscopic and thermodynamic properties for both molecules and solids. However, typical acceleration techniques used in the traditional quantum chemistry self-consistent algorithms cannot be easily deployed for the Green’s function methods because of a non-convex grand potential functional and a non-idempotent density matrix. Moreover, the optimization problem can become more challenging due to the inclusion of correlation effects, changing chemical potential, and fluctuations of the number of particles. In this paper, we study acceleration techniques to target the self-consistent solution of the Dyson equation directly. We use the direct inversion in the iterative subspace (DIIS), the least-squared commutator in the iterative subspace (LCIIS), and the Krylov space accelerated inexact Newton method (KAIN). We observe that the definition of the residual has a significant impact on the convergence of the iterative procedure. Based on the Dyson equation, we generalize the concept of the commutator residual used in DIIS and LCIIS and compare it with the difference residual used in DIIS and KAIN. The commutator residuals outperform the difference residuals for all considered molecular and solid systems within both GW and GF2. For a number of bond-breaking problems, we found that an easily obtained high-temperature solution with effectively suppressed correlations is a very effective starting point for reaching convergence of the problematic low-temperature solutions through a sequential reduction of temperature during calculations.},

Furthermore, because the heteroatom is represented as a self-loop of unit length in the graph, an odd number of passes of the self-loop will change the parity of the length of the walk. To confirm the aforementioned effects of heteroatoms on conduction in an actual sample, the conduction behavior of meta-connected molecular junctions consisting of a heterocyclic six-membered ring, whose conductive properties have already been experimentally determined, was analyzed based on the enumerated number of walks.},

  abstract = {Many physical systems are well modeled as collections of interacting particles. Nevertheless, a general approach to quantifying the absolute degree of order immediately surrounding a particle has yet to be described. Motivated thus, we introduce a quantity E that captures the amount of pairwise informational redundancy among the bonds formed by a particle. Particles with larger E have less diversity in bond angles and thus simpler neighborhoods. We show that E possesses a number of intuitive mathematical properties, such as increasing monotonicity in the coordination number of Platonic polyhedral geometries. We demonstrate analytically that E is, in principle, able to distinguish a wide range of structures and conjecture that it is maximized by the icosahedral geometry under the constraint of equal sphere packing. An algorithm for computing E is described and is applied to the structural characterization of crystals and glasses. The findings of this study are generally consistent with existing knowledge on the structure of such systems. We compare E to the Steinhardt order parameter Q 6 and polyhedral template matching (PTM). We observe that E has resolution comparable to Q 6 and robustness similar to PTM despite being much simpler than the former and far more informative than the latter.},

  abstract = {Successful functioning of biological cells relies on efficient translocation of different materials across cellular membranes. An important part of this transportation system is membrane channels that are known as antiporters and symporters. They exploit the energy stored as a trans-membrane gradient of one type of molecules to transport the other types of molecules against their gradients. For symporters, the directions of both fluxes for driving and driven species coincide, while for antiporters, the fluxes move in opposite directions. There are surprising experimental observations that despite differing only by the direction of transport fluxes, the molecular mechanisms of translocation adopted by antiporters and symporters seem to be drastically different. We present chemical-kinetic models to quantitatively investigate this phenomenon. Our theoretical approach allows us to explain why antiporters mostly utilize a single-site transportation when only one molecule of any type might be associated with the channel. At the same time, the transport in symporters requires two molecules of different types to be simultaneously associated with the channel. In addition, we investigate the kinetic constraints and efficiency of symporters and compare them with the same properties of antiporters. Our theoretical analysis clarifies some important physical–chemical features of cellular trans-membrane transport.},

This allows bidirectional transmission of forces between the ECM and the cytoskeleton, which tunes intracellular signaling cascades that control survival, proliferation, differentiation, and motility. The quantitative relationships between recruitment of distinct cell–matrix adhesion proteins and local cellular traction forces are not known. Here, we applied quantitative super-resolution microscopy to cell–matrix adhesions formed on fibronectin-stamped elastomeric pillars and developed an approach to relate the number of talin, vinculin, paxillin, and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) molecules to the local cellular traction force. We find that FAK recruitment does not show an association with traction-force application, whereas a ∼60 pN force increase is associated with the recruitment of one talin, two vinculin, and two paxillin molecules on a substrate with an effective stiffness of 47 kPa. On a substrate with a fourfold lower effective stiffness, the stoichiometry of talin:vinculin:paxillin changes to 2:12:6 for the same ∼60 pN traction force. The relative change in force-related vinculin recruitment indicates a stiffness-dependent switch in vinculin function in cell–matrix adhesions. Our results reveal a substrate-stiffness-dependent modulation of the relationship between cellular traction-force and the molecular stoichiometry of cell–matrix adhesions.},

The transport coefficients for electric and pressure fields, namely, the ionic conductivity, Darcy permeability, and cross coupling constant, were calculated based on Kubo’s linear response theory from the corresponding velocity correlation functions and mean square displacements. The effects of the water content of the gel electrolyte and those of the monovalent cationic species were also analyzed. The calculated transport coefficients qualitatively agree with the reported experimental results. The role of the cross coupling constants in determining the functional efficiency of gel electrolytes as pressure sensors or electroactive actuators is discussed.},

  abstract = {The gelation of colloidal particles interacting through a short-range attraction is widely recognized as a consequence of the dynamic arrest of phase separation into colloid-rich and solvent-rich phases. However, the microscopic origin behind the slowing down and dynamic arrest of phase separation remains elusive. In order to access microscopic structural changes through the entire process of gelation in a continuous fashion, we used core–shell fluorescent colloidal particles, laser scanning confocal microscopy, and a unique experimental protocol that allows us to initiate phase separation instantaneously and gently. Combining these enables us to track the trajectories of individual particles seamlessly during the whole phase-separation process from the early stage to the late arresting stage. We reveal that the enhancement of local packing and the resulting formation of locally stable rigid structures slow down the phase-separation process and arrest it to form a gel with an average coordination number of z = 6–7. This result supports a mechanical perspective on the dynamic arrest of sticky-sphere systems based on the microstructure, replacing conventional explanations based on the macroscopic vitrification of the colloid-rich phase. Our findings illuminate the microscopic mechanisms behind the dynamic arrest of colloidal phase separation, the emergence of mechanical rigidity, and the stability of colloidal gels.},

Measurements were performed on thin films with MW ranging from 1.1 to 641 kg/mol. The temperature dependence of the average 8 Li spin–lattice relaxation time ( T 1 avg ) was measured near the free surface and in the bulk. Spin–lattice relaxation is caused by phenyl ring flips, which involve transitions between local minima over free-energy barriers with enthalpic and entropic contributions. We used transition state theory to model the temperature dependence of the γ -relaxation, and hence T 1 avg ⁠ . There is no clear correlation of the average entropy of activation ( Δ ‡ S ̄ ) and enthalpy of activation ( Δ ‡ H ̄ ) with MW, but there is a clear correlation between Δ ‡ S ̄ and Δ ‡ H ̄ ⁠ , i.e., entropy–enthalpy compensation. This results in the average Gibbs energy of activation, Δ ‡ G ̄ ⁠ , being approximately independent of MW. Measurements of the temperature dependence of T 1 avg as a function of depth below the free surface indicate the inherent entropic barrier, i.e., the entropy of activation corresponding to Δ ‡ H ̄ = 0, has an exponential dependence on the distance from the free surface before reaching the bulk value. This results in Δ ‡ G ̄ near the free surface being lower than the bulk. Combining these observations results in a model where the average fluctuation rate of the γ -relaxation has a “double-exponential” depth dependence. This model can explain the depth dependence of 1 / T 1 avg in polystyrene films. The characteristic length of enhanced dynamics is ∼6 nm and approximately independent of MW near room temperature.},

Based on the laws of thermodynamics, the emerging nonequilibrium structures should be characterizable by some “extra free energy” (excess over the equilibrium Helmholtz free energy). Here, we study the nonequilibrium thermodynamics of chain-growth polymerization of ideal chains in a dispersion of free reactive monomers, using off-lattice, reactive Brownian dynamics computer simulations in conjunction with approximative statistical mechanics and relative entropy (Gibbs–Shannon and Kullback–Leibler) concepts. In the case of fast growing polymers, we indeed report increased nonequilibrium free energies Δ F neq of several k B T compared to equilibrium and near-equilibrium, slowly growing chains. Interestingly, Δ F neq is a non-monotonic function of the degree of polymerization and thus also of time. Our decomposition of the thermodynamic contributions shows that the initial dominant extra free energy is stored in the nonequilibrium inhomogeneous density profiles of the free monomer gas (showing density depletion and wakes) in the vicinity of the active center at the propagating polymer end. At later stages of the polymerization process, we report significant extra contributions stored in the nonequilibrium polymer conformations. Finally, our study implies a nontrivial relaxation kinetics and “restoring” of the extra free energy during the equilibration process after polymerization.},

  abstract = {Hydrogen bonds are of paramount importance in the chemistry of clays, mediating the interaction between the clay surface and water, and for some materials between separate layers. It is well-established that the accuracy of a computational model for clays depends on the level of theory at which the electronic structure is treated. However, for hydrogen-bonded systems, the motion of light H nuclei on the electronic potential energy surface is often affected by quantum delocalization. Using path integral molecular dynamics, we show that nuclear quantum effects lead to a relatively small change in the structure of clays, but one that is comparable to the variation incurred by treating the clay at different levels of electronic structure theory. Accounting for quantum effects weakens the hydrogen bonds in clays, with H-bonds between different layers of the clay affected more than those within the same layer; this is ascribed to the fact that the confinement of an H atom inside a layer is independent of its participation in hydrogen-bonding. More importantly, the weakening of hydrogen bonds by nuclear quantum effects causes changes in the vibrational spectra of these systems, significantly shifting the O–H stretching peaks and meaning that in order to fully understand these spectra by computational modeling, both electronic and nuclear quantum effects must be included. We show that after reparameterization of the popular clay forcefield CLAYFF, the O–H stretching region of their vibrational spectra better matches the experimental one, with no detriment to the model’s agreement with other experimental properties.},

  abstract = {Coating gold nanostructures with a silica shell has been long considered for biomedical applications, including photoacoustic imaging. Recent experimental and modeling investigations reported contradicting results concerning the effect of coating on the photoacoustic response of gold nanostructures. Enhanced photoacoustic response is generally attributed to facilitated heat transfer at the gold/silica/water system. Here, we examine the photoacoustic response of gold core–silica shell nanoparticles immersed in water using a combination of the two temperature model and hydrodynamic phase field simulations. Here, of particular interest is the role of the interfacial coupling between the gold electrons and silica shell phonons. We demonstrate that as compared to uncoated nanoparticles, photoacoustic response is enhanced for very thin silica shells (5 nm) and short laser pulses, but for thicker coatings, the photoacoustic performance are generally deteriorated. We extend the study to the regime of nanocavitation and show that the generation of nanobubbles may also play a role in the enhanced acoustic response of core–shell nanoparticles. Our modeling effort may serve as guides for the optimization of the photoacoustic response of heterogeneous metal–dielectric nanoparticles.},

  abstract = {We perform nuclear magnetic resonance, broadband dielectric spectroscopy, and differential scanning calorimetry studies to ascertain the dynamical behaviors of aqueous ethylene glycol (EG) solutions in silica pores over broad temperature ranges. Both translational and rotational motions are analyzed, and the pore diameter (2.4–9.2 nm) and the EG concentration (12–57 mol.\%) are varied, leading to fully liquid or partially crystalline systems. It is found that the translational diffusion coefficient strongly decreases when the diameter is reduced, resulting in a slowdown of nearly three orders of magnitude in the narrowest pores, while the confinement effects on the rotational correlation times are moderate. For the fully liquid solutions, we attribute bulk-like and slowed down reorientation processes to the central and interfacial pore regions, respectively. This coexistence is found in all the studied pores, and, hence, the range of the wall effects on the solution dynamics does not exceed ∼1 nm. Compared to the situation in the bulk, the concentration dependence is reduced in confinements, implying that the specific interactions of the molecular species with the silica walls lead to preferential adsorption. On the other hand, bulk-like structural relaxation is not observed in the partially frozen samples, where the liquid is sandwiched between the silica walls and the ice crystallites. Under such circumstances, there is another relaxation process with a weaker temperature dependence, which is observed in various kinds of partially frozen aqueous systems and denoted as the x process.},

By mixing the ionic liquid with either heavy or light water, the different contributions to the quasielastic broadening could be identified and treated separately. This study was performed at room temperature, which is more than 15 °C above the demixing line. Our results show that even small amounts of water accelerate the diffusion mechanisms considerably. While samples with small water percentage reveal a diffusion process confined within ionic liquid nanodomains, an admixture of more than 15 wt.\% water relieves the confinement. Furthermore, the presence of two water species was identified: one behaving as free water, whereas the other was interpreted as a component bound to the ionic liquid motion. Based on the fact that water preferentially binds to the BF 4 anion, which itself has a negligible contribution to the scattered intensity, our experiments reveal unprecedented information about the microscopic anion dynamics.},

  abstract = {X-ray scattering has been used to characterize glassy itraconazole (ITZ) prepared by cooling at different rates. Faster cooling produces ITZ glasses with lower (or zero) smectic order with more sinusoidal density modulation, larger molecular spacing, and shorter lateral correlation between the rod-like molecules. We find that each glass is characterized by not one, but two fictive temperatures T f (the temperature at which a chosen order parameter is frozen in the equilibrium liquid). The higher T f is associated with the regularity of smectic layers and lateral packing, while the lower T f with the molecular spacings between and within smectic layers. This indicates that different structural features are frozen on different timescales. The two timescales for ITZ correspond to its two relaxation modes observed by dielectric spectroscopy: the slower δ mode (end-over-end rotation) is associated with the freezing of the regularity of molecular packing and the faster α mode (rotation about the long axis) with the freezing of the spacing between molecules. Our finding suggests a way to selectively control the structural features of glasses.},

These findings are put in perspective with results from deuteron nuclear magnetic resonance and with calculations based on dielectrically detected correlation times. This comparison reveals the presence of a wide distribution of correlation times. Furthermore, oxygen-17 central-transition echo spectra were recorded for wide ranges of temperature and pulse spacing. The spectra cannot be described by a single set of quadrupolar parameters, suggesting a distribution of H–O–H opening angles that is broader for high-density than for low-density amorphous ice. Simulations of the pulse separation dependent spin-echo spectra for various scenarios demonstrate that a small-step frequency diffusion process, assigned to the presence of homonuclear oxygen–oxygen interactions, determines the shape evolution of the pulse-separation-dependent spectra.},

  abstract = {If a binary liquid mixture, composed of two alternative species with equal amounts, is quenched from a high temperature to a low temperature, below the critical point of demixing, then the mixture will phase separate through a process known as spinodal decomposition. However, if the two alternative species are allowed to interconvert, either naturally (e.g., the equilibrium interconversion of enantiomers) or forcefully (e.g., via an external source of energy or matter), then the process of phase separation may drastically change. In this case, depending on the nature of interconversion, two phenomena could be observed: either phase amplification, the growth of one phase at the expense of another stable phase, or microphase separation, the formation of nongrowing (steady-state) microphase domains. In this work, we phenomenologically generalize the Cahn–Hilliard theory of spinodal decomposition to include the molecular interconversion of species and describe the physical properties of systems undergoing either phase amplification or microphase separation. We apply the developed phenomenology to accurately describe the simulation results of three atomistic models that demonstrate phase amplification and/or microphase separation. We also discuss the application of our approach to phase transitions in polyamorphic liquids. Finally, we describe the effects of fluctuations of the order parameter in the critical region on phase amplification and microphase separation.},

The relaxation to a metastable state, which occurred prior to crystallization, exhibited nonexponential kinetics with a rate that was dependent on the initial structural configuration.

Chem. Chem. Phys. 21 (4), 1717 (2019)]. The present work employs this direct far-infrared spectroscopic approach to investigate the non-covalent intermolecular forces involved in the micro-solvation of a selection of seven ether molecules with systematically varied alkyl substituents: dimethyl ether, diethyl ether, diisopropyl ether, ethyl methyl ether, t -butyl methyl ether, and t -butyl ethyl ether. The ranking of the observed out-of-plane water librational band signatures for this selected series of ether–water complexes embedded in inert neon matrices at 4 K reveals information about the interplay of directional intermolecular hydrogen bond motifs and non-directional and long-range dispersion interactions for the micro-solvated structures. These far-infrared observables differentiate minor subtle effects introduced by specific alkyl substituents and serve as rigorous experimental benchmarks for modern quantum chemical methodologies of various levels of scalability, which often fail to accurately predict the structural variations and corresponding vibrational signatures of the closely related systems. The accurate interaction energies of the series of ether–water complexes have been predicted by the domain based local pair natural orbital coupled cluster theory with single-, double-, and perturbative triple excitations, followed by a local energy decomposition analysis of the energy components. In some cases, the secondary dispersion forces are in direct competition with the primary intermolecular hydrogen bonds as witnessed by the specific out-of-plane librational signatures.},

Simulations are performed using the Lindblad master equation, where the so-called Lindblad parameters are used to describe the effect of the environment in the dilute gas phase. A phenomenological representation of the parameters is used, and they are extracted from high-resolution spectroscopy line broadening data. An effective Hamiltonian is used for the description of the system down to the rotational level close to experimental accuracy. The quality of both the Hamiltonian and Lindblad parameters is assessed by a comparison of a calculated infrared spectrum with the available experimental data. A single shaped laser pulse is used to perform the control, where elements of optics and pulse shaping using masks are introduced with emphasis on experimental limitations. The optimization procedure, based on gradients, explicitly takes into account the experimental constraints. Control performances are reported for shaping masks of increasing complexity. Although modest performances are obtained, mainly due to the strong pulse shaping constraints, we gain insights into the control mechanism. This work is the first step toward the conception of a realistic experiment that will allow for population characterization and manipulation of a non-stationary vibrational “dark” state. Effects of the collisions on the laser control in the dilute gas phase, leading to decoherence in the molecular system, are clearly shown.},

  abstract = {Mixtures of layered perovskite quantum wells with different sizes form prototypical light-harvesting antenna structures in solution-processed films. Gradients in the bandgaps and energy levels are established by concentrating the smallest and largest quantum wells near opposing electrodes in photovoltaic devices. Whereas short-range energy and charge carrier funneling behaviors have been observed in layered perovskites, our recent work suggests that such light-harvesting processes do not assist long-range charge transport due to carrier trapping at interfaces between quantum wells and interstitial organic spacer molecules. Here, we apply a two-pulse time-of-flight technique to a family of layered perovskite systems to explore the effects that interstitial organic molecules have on charge carrier dynamics. In these experiments, the first laser pulse initiates carrier drift within the active layer of a photovoltaic device, whereas the second pulse probes the transient concentrations of photoexcited carriers as they approach the electrodes. The instantaneous drift velocities determined with this method suggest that the rates of trap-induced carrier deceleration increase with the concentrations of organic spacer cations. Overall, our experimental results and model calculations suggest that the layered perovskite device efficiencies primarily reflect the dynamics of carrier trapping at interfaces between quantum wells and interstitial organic phases.},

Inorganic voltage nanosensors utilize the Quantum Confined Stark Effect (QCSE) to sense local electric fields. Engineered nanoparticles achieve substantial single-particle voltage sensitivity (∼2\% Δλ spectral Stark shift up to ∼30\% ΔF/F per 160 mV) at room temperature due to enhanced charge separation. A dedicated home-built fluorescence microscope records spectrally resolved images to measure the QCSE induced spectral shift at the single-particle level. Biomaterial based surface ligands are designed and developed based on theoretical simulations. The hybrid nanobiomaterials satisfy anisotropic facet-selective coating, enabling effective compartmentalization beyond non-specific staining. Self-spiking- and patched-HEK293 cells and cortical neurons, when stained with hybrid nanobiomaterials, show clear photoluminescence intensity changes in response to membrane potential (MP) changes. Organic voltage nanosensors based on polystyrene beads and nanodisk technology utilize Fluorescence (Förster) Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) to sense local electric fields. Voltage sensing FRET pairs achieve voltage sensitivity up to ∼35\% ΔF/F per 120 mV in cultures. Non-invasive MP recording from individual targeted sites (synapses and spines) with nanodisks has been realized. However, both of these QCSE- and FRET-based voltage nanosensors yet need to reach the milestone of recording individual action potentials from individual targeted sites.},

  abstract = {Dynamic pattern formations are commonly observed in multicellular systems, such as cardiac tissue and slime molds, and modeled using reaction–diffusion systems. Recent experiments have revealed dynamic patterns in the concentration profile of various cortical proteins at a much smaller scale, namely, embryos at their single-cell stage. Spiral waves of Rho and F-actin proteins have been reported in Xenopus frog and starfish oocytes [Bement et al. , Nat. Cell Biol. 17 , 1471 (2015)], while a pulsatile pattern of Rho and myosin proteins has been found in C. elegans embryo [Nishikawa et al. , eLife 6 , e30537 (2017)]. Here, we propose that these two seemingly distinct dynamic patterns are signatures of a single reaction–diffusion network involving active-Rho, inactive-Rho, actin, and myosin. We show that a small variation in the concentration of other ancillary proteins can give rise to different dynamical states from the same chemical network.},

  abstract = {The connection between the adiabatic excitation energy of time-dependent density functional theory and the ground state correlation energy from the adiabatic connection fluctuation–dissipation theorem (ACFDT) is explored in the limiting case of one excited state. An exact expression is derived for any adiabatic Hartree-exchange–correlation kernel that connects the excitation energy and the potential contribution to correlation. The resulting formula is applied to the asymmetric Hubbard dimer, a system where this limit is exact. Results from a hierarchy of approximations to the kernel, including the random phase approximation (RPA) with and without exchange and the adiabatically exact (AE) approximation, are compared to the exact ones. At full coupling, the numerical results indicate a tension between predicting an accurate excitation energy and an accurate potential contribution to correlation. The AE approximation is capable of making accurate predictions of both quantities, but only in parts of the parameter space that classify as weakly correlated, while RPA tends to be unable to accurately predict these properties simultaneously anywhere. For a strongly correlated dimer, the AE approximation greatly overestimates the excitation energy yet continues to yield an accurate ground state correlation energy due to its accurate prediction of the adiabatic connection integrand. If similar trends hold for real systems, the development of correlation kernels will be important for applications of the ACFDT in systems with large potential contributions to correlation.},

In this work, we generalize the grand-isobaric ensemble to mixtures and develop a Monte Carlo algorithm for the rapid determination of entropy in these systems. A key advantage of adiabatic ensembles is the direct connection they provide with entropy. Here, we show how the entropy of a binary mixture A–B can be readily obtained in the adiabatic grand-isobaric ( μ A , μ B , P , R ) ensemble, in which μ A and μ B denote the chemical potential of components A and B, respectively, P is the pressure, and R is the heat (Ray) function, that corresponds to the total energy of the system. This, in turn, allows for the evaluation of the entropy of mixing and the Gibbs free energy of mixing. We also demonstrate that our approach performs very well both on systems modeled with simple potentials and with complex many-body force fields. Finally, this approach provides a direct route to the determination of the thermodynamic properties of mixing and allows for the efficient detection of departures from ideal behavior in mixtures.},

Temperature permutations are performed among more than two replicas in RPM, whereas temperature exchanges are performed between two replicas in the replica-exchange method (REM). The temperature transition in RPM occurs more efficiently than in REM. In REST, only the temperatures of the solute region, the solute temperatures, are exchanged to reduce the number of replicas compared to REM. Therefore, RPST is expected to be an improved method taking advantage of these methods. For comparison, we applied RPST, REST, RPM, and REM to two amyloid-β(16–22) peptides in explicit water. We calculated the transition ratio and the number of tunneling events in the temperature space and the number of dimerization events of amyloid-β(16–22) peptides. The results indicate that, in RPST, the number of replicas necessary for frequent random walks in the temperature and conformational spaces is reduced compared to the other three methods. In addition, we focused on the dimerization process of amyloid-β(16–22) peptides. The RPST simulation with a relatively small number of replicas shows that the two amyloid-β(16–22) peptides form the intermolecular antiparallel β-bridges due to the hydrophilic side-chain contact between Lys and Glu and hydrophobic side-chain contact between Leu, Val, and Phe, which stabilizes the dimer of the peptides.},

We derive the exact solution of this problem and investigate the short-time and long-time asymptotic behaviors of the reaction time probability density.

Because these processes take place at a large range of time and length scales, it is a challenge to model catalytic reactors, especially when dealing with complex surface reactions that cannot be reduced to simple mean-field boundary conditions. As a particle-based mesoscale method, Stochastic Rotation Dynamics (SRD) is well suited for studying problems that include both microscale effects on surfaces and transport phenomena in fluids. In this work, we demonstrate how to simulate heterogeneous catalytic reactors by coupling an SRD fluid with a catalytic surface on which complex surface reactions are explicitly modeled. We provide a theoretical background for modeling different stages of heterogeneous surface reactions. After validating the simulation method for surface reactions with mean-field assumptions, we apply the method to non-mean-field reactions in which surface species interact with each other through a Monte Carlo scheme, leading to island formation on the catalytic surface. We show the potential of the method by simulating a more complex three-step reaction mechanism with reactant dissociation.},

Here, we study the performance, generalizability, and explainability of the quantum mechanics-augmented graph neural network (ml-QM-GNN) architecture as applied to the prediction of regioselectivity (classification) and of activation energies (regression). In our hybrid QM-augmented model architecture, structure-based representations are first used to predict a set of atom- and bond-level reactivity descriptors derived from density functional theory calculations. These estimated reactivity descriptors are combined with the original structure-based representation to make the final reactivity prediction. We demonstrate that our model architecture leads to significant improvements over structure-based GNNs in not only overall accuracy but also in generalization to unseen compounds. Even when provided training sets of only a couple hundred labeled data points, the ml-QM-GNN outperforms other state-of-the-art structure-based architectures that have been applied to these tasks as well as descriptor-based (linear) regressions. As a primary contribution of this work, we demonstrate a bridge between data-driven predictions and conceptual frameworks commonly used to gain qualitative insights into reactivity phenomena, taking advantage of the fact that our models are grounded in (but not restricted to) QM descriptors. This effort results in a productive synergy between theory and data science, wherein QM-augmented models provide a data-driven confirmation of previous qualitative analyses, and these analyses in turn facilitate insights into the decision-making process occurring within ml-QM-GNNs.},

We apply two different models, the Hamiltonian vibration model (HVM) and bath vibration model (BVM), to a monomer and a homodimer. In the HVM, we specifically include the vibronic states in the Hamiltonian capturing vibronic quenching, whereas in the BVM, all vibrational details are contained within the bath and described by an underdamped spectral density. The resultant spectra are analyzed in terms of energetic peak position and thermodynamic broadening precision in order to evaluate the efficacy of the two models. The HVM produces 2D spectra with accurate peak positional information, while the BVM is well suited to modeling dynamic peak broadening. For the monomer, both models produce equivalent spectra in the limit where additional damping associated with the underdamped vibration in the BVM approaches zero. This is supported by analytical results. However, for the homodimer, the BVM spectra are redshifted with respect to the HVM due to an absence of vibronic quenching in the BVM. The computational efficiency of the two models is also discussed in order to inform us of the most appropriate use of each method.},

  abstract = {The Raman vibrational frequency shifts of pure parahydrogen and orthodeuterium clusters of sizes N = 4–9 are calculated using the Langevin equation path integral ground state method. The shifts are calculated using three different methods; the results obtained from each are compared to experiment and variance properties are assessed. The first method requires the direct calculation of energies from two simulations: one when the cluster is in the v = 0 vibrational state and one when the cluster has v = 1 total quantum of vibration. The shift is directly calculated from the difference in those two energies. The second method requires only a v = 0 simulation to be performed. The ground state energy is calculated as usual and the excited state energy is calculated by using the distribution of the v = 0 simulation and the ratio of the density matrices between the v = 1 state and the v = 0 state. The shift is calculated from the difference in those two energies. These first two are both exact methods. The final method is based on perturbation theory where the shift is calculated by averaging the pairwise difference potential over the pair distribution function. However, this is an approximate approach. It is found that for large enough system sizes, despite the approximations, the perturbation theory method has the strongest balance between accuracy and precision when weighing against computational cost.},

Our DDFT predicts the electrode charge Q ( t ) to form exponentially with two timescales: at early times, the system relaxes on the RC time, namely, λ D L /[ D (2 + σ / λ D )], with λ D being the Debye length, L being the electrode separation, σ being the ion diameter, and D being the ionic diffusivity. Contrasting an earlier DDFT study, this early-time response does not depend on the applied potential. At late times, the capacitor relaxes with a relaxation time proportional to the diffusion time L 2 / D .},

  abstract = {Heterogeneity is ubiquitous in stem cells (SC), cancer cells (CS), and cancer SC (CSC). This heterogeneity manifests in the form of diverse sub-populations of SC, CS, and CSC with self-renewal and unique regeneration capacity. Moreover, the progeny of CSC possess multiple plasticity and cancerous characteristics. Many studies have demonstrated that cancer heterogeneity is among the greatest obstacles to successful anti-cancer therapy. This leads to incomplete therapy and transitory efficacy. Furthermore, numerous micro-metastases lead to the spread of tumor cells widely across the body; this is the beginning of metastasis. Epigenetic processes (DNA methylation and histone remodification) represent sources of heterogeneity. In this study, we develop a mathematical model to quantify the heterogeneity of SC, CS, and CSC, taking into consideration both genetic and epigenetic effects. We reveal the roles and physical mechanisms of heterogeneity in SC, CSC, and cancer cells. Under the adiabatic regime (relatively fast regulatory binding and effective coupling among genes), seven native states (SC, CSC, cancer, premalignant, normal, lesion, and hyperplasia) emerge. Under the non-adiabatic regime (relatively slow regulatory binding and effective weak coupling among genes), SC, CS, CSC, and differentiated states emerge and become diffusive, partially explaining the origin of heterogeneity. In other words, slow regulatory binding that mimics epigenetic effects can give rise to heterogeneity. Moreover, we calculated the entropy production rate and Fano factor, which can be used to quantify the thermodynamic cost and the degrees of the variations or the fluctuations as the parameter ω (representing the speed of regulatory binding/unbinding relative to the synthesis/degradation) changes. Elucidating the origins of heterogeneity and the dynamical relationships between intra-tumoral cells has a clear clinical significance and will improve the understanding of the cellular basis of treatment response, therapeutic resistance, and cancer metastasis.},

Recently, studies revealed that the net orientation of interfacial water strongly depends on the headgroup electrostatics, i.e., the charges and dipole generated by the phosphate and the choline groups. In order to characterize interfacial H-bond dynamics, we measured two-dimensional infrared spectra of the ester carbonyl band and performed molecular dynamics simulations in fully hydrated 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and 2-((2,3-bis(oleoyloxy)propyl)-dimethyl-ammonio)ethyl ethyl phosphate (DOCPe) lipid bilayers. The experiments and simulations suggest that the reverse dipole generated by the inverted-headgroup in DOCPe does not affect the carbonyl H-bond populations or the interfacial water H-bond dynamics. However, while phosphate-associated waters in both lipids appear to show a similar H-bond structure, carbonyl-associated waters are characterized by a slightly disrupted H-bond structure in the DOCPe bilayer, especially within the second hydration shell. Our findings show that changes in net water orientation perturb the water H-bonds at the linker region between the headgroup and the lipid tail, although this perturbation is weak.},

  abstract = {Vibrational energy flow in the many degrees of freedom in proteins governs energy-barrier-crossing processes, such as conformational exchanges and thermal reactions. The intensity of anti-Stokes Raman bands arises from vibrationally excited populations and can thus function as a selective probe for the excess energy. Time-resolved observations of the anti-Stokes ultraviolet resonance Raman (UVRR) intensity of amino acid residues provide information about the flow of excess energy in proteins, with the spatial resolution of an amino acid residue. The answer to the question of whether the extent of vibrational excitation in any given vibrational modes reflects the extent of excitation in the whole molecule under nonequilibrium conditions is not straightforward. Here, we calculated the occupation probabilities of vibrational states for model compounds of amino acids under equilibrium and nonequilibrium conditions. At a given temperature, the occupation probability of the model compound of tryptophan under nonequilibrium conditions was nearly identical to that under equilibrium conditions at high temperature. Thus, the anti-Stokes band intensities of Trp residues in the nonequilibrium condition indicate the temperature of the molecules with equivalent energy in the equilibrium condition. In addition, we showed that the temperatures calculated on the basis of two UVRR bands of tryptophan in a time-resolved spectrum agreed with each other within the experimental uncertainty. The present results demonstrate that anti-Stokes UVRR bands of Trp residues serve as an excellent spectroscopic thermometer for determining the local temperature in proteins under nonequilibrium conditions.},

  abstract = {The demand for Li secondary batteries is increasing, with the need for batteries with a higher level of performance and improved safety features. The use of a highly concentrated aqueous electrolyte solution is an effective way to increase the safety of batteries because it is possible to use “water-in-salt” (WIS) and “hydrate-melt” (HM) electrolytes for practical applications. These electrolytes exhibit a potential window of &gt;3.0 V, which is attributed to the difference between the HOMO and the LUMO energies of the n orbital of the pure water molecules and that of the water molecules in the hydration shells of a metal ion, according to theoretical predictions. Thus, in the present study, the attenuated total reflectance (ATR)-far-ultraviolet (FUV) spectra of water and super-concentrated aqueous solutions, such as WIS and HM using a Li salt, were experimentally investigated. The effects of anions, cations, and deuteriums on the ATR-FUV spectra were examined. The ATR-FUV method is an excellent means of studying highly concentrated aqueous salt solutions. The results suggest that the transition energy of water molecules in an ultrahighly concentrated aqueous electrolyte containing HM and WIS increased by nearly 0.4 eV (corresponding to an energy shift of over 10 nm) compared to an aqueous electrolyte with a typical water concentration. It was also revealed that the transition energy of water changes depending on the environment of the non-bonding electron, which is directly connected with or affected by hydrogen bonding with other water molecules or directly connected with Li + .},

Polymer light-emitting device performance and color purity can be significantly improved by forming β-phase segments. However, the role of the β-phase on energy transfer (ET) among glassy F8, β-phase, and F8/BSP CT state is unclear. Herein, we identify dynamic molecular conformation-controlled ET from locally excited states to either the CT state or β-phase in light-emitting copolymers. By conducting single-molecule spectroscopy for single F8-5\% BSP chains, we find inefficient intra-chain ET from glassy segments to the CT state, while efficient ET from the glassy to the β-phase. Spontaneous and reversible CT on–off emission is observed both in the presence and absence of the β-phase. The density functional theory calculations reveal the origin of the on-chain CT state and indicate this CT emission on–off switching behavior could be related to molecule torsional motion between BSP and F8 units. The population of the CT state by ET can be increased via through-space interaction between the F8 block and the BSP unit on a self-folded chain. Temperature-dependent single-molecule spectroscopy confirms such interaction showing a gradual increase in intensity of the CT emission with the temperature. Based on these observations, we propose the dynamic molecular motion-induced conformation change as the origin of the glassy-to-CT ET, and thermal energy may provide the activation for such a change to enhance the ET from glassy or β-phases to the CT state.},

  abstract = {Kinetics of singlet fission (SF) in molecular semiconductors, i.e., spontaneous splitting of the excited singlet state into a pair of triplet (T) excitons, is known to be strongly affected by geminate annihilation of created TT-pairs. In our work, we analyze in detail the specific properties of SF-kinetics in highly anisotropic molecular crystals (in which T-excitons undergo strongly anisotropic hopping migration) within the earlier proposed two-state model (TSM). This model allows for accurate treatment of the characteristic effects of anisotropic relative migration of T-excitons and TT-interaction on SF-kinetics, describing these effects within the approximation, that assumes kinetic coupling of two states: the [TT]-state of interacting TT-pairs and the [T + T]-state of freely migrating T-excitons. The TSM makes it possible to represent the TT-migration and interaction effects in terms of lattice-migration Green’s functions, accurate analytical formulas that are obtained in this work. The TSM is applied to the analysis of SF-kinetics in rubrene single crystals, recently measured in a wide range of times (0.1 ns &lt; t &lt; 10 4 ns). The analysis enables one to obtain important information on specific properties of SF-kinetics in highly anisotropic crystals. In particular, the observed specific “hump” of SF-kinetics at intermediate times can be treated as a manifestation of the TT-coupling in the [TT]-state. It is also found that the characteristic asymptotic time-dependence of SF-kinetics ( ∼ t − 3 / 2 ) can markedly be distorted by spin relaxation in TT-pairs.},

Here, we demonstrate that the interlayer vdW interactions can be engineered by tuning the sizes of bottom-up synthesized NGs to control the interfacial electronic coupling strength and, thus, the CT process in NG–Gr vdWHs. By increasing the dimensions of NGs from 42 to 96 sp 2 carbon atoms in the polyaromatic core to enhance the interfacial coupling strength, we find that the CT efficiency and rate in NG–Gr vdWHs display a drastic increase of one order of magnitude, despite the fact that the interfacial energy driving the CT process is unfavorably reduced. Our results shed light on the CT mechanism and provide an effective knob to tune the electronic coupling at NG–Gr interfaces by controlling the size-dependent vdW interactions.},

We show that the HHG spectrum is controlled by both the electric field and the vector potential. The electronic band structure and the laser-matter energy transfer play an important role in determining the laser polarization for optimal HHG in the hBN crystal.

In this paper, we use the excess two-body entropy S 2 and tetrahedrality n tet as the per-particle local structural order parameters to explore such correlations in a three-dimensional model glass subjected to cyclic shear deformation. We first show that for both liquid configurations and the corresponding inherent structures, local ordering increases upon lowering temperature, signaled by a decrease in the two-body entropy and an increase in tetrahedrality. When the inherent structures, or glasses, are periodically sheared athermally, they eventually reach absorbing states for small shear amplitudes, which do not change from one cycle to the next. Large strain amplitudes result in the formation of shear bands, within which particle motion is diffusive. We show that in the steady state, there is a clear difference in the local structural environment of particles that will be part of plastic rearrangements during the next shear cycle and that of particles that are immobile. In particular, particles with higher S 2 and lower n tet are more likely to go through rearrangements irrespective of the average energies of the configurations and strain amplitude. For high shear, we find very distinctive local order outside the mobile shear band region, where almost 30\% of the particles are involved in icosahedral clusters, contrasting strongly with the fraction of &lt; 5\% found inside the shear band.},

Although FC 31 P studies are still instrumentally demanding, together with FC 1 H data, they provide site-resolved information. A crossover from dipolar relaxation at low frequencies to relaxation determined by chemical shift anisotropy at high frequencies and probed by conventional NMR is identified. A comparison is made between dielectric (DS) and depolarized light scattering (DLS) relaxation spectra demonstrating similar behavior close to T g , including an excess wing contribution for m -TCP. The time constants of 31 P NMR and DLS, probing the molecular core, agree. The 1 H data monitoring the dynamics of the phenyl groups yield slightly shorter correlation times. At high temperatures, the DS relaxation spectra show a bimodal character: a fast component in agreement with 1 H data, and a slow component much slower than 31 P NMR and DLS suggest. We discuss the possible origins of the slow component. All time constants tend to merge toward T g . Hence, we propose that site-specific dynamics disappear and a common α -relaxation establishes near T g . In addition, we compare the diffusion coefficient D ( T ) determined by FC and static field gradient 1 H NMR. Concerning TBP, we present FC 31 P data of both α - and β -processes. Regarding the latter, we compare the DS and NMR susceptibility on absolute scale, yielding a significantly stronger β -relaxation in the 31 P NMR spectra.},

  abstract = {We perform molecular dynamics simulations of ionic liquids that are confined between amorphous silica surfaces and composed of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium [C 4 mim] cations and tetrafluoroborate [BF 4 ], hexafluorophosphate [PF 6 ], or bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide [TFSI] anions. Near the silica surfaces, we observe strong slowdowns of ion dynamics, which involve mainly two layers of ions and amount to about two orders of magnitude, depending on temperature and anion type. For a detailed investigation of the slow interfacial dynamics, we determine the adsorption sites of the various anion species on the amorphous silica surfaces and ascertain the repopulation dynamics of these sites. The analysis reveals that the mean residence times show a broad distribution, where anions stay longer at sites, which provide better opportunities for hydrogen bonding. Furthermore, the mean residence times follow Arrhenius laws, providing access to site-specific activation energies E i . The distributions G ( E i ) have Gaussian shape with mean values from ∼0.40 eV for TFSI to ∼0.48 eV for PF 6 and standard deviations of about 0.31 eV. Thus, the amorphous silica surfaces impose static and disordered energy landscapes to the neighboring liquid, which have considerable ruggedness and, in this way, substantially hinder ion rearrangements. We discuss that qualitatively similar situations are expected for all kinds of confined liquids.},

The dissociation product of the CHO radical has an appearance time of about 540 fs, which agrees well with the measured ISC relaxation time constant of 430 fs.

  abstract = {Water molecules trapped in rare gas matrices exhibit conspicuous shifts in their far-infrared (FIR), rotranslational spectral features compared with the corresponding transitions observed in the gas phase. These confinement-induced perturbations have been related not only to the quantization of translational motion but also to the coupling between the orientational and positional degrees of freedom: the rotation–translation coupling (RTC). As the propensity displayed by the nuclear spin isomers (NSI) of water to undergo interconversion in confinement is intimately related to how its nuclear spin degrees of freedom are coupled with those for intra- and intermolecular motions, confinement-induced RTC should also strongly impact the NSI interconversion mechanisms and rates. Insight into the rotranslational dynamics for H 2 16 O ⁠ , H 2 17 O ⁠ , and H 2 18 O ⁠ , confined in argon and krypton matrices, is provided here based on the evolution of rotranslational spectra induced by NSI interconversion while a definitive assignment is provided from the transition energies and intensities calculated using the confined rotor model [Paper I, Wespiser et al. , J. Chem. Phys. 156 , 074304 (2021)]. In order to build a complete rotranslational energy diagram of confined water, which is fundamental to understand the NSI interconversion rates, the energy difference between the ground ortho and para rotranslational states is derived from the temperature dependence of the intensity ratio of mid-infrared lines emerging from these states. These investigations should provide deeper insight of the factors that control NSI interconversion of water isotopologues under extreme confinement.},

The confined rotor model is used here to reveal how the quantized rotational and frustrated translational energy levels of confined water interact and mix by way of the confinement-induced rotation-translation coupling (RTC). An eccentric but otherwise isotropic 3D harmonic effective potential is used to account for confinement effects, thereby allowing the dependence of the magnitude of the RTC on the topology of the model confinement potential, the resulting intricate mixing schemes, and their impact on the RT energy levels to be examined in detail. The confined rotor model thus provides a convenient framework to investigate the matrix and isotope effects on the RT dynamics of water under extreme confinement probed spectroscopically, thereby potentially providing insight into the mechanisms and rates for ortho -H 2 O ↔ para -H 2 O nuclear spin isomer interconversion in confined water.},

For fast modulation, extra 2 ω eg and 2 ω fe peaks may obscure the g – f transitions in the classical two-photon absorption (CTPA) spectra for nearly resonant e states. These peaks arise from one-photon resonant g – e or e – f transitions. In the slow modulation limit, these peaks vanish because of the short tails of the Gaussian line shape. CTPA strongly depends on the correlations between energy fluctuations. In entangled two-photon absorption, the extra peaks are eliminated because of the broad one-photon but narrow two-photon spectrum of the twin photons. The variation of the coherences between f states with the correlation between energy fluctuations is explored.},

  abstract = {We study the three-dimensional correlated motion of an electron and a proton. In one situation, the dynamics is restricted to the electronic ground state and is, thus, well described within the Born–Oppenheimer (BO) approximation. The probability and flux densities yield information about the coupled dynamics. Because the electronic flux density vanishes if determined from the BO wave function, another flux density is regarded, which provides insight into the directional motion of the electron. This flux density can be calculated within the BO approximation and agrees numerically well with the one derived from the full-dimensional calculation. Starting in the first excited electronic state at a similar geometry as chosen for the ground state dynamics results in a short-time dynamics that takes place in the same regions of the configuration space. Adopting the picture that evolves from the adiabatic expansion of the wave function, the nuclear wave packet motion in the two coupled adiabatic electronic states proceeds through a ring of conical intersections (CIs), which is accompanied by an effective population transfer. Nevertheless, the total nuclear probability and flux densities resemble very much those obtained for the ground state dynamics. While passing the CI, the electronic densities remain nearly constant, as expected for a diabatic dynamics. This confirms the conclusions obtained from our former two-dimensional study, namely, that also in three-dimensional space the wave packet dynamics does not exhibit features of the non-adiabatic dynamics.},

Here, we quantify the plasmon-like character of the excited states of silver nanorods and nanowires based on three nearly orthogonal criteria: (1) collectivity, (2) dipole additivity, and (3) superatomic character. Based on these three criteria, we classify the excited states as plasmon-like, collective, single-particle, interband, or as intermediate between these categories. We show that linear nanowires have a longitudinal absorption peak that has single-particle character and a transverse absorption peak that evolves from a single-particle to plasmon-like to a mix of plasmon-like and interband with increasing length. Increasing the width tends to increase the plasmon-like character of the longitudinal excited state. In contrast, increasing the nanorod width tends to decrease the length at which interband transitions start mixing significantly into the transverse plasmon-like excited states.},

In this paper, as an example, we focus on the barrier for hydrogen diffusion on a α -Al 2 O 3 (0001) surface, aiming for a couple cluster singles, doubles, and perturbative triples [CCSD(T)]-level benchmark. We employ the density functional theory (DFT) optimized minimum and transition state structures reported by Heiden, Usvyat, and Saalfrank [J. Phys. Chem. C 123 , 6675 (2019)]. The barrier is first evaluated at the periodic Hartree–Fock and local Møller–Plesset second-order perturbation (MP2) level of theory. The possible sources of errors are then analyzed, which includes basis set incompleteness error, frozen core, density fitting, local approximation errors, as well as the MP2 method error. Using periodic and embedded fragment models, corrections to these errors are evaluated. In particular, two corrections are found to be non-negligible (both from the chemical accuracy perspective and at the scale of the barrier value of 0.72 eV): the correction to the frozen core-approximation of 0.06 eV and the CCSD(T) correction of 0.07 eV. Our correlated wave function results are compared to barriers obtained from DFT. Among the tested DFT functionals, the best performing for this barrier is B3LYP-D3.},

One way to analyze 2D POLIM data is to apply a so-called single funnel approximation (SFA). The SFA allows for quantitative assessment of energy transfer between chromophores with identical spectra [homo-FRET (Förster resonance energy transfer)]. In this paper, we run a series of computer experiments to investigate the applicability of the analysis based on the SFA to various systems ranging from single multichromophoric systems to isotropic ensembles. By setting various scenarios of energy transfer between individual chromophores within a single object, we were able to define the borders of the practical application of SFA. It allowed us to reach a more comprehensive interpretation of the experimental data in terms of uncovering the internal arrangement of chromophores in the system and energy transfer between them. We also found that the SFA can always formally explain the data for isotropic ensembles and derived a formula connecting the energy funneling efficiency parameter and traditional fluorescence anisotropy.},

  abstract = {Titanium dioxide has been extensively studied in the rutile or anatase phase, while its high-pressure phases are less well-understood, despite that many are thought to have interesting optical, mechanical, and electrochemical properties. First-principles methods, such as density functional theory (DFT), are often used to compute the enthalpies of TiO 2 phases at 0 K, but they are expensive and, thus, impractical for long time scale and large system-size simulations at finite temperatures. On the other hand, cheap empirical potentials fail to capture the relative stabilities of various polymorphs. To model the thermodynamic behaviors of ambient and high-pressure phases of TiO 2 , we design an empirical model as a baseline and then train a machine learning potential based on the difference between the DFT data and the empirical model. This so-called Δ-learning potential contains long-range electrostatic interactions and predicts the 0 K enthalpies of stable TiO 2 phases that are in good agreement with DFT. We construct a pressure–temperature phase diagram of TiO 2 in the range 0 &lt; P &lt; 70 GPa and 100 &lt; T &lt; 1500 K. We then simulate dynamic phase transition processes by compressing anatase at different temperatures. At 300 K, we predominantly observe an anatase-to-baddeleyite transformation at about 20 GPa via a martensitic two-step mechanism with a highly ordered and collective atomic motion. At 2000 K, anatase can transform into cotunnite around 45–55 GPa in a thermally activated and probabilistic manner, accompanied by diffusive movement of oxygen atoms. The pressures computed for these transitions show good agreement with experiments. Our results shed light on how to synthesize and stabilize high-pressure TiO 2 phases, and our method is generally applicable to other functional materials with multiple polymorphs.},

  abstract = {We develop a novel data-driven approach to the inverse problem of classical statistical mechanics: Given the experimental data on the collective motion of a classical many-body system, how does one characterize the free energy landscape of that system? By combining non-parametric Bayesian inference with physically motivated constraints, we develop an efficient learning algorithm that automates the construction of approximate free-energy functionals. In contrast to optimization-based machine learning approaches, which seek to minimize a cost function, the central idea of the proposed Bayesian inference is to propagate a set of prior assumptions through the model, derived from physical principles. The experimental data are used to probabilistically weigh the possible model predictions. This naturally leads to humanly interpretable algorithms with full uncertainty quantification of predictions. In our case, the output of the learning algorithm is a probability distribution over a family of free energy functionals, consistent with the observed particle data. We find that surprisingly small data samples contain sufficient information for inferring highly accurate analytic expressions of the underlying free-energy functionals, making our algorithm highly data efficient. In particular, we consider classical particle systems with excluded volume interactions, which are ubiquitous in nature, while being highly challenging in terms of free energy modeling. We validate our approach on the paradigmatic case of one-dimensional fluid and develop inference algorithms for the canonical and grand-canonical statistical–mechanical ensembles. Extensions to higher dimensional systems are conceptually straightforward, while standard coarse-graining techniques allow one to easily incorporate attractive interactions.},

Explicit working equations for a scheme referred to as IP-UCC3 are given, providing electron-detachment energies and spectroscopic amplitudes of electron-detached states dominated by one-hole excitations correct through third order. In the derivation, an expansion of the UCC transformed Hamiltonian involving Bernoulli numbers as expansion coefficients is employed. Both the secular matrix and the effective transition moments are shown to be essentially equivalent to the strict third-order algebraic-diagrammatic construction scheme for the electron propagator (IP-ADC). Interestingly, due to the Bernoulli expansion, neglecting triple substitutions in the UCC expansion manifold does not affect the third-order consistency of the IP-UCC effective transition moments. Finally, the equivalence between ADC and UCC excited-state schemes is shown to not hold in fourth or higher order due to a different treatment of the correlated excited-state basis.},

  abstract = {The production of sequence-specific copolymers using copolymer templates is fundamental to the synthesis of complex biological molecules and is a promising framework for the synthesis of synthetic chemical complexes. Unlike the superficially similar process of self-assembly, however, the development of synthetic systems that implement templated copying of copolymers under constant environmental conditions has been challenging. The main difficulty has been overcoming product inhibition or the tendency of products to adhere strongly to their templates—an effect that gets exponentially stronger with the template length. We develop coarse-grained models of copolymerization on a finite-length template and analyze them through stochastic simulation. We use these models first to demonstrate that product inhibition prevents reliable template copying and then ask how this problem can be overcome to achieve cyclic production of polymer copies of the right length and sequence in an autonomous and chemically driven context. We find that a simple addition to the model is sufficient to generate far longer polymer products that initially form on, and then separate from, the template. In this approach, some of the free energy of polymerization is diverted into disrupting copy–template bonds behind the leading edge of the growing copy copolymer. By additionally weakening the final copy–template bond at the end of the template, the model predicts that reliable copying with a high yield of full-length, sequence-matched products is possible over large ranges of parameter space, opening the way to the engineering of synthetic copying systems that operate autonomously.},

  abstract = {In the new field of quantum plasmonics, plasmonic excitations of silver and gold nanoparticles are utilized to manipulate and control light–matter interactions at the nanoscale. While quantum plasmons can be described with atomistic detail using Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (DFT), such studies are computationally challenging due to the size of the nanoparticles. An efficient alternative is to employ DFT without approximations only for the relatively fast ground state calculations and use tight-binding approximations in the demanding linear response calculations. In this work, we use this approach to investigate the nature of plasmonic excitations under the variation of the separation distance between two nanoparticles. We thereby provide complementary characterizations of these excitations in terms of Kohn–Sham single–orbital transitions, intrinsic localized molecular fragment orbitals, scaling of the electron–electron interactions, and probability of electron tunneling between monomers.},

  abstract = {Strategies for machine-learning (ML)-accelerated discovery that are general across material composition spaces are essential, but demonstrations of ML have been primarily limited to narrow composition variations. By addressing the scarcity of data in promising regions of chemical space for challenging targets such as open-shell transition-metal complexes, general representations and transferable ML models that leverage known relationships in existing data will accelerate discovery. Over a large set (∼1000) of isovalent transition-metal complexes, we quantify evident relationships for different properties (i.e., spin-splitting and ligand dissociation) between rows of the Periodic Table (i.e., 3 d /4 d metals and 2 p /3 p ligands). We demonstrate an extension to the graph-based revised autocorrelation (RAC) representation (i.e., eRAC) that incorporates the group number alongside the nuclear charge heuristic that otherwise overestimates dissimilarity of isovalent complexes. To address the common challenge of discovery in a new space where data are limited, we introduce a transfer learning approach in which we seed models trained on a large amount of data from one row of the Periodic Table with a small number of data points from the additional row. We demonstrate the synergistic value of the eRACs alongside this transfer learning strategy to consistently improve model performance. Analysis of these models highlights how the approach succeeds by reordering the distances between complexes to be more consistent with the Periodic Table, a property we expect to be broadly useful for other material domains.},

We thereby document the existence of a deep and close stochastic relationship between them, resulting in the subtle balance between fluctuations in the magnitude and direction of the self-propulsion velocity. Besides illustrating the relation between these two common models, the PAM can generate additional offsprings, interpolating between ABP and AOUP dynamics, that could provide more suitable models for a large class of living and inanimate active matter systems, possessing characteristic distributions of their self-propulsion velocity. Our general model is evaluated in the presence of a harmonic external confinement. For this reference example, we present a two-state phase diagram that sheds light on the transition in the shape of the positional density distribution from a unimodal Gaussian for AOUPs to a Mexican-hat-like profile for ABPs.},

Beside the challenges of PES fitting and fitting set generation, one also has to choose an electronic structure method capable of delivering accurate potential energy values for all geometries in the fitting set, even in regions far from equilibrium. Such regions are often plagued by Hartree–Fock (HF) convergence issues, and even if convergence is achieved, self-consistent field (SCF) procedures that are used to obtain HF solutions offer no guarantee that the solution found is the lowest-energy solution. We present a study of the reactant regions of CH 3 OH + OH·, C 2 H 6 + F·, and CH 3 NH 2 + Cl·, where the SCF procedure often converges to a higher-energy state or fails to converge, resulting in erratic post-HF energies and regions where no energy is obtained, both of which are major obstacles for PES development. We introduce a pragmatic method for automatically finding better HF solutions (dubbed ManyHF) and present evidence that it may extend the applicability of single-reference methods to some systems previously thought to require multireference methods.},

  abstract = {Photosystem II (PSII) uses light energy to split water into protons, electrons, and oxygen, ultimately sustaining heterotrophic life on Earth. The major light harvesting complex in plants (LHCII) is packed with chlorophylls and carotenoids and is the main supplier of excitation energy to PSII reaction centers. The protein scaffold acts as a programmed solvent for the pigments in LHCII, tuning their orientations while at the same time impeding concentration quenching to ensure efficient storage of excitation energy by chlorophylls. However, under stress, the very fuel of PSII, solar photons, can damage its delicate inner components and hamper photosynthesis. In a crucial regulatory strategy in plants, LHCII evolved a flexible design that allows it to switch between light-harvesting and dissipative conformations, thereby safely releasing the excess energy that is absorbed into heat. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain chlorophyll de-excitation pathways in LHCII, such as chlorophyll–chlorophyll charge transfer states, resonance energy transfer from chlorophylls to a carotenoid S1 state, and chlorophyll–carotenoid reductive energy transfer. This Perspective critically assesses the listed proposals, addressing both the physical mechanism of quenching and the nature of the quenching pigment. These hypotheses are then discussed in the context of state-of-the-art biochemical, physiological, and genetic knowledge to scrutinize their likeliness to occur in the native thylakoid membranes.},

  abstract = {Single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy allows direct, real-time observation of dynamic photophysical changes in light harvesting complexes. The Anti-Brownian ELectrokinetic (ABEL) trap is one such single-molecule method with useful advantages. This approach is particularly well-suited to make detailed spectroscopic measurements of pigment–protein complexes in a solution phase because it enables extended-duration single-molecule observation by counteracting Brownian motion. This Perspective summarizes recent contributions by the authors and others that have utilized the unique capabilities of the ABEL trap to advance our understanding of phycobiliproteins and the phycobilisome complex, the primary light-harvesting apparatus of cyanobacteria. Monitoring the rich spectroscopic data from these measurements, which include brightness, fluorescence lifetime, polarization, and emission spectra, among other measurable parameters, has provided direct characterization of pigments and energy transfer pathways in the phycobilisome, spanning scales from single pigments and monomeric phycobiliproteins to higher order oligomers and protein–protein interactions of the phycobilisome complex. Importantly, new photophysical states and photodynamics were observed to modulate the flow of energy through the phycobilisome and suggest a previously unknown complexity in phycobilisome light harvesting and energy transport with a possible link to photoadaptive or photoprotective functions in cyanobacteria. Beyond deepening our collective understanding of natural light-harvesting systems, these and future discoveries may serve as inspiration for engineering improved artificial light-harvesting technologies.},

A significant obstacle limiting their development as therapeutics is the lack of an ability to predict their membrane permeability. We use molecular dynamics simulations to assess the ability of a set of widely used parameters in describing the membrane permeability of a set of model cyclic peptides; the parameters include polar surface area (PSA), the number of hydrogen bonds, and transfer free energy between an aqueous phase and a membrane mimicking phase. These parameters were found to generally correlate with the membrane permeability of the set of cyclic peptides. We propose two new descriptors, the charge reweighted PSA and the non-polar surface area to PSA ratio; both show enhanced correlation with membrane permeability. This inspired us to explore crosslinking of the peptide to reduce the accessible surface area of the backbone polar atoms, and we find that this can indeed result in reductions in the accessible PSA. This gives reason to speculate that crosslinking may result in increased permeability, thus suggesting a new scaffold for the development of cyclic peptides as potential therapeutics.},

The x-ray diffraction patterns revealed that samples have a cubic structure with Fm 3 ̄ m space group and no change in the crystallite structure was observed with doping Gd 3+ ions. The crystallite size ( D c ) decreases from 2.70 to 1.27 nm when Gd is doped into Ni/NiO MNPs. Transmission electron microscopy analysis revealed that the Ni/NiO MNPs with Gd(5\%) concentration are formed as spherical multicore-like shape core/shell MNPs with a protective PVP layer. The magnetic hysteresis measurements taken at 10 and 300 K show that the saturation magnetization ( M s ) decreases with increasing Gd 3+ ions in the structure. The highest effective magnetic moment ( μ eff ) was obtained as 10.34 μ B in the NG-2 sample. We ascribe that the high μ eff value in this sample is due to the increase in d–f exchange interaction between Ni( 3d 7 ) and Gd( 4f 7 ) and the contribution of the dipole moment of PVP molecules. The electrochemical measurements showed that the current density values were 0.294 and 0.319 mA/cm 2 at-1.3 V in the absence of Gd (NG-0) and Gd(5\%) doped (NG-2) samples, respectively. βc was 159 and 132 mV/dec for NG-0 and NG-2 samples, respectively. The diminishing of βc and the charge resistance (Rct) proved that the Gd doped catalyst enhanced the hydrogen evolution activity and the Gd(5\%) doped sample exhibited the highest catalyst performance.},

  abstract = {The development of new electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) could reduce the dependence on Pt and other rare metals and enable large-scale production of hydrogen with near-zero carbon emissions. Mechanistic insight into the electrocatalytic activity of a material helps to accelerate the development of new electrocatalysts. Alternative electrocatalyst materials such as transition metal oxides and sulfides can undergo insertion reactions that change their properties. Recent reports indicate that the presence of inserted ions can influence the electrocatalytic activity. Here, we utilized a materials chemistry approach to understand the role of proton insertion in the HER activity of the layered tungsten oxide hydrates (WO 3 · x H 2 O, x = 1, 2). We synthesized a series of tungsten oxide hydrates along with an octylamine-pillared tungsten oxide (OA–WO 3 ). We used cyclic voltammetry to study the electrochemical reactivity of each material and performed ex situ x-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy to understand bulk and surface structural changes during electrochemical cycling. We show an inverse relationship between the degree of proton insertion and HER overpotential in tungsten oxides: the lack of proton insertion leads to a high overpotential for the HER. We discuss three hypotheses for how proton insertion leads to the HER activity in WO 3 · x H 2 O: (1) proton insertion changes the electronic band structure of WO 3 · x H 2 O, (2) the presence of bulk protons can influence Δ G H,ads at the surface sites, and (3) the inserted protons may participate in the HER mechanism on WO 3 · x H 2 O. Overall, this work shows the critical role of proton insertion in enabling the high HER activity in tungsten oxides.},

The general importance of including polarizability into molecular dynamics simulations was shown in various recent studies for a wide range of materials, ranging from proteins to water to complex ionic liquids and for solid–liquid interfaces. While most previous studies focused on bulk properties or static structure factors, this study investigates in more detail the importance of polarizable surfaces on the dynamics of a confined ionic liquid in graphitic slit pores, as evident in modern electrochemical capacitors or in catalytic processes. A recently developed polarizable force field using Drude oscillators is modified in order to describe a particular room temperature ionic liquid accurately and in agreement with recently published experimental results. Using the modified parameters, various confinements are investigated and differences between non-polarizable and polarizable surfaces are discussed. Upon introduction of surface polarizability, changes in the dipole orientation and in the density distribution of the anions and cations at the interface are observed and are also accompanied with a dramatic increase in the molecular diffusivity in the contact layer. Our results thus clearly underline the importance of considering not only the polarizability of the ionic liquid but also that of the surface.},

  abstract = {Plasmon-induced charge transfer has been studied for the development of plasmonic photodiodes and solar cells. There are two mechanisms by which a plasmonic nanoparticle can transfer charge to an adjacent material: indirect transfer following plasmon decay and direct transfer as a way of plasmon decay. Using single-particle dark-field scattering and photoluminescence imaging and spectroscopy of gold nanorods on various substrates, we identify linewidth broadening and photoluminescence quantum yield quenching as key spectroscopic signatures that are quantitatively related to plasmon-induced interfacial charge transfer. We find that dark-field scattering linewidth broadening is due to chemical interface damping through direct charge injection via plasmon decay. The photoluminescence quantum yield quenching reveals additional mechanistic insight into electron–hole recombination as well as plasmon generation and decay within the gold nanorods. Through these two spectroscopic signatures, we identify charge transfer mechanisms at TiO 2 and indium doped tin oxide interfaces and uncover material parameters contributing to plasmon-induced charge transfer efficiency, such as barrier height and resonance energy.},

  abstract = {Water formation is relevant in many technological processes and is also an important model reaction. Although water formation over Pd surfaces is widely studied, questions regarding the active site and the main reaction path (OH* + OH*) or (OH* + H*) are still open. Combining first-principles density functional theory calculations and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, we find that the reaction rate is dominated by surface steps and point defects over a wide range of conditions. The main reaction path is found to be temperature dependent where the OH* + OH* path dominates at low temperatures, whereas the OH* + H* path is the main path at high temperatures. Steps facilitate the OH* formation, which is the rate limiting step under all conditions. OH* is formed via O* + H* association or OOH* splitting at low temperatures, whereas OH* is exclusively formed via O* + H* association at high temperatures. The results of the first-principles-based kinetic model are in excellent agreement with experimental observations at high and low temperatures as well as different gas-phase compositions.},

  abstract = {NaCl aqueous solutions are ubiquitous. They can crystallize into ice, NaCl, or NaCl · 2H 2 O depending on the temperature–concentration conditions. These crystallization transitions have important implications in geology, cryopreservation, or atmospheric science. Computer simulations can help understand the crystallization of these solids, which requires a detailed knowledge of the equilibrium phase diagram. We use molecular simulations in which we put at contact the solution with the solid of interest to determine points of the solid–solution coexistence lines. We follow two different approaches, one in which we narrow down the melting temperature for a given concentration and the other in which we equilibrate the concentration for a given temperature, obtaining consistent results. The phase diagram thus calculated for the selected model (TIP4P/2005 for water molecules and Joung–Cheatham for the ions) correctly predicts coexistence between the solution and ice. We were only able to determine NaCl · 2H 2 O–solution coexistence points at higher temperatures and concentrations than in the experiment, so we could not establish a direct comparison in this case. On the other hand, the model underestimates the concentration of the solution in equilibrium with the NaCl solid. Our results, alongside other literature evidence, seem to indicate that ion–ion interactions are too strong in the model. Our work is a good starting point for the improvement of the potential model and for the study of the nucleation kinetics of the solid phases involved in the phase diagram.},

The model is based on a simple set of reactions and contains a single adjustable parameter p (0 ≤ p ≤ 1). The latter is found from 27 Al solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments in the regime where R = x / y ≥ 1, aided by new experiments on the magnesium and zinc aluminosilicate systems. The parameter p decreases linearly as the cation field strength of M + or M 2+ increases, as per the observation previously made for the degree of aluminum avoidance [Lee et al. , J. Phys. Chem. C 120 , 737 (2016)]. The results indicate that as the cation field strength increases, there are less fourfold coordinated aluminum atoms to contribute toward the glass network, and Al–O–Al bonds become more prevalent in a progressive breakdown of Loewenstein’s aluminum avoidance rule. The model gives a good account of the composition-dependent fraction of non-bridging oxygen (NBO) atoms for R ≥ 1, as assessed from the results obtained from solid-state NMR experiments. An extension of the model to ( M 2 O 3 ) x (Al 2 O 3 ) y (SiO 2 ) 1− x − y glasses leads, however, to an excess of NBO atoms, the proportion of which can be reduced by invoking network-forming fivefold coordinated Al atoms and/or oxygen triclusters. The model provides a benchmark for predicting the structure-related properties of aluminosilicate materials and a starting point for predicting the evolution in the structure of these materials under the extreme conditions encountered in the Earth’s interior or in processes such as sharp-contact loading.},

We find two distinct regimes of annealing separated by a threshold energy. Poorly annealed glasses progressively evolve toward the threshold energy as the strain amplitude is increased toward the yielding value. Well annealed glasses with initial energies below the threshold energy exhibit stable behavior, with a negligible change in energy with increasing strain amplitude, until they yield. Discontinuities in energy and stress at yielding increase with the degree of annealing, consistent with recent results found in three dimensions. We observe a significant structural change with strain amplitude that closely mirrors the changes in energy and stresses. We investigate groups of particles that are involved in plastic rearrangements. We analyze the distributions of avalanche sizes, of clusters of connected rearranging particles, and related quantities, employing finite size scaling analysis. We verify previously investigated relations between exponents characterizing these distributions.},

  abstract = {A synchrotron-based photoionization spectrum of azulene shows a significant additional vibrational fine structure when compared to previous studies. This spectrum was successfully analyzed by using Franck–Condon (FC) methods. Previously reported zero-kinetic-energy electron spectra for azulene have been reinterpreted in FC terms, leading to some alternative assignments to the earlier work. The sequence of ionic states has been determined by using ab initio configuration interaction (CI) methods, leading to reliable theoretical values for both the calculated adiabatic ionization energy (AIE) and vertical ionization energy (VIE). VIEs were calculated by both symmetry-adapted cluster (SAC-CI), together with Green’s function (GF) and Tamm–Dancoff approximation (TDA), and single excitation CI methods; AIEs for highest states of each symmetry were determined by open-shell self-consistent field (SCF) methods at the restricted Hartree–Fock level. Complete active space SCF was used for the pairs of 1 2 A 2 + 2 2 A 2 and 1 2 B 1 + 2 2 B 1 states, each of which occurs as antisymmetric and symmetric (higher energy) combinations. The combined ionic state sequences (AIE and VIE) from these methods are 1 2 A 2 &lt; 1 2 B 1 &lt; 2 2 A 2 &lt; 2 2 B 1 . The photoelectron spectrum (PES) shows a series of broadbands above 11 eV, each of which is attributed to more than one ionization. The calculated PES sequence of states of up to 19 eV shows that the SAC-CI and GF results are in almost exact agreement. The internal spacing of the bands is best reproduced by the simpler GF and TDA methods. States involving simultaneous ionization and electronic excitation are considered by both SAC-CI and TDA methods.},

The triplet states are found to have deep bonding wells supporting an extensive manifold of vibrational levels, which could give rise to observable triplet–singlet phosphorescence. The ã – X ̃ band systems of the halosilylenes are calculated to occur at the red edge of the visible and are likely to be very weak. In contrast, the HGeX and HSnX triplet–singlet spectra are shifted 1000–2000 cm −1 to the higher energy and are expected to be significantly stronger due to increased spin–orbit coupling, making the spectra viable targets for experimental investigations. The Ã – X ̃ fluorescence is found to be limited by the possibility of HMX ( Ã 1 A ″) → H ( 2 S) + MX ( 2 Π ⁠ ) dissociation in the excited state, leading to the expectation that HGeF is unlikely to be detectable by laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) spectroscopy. The HSiX and HGeX species with known LIF spectra are found to have deeper Ã state bonding wells and minimal or no calculated barriers to dissociation. It is generally found that the intensity in their LIF spectra tails off due to a diminution of vibrational overlap rather than the abrupt opening of a dissociation channel. Few of the HSnX species are known experimentally. HSnF and DSnF are found to dissociate very low down in the Ã state vibrational manifold and are predicted to be unobservable by LIF spectroscopy. The LIF spectrum of HSnCl is expected to consist of only one or two bands, with slightly more activity for DSnCl, precisely as has recently been found experimentally. HSnBr and DSnBr have deeper Ã state bonding wells, and their LIF spectra are thus likely to be more extensive. Although HSnI and DSnI are calculated to have deep bonding wells with respect to the H + MX dissociation, predictions are complicated by the existence of a global small bond angle minimum and the opening of a second SnH + I dissociation channel.},

  abstract = {Nitrogen (N 2 ) fixation is a challenging task for chemists. Adsorption of N 2 on transition metal (TM) sites has been identified as a prerequisite for activating the very stable N≡N triple bond in both industrial and biological processes. The importance of π back-donation (filled orbitals of TM → π * orbitals of N 2 ) between metal sites and N 2 has been well elucidated while the role of another classic orbital interaction, namely σ donation ( σ orbitals of N 2 → empty orbitals of TM), remains ambiguous. Herein, the size-dependent reactivity of trinuclear rhodium deuteride cluster anions Rh 3 D n − ( n = 0–3) toward N 2 adsorption in the gas phase was investigated experimentally and theoretically. A reverse relationship that higher electron-donating ability of clusters corresponds to lower N 2 adsorption reactivity was experimentally observed, which is uncommon in N 2 activation by gas-phase species. Theoretical analysis revealed that the σ donation rather than the π back-donation plays a predominant role in the adsorption complexes Rh 3 D n N 2 − and the enhanced reactivity upon D addition is ascribed to the lowered energy levels of active orbitals in Rh 3 D n − as n increases. This study provides the first experimental evidence to declare the important role of σ donation and new clues for the design of reactive metal species in nitrogen fixation.},

  abstract = {Organic emissive materials with the inverted singlet–triplet energy gaps, where in violation of Hund’s multiplicity rule the lowest triplet excited-state is higher in energy than the lowest singlet excited-state, have recently come into the limelight. This unique feature is of important relevance, where the emitters meeting the singlet–triplet inversion have potential to usher in the next generation of organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs). Since experimental data in this context are currently sparse, necessity of the cost-effective theoretical tools able to provide reliable results seems to be evident. Following our recent endeavors on the spin-component-scaled (SCS), spin-opposite-scaled (SOS), and SOS-range separated exchange (SOS-RSX) double-hybrids (DHs) as well as other efforts revealing the superior performances of such models for time-dependent computations, in the present work, we develop and validate several models based on the SOS-configuration interaction singles with perturbative doubles correction [SOS-CIS(D)] devoid of any fitting procedure for describing the singlet–triplet inversion. Taking a series of emitters with the available reference values for the inverted singlet–triplet energy gaps as working models, it is unveiled that the extremes of the same-spin and opposite-spin parameters included in the direct and indirect terms of the SOS-CIS(D) correlation energy as well as the nonlocal exchange and correlation contributions do not necessarily work well for the inverted gaps, but particular proportions among them are needed to achieve a reliable accuracy. Perusing the results of our developed methods, the best one based on the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange and correlation terms and the quadratic integrand model, denominated as SOS0-CIS(D)-PBE-QIDH, is shown to be highly efficient and robust for computations of the inverted singlet–triplet energy gaps. Furthermore, through detailed comparisons, we have also evaluated the performances of a variety of the recently presented DHs, including parameterized, parameter-free, RSX, as well as spin-component and spin-opposite scaling models for the purpose. Dissecting all the findings, it is disclosed that the results of any type of the DHs cannot be reliable, leading to positive energy gaps in most cases. Nonetheless, there are still some approximations, including SCS-PBE-QIDH, dispersion corrected spin-component scaled double-hybrids (DSD) of DSD-PBEP86 and DSD-BLYP, SOS-PBE-QIDH, SOS- ω PBEPP86, and SOS-RSX-QIDH, that can predict the negative singlet–triplet energy gaps for all the considered emitters and provide comparable performances with respect to our proposed model. To wrap up, among the large panel of different families of DHs on the market, the newly proposed model herein alongside these latter functionals can be recommended as the currently best affordable methods for subsequent applications on the inverted singlet–triplet emitters in OLED materials.},

A rigid-monomer version of the recent ab initio full-dimensional (12D) potential energy surface of H 2 O–CO 2 [Q. Wang and J. M. Bowman, J. Chem. Phys. 147 , 161714 (2017)] is employed. This treatment provides for the first time a rigorous and comprehensive description of the intermolecular rovibrational level structure of the two isotopologues that includes the internal-rotation tunneling splittings and their considerable sensitivity to rotational and intermolecular vibrational excitations, as well as the rotational constants of the two vdW complexes. Two approaches are used in the calculations, which differ in the definition of the dimer-fixed (DF) frame and the coordinates associated with them. We demonstrate that with the approach introduced in this work, where the DF frame is fixed to the CO 2 moiety, highly accurate results are obtained using significantly smaller basis sets in comparison to those for the alternative approach. In addition, the resulting wavefunctions tend to lend themselves better to physical interpretation and assignment. The H 2 O–CO 2 ground-state internal-rotation tunneling splittings, the rotational transition frequencies, and the rotational constants of both vdW complexes are in excellent agreement with the experimental results. The calculated intermolecular vibrational fundamentals agree well with the scant terahertz spectroscopy data for these complexes in cryogenic neon matrices.},

  abstract = {Recently, the T-hetero-nuclear multiple quantum coherence (T-HMQC) sequence using the TRAPDOR (transfer of population in double resonance) recoupling has been introduced for the indirect detection via protons of quadrupolar nuclei with spin I = 1 ( 14 N) or 3/2 ( 35 Cl) in solids at fast magic-angle spinning (MAS). The sequence is simple as it only uses four rectangular pulses and exhibits low t 1 -noise because the recoupling pulses are applied to the indirectly detected isotope, I . We demonstrate that this sequence is applicable for the detection via protons of spin-1/2 nuclei subject to large chemical shift anisotropy, such as 195 Pt. We also report the proton detection of double-quantum (2Q) coherences of 14 N nuclei using this sequence. This 2Q version is more robust to the adjustment of the magic angle and the instabilities of the MAS frequencies than its parent single-quantum (1Q) version since the 2Q coherences are not broadened by the first-order quadrupole interaction. In practice, than its 1Q counterpart for the indirect detection of 14 N nuclei, the 2Q variant benefits from a slightly higher resolution and comparable sensitivity. In this article, we derive for the first time the Hamiltonian that describes the spin dynamics during the TRAPDOR recoupling. This Hamiltonian demonstrates the importance of the adiabaticity parameter as well as the role of third-order terms in the effective Hamiltonian. The effects of offsets, radio-frequency field, and recoupling time on the efficiency of the T-HMQC sequence are analyzed numerically as well as with experimental detection via protons of 195 Pt nuclei in a mixture of cis- and trans-platin and that of 14 N and 35 Cl isotopes in l -histidine HCl.},

  abstract = {We carried out transient absorption spectroscopy of thioflavin T (ThT) molecules in various solvents employing an asynchronous optical sampling (ASOPS) scheme with dual synchronized and frequency up-converted mode-lock lasers in the near UV (NUV) spectral region. We developed a pair of synchronized femtosecond lasers with tunable center wavelengths ranging from 380 to 430 nm and spectral bandwidths of 30 nm. As a proof-of-principle experiment, we measured interferometrically detected time and frequency-resolved pump–probe signals of ThT in various solvents to study the twisted intramolecular charge transfer process of photo-excited ThT molecules. Both single-color NUV-NUV and two-color NUV-near IR (NIR) pump–probe measurements reveal that the vibronic coupling strengths of two vibrational modes with frequencies of 214 and 526 cm −1 in the excited state of ThT are reduced when ThT is dissolved in a chlorine-containing solvent, e.g., chloroform. We confirm theoretically that these vibrational modes have relatively high electric dipole moments in the excited state. As a result, the intramolecular charge transfer process of ThT in chloroform, which is driven by the solvation process of surrounding polar solvent molecules, could occur less efficiently, which results in an increase in the fluorescence quantum yield. Here, we demonstrate that the NUV-NUV and NUV-NIR ASOPS-transient absorption could be useful techniques for studying ultrafast photochemical reactions in condensed phases.},

  abstract = {Autonomous experimentation systems use algorithms and data from prior experiments to select and perform new experiments in order to meet a specified objective. In most experimental chemistry situations, there is a limited set of prior historical data available, and acquiring new data may be expensive and time consuming, which places constraints on machine learning methods. Active learning methods prioritize new experiment selection by using machine learning model uncertainty and predicted outcomes. Meta-learning methods attempt to construct models that can learn quickly with a limited set of data for a new task. In this paper, we applied the model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) model and the Probabilistic LATent model for Incorporating Priors and Uncertainty in few-Shot learning (PLATIPUS) approach, which extends MAML to active learning, to the problem of halide perovskite growth by inverse temperature crystallization. Using a dataset of 1870 reactions conducted using 19 different organoammonium lead iodide systems, we determined the optimal strategies for incorporating historical data into active and meta-learning models to predict reaction compositions that result in crystals. We then evaluated the best three algorithms (PLATIPUS and active-learning k-nearest neighbor and decision tree algorithms) with four new chemical systems in experimental laboratory tests. With a fixed budget of 20 experiments, PLATIPUS makes superior predictions of reaction outcomes compared to other active-learning algorithms and a random baseline.},

It is shown that, with the increase in the system–bath coupling strength, the standard HEOM may become unstable, and a simple increase in the truncation depth of the HEOM cannot remove the instability at long times. To solve this problem, we first show that the high-temperature approximation of the HEOM with the BO spectral density is equivalent to the celebrated quantum Fokker–Planck equation (QFPE). By starting from the HEOM, we then derive a new multidimensional phase space differential equation that generalizes the QFPE to arbitrary temperature. It is further shown that the numerical instability can be removed if the new low-temperature QFPE is expanded in a basis set different than the one that leads to the conventional HEOM. The matrix product state method is also employed to propagate the new equation based on the low-temperature QFPE and to resolve the numerical instability problem for an electron transfer model with the MBO spectral density presented in the recent literature.},

  abstract = {Due to the sheer size of chemical and materials space, high-throughput computational screening thereof will require the development of new computational methods that are accurate, efficient, and transferable. These methods need to be applicable to electron configurations beyond ground states. To this end, we have systematically studied the applicability of quantum alchemy predictions using a Taylor series expansion on quantum mechanics (QM) calculations for single atoms with different electronic structures arising from different net charges and electron spin multiplicities. We first compare QM method accuracy to experimental quantities, including first and second ionization energies, electron affinities, and spin multiplet energy gaps, for a baseline understanding of QM reference data. Next, we investigate the intrinsic accuracy of “manual” quantum alchemy. This method uses QM calculations involving nuclear charge perturbations of one atom&#39;s basis set to model another. We then discuss the reliability of quantum alchemy based on Taylor series approximations at different orders of truncation. Overall, we find that the errors from finite basis set treatments in quantum alchemy are significantly reduced when thermodynamic cycles are employed, which highlights a route to improve quantum alchemy in explorations of chemical space. This work establishes important technical aspects that impact the accuracy of quantum alchemy predictions using a Taylor series and provides a foundation for further quantum alchemy studies.},

  abstract = {Semiflexible polymers comprised of active Brownian particles (ABPOs) exhibit intriguing activity-driven conformational and dynamical features. Analytically, the generic properties of ABPOs can be obtained in a mean-field description applying the Gaussian semiflexible polymer model. In this article, we derive a path integral representation of the stationary-state distribution function of such ABPOs, based on the stationary-state distribution function of the normal mode amplitudes following from the Langevin equation of motion. The path integral includes characteristic semiflexible polymer contributions from entropy and bending energy, with activity dependent coefficients, and, in addition, activity-induced torsional and higher order correlations along the polymer contour. Focusing on a semiflexible polymer approximation, we determine various properties such as the tangent-vector correlation function, effective persistence length, and the mean-square end-to-end distance. The latter reflects the characteristic features of ABPOs, and good quantitative agreement is obtained with the full solution for larger activities, specifically for flexible polymers. Moreover, the approximation indicates the relevance of torsional and higher order contour correlations for the ABPO conformations. In general, the ABPO path integral illustrates how colored noise (active fluctuations) affects semiflexible polymer conformations in comparison to white noise thermal fluctuations.},

  abstract = {A challenge of atomistic machine-learning (ML) methods is ensuring that the training data are suitable for the system being simulated, which is particularly challenging for systems with large numbers of atoms. Most atomistic ML approaches rely on the nearsightedness principle (“all chemistry is local”), using information about the position of an atom’s neighbors to predict a per-atom energy. In this work, we develop a framework that exploits the nearsighted nature of ML models to systematically produce an appropriate training set for large structures. We use a per-atom uncertainty estimate to identify the most uncertain atoms and extract chunks centered around these atoms. It is crucial that these small chunks are both large enough to satisfy the ML’s nearsighted principle (that is, filling the cutoff radius) and are large enough to be converged with respect to the electronic structure calculation. We present data indicating when the electronic structure calculations are converged with respect to the structure size, which fundamentally limits the accuracy of any nearsighted ML calculator. These new atomic chunks are calculated in electronic structures, and crucially, only a single force—that of the central atom—is added to the growing training set, preventing the noisy and irrelevant information from the piece’s boundary from interfering with ML training. The resulting ML potentials are robust, despite requiring single-point calculations on only small reference structures and never seeing large training structures. We demonstrated our approach via structure optimization of a 260-atom structure and extended the approach to clusters with up to 1415 atoms.},

  abstract = {We consider the rank-reduced coupled-cluster theory with single and double (RR-CCSD) excitations introduced recently [Parrish et al. , J. Chem. Phys. 150 , 164118 (2019)]. The main feature of this method is the decomposed form of doubly excited amplitudes, which are expanded in the basis of largest magnitude eigenvectors of MP2 or MP3 amplitudes. This approach enables a substantial compression of amplitudes with only minor loss of accuracy. However, the formal scaling of the computational costs with the system size ( N ) is unaffected in comparison with the conventional CCSD theory (∝ N 6 ) due to the presence of some terms quadratic in amplitudes, which do not naturally factorize to a simpler form even within the rank-reduced framework. We show how to solve this problem, exploiting the fact that their effective rank increases only linearly with the system size. We provide a systematic way to approximate the problematic terms using the singular value decomposition and reduce the scaling of the RR-CCSD iterations down to the level of N 5 . This is combined with an iterative method of finding dominant eigenpairs of MP2 or MP3 amplitudes, which eliminates the necessity to perform the complete diagonalization, making the cost of this step proportional to the fifth power of the system size, as well. Next, we consider the evaluation of perturbative corrections to CCSD energies resulting from triply excited configurations. The triply excited amplitudes present in the CCSD(T) method are decomposed to the Tucker-3 format using the higher-order orthogonal iteration procedure. This enables us to compute the energy correction due to triple excitations non-iteratively with N 6 cost. The accuracy of the resulting rank-reduced CCSD(T) method is studied for both total and relative correlation energies of a diverse set of molecules. Accuracy levels better than 99.9\% can be achieved with a substantial reduction of the computational costs. Concerning the computational timings, the break-even point between the rank-reduced and conventional CCSD implementations occurs for systems with about 30–40 active electrons.},

  abstract = {Conformational dynamics play a crucial role in protein functions. A molecular-level understanding of the conformational transition dynamics of proteins is fundamental for studying protein functions. Here, we report a study of real-time conformational dynamic interaction between calcium-activated calmodulin (CaM) and C28W peptide using single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) spectroscopy and imaging. Plasma membrane Ca-ATPase protein interacts with CaM by its peptide segment that contains 28 amino acids (C28W). The interaction between CaM and the Ca-ATPase is essential for cell signaling. However, details about its dynamic interaction are still not clear. In our current study, we used Cyanine3 labeled CaM (N-domain) and Dylight 649 labeled C28W peptide (N-domain) to study the conformational dynamics during their interaction. In this study, the FRET can be measured when the CaM–C28W complex is formed and only be observed when such a complex is formed. By using single-molecule FRET efficiency trajectory and unique statistical approaches, we were able to observe multiple binding steps with detailed dynamic features of loosely bound and tightly bound state fluctuations. The C-domain of CaM tends to bind with C28W first with a higher affinity, followed by the binding of the CaM N-domain. Due to the comparatively high flexibility and low affinity of the N-domain and the presence of multiple anchor hydrophobic residues on the peptide, the N-domain binding may switch between selective and non-selective binding states, while the C-domain remains strongly bound with C28W. The results provide a mechanistic understanding of the CaM signaling interaction and activation of the Ca-ATPase through multiple-state binding to the C28W. The new single-molecule spectroscopic analyses demonstrated in this work can be applied for broad studies of protein functional conformation fluctuation and protein–protein interaction dynamics.},

  abstract = {Here, we performed spectral simulations of the amide-I vibrational spectra for three proposed fibril structures of the human islet amyloid polypeptide, which is involved in type II diabetes. We modeled both the overall absorption and two-dimensional infrared spectra for these structures. We further analyzed the isotope-labeled spectra, including the variation between structures. The analysis suggests that the infrared spectra of the cryo-electron microscopy structure provide the best match with experimental data. We further simulated isotope-labeled dilution spectroscopy investigating the correlation between the predicted spectral peak shift and the coupling between the amide units. While this correlation works in most cases, failures were observed when the isotope-labeled spectra were broad compared to the coupling or exhibited structure. These findings will be useful in the quest for potential toxic fibril formation intermediates.},

  abstract = {The self-assembly of block copolymer melts and solutions with two-dimensional density inhomogeneity is studied using modified inhomogeneous statistical associating fluid theory (iSAFT). A real-space combinatorial screening method under density functional theory formalism is proposed and used to map out the phase diagram of block copolymer melts including order–disorder transitions and order–order transitions. The predicted phase diagram agrees well with molecular dynamics simulation and self-consistent field theory. The compressibility effect on order–disorder transition temperature for block copolymer melts is modeled using iSAFT. The pressure induced temperature change by theory has a similar trend to experimental studies. Then, the lyotropic and thermotropic self-assembly phase behavior of block copolymer solutions is investigated. Detailed density distributions by iSAFT provide insight into the lyotropic properties of the block copolymer solutions at the molecular level. The effect of the block copolymer molecular architecture is studied by comparing block copolymers with different molecular packing parameters. Block copolymer solutions in the inverted hexagonal phase are predicted by theory for the block copolymer having a large molecular packing parameter. Finally, solvent selectivity is studied by modeling the block copolymers in a neutral good solvent. The enhanced local solvent concentration predicted by theory explains the reason for fewer ordered phases found in experiments.},

More detailed work is needed to elucidate the structure–property relationship of these systems. In this work, the density functional theory is used to compute the energy and electronic structure of the graphene models with respect to variable curvatures and hydrogen adsorption sites. The magnitude of finite bandgap opening depends on the orientation of ripples, and the hydrogen adsorption energy depends on the local curvature of graphene. An adsorbed hydrogen alters the local curvature, resulting in relatively weakened adsorption on the neighboring three sites, which gives a rationale to experimentally observed dynamic equilibrium stoichiometry (H:C = 1:4) of hydrogenated graphene. The surface diffusion transition state energy of adsorbed hydrogen is computed, which suggests that the Eley–Rideal surface recombination mechanism may be important to establish the dynamic equilibrium, instead of the commonly assumed Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism.},

Two Fano resonances with a distinctly different temperature dependence were identified. The continuous background that is responsible for the Fano resonances is attributed to the d–d transition of the optically active Cr 3+ center, predominantly the spin-forbidden 2 E g → 4 A 2g transition with contributions of the broad-band 4 T 2g → 4 A 2g transition. The discrete states that interfere with this continuous background are suggested to arise from localized atomic phosphorus.

  abstract = {Carbodiimide-mediated coupling chemistry was used to synthesize heterostructures of CdSe and CdTe quantum dots (QDs) with varying ratios of electron-donating CdTe QDs and electron-accepting CdSe QDs. Heterostructures were assembled via the formation of amide bonds between the terminal functional groups of CdTe-adsorbed 4-aminothiophenol (4-ATP) ligands and CdSe-adsorbed N -hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) ligands. The number of charge acceptors on the surfaces of QDs can greatly influence the rate constant of excited-state charge transfer with QDs capable of accommodating far more acceptors than molecular chromophores. We report here on excited-state electron transfer within heterostructure-forming mixtures of 4-ATP-capped CdTe and NHS-capped CdSe QDs with varying molar ratios of CdTe to CdSe. Photophysical properties and charge transfer were characterized using UV–vis absorption, steady-state emission, and time-resolved emission spectroscopy. As the relative concentration of electron-accepting CdSe QDs within mixtures of 4-ATP-capped CdTe and NHS-capped CdSe QDs increased, the rate and efficiency of electron transfer increased by 100-fold and 7.4-fold, respectively, as evidenced by dynamic quenching of band-edge emission from CdTe QDs. In contrast, for non-interacting mixtures of thiophenol capped CdTe QDs and NHS-capped CdSe QDs, which served as control samples, photophysical properties of the constituent QDs were unperturbed and excited-state charge transfer between the QDs was negligible. Our results reveal that carbodiimide-mediated coupling chemistry can be used to control the relative number of donor and acceptor QDs within heterostructures, which, in turn, enables fine-tuning of charge-transfer dynamics and yields. These amide-bridged dual-QD heterostructures are, thus, intriguing for light harvesting, charge transfer, and photocatalysis.},

  abstract = {A water microdroplet in air or oil typically possesses an electric double layer (EDL) from the preferential adsorption of surface-bound ions at the periphery. We present the calculations of the ion gradients within a microdroplet at equilibrium, including systems containing buffers and water autoionization. These ion gradients are used to calculate the potential energy stored within the microdroplet. We consider how this stored potential energy can be utilized to drive chemical reactions, much like an electrochemical cell. Effective voltages as high as 111 mV are found for microdroplets having a low surface charge density (0.01 ions per nm 2 ). Two sources of potential energy are investigated: (1) the electrostatic energy of the EDL of the microdroplet and (2) shifts in other chemical equilibria coupled to the main reaction through the EDL. A particularly important example of the latter is water autoionization, wherein the reaction of interest causes a flattening of the [H + ] gradient within the EDL, resulting in a net recombination of H + and OH − throughout the microdroplet. Numerical calculations are performed using a continuum model consisting of a balance between the electromigration and diffusion of ions throughout the microdroplet. Our treatment accounts for the autoionization of water and any chemical equilibrium of buffers present. The results are presented for uncharged water microdroplets with low amounts of salts and simple buffers in them. However, the calculational method presented here can be applied to microdroplets of any net charge, composed of any solvent, containing ions of any valence, and containing complex mixtures of chemical equilibria.},

  abstract = {The optoelectronic properties of quantum confined semiconductor nanocrystals depend critically on the band edge electron and hole levels and their exciton fine structures. Transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy has been widely used to probe the dynamics of photogenerated electrons, holes, and excitons in these materials through their state filling induced bleach of the band edge exciton transition. Such effects, in principle, reflect the band edge fine structures and are well understood for the conduction band electrons. However, the valence band hole state filling signals remain poorly understood due to the complexity of the valence band level structure and the presence of fast hole trapping in many materials. Herein, we report a study of the valence band hole state filling effect by comparing the TA spectra of CdSe quantum dots (QDs) with different degrees of hole trapping and by selective removal of the conduction band electrons to adsorbed methyl viologen molecules. We observe that in CdSe/CdS core/shell QDs with a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 81\%, the valence band hole contributes to 22\% ± 1\% of the exciton bleach, while a negligible hole state filling signal is observed in CdSe core only QDs with a photoluminescence quantum yield of 17\%. This hole state filling effect can be explained by a simplified valence band edge hole model that contains two sets of twofold degenerate hole levels that are responsible for the higher energy bright exciton and lower energy dark exciton states, respectively. Our result clarifies the TA spectral features of the valence band holes and provides insights into the nature of single hole states in CdSe-based QDs.},

In a previous paper [Nguyen et al. , J. Phys. Chem. C 125 , 15405–15414 (2021)], we showed that under high-intensity photoexcitation, two types of biexcitons are formed: those having two conduction band electrons and two valence band holes (designated as an XX state) and those having two conduction band electrons, one valence band hole, and an additional trapped hole (designated as an XT state). In the present paper, we show that both types of biexcitons can undergo Auger processes, with those of the XT state being a factor of four to five slower than those of the XX state. In addition, the trapped holes can undergo tunneling into the valence band, converting an XT state to an XX state. The relative amplitudes of the fast (XX) and slow (XT) components are different in the TA and PL kinetics, and these differences can be quantitatively understood in terms of oscillator strengths and electron–hole overlap integrals of each state. XT to XX hole tunneling rates are obtained from the comparison of the XT state lifetimes with those of the negative trions. This comparison shows that the tunneling times decrease with decreasing core size and shell thickness. These times are about 2 ns for the thinnest shell red-emitting QDs and decrease to 330 ps for QDs that luminesce in the yellow.},

The SL and SV interfacial tensions γ SL − γ S0 and γ SV − γ S0 relative to that for bare solid surface γ S0 , respectively, were obtained by simple force balance relations on fluid-containing control volumes set around the bottom and top ends of the solid cylinder, which are subject to the fluid stress and the force from the solid. The theoretical contact angle calculated by Young’s equation using these interfacial tensions agreed well with the apparent contact angle estimated by the analytical solution to fit the meniscus shape, showing that Young’s equation holds even for the menisci around solids with nanoscale curvature. We have also found that the curvature effect on the contact angle was surprisingly small while it was indeed large on the local forces exerted on the solid cylinder near the contact line. In addition, the present results showed that the curvature dependence of the SL and SV interfacial free energies, which are the interfacial tensions, is different from that of the corresponding interfacial potential energies.},

  abstract = {Finite size artifacts arise in molecular simulations of nucleation when critical nuclei are too close to their periodic images. A rigorous determination of what constitutes too close is, however, a major challenge. Recently, we devised rigorous heuristics for detecting such artifacts based on our investigation of how system size impacts the rate of heterogeneous ice nucleation [S. Hussain and A. Haji-Akbari, J. Chem. Phys. 154 , 014108 (2021)]. We identified the prevalence of critical nuclei spanning across the periodic boundary, and the thermodynamic and structural properties of the liquid occupying the inter-image region as indicators of finite size artifacts. Here, we further probe the performance of such heuristics by examining the dependence of homogeneous crystal nucleation rates in the Lennard-Jones (LJ) liquid on system size. The rates depend non-monotonically on system size and vary by almost six orders of magnitude for the range of system sizes considered here. We confirm that the prevalence of spanning critical nuclei is the primary indicator of finite size artifacts and almost fully explains the observed variations in rate. Proximity, or structuring of the inter-image liquid, however, is not as strong of an indicator due to the fragmented nature of crystalline nuclei. As a result, the dependence of rate on system size is subtle for the systems with a minuscule fraction of spanning critical nuclei. These observations indicate that our heuristics are universally applicable to different modes of nucleation (homogeneous and heterogeneous) in different systems even if they might be overly stringent for homogeneous nucleation, e.g., in the LJ system.},

  abstract = {Thermodynamic or density scaling of high-pressure conductivities and molar conductivities of the high-temperature molten salts NaOH, and the alkali chlorides, bromides, and nitrates, from Na to Cs, taken from the literature, is found to be consistent with the simulations of Knudsen, Niss, and Bailey (KNB). They used a simple model fluid of point particles interacting through an interionic potential with a repulsive inverse power law part varying as r −9 and an attractive Coulombic part. This yields values between the limits 0.33–3 for the scaling parameter, γ. The Coulombic potential reduces the scaling parameter to values much lower than are normally found for molecular liquids, and KNB used this to explain the low values typically found for ionic liquids. Here, it is shown that the high-temperature molten salts examined behave similarly.},

From kinetic data and fits, we extract relative rate constants for each N 2 adsorption step and possible desorption steps. We find significant trends in adsorption behavior, which reveal adsorption limits, intermittent adsorption limits, and equilibrium reactions. For those steps, which are in equilibrium, we determine the Gibbs free energies. We conclude on likely ligand shell reorganization and some weakly bound N 2 ligands for clusters where multiple N 2 adsorbates are in equilibrium. The relative rate constants are transferred to absolute rate constants, which are slightly smaller than the collision rate constants calculated by the average dipole orientation (Langevin) theory. The calculated sticking probabilities increase, in general, with the size of the clusters and decrease with the level of N 2 adsorption, in particular, when reaching an adsorption/desorption equilibrium. We receive further evidence on cluster size dependent properties, such as cluster geometries and metal atom distributions within the clusters through the accompanying spectroscopic and computational study on the equiatomic i = j clusters [Klein et al. , J.

The ratio between the two isomers serves as an indicator of the physical conditions in different areas of the ISM. As such, the isomerization process between the two isomers has been extensively studied on the neutral potential energy surface. Moreover, HCN and HNC are thought to be precursors of important organic molecules, such as adenine. Here, we use quantum chemistry calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations to focus on the chemistry that occurs upon ionization of pure HNC clusters. We demonstrate that upon ionization of HNC clusters, a distonic ion CN⋯HCNH + is formed, and this formation is accompanied by HNC-to-HCN isomerization. Moreover, we show that the cluster environment and the network of hydrogen bonds are crucial for the isomerization process to occur and for the stabilization of the clusters. We demonstrate that, in contrast to HNC clusters, isomerization of ionized HCN clusters can occur only for the larger clusters. In addition, we discuss the formation of aminonitrile cation in the clusters and propose a barrierless route for diaminonitrile, a known precursor of amino acids and nucleobases, to form.},

The reaction rate is then controlled by the rate of formation of the reaction pairs. We demonstrate this concept on the example of electron-induced reactions in hydrogen peroxide. We consider two types of nanoparticle environments: solid argon particles, only weakly interacting with the hydrogen peroxide reactant, and ice particles with a much stronger interaction. The formation of hydrogen peroxide dimers is investigated via classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on a microsecond timescale. With a modified force field for hydrogen peroxide, we found out a fast formation and stabilization of the hydrogen peroxide dimer for argon nanoparticles, while the reaction pair was formed reversibly at a much slower rate on the water nanoparticles. We have further investigated the electron-induced reactions using non-adiabatic ab initio MD simulations, identifying the possible reaction products upon the ionization or electron attachment. The major reaction path in all cases corresponded to a proton transfer. The computational findings are supported by mass spectrometry experiments, where large ArM and (H2O)M nanoparticles are generated, and several hydrogen peroxide molecules are embedded on these nanoparticles in a pickup process. Subsequently, the nanoparticles are ionized either positively by 70 eV electrons or negatively by electron attachment at electron energies below 5 eV. The recorded mass spectra demonstrate the efficient coagulation of H2O2 on ArM, while it is quite limited on (H2O)M.},

These experiments are accompanied by extensive ab initio electronic structure calculations using a relativistic composite methodology based primarily on coupled cluster singles and doubles with perturbative triples calculations. The theoretical electron affinities (EAs) at 0 K agree with the experimental adiabatic EAs to within 0.02 eV for all species. Two separate isomers were located in the calculations for ThAuOH − , and detachment from both of these appears to be present in the photoelectron spectrum. Excited electronic states of the neutral molecules are reported at the equation of motion-coupled cluster singles and doubles level of theory. Atomization energies and heats of formation are also calculated for each neutral species and have expected uncertainties of 3 and 4 kcal/mol, respectively. The σ bonds between Th and Au are determined by natural bond orbital analysis to consist of predominately sd hybrids on Th bonding with the Au 6s orbital. In order to investigate the correspondence between the bonding in Th–Au and Th–F molecules, a limited number of calculations were also carried out on most of the F-analogs of this study. These results demonstrate that Au does behave like F in these cases, although the Th–F σ bonds are much more ionic compared to Th–Au. This results in an EA for ThF 2 that is 10 kcal/mol smaller than that of ThAu 2 . The EA values for the Th(IV) species, i.e., ThX 2 O and ThXOH, only differed, however, by 3–4 kcal/mol.},

This perturbation causes the dispersion of a Gaussian wave packet, which is reflected in the coordinate-space and the momentum-space Shannon entropies, the latter being a measure for the amount of information available on a system. Regarding the sum of the two quantities, one arrives at an entropy that is related to the coordinate–momentum uncertainty. Whereas in the harmonic case, this entropy is strictly periodic and can be evaluated analytically, this behavior is lost if disorder is added. There, at selected times, the quantum mechanical probability density resembles that of a classical oscillator distribution function, and the entropy assumes larger values. However, at later times and dependent on the degree of disorder and the chosen initial conditions, quantum mechanical revivals occur. Then, the observed effects are reversed, and the entropy may decrease close to its initial value. This effect cannot be found classically.},

  abstract = {The vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) photodissociation of CO 2 is important to understand the primary photochemical processes of CO 2 induced by solar VUV excitation in the Earth’s atmosphere. Here, we report a detailed study of vibrational-state-specific photodissociation dynamics of the CO(X 1 Σ + ) + O( 1 D 2 ) channel via the 3P 1 Π u state by using the time-sliced velocity-mapped ion imaging apparatus combined with the single VUV photoionization detection scheme. By recording the sliced images of the O( 1 D 2 ) photoproducts formed by VUV photoexcitation of CO 2 to the individual vibrational structure of the 3P 1 Π u state, both the vibrational state distributions of the counterpart CO(X 1 Σ + ) photoproducts and the vibrational-state-specific product anisotropy parameters ( β ) are determined. The experimental results show that photodissociation of CO 2 at 108.22, 107.50, 106.10, and 104.76 nm yields less anisotropic ( β &gt; 0) and inverted distributed CO(X 1 Σ + , v ) photoproducts. The possible dissociation mechanism for the CO(X 1 Σ + ) + O( 1 D 2 ) channel may involve the non-adiabatic transition of excited CO 2 * from the initially prepared state to the 3 1 A′ state with potential energy barriers. While at 108.82 and 107.35 nm, the vibrational distributions are found to have the population peaked at a low vibrational state, and the anisotropy parameters turn out to be negative. Such variation indicates the possibility of another non-adiabatic dissociation pathway that may involve Coriolis-type coupling to the low-lying dissociative state. These observations show sclear evidence of the influence of the initially vibrational excitations on the photodissociation dynamics of CO 2 via the 3P 1 Π u state.},

  abstract = {Chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) is widely used for enhancing the solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signatures of magnetically dilute spin pools, in particular, species at low concentrations undergoing chemical exchanges with an abundant spin pool. CEST’s main feature involves encoding and then detecting weak NMR signals of the magnetically dilute spin pools on a magnetically abundant spin pool of much easier detection, for instance, the protons of H 2 O. Inspired by this method, we propose and exemplify a methodology to enhance the sensitivity of magic-angle spinning (MAS) solid-state NMR spectra. Our proposal uses the abundant 1 H reservoir arising in organic solids as the magnetically abundant spin pool and relies on proton spin diffusion in lieu of chemical exchange to mediate polarization transfer between a magnetically dilute spin pool and this magnetically abundant spin reporter. As an initial test of this idea, we target the spectroscopy of naturally abundant 13 C and rely on a Fourier-encoded version of the CEST experiment for achieving broadbandness in coordination with both MAS and heteronuclear decoupling, features normally absent in CEST. Arbitrary evolutions of multiple 13 C sites can, thus, be imprinted on the entire 1 H reservoir, which is subsequently detected. Theoretical predictions suggest that orders-of-magnitude signal enhancements should be achievable in this manner, on the order of the ratio between the 13 C and the 1 H reservoirs’ abundances. Experiments carried out under magic-angle spinning conditions evidenced 5–10× gains in signal amplitudes. Further opportunities and challenges arising in this Fourier-encoded saturation transfer MAS NMR approach are briefly discussed.},

Key to a rare event is the rare fluctuation that enables the energy activation process that precedes and powers crossing of the activation barrier. However, the physical nature of this rare fluctuation and how it enables energy activation and subsequently barrier crossing are unknown. We developed a novel metric, the reaction capacity p C , that rigorously defines the beginning and parameterizes the progress of energy activation. This enabled us to identify the rare fluctuation as a special phase-space condition that is necessary and sufficient for initiating systematic energy flow from the non-reaction coordinates into the reaction coordinates. The energy activation of a prototype biomolecular isomerization reaction is dominated by kinetic energy transferring into and accumulating in the reaction coordinates, administered by inertial forces alone. This mechanism for energy activation is fundamentally different from the mechanism suggested by Kramers theory.},

This increase in the transport efficiency is due to an intensification of the stochastic resonance effect observed in corrugated rigid channels, for which the response to the force is maximal for an optimal value of the thermal noise. The distances traveled by the particles are even larger when the oscillation of the micro-channel is synchronized with that of an applied transverse force and also when a constant external force is considered. The phenomenon found could be observed in the transport of particles through elastic porous media, in drug delivery to cancerous tissues, and in the passage of substrates through transporters in biological membranes.

  abstract = {The transition path ensemble is a collection of reactive trajectories, all of which largely keep going forward along the transition channel from the reactant state to the product one, and is believed to possess the information necessary for the identification of reaction coordinates. Previously, the full coordinates (both position and momentum) of the snapshots in the transition path ensemble were utilized to obtain the reaction coordinate [W. Li and A. Ma, J. Chem. Phys. 144 , 114103 (2016) and W. Li, J. Chem. Phys. 148 , 084105 (2018)]. Here, with the conformational (or position) coordinates alone, it is suggested that a meaningful one-dimensional representation of the reaction coordinate can be obtained by maximizing the flux (the net number of transitions through the dividing surface) of a given coordinate in the transition path ensemble. In the application to alanine dipeptide in vacuum, dihedral angles ϕ and θ were identified to be the two best reaction coordinates, which was consistent with the results in the existing studies. A linear combination of these two coordinates gave a better reaction coordinate, which is highly correlated with the committor. Most importantly, the method obtained a linear combination of pairwise distances between heavy atoms, which was highly correlated with the committor as well. The standard deviation of the committor at the transition region defined by the optimized reaction coordinate is as small as 0.08. In addition, the effects of practical factors, such as the choice of transition path sub-ensembles and saving interval between frames in transition paths, on reaction coordinate optimization were also considered.},

  abstract = {The construction of the density functional for grand potential is fundamental in understanding a broad range of interesting physical phenomena, such as phase equilibrium, interfacial thermodynamics, and solvation. However, the knowledge of a general functional accurately describing the many-body correlation of molecules is far from complete. Here, we propose a self-consistent construction of the grand potential functional based on the weighted density approximation (WDA) utilizing hierarchical integral equations. Different from our previous study [T. Yagi and H. Sato, J. Chem. Phys. 154 , 124113, (2021)], we apply the WDA to the excess Helmholtz free energy functional rather than the bridge functional. To assess the performance of the present functional, we apply it to the solvation thermodynamics of Lennard-Jones fluids. Compared to the modified Benedict–Webb–Rubin equation of state, the present functional qualitatively predicts the liquid–vapor equilibrium. The solvation free energy obtained from the present functional provides a much better agreement with the Monte Carlo simulation result than the hypernetted chain functionals. It constitutes a general starting point for a systematic improvement in the accuracy of the grand potential functional.},

  abstract = {Spin–orbit (SO) coupling can have significant effects on the quantum dynamics of molecular systems, but it is still difficult to account for accurately. One promising way to do this is to devise a diabatic SO model combined with the molecular potential energy. Few such models have been developed utilizing spatial and time-reversal symmetry. These models are tedious to derive and are specific for the molecular symmetry and included spin states. Here, we present a relatively simple approach to construct such models for various spin states with S ≠ 1 2 from a basic one-electron SO case with S = 1 2 ⁠ . The multi-electron fine structure states are expressed in terms of Slater determinants of single-electron spin functions (spinors). The properties of all single-electron matrix elements over the SO operator are derived and expressed as Taylor expansions in terms of symmetry-adapted nuclear coordinates. The SO matrix elements for the multi-electron case are then obtained from these single-electron matrix elements using the Slater–Condon rules. This yields the full SO matrix and symmetry properties of the multi-electron matrix elements in a straightforward way. The matrix elements are expressed as symmetry-adapted polynomials up to arbitrary order. This approach is demonstrated first for an abstract model of two electrons in a set of p orbitals in a C 3 v symmetric environment and then applied to set up a diabatic model for the photodissociation of methyl iodide (CH 3 I). The high accuracy of this new approach is demonstrated in comparison to an available analytic SO model for CH 3 I.},

Based on a statistical evaluation of about 200 electron-detached states of 41 molecules, the second-order methods IP-ADC(2) and IP-UCC2 show modest accuracies with IP-EOM-CCSDT as reference, exposing a mean signed error and a standard deviation of the error of −0.54 ± 0.50 and −0.49 ± 0.54 eV, respectively, accompanied by a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.61 and 0.58 eV, respectively. The strict third-order IP-ADC method demonstrates an accuracy of 0.26 ± 0.35 eV (MAE = 0.35 eV), while the IP-UCC3 method is slightly more accurate with 0.24 ± 0.26 eV (MAE = 0.29 eV). Employing the static self-energy computed using the Dyson expansion method (DEM) improves the IP-ADC(3) performance to 0.27 ± 0.28 eV, with the mean absolute error of this method being 0.32 eV. However, employing the simpler improved fourth-order scheme Σ (4+) for the static self-energy provides almost identical results as the DEM. Based on the quality of the present benchmark results, it therefore appears not necessary to use the computationally more demanding DEM.},

Our treatment uniquely accounts for both beyond-first-order light–matter interactions and relativistic effects, enabling us to investigate the ECD response across the electromagnetic spectrum from optical to x-ray wavelengths where relativistic selection rules and spatial field variations gain increasing importance. We consider the isotropic and oriented ECD across the valence transition and sulfur L - and K -edge transitions in the simplest disulfides, H 2 S 2 and (CH 3 S) 2 , and evaluate the influence of the full interaction by comparing to a traditional truncated formulation in the Coulomb gauge (velocity representation). Additionally, we demonstrate that in the relativistic formalism, it is possible to work in the velocity representation, hence keeping order-by-order gauge-origin invariance, contrary to the multipolar gauge, yet being able to distinguish electric and magnetic multipole contributions. Going beyond a first-order treatment in the wave vector is mandatory in the higher-energy end of the soft x-ray region and beyond where the consequent intensity redistribution becomes significant. While the sulfur K -edge absorption spectrum is essentially unaffected by this redistribution, the signed differential counterpart is not: At least third-order contributions are required to describe the differential absorption profile that is otherwise overestimated by a factor of about two. The first-order description deteriorates at higher transition energies (beyond ∼1000 eV) where it may even fail to predict the sign of individual differential oscillator strengths.},

By utilizing the absolutely localized basis, we significantly improve the efficiency of the method while maintaining high accuracy. Furthermore, the absolutely localized basis allows for high accuracy open-shell wave function methods to be embedded into a closed-shell density functional theory environment. The open-shell embedding method is shown to calculate electronic energies of a variety of systems to within 1 kcal/mol accuracy of the full system wave function result. For certain highly localized reactions, such as spin transition energies on transition metals, we find that very few atoms are necessary to include in the wave function region in order to achieve the desired accuracy. This extension further broadens the applicability of our absolutely localized Huzinaga level-shift projection operator method to include open-shell species. Here, we apply our method to several representative examples, such as spin splitting energies, catalysis on transition metals, and radical reactions.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we report on a correctly scaling novel coupled cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) implementation for arbitrary high-spin open-shell states. The chosen cluster operator is completely spin-free, i.e., employs spatial substitutions only. It is composed of our recently developed Löwdin-type operators [N. Herrmann and M. Hanrath, J. Chem. Phys. 153 , 164114 (2020)], which ensure (1) spin completeness and (2) spin adaption, i.e., spin purity of the CC wave function. In contrast to the proof-of-concept matrix-representation-based implementation presented there, the present implementation relies on second quantization and factorized tensor contractions. The generated singles and doubles operators are embedded in an equation generation engine. In the latter, Wick’s theorem is used to derive prefactors arising from spin integration directly from the spin-free full contraction patterns. The obtained Wick terms composed of products of Kronecker deltas are represented by special non-antisymmetrized Goldstone diagrams. Identical (redundant) diagrams are identified by solving the underlying graph isomorphism problem. All non-redundant graphs are then automatically translated to locally—one term at a time—factorized tensor contractions. Finally, the spin-adapted and spin-complete (SASC) CCS and CCSD variants are applied to a set of small molecular test systems. Both correlation energies and amplitude norms hint toward a reasonable convergence of the SASC-CCSD method for a Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff series truncation of order four. In comparison to spin orbital CCSD, SASC-CCSD leads to slightly improved correlation energies with differences of up to 1.292m E H (1.10\% with respect to full configuration identification) for quintet CH 2 in the cc-pVDZ basis set.},

Surprisingly, descriptors based on the cesium sublattice perform better than those of the lead sublattice, even though Cs does not contribute to the relevant wavefunctions, while Pb forms the conduction band and contributes to the valence band.

Hence, the topography of the cost function surface is crucial to understanding the performance of the algorithm. Here, we employ the energy landscape approach to elucidate the topography of the K -means cost function surface for Fisher’s Iris dataset. For any number of clusters, we find that the solution landscapes have a funneled structure that is usually associated with efficient global optimization. An analysis of the barriers between clustering solutions shows that the funneled structures result from remarkably small barriers between almost all clustering solutions. The funneled structure becomes less well-defined as the number of clusters increases, and we analyze kinetic analogs to quantify the increased difficulty in locating the global minimum for these different landscapes.},

It is especially relevant in the context of using anisotropic building blocks with various symmetries. Two classes of tensor order parameters are associated with polyhedral nematic and bond orientational order. For the latter, a variation of classical bond order parameters (BOPs) is introduced, which takes advantage of the symmetry of constituent particles and/or expected crystalline phases. These symmetrized BOPs can be averaged over an entire system or assigned locally to an individual bond. By combining that with the bond percolation procedure, one is able to identify coherent domains within a self-assembled structure. As a demonstration of the proposed framework, we apply it to a simulated hybrid system that combines isotropic and patchy particles with octahedral symmetry. Not only does the methodology allow one to identify individual crystalline domains but also it detects coherent clusters of a peculiar compact amorphous structure that is not space-filling and lacks any long-range order.},

This implementation allows for flexibility in the coordinates used to expand the vibrational Hamiltonian as well as the order to which the perturbation theory is performed. It also provides a powerful tool for investigating the origin of spectral intensity and transition frequencies. Specifically, this flexibility allows for the analysis of which terms in the expansions of the Hamiltonian and dipole surface lead to the largest corrections to the energies and transition intensities, and how these conclusions depend on the coordinates used for these expansions. Comparisons of corrections to transition frequencies are reported for the Morse oscillator when the potential is expanded in Δ r and Morse coordinates as well as for water, water dimer, and peroxynitrous acid when the molecular Hamiltonians and dipole surfaces are expanded in Cartesian displacement coordinates and in the displacements of the bond-angle-dihedral internal coordinates. Further comparisons of the corrections to the transitions moments are made for H 2 O and ( H 2 O ) 2 ⁠ . It is found that while the transition frequencies and intensities are independent of coordinate choice, a good choice of coordinates leads to a cleaner interpretation of the origins of the anharmonicities in these systems.},

The related concept of toroidization, i.e., toroidal moment per unit volume, has been advocated in analogy to electric polarization and magnetization operated by electromagnetic fields and should be considered on the same footing regarding its relevance and practicality for understanding certain properties, e.g., ferrotoroidicity in condensed matter physics, and for rationalizing the behavior of charge-current distributions that neither radiate nor interact with external fields in classical and quantum electrodynamics. Toroidizability, i.e., the ability of sustaining toroidal moments, can also be defined by an analogy with electric polarizability and magnetizability. The present study shows that such a property is general and characterizes atoms and molecules and that the optical electric field of a light beam induces an oscillating anapole moment, i.e., the superposition of toroidal moment with an electric dipole moment. However, values of anapole polarizabilities induced by monochromatic light, estimated by time-dependent perturbation theory for rare gas atoms and a few molecules, are quite small and possibly hard to detect experimentally.},

This method is based on robust line-search energy minimization in reduced parameter space, exploiting approximate but accurate Hessian information from a surrogate theory, such as density functional theory. The surrogate theory is also used to characterize the potential energy surface, allowing for simple but reliable ways to maximize statistical efficiency while retaining controllable accuracy. We demonstrate the method by finding the minimum DMC energy structures of the selected flake-like aromatic molecules, such as benzene, coronene, and ovalene, represented by 2, 6, and 19 structural parameters, respectively. In each case, the energy minimum is found within two parallel line-search iterations. The method is near-optimal for a line-search technique and suitable for a broad range of applications. It is easily generalized to any electronic structure method where forces and stresses are still under active development and implementation, such as diffusion Monte Carlo, auxiliary-field Monte Carlo, and stochastic configuration interaction, as well as deterministic approaches such as the random-phase approximation. Accurate and efficient means of geometry optimization could shed light on a broad class of materials and molecules, showing high sensitivity of induced properties to structural variables.},

In several cases, the accuracy of the constructed predictive models for unknown materials is extremely high. In this study, we explored the adsorption of methane by metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and concluded that many top-performing materials often deviate significantly from the known materials used for the training of the machine learning algorithms. In such cases, the predictions of the machine learning algorithms may not be adequately accurate. For lack of the required appropriate data, we put forth a simple approach for the construction of artificial MOFs with the desired superior properties. Incorporation of such data during the training phase of the machine learning algorithms improves the predictions outstandingly.

  abstract = {We develop a quartic-scaling implementation of coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) based on low-rank tensor hypercontraction (THC) factorizations of both the electron repulsion integrals (ERIs) and the doubles amplitudes. This extends our rank-reduced (RR) coupled-cluster method to incorporate higher-order tensor factorizations. The THC factorization of the doubles amplitudes accounts for most of the gain in computational efficiency as it is sufficient, in conjunction with a Cholesky decomposition of the ERIs, to reduce the computational complexity of most contributions to the CCSD amplitude equations. Further THC factorization of the ERIs reduces the complexity of certain terms arising from nested commutators between the doubles excitation operator and the two-electron operator. We implement this new algorithm using graphical processing units and demonstrate that it enables CCSD calculations for molecules with 250 atoms and 2500 basis functions using a single computer node. Furthermore, we show that the new method computes correlation energies with comparable accuracy to the underlying RR-CCSD method.},

Here, we analyze the performance of the approach through the lens of the exact factorization approach. Since the exact factorization enables a rigorous definition of the potentials driving the photonic motion, it allows us to identify that the underestimation of photon number and intensities observed in earlier work is primarily due to an inadequate accounting of light–matter correlation in the classical Ehrenfest force rather than errors from treating the photons quasiclassically per se . The latter becomes problematic when the number of photons per mode begins to exceed a half.},

The relative contributions of dimers and trimers are about 2:1, in qualitative agreement with the doping statistics. Limited by the detection range of the experimental data, we cannot distinguish further structure details. The predominant contribution of helium also prevents observations of the solvation shell of the ionic cluster. Nevertheless, the success of this experiment demonstrates the feasibility of electron diffraction from an ionic all-light-atom system, dispelling the concern over limited particle concentration of ionic species in the diffraction region, and the need of heavy atoms for diffraction intensity.},

  abstract = {DNA replication and the related processes of genome expression require binding, assembly, and function of protein complexes at and near single-stranded (ss)–double-stranded (ds) DNA junctions. These central protein–DNA interactions are likely influenced by thermally induced conformational fluctuations of the DNA scaffold across an unknown distribution of functionally relevant states to provide regulatory proteins access to properly conformed DNA binding sites. Thus, characterizing the nature of conformational fluctuations and the associated structural disorder at ss–dsDNA junctions is critical for understanding the molecular mechanisms of these central biological processes. Here, we describe spectroscopic studies of model ss–dsDNA fork constructs that contain dimers of “internally labeled” cyanine (iCy3) chromophore probes that have been rigidly inserted within the sugar–phosphate backbones of the DNA strands. Our combined analyses of absorbance, circular dichroism, and two-dimensional fluorescence spectroscopy permit us to characterize the local conformational parameters and conformational distributions. We find that the DNA sugar–phosphate backbones undergo abrupt successive changes in their local conformations—initially from a right-handed and ordered DNA state to a disordered splayed-open structure and then to a disordered left-handed conformation—as the dimer probes are moved across the ss–dsDNA junction. Our results suggest that the sugar–phosphate backbones at and near ss–dsDNA junctions adopt specific position-dependent local conformations and exhibit varying extents of conformational disorder that deviate widely from the Watson–Crick structure. We suggest that some of these conformations can function as secondary-structure motifs for interaction with protein complexes that bind to and assemble at these sites.},

  abstract = {Recently, a novel class of responsive uncharged polymer brushes has been proposed [Klushin et al. , J. Chem. Phys. 154 (7), 074904 (2021)] where the brush-forming chains have an affinity to the substrate. For sufficiently strong surface interactions, a fraction of chains condenses into a near-surface layer, while the remaining ones form the outer brush with a reduced grafting density. The dense layer and the more tenuous outer brush can be seen as coexisting microphases. The effective grafting density of the outer brush is controlled by the adsorption strength and can be changed reversibly as a response to changes in environmental parameters. In this paper, we use numerical self-consistent field calculations to study this phenomenon in polydisperse brushes. Our results reveal an unexpected effect: Although all chains are chemically identical, shorter chains are adsorbed preferentially. Hence, with the increase in the surface affinity parameter, a reduction in the surface grafting density of the residual brush is accompanied by a change in the shape of its molecular mass distribution (MMD). In particular, an originally bidisperse brush can be effectively transformed into a nearly monodisperse one containing only the longer chain fraction. We introduce a method of assigning different chain conformations to one or the other microphase, based on analyzing tail length distributions. In a polydisperse brush with a uniform MMD, short chains are relegated to the adsorbed phase, leading to a narrower effective MMD in the residual brush. Preferential adsorption is not absolute, and longer chains are also partially involved in adsorption. As a result, not only the width of the distribution decreases but also its shape evolves away from the initial uniform distribution. We believe that the effect of preferential adsorption stems from a fundamental property of a polydisperse brush, which is characterized by a spectrum of chemical potential values for monomers belonging to chains of different lengths. Hence, preferential adsorption is also expected in polyelectrolyte brushes; moreover, brush polydispersity would affect coexistence with any other condensed phase, not necessarily related to adsorption.},

The solvent quality (or effective temperature, equivalently) is varied systematically, while all other interactions remain unaltered. For flexible polymers, the wetting transition temperature T w increases monotonically with chain length N , while the contact angle at temperatures far below T w is independent of N . For semiflexible polymer solutions, T w varies non-monotonically with the persistence length: Initially, T w increases with increasing chain stiffness and reaches a maximum, but then a sudden drop of T w is observed, which is associated with the isotropic–nematic transition of the system.},

The calculations are based on the B3LYP functional in its standard form, with a C basis set that is identical to that which was used previously in numerous calculations of the ground state properties of defective diamond. Both the vertically excited and thermally relaxed GR1 states are predicted to be excitonic and insulating, with extensive re-distribution of charge and spin density and back-donation to the donor site. The present calculations suggest that the triplet state makes no contribution to the GR1 excitation. The predicted energy of the zero phonon line (1.57 eV) compares with the observed value of 1.67 eV, which also suggests that the GR1 state is neutral. The bandgaps lead to an estimate of the next higher (GR2) excited state energy, which is close to that found in the observed spectra. Similar calculations are used to predict the energies of the higher gap states at (5.0–5.5) eV, including the bulk value of 7.3 eV, which compares with the experimental value of (7.3–7.4) eV. An explanation is suggested as to why only the GR1 luminescence is observed. This paper also suggests an alternative channel for the recovery of the ground state in photoluminescence studies.},

Using density functional theory (DFT), we examine the energies of hydrogen layers of varying coverage adsorbed on Pd(111). We find that H–H and H–Pd interactions promote the formation of the well-known 3 × 3 phases but also favor an unreported (3 × 3) phase at high H coverages for which we present experimental evidence. We relate the stability of isolated H vacancies of the (3 × 3) phase to the need of H 2 molecules to access bare Pd before they can dissociate. Following higher hydrogen dosage, we observe initial steps of hydride formation, starting with small clusters of subsurface hydrogen. The interaction between H and Pd is complicated by the persistent presence of carbon at the surface. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy experiments show that trace amounts of carbon, emerging from the Pd bulk despite many surface cleaning cycles, become mobile enough to repopulate the C-depleted surface at temperatures above 200 K. When exposed to hydrogen, these surface carbon atoms react to form benzene, as evidenced by scanning tunneling microscopy observations interpreted with DFT.},

  abstract = {Graphene has received tremendous interest in both chemical and physical fields. Among different edges of the graphene system, the zigzag edge terminated graphene nanoribbons (ZGNRs) show unique magnetic properties in the antiferromagnetic (AFM) state. However, to date, the understanding of ZGNR chemical properties is mainly based on the partial radical concept, and in previous studies, the energy differences between the ferromagnetic (FM) and AFM states are smaller than experimental evidence. Here, we report that the strongly constrained and appropriately normed functional gives a significantly larger energy difference, which matches the experimental observation. Furthermore, utilizing the energetics in the large difference case, we propose a conceptual supplement to the previous partial radical concept: the overall stabilization of the AFM state compared to the nonmagnetic (NM) state consists of two parts that affect the adsorption energy conversely. The NM-FM energy differences will strengthen the adsorption, being in line with the previous partial radical concept. The FM-AFM energy differences will instead weaken the adsorption. We perform calculations of H, OH, and LiS radical adsorption energies on ZGNRs to show that this weakening effect is numerically non-negligible: at least a ∼0.2 eV difference in the adsorption energies is found. We expect that this refinement of the partial radical concept can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the chemical properties of ZGNRs. The differences in adsorption energies for the H, OH, and LiS radicals found here lead to significant changes in the predicted reactivity of the ZGNR models.},

Different from the traditional three or more layered structure where the semiconductor is sandwiched between two electrodes, this device contains only two atomic layers: the MoSe 2 layer serving as the photon absorber and the graphene layer functioning as the charge acceptor and both electrodes. This structure looks like short-circuited but shows an obvious photoelectric response, which is aided by electron transfers from MoSe 2 to graphene. The photocurrent generation is explored quantitatively with electronic dynamics of graphene aided with ultrafast measurements. The two-layered architecture simplifies the fabrication of atomic-thick optoelectronic devices, allowing the as-grown semiconductors to be directly used and eliminating the damage-prone transfer process.},

The p H-dependence of experimental transport coefficients points to the sorption of hydroxide ions as the microscopic origin of the surface charge and recent ab initio calculations suggest that these ions behave differently on carbon and hBN, with only physisorption on the former and both physisorption and chemisorption on the latter. Using classical non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations of interfaces between an aqueous electrolyte and three models of hBN and graphite surfaces, we demonstrate the major influence of the sorption mode of hydroxide ions on the interfacial transport properties. Physisorbed surface charge leads to a considerable enhancement of the surface conductivity as compared to its chemisorbed counterpart, while values of the ζ -potential are less affected. The analysis of the MD results for the surface conductivity and ζ -potential in the framework of Poisson–Boltzmann–Stokes theory, as is usually done to analyze experimental data, further confirms the importance of taking into account both the mobility of surface hydroxide ions and the decrease in the slip length with increasing titratable surface charge density.},

  abstract = {The Interfacial Thermal Conductance (ITC) is a fundamental property of materials and has particular relevance at the nanoscale. The ITC quantifies the thermal resistance between materials of different compositions or between fluids in contact with materials. Furthermore, the ITC determines the rate of cooling/heating of the materials and the temperature drop across the interface. Here, we propose a method to compute local ITCs and temperature drops of nanoparticle–fluid interfaces. Our approach resolves the ITC at the atomic level using the atomic coordinates of the nanomaterial as nodes to compute local thermal transport properties. We obtain high-resolution descriptions of the interfacial thermal transport by combining the atomistic nodal approach, computational geometry techniques, and “computational farming” using non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. We use our method to investigate the ITC of nanoparticle–fluid interfaces as a function of the nanoparticle size and geometry, targeting experimentally relevant structures of gold nanoparticles: capped octagonal rods, cuboctahedrons, decahedrons, rhombic dodecahedrons, cubes, icosahedrons, truncated octahedrons, octahedrons, and spheres. We show that the ITC of these very different geometries varies significantly in different regions of the nanoparticle, increasing generally in the order face &lt; edge &lt; vertex. We show that the ITC of these complex geometries can be accurately described in terms of the local coordination number of the atoms in the nanoparticle surface. Nanoparticle geometries with lower surface coordination numbers feature higher ITCs, and the ITC generally increases with the decreasing particle size.},

  abstract = {Etalons are pairs of parallel plate mirrors with wavelength-scale spacing that exhibit cavity modes, giving transmission maxima (fringes) due to constructive interference. Infrared transmission measurements as a function of angle were used to determine the effective mass of etalon cavity modes using a gap filled with air and then liquid carbon tetrachloride. The air-filled etalon gives results in agreement with pure photon expectations established herein. Liquids with vibrations having strong infrared transition intensity (vibrational strong coupling mode) can strongly perturb the pattern of transmission resonances, creating mixed states of infrared cavity modes and molecular vibrations, i.e., cavity-vibration polaritons. The effective mass of one cavity-vibration polariton close to the strong vibration of carbon tetrachloride is 4.36 times heavier than the pure photon cavity mode expectation, i.e., the mass factor vs pure light. The mass factors are largest when closest to the strong vibrational frequency, and they converge to the one far away from the strong vibration. This work gives quantitative values of the effective mass of cavity-vibration polariton states and is a diagnostic for the mixing of vibrations with etalon transmission.},

  abstract = {Polymer electrolyte membranes, for example, the Nafion™ membranes, used in the fuel cells are responsible for separating reactive gas molecules as well as for the efficient exchange of protons. Although control of the permeation of the gases is important to enhance the fuel cell performance, the mechanism by which hydrogen and oxygen molecules permeate through the membranes remains unclear. To clarify the mechanism, we investigated the three-dimensional free-energy landscape of hydrogen and oxygen molecules in Nafion membranes with various water contents focusing on relevant diffusion paths. Low-free-energy paths are found mainly in the polymer phase and the interfacial region between the polymer and water phases. Thus, the path of the transportation may be attributed to the polymer phase and interfacial phases. However, the free-energy value in the aqueous phase is only slightly higher (∼1–2 k B T ) than that in the other two phases, which indicates that a secondary contribution from the aqueous phase is expected. The free-energy landscape in the polymer and interfacial phases was found rugged, while it is comparatively flat in the water phase. We also found that an increase in water content brings about a smoother free-energy landscape in the polymer and interfacial phases. The decreased ruggedness may facilitate the gas diffusivity. These observations help understand the molecular mechanism of the gas diffusion in the membranes.},

Using the relatively simple and physically coherent gamma model for the fluctuation distributions, we obtain a complete theoretical equation of state, also giving insight into the statistical/molecular organization and phase or pseudo-phase transitions occurring under the sub- and super-critical conditions, respectively. Application to sub- and super-critical fluid water and a comparison with the experimental data show that this model provides an accurate description of fluid water thermodynamics, except close to the critical point region where limited but significant deviations from the experimental data occur. We obtain quantitative evidence of the correspondence between the sub- and super-critical thermodynamic behaviors, with the super-critical water pseudo-liquid and pseudo-gas phases being the evolution of the sub-critical water liquid and gas phases, respectively. Remarkably, according to our model, we find that for fluid water the minimal subsystem corresponding to either the liquid-like or the gas-like condition includes an infinite number of molecules in the sub-critical regime (providing the expected singularities due to macroscopic phase transitions) but only five molecules in the super-critical regime (coinciding with the minimal possible hydrogen-bonding cluster), thus suggesting that the super-critical regime be characterized by the coexistence of nanoscopic subsystems in either the pseudo-liquid or the pseudo-gas phase with each subsystem fluctuating between forming and disrupting the minimal hydrogen-bonding network.},

These ions were the remaining alkaline and halogen ions, not previously considered in the Madrid-2019 force field. The force field, denoted as Madrid-2019-Extended, does not include polarizability and uses the TIP4P/2005 model of water and scaled charges for the ions. A charge of ±0.85 e is assigned to monovalent ions. The force field developed provides an accurate description of aqueous solution densities over a wide range of concentrations up to the solubility limit of each salt studied. Good predictions of viscosity and diffusion coefficients are obtained for concentrations below 2 m. Structural properties obtained with this force field are also in reasonable agreement with the experiment. The number of contact ion pairs has been controlled to be low so as to avoid precipitation of the system at concentrations close to the experimental solubility limit. A comprehensive comparison of the performance for aqueous solutions of alkaline halides of force fields of electrolytes using scaled and integer charges is now possible. This comparison will help in the future to learn about the benefits and limitations of the use of scaled charges to describe electrolyte solutions.},

The relative velocity that describes such movements can be a slowly relaxing variable. Its couplings to the nematic and the magnetic degrees of freedom are particularly interesting since the symmetry properties (behavior under spatial inversion and time reversal) of the three vectorial quantities involved are all different. As a consequence, a number of new crosscouplings involving the relative velocity exist. Some of them are discussed in more detail. First, we demonstrate that transverse temperature gradients generate transverse relative velocities and, vice versa, that transverse relative velocities give rise to temperature gradients. Second, we show that a simple shear flow in the relative velocity with the preferred direction in the shear plane can lead in a stationary situation to a tilt of the magnetization.},

Tetrahalides of the carbon group elements (group 14), lacking all intermolecular interactions but van der Waals, are among the most elementary of molecular compounds. Here, we report the investigation of CF 4 up to 46.5 GPa—the highest pressure up to which any tetrahalides of group 14 elements have been studied so far—by a combination of single-crystal x-ray diffraction (SC-XRDp), Raman spectroscopy, and ab initio calculations. These measurements reveal a pressure-induced reentrant phase transition (phase II → 2.8 G P a phase III → ∼ 20 G P a phase II R ) at room temperature and the formation of a previously unknown CF 4 cubic polymorph, named phase IV, after the laser heating of CF 4 at 46.5 GPa. In this work, the structures of phases II R , III, and IV were solved and the atomic coordinates were refined on the basis of SC-XRDp. A comparison of tetrahalides of group 14 elements underlines that reducing the intermolecular halogen–halogen distances leads to a structural rearrangement from close packing of the tetrahedral molecules to close packing of the halogen atoms.},

  abstract = {Kirkwood–Buff integrals (KBIs) connect the microscopic structure and thermodynamic properties of liquid solutions. KBIs are defined in the grand canonical ensemble and evaluated by assuming the thermodynamic limit (TL). In order to reconcile analytical and numerical approaches, finite-size KBIs have been proposed in the literature, resulting in two strategies to obtain their TL values from computer simulations. (i) The spatial block analysis method in which the simulation box is divided into subdomains of volume V to compute density fluctuations. (ii) A direct integration method where a corrected radial distribution function and a kernel that accounts for the geometry of the integration subvolumes are combined to obtain KBI as a function of V . In this work, we propose a method that connects both strategies into a single framework. We start from the definition of finite-size KBI, including the integration subdomain and an asymptotic correction to the radial distribution function, and solve them in Fourier space where periodic boundary conditions are trivially introduced. The limit q → 0, equivalent to the value of the KBI in the TL, is obtained via the spatial block-analysis method. When compared to the latter, our approach gives nearly identical results for all values of V . Moreover, all finite-size effect contributions (ensemble, finite-integration domains, and periodic boundary conditions) are easily identifiable in the calculation. This feature allows us to analyze finite-size effects independently and extrapolates the results of a single simulation to different box sizes. To validate our approach, we investigate prototypical systems, including SPC/E water and aqueous urea mixtures.},

By contrast, varying the deposition temperature and rate of vapor-deposited samples leads to dielectric constants in a range between 4.5 and 63 at T = 103 K. Values much below ε s = 63 persist for thousands of seconds, where the dielectric relaxation time is about 0.1 s. The observations can be interpreted by the formation of clusters in which pair-wise anti-parallel dipole orientation is the preferred state at temperatures well below the glass transition. These non-crystalline clusters are long-lived even above T g , where the remaining volume fraction is in the state of the equilibrium polar liquid.},

  abstract = {A novel trimeric perylenediimide (PDI) macrocycle was synthesized, and its intramolecular electronic couplings were investigated by bulk and single-molecule optical spectroscopy and by various theoretical approaches. In polarization-resolved excitation spectroscopy at 1.2 K in a PMMA matrix, the appearance and disappearance of the three zero-phonon lines (ZPLs) of an individual trimer by changing the polarization in steps of 60° nicely reflect an approximate triangular geometry of the macrocycle and indicate localized excitations that are transferred by incoherent hopping processes at time scales of around 1 ps as inferred from the ZPL linewidths. The electronic coupling strength deduced from the low temperature data is found to be in good agreement with theoretical estimates. Bulk spectroscopy in toluene at room temperature indicates that the excitations are also localized under these conditions. Theory reveals that the reasons for the localized nature of the excitations at room and low temperatures are different. For a rigid macrocycle, the excitations are predicted to be delocalized, but molecular dynamics simulations point to considerable structural flexibility at ambient temperatures, which counteracts excitation delocalization. At 1.2 K in a PMMA matrix, this effect is too small to lead to localization. Yet, supported by simple model calculations, the disorder in the PMMA host induces sufficient differences between the PDI chromophores, which again result in localized excitations. By addressing crucial aspects of excitation energy transfer, our combined approach provides a detailed and quantitative account of the interchromophore communication in a trimeric macrocycle.},

Developing a semi-empirical model, we describe the shift as arising from three fundamental interactions: (1) a fractional change in the alkali’s valence electron density at the alkali nucleus, η, which affects the hyperfine contact term; (2) a mixing of p-wavefunction character into the alkali ground state (characterized by the probability for p-state character appearing in the perturbed wavefunction ξ 1 2 ), which gives rise to an electric quadrupole term in the ground-state hyperfine splitting; and (3) an interaction of the alkali’s valence electron with the magnetic field produced by molecular rotation, characterized by a magnetic field strength B vdW . In addition to these molecular parameters, the model also depends on the formation rate of van der Waals molecules, k f P 2 , and the breakup rate of the molecules, k b P, where P is the noble-gas pressure. Fitting the model to the 85 Rb/Xe and 87 Rb/Xe experimental data of McGuyer and co-workers (and taking previously measured values for k f and B vdW ), we find that η = 9 × 10 −3 , ξ 1 2 = 5 × 10 −3 , and k b = 2.9×10 7 s −1 /Torr.},

  abstract = {A new difference-frequency method based on electro-optic phase modulators (EOMs) and two free-running lasers is reported to perform chirped-pulse dual-comb spectroscopy in the THz region. A variation of a near-IR interleaving scheme we recently reported has been developed to interleave the EOMs’ orders and sidebands and to map THz comb teeth into the radio-frequency region below 1 MHz. The down-converted comb teeth are shown to have transform limited widths of 1 Hz over a 1 s time scale. The dual chirp-pulsed scheme is used to measure the complex line shapes of two water vapor lines below 600 GHz and to temporally magnify the effects of rapid passage by more than 60 000. For the 1 1,0 ← 1 0,1 transition in H 2 O, a pressure dependent phase perturbation is observed in the rapid passage response over the magnified time scale in contrast to a uniform line shape transformation observed for the 2 1,1 ← 2 0,2 transition of D 2 O. The possible origins for this anomalous behavior are modeled and discussed. The method is applicable to any region where difference or sum frequency waves can be generated.},

  abstract = {We present a 3D isotropic ab initio three-body ( para -H 2 ) 3 interaction potential energy surface (PES). The electronic structure calculations are carried out at the correlated coupled-cluster theory level, with single, double, and perturbative triple excitations. The calculations use an augmented correlation-consistent triple zeta basis set and a supplementary midbond function. We construct the PES using the reproducing-kernel Hilbert space toolkit [O. T. Unke and M. Meuwly, J. Chem. Inf. Model. 57 , 1923 (2017)] with phenomenological and empirical adjustments to account for short-range and long-range behaviors. The ( para -H 2 ) 3 interaction energies deviate drastically from the Axilrod–Teller–Muto (ATM) potential at short intermolecular separations. We find that the configuration of three para -H 2 molecules at the corners of an equilateral triangle is responsible for the majority of the ( para -H 2 ) 3 interaction energy contribution in a hexagonal-close-packed lattice. In cases where two para -H 2 molecules are close to one another while the third is far away, the ( para -H 2 ) 3 interaction PES takes the form of a modified version of the ATM potential. We expect the combination of this PES together with a first-principles para -H 2 – para -H 2 adiabatic hindered rotor potential to outperform a widely used effective pair potential for condensed many-body systems of para -H 2 .},

Driven by advances in the synthesis of such structures, carbyne has attracted significant interest in recent years, with numerous experimental studies exploring its remarkable properties. As for other carbon nanomaterials, Raman spectroscopy has played an important role in the characterization of carbyne. In particular, tip-enhanced Raman scattering (TERS) has enabled imaging and spectroscopy down to the single-chain level. In this article, we provide a general introduction to carbyne and discuss the principles and experimental implementation of TERS as a key technology for the investigation of this material system. Within this context, the development of optical nanoantennas as TERS probes is addressed. We then summarize the latest progress in the Raman spectroscopic characterization of confined carbyne, with a focus on the findings assisted by TERS. Finally, we discuss open questions in the field and outline how TERS can contribute to solving them in future studies.},

In this paper, we report a joint experimental and theoretical study on x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) of aqueous cellobiose, a disaccharide unit of cellulose. In the experimental part, high resolution measurements of the carbon K-edge XAS spectra were taken. In the theoretical part, ab initio molecular dynamics simulations and ensemble calculations of electronic excited states were performed to obtain the continuous XAS spectra. The XAS spectra were found to have three characteristic peaks at 289.3, 290.7, and 293.6 eV, each representing the absorption by carbon atoms of the alcohol group, the hemiacetal group, and both of these functional groups. It was found that the peak heights in the spectrum change considerably over the temperature range of 25–60 °C, which is a reflection of the number of hydrogen bonds between cellobiose and water. We suggest that this spectral change could be useful information for identifying the hydration of cellulose in various environments.},

  abstract = {The net charge of solvated entities, ranging from polyelectrolytes and biomolecules to charged nanoparticles and membranes, depends on the local dissociation equilibrium of individual ionizable groups. Incorporation of this phenomenon, charge regulation (CR), in theoretical and computational models requires dynamic, configuration-dependent recalculation of surface charges and is therefore typically approximated by assuming constant net charge on particles. Various computational methods exist that address this. We present an alternative, particularly efficient CR Monte Carlo method (CR-MC), which explicitly models the redistribution of individual charges and accurately samples the correct grand-canonical charge distribution. In addition, we provide an open-source implementation in the large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator molecular dynamics (MD) simulation package, resulting in a hybrid MD/CR-MC simulation method. This implementation is designed to handle a wide range of implicit-solvent systems that model discreet ionizable groups or surface sites. The computational cost of the method scales linearly with the number of ionizable groups, thereby allowing accurate simulations of systems containing thousands of individual ionizable sites. By matter of illustration, we use the CR-MC method to quantify the effects of CR on the nature of the polyelectrolyte coil–globule transition and on the effective interaction between oppositely charged nanoparticles.},

  abstract = {The diagonal nonadiabatic term arising from the Born–Oppenheimer wave function ansatz contains contributions from a vector and scalar potential. The former is provably zero when the wave function can be taken to be real valued, and the latter, known as the diagonal Born–Oppenheimer correction (DBOC), is typically small in magnitude. Therefore, unless high accuracy is sought, the diagonal nonadiabatic term is usually neglected when calculating molecular properties. In the presence of a magnetic field, the wave function is generally complex, and the geometric vector potential gives rise to a screening force that is qualitatively important for molecular dynamics. This screening force is written in terms of the Berry curvature and is added to the bare Lorentz force acting on the nuclei in the presence of the field. In this work, we derive analytic expressions for the Berry curvature and DBOC using both first- and second-quantization formalisms for the case of generalized and restricted Hartree–Fock theories in a uniform magnetic field. The Berry curvature and DBOC are calculated as a function of the magnetic field strength and the bond distance for the ground-state singlets of H 2 , LiH, BH, and CH + . We also examine the stability and time-reversal symmetry of the underlying self-consistent field solutions. The character of the DBOC and Berry curvature is found to depend on the magnetic field and varies between molecules. We also identify instances of broken time-reversal symmetry for the dissociation curves of BH and CH + .},

Recently, the approach has been extended to moderate size molecules with up to 15 atoms. The algorithm, including “purification of the basis,” is computationally efficient for energies; however, we found that the recent extension to obtain analytical gradients, despite being a remarkable advance over previous methods, could be further improved. Here, we report developments to further compact a purified basis and, more significantly, to use the reverse differentiation approach to greatly speed up gradient evaluation. We demonstrate this for our recent four-body water interaction potential. Comparisons of training and testing precision on the MD17 database of energies and gradients (forces) for ethanol against numerous machine-learning methods, which were recently assessed by Dral and co-workers, are given. The PIP fits are as precise as those using these methods, but the PIP computation time for energy and force evaluation is shown to be 10–1000 times faster. Finally, a new PIP potential energy surface (PES) is reported for ethanol based on a more extensive dataset of energies and gradients than in the MD17 database. Diffusion Monte Carlo calculations that fail on MD17-based PESs are successful using the new PES.},

Within this framework, the effect of coupling to the nuclear degrees of freedom, as well as to any projected-out electronic reduced density matrix elements, is captured by a memory kernel and an inhomogeneous term, whose dimensionalities are dictated by the number of electronic reduced density matrix elements included in the subset of interest. We show that the memory kernel and inhomogeneous term within such GQMEs can be calculated from projection-free inputs of the same dimensionality, which can be cast in terms of the corresponding subsets of overall system two-time correlation functions. The applicability and feasibility of such reduced-dimensionality GQMEs is demonstrated on the two-state spin-boson benchmark model. To this end, we compare and contrast the following four types of GQMEs: (1) a full density matrix GQME, (2) a single-population scalar GQME, (3) a populations-only GQME, and (4) a subset GQME for any combination of populations and coherences. Using a method based on the mapping Hamiltonian approach and linearized semiclassical approximation to calculate the projection-free inputs, we find that while single-population GQMEs and subset GQMEs containing only one population are less accurate, they can still produce reasonable results and that the accuracy of the results obtained via the populations-only GQME and a subset GQME containing both populations is comparable to that obtained via the full density matrix GQMEs.},

  abstract = {The velocity distribution of a classical gas of atoms in thermal equilibrium is the normal Maxwell distribution. It is well known that for sub-recoiled laser cooled atoms, Lévy statistics and deviations from usual ergodic behavior come into play. In a recent letter, we showed how tools from infinite ergodic theory describe the cool gas. Here, using the master equation, we derive the scaling function and the infinite invariant density of a stochastic model for the momentum of laser cooled atoms, recapitulating results obtained by Bertin and Bardou [Am. J. Phys. 76 , 630 (2008)] using life-time statistics. We focus on the case where the laser trapping is strong, namely, the rate of escape from the velocity trap is R ( v ) ∝ | v | α for v → 0 and α &gt; 1. We construct a machinery to investigate time averages of physical observables and their relation to ensemble averages. The time averages are given in terms of functionals of the individual stochastic paths, and here we use a generalization of Lévy walks to investigate the ergodic properties of the system. Exploring the energy of the system, we show that when α = 3, it exhibits a transition between phases where it is either an integrable or a non-integrable observable with respect to the infinite invariant measure. This transition corresponds to very different properties of the mean energy and to a discontinuous behavior of fluctuations. While the integrable phase is described by universal statistics and the Darling–Kac law, the more challenging case is the exploration of statistical properties of non-integrable observables. Since previous experimental work showed that both α = 2 and α = 4 are attainable, we believe that both phases could also be explored experimentally.},

We introduce a singular value decomposition approach in order to represent general interaction potentials as matrix product operators. The method can be used to describe linear chains containing up to 50 water molecules. Properties such as the ground state energy, the von-Neumann entanglement entropy, and orientational correlation functions are computed. The effect of basis set truncation on the convergence of ground state properties is assessed. It is shown that specific intermolecular distance regions can be grouped by their von-Neumann entanglement entropy, which in turn can be associated with electric dipole–dipole alignment and hydrogen bond formation.

  abstract = {In large-scale quantum-chemical calculations, the electron-repulsion integral (ERI) tensor rapidly becomes the bottleneck in terms of memory and disk space. When an external finite magnetic field is employed, this problem becomes even more pronounced because of the reduced permutational symmetry and the need to work with complex integrals and wave function parameters. One way to alleviate the problem is to employ a Cholesky decomposition (CD) to the complex ERIs over gauge-including atomic orbitals. The CD scheme establishes favorable compression rates by selectively discarding linearly dependent product densities from the chosen basis set while maintaining a rigorous and robust error control. This error control constitutes the main advantage over conceptually similar methods such as density fitting, which relies on employing pre-defined auxiliary basis sets. We implemented the use of the CD in the framework of finite-field (ff) Hartree–Fock and ff second-order Møller–Plesset perturbation theory (MP2). Our work demonstrates that the CD compression rates are particularly beneficial in calculations in the presence of a finite magnetic field. The ff-CD-MP2 scheme enables the correlated treatment of systems with more than 2000 basis functions in strong magnetic fields within a reasonable time span.},

The computational time required for a numerically exact treatment of this frequency dependence is O ( N 6 ), where N is the system size. To avoid the common static screening approximation, we show that the full-frequency dynamical BSE can be exactly reformulated as a frequency-independent eigenvalue problem in an expanded space of single and double excitations. When combined with an iterative eigensolver and the density fitting approximation to the electron repulsion integrals, this reformulation yields a dynamical BSE algorithm whose computational time is O ( N 5 ), which we verify numerically. Furthermore, the reformulation provides direct access to excited states with dominant double excitation character, which are completely absent in the spectrum of the statically screened BSE. We study the 2 1 A g state of butadiene, hexatriene, and octatetraene and find that GW/BSE overestimates the excitation energy by about 1.5–2 eV and significantly underestimates the double excitation character.},

  abstract = {We re-examine the recently introduced basis-set correction theory based on density-functional theory, which consists of correcting the basis-set incompleteness error of wave-function methods using a density functional. We use a one-dimensional model Hamiltonian with delta-potential interactions, which has the advantage of making easier to perform a more systematic analysis than for three-dimensional Coulombic systems while keeping the essence of the slow basis convergence problem of wave-function methods. We provide some mathematical details about the theory and propose a new variant of basis-set correction, which has the advantage of being suited to the development of an adapted local-density approximation. We show, indeed, how to develop a local-density approximation for the basis-set correction functional, which is automatically adapted to the basis set employed, without resorting to range-separated density-functional theory as in previous studies, but using instead a finite uniform electron gas whose electron–electron interaction is projected on the basis set. The work puts the basis-set correction theory on firmer ground and provides an interesting strategy for the improvement of this approach.},

  abstract = {Exciton transport in molecular materials is usually well described by Fermi’s golden rule within the Condon approximation. However, when collective or molecular vibrations are thermally accessible, dynamic disorder effects have a sizable impact on the predicted exciton transfer rates and need to be considered for quantitative evaluation. In this work, we derive an analytic expression for the distribution of the electronic couplings that gives direct access to averaged quantities without the need to perform explicit calculations for a distribution of structural conformations. The distribution of exciton couplings and transfer rates obtained by this simple model in the study of singlet exciton transfer in the crystal naphthalene are in very good agreement with the data generated from molecular dynamics.},

For a set of small polyatomic molecules (acenes and azulene), we show that our calculated rates are in near quantitative agreement with the rates derived from experiments. Interestingly, we find that our rates do not agree with previous golden-rule-based theoretical efforts; detailed analysis shows that while the level of electronic structure theory can play a role, the more significant error is from not fully converging the numerical time integral over the oscillatory vibration correlation function. We then use our singularity-free IC rate expression to compute the rate of recombination of the correlated triplet pair state generated by intramolecular singlet fission in a trio of bipentacenes. We show that the recombination rates are in good agreement with experimentally observed trends—specifically, the rates are robust to temperature changes and decrease rapidly with increasing inter-monomer dihedral angle. Finally, we use a pair-wise breakdown of normal mode contributions to the rate to identify the key vibrational modes that drive recombination in bipentacenes.},

To illustrate its advantages, we utilize the presented scheme in the geometry optimization of a technologically important host–guest molecular system: a pentacene-doped p -terphenyl crystal, a core component of a room-temperature MASER device. We show that, as opposed to the simpler and widely used hybrid scheme ONIOM, our Quantum-Coupling QM/MM scheme was able to reproduce explicit interactions in the minimum energy configuration for the host–guest complex. We also show that, as a result of these explicit interactions, the host–guest complex exhibits an oriented net electric dipole moment that is responsible for red-shifting the energy of the first singlet–singlet electronic excitation of pentacene.},

  abstract = {Optimizing energy and charge transfer is key in design and implementation of efficient layered conductive metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) for practical applications. In this work, for the first time, we investigate the role of both long-range excitonic and short-range charge transfer coupling as well as their dependency on reorganization energy on through-space charge transfer in layered MOFs. A π -stacked model system is built based on the archetypal Ni 3 (HITP) 2 , HITP = 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexaiminotriphenylene, layered MOF, and a Frenkel/charge transfer Holstein Hamiltonian is developed that takes into account both electronic coupling and intramolecular vibrations. The dependency of the long- and short-range couplings of secondary building units (SBUs) on the stacking geometry is evaluated, which predicts that photophysical properties of layered MOFs critically depend on the degree of ordering between layers. We show that the impact of the two coupling sources in these materials can be discerned or enhanced by the displacement of the SBUs along the long or short molecular axes. The effects of vibronic spectral signatures are examined in both perturbative and resonance regimes. Although, to the best of our knowledge, displacement engineering in layered MOFs currently remains beyond reach, the findings reported here offer new details on the photophysical structure–property relationships in layered MOFs and provide suggestions on how to combine elements of molecular design and engineering to achieve desirable properties and functions for nano- and mesoscale optoelectronic applications.},

  abstract = {The moving boundary truncated grid method is developed to study the wave packet dynamics of electronic nonadiabatic transitions between a pair of diabatic potential energy surfaces. The coupled time-dependent Schrödinger equations (TDSEs) in the diabatic representation are integrated using adaptive truncated grids for both the surfaces. As time evolves, a variable number of grid points fixed in space are activated and deactivated without any advance information of the wave packet dynamics. Essential features of the truncated grid method are first illustrated through applications to three one-dimensional model problems, including the systems of single avoided crossing, dual avoided crossing, and extended coupling region with reflection. As a demonstration for chemical applications, the truncated grid method is then employed to study the dynamics of photoisomerization of retinal in rhodopsin described by a two-electronic-state two-dimensional model. To demonstrate the capability of the truncated grid method to deal with the electronic nonadiabatic problem in high dimensionality, we consider a multidimensional electronic nonadiabatic system in two, three, and four dimensions. The results indicate that the correct grid points are automatically activated to capture the growth and decay of the wave packets on both of the surfaces. Therefore, the truncated grid method greatly decreases the computational effort to integrate the coupled TDSEs for multidimensional electronic nonadiabatic systems.},

In this work, we show that the factorized form is quite flexible, allowing one to range from a conventional configuration interaction, to conventional unitary coupled cluster, to efficient approximations that lie in between these two. The variational minimization of the energy often allows simpler factorized unitary coupled cluster approximations to achieve high accuracy, even if they do not accurately approximate the Trotter product formula.

As common virtue of the Monte Carlo integration techniques, quantum Monte Carlo algebraic diagrammatic construction (QMCADC) enables exploitation of the sparsity of the effective ADC matrix, and it reduces the memory requirements by storing only a portion of configurations at each iteration. Furthermore, distributing memory and processing loads to different computing nodes enables the use of fast developing parallel computing resources. Here, the theory and implementation of QMCADC is reported and its viability is demonstrated by the first proof-of-principle calculations. The focus lies on the first excited state and the reproduction of the corresponding lowest vertical excitation energy of various molecular systems. QMCADC is shown to be a genuine stochastic solution of the ADC eigenvalue problem, and exact ADC values can be obtained with a marginal controllable error.},

  abstract = {It is well-known experimentally that the positively charged muon and the muonium atom may bind to molecules and solids, and through muon’s magnetic interaction with unpaired electrons, valuable information on the local environment surrounding the muon is deduced. Theoretical understanding of the structure and properties of resulting muonic species requires accurate and efficient quantum mechanical computational methodologies. In this paper, the two-component density functional theory (TC-DFT), as a first principles method, which treats electrons and the positive muon on an equal footing as quantum particles, is introduced and implemented computationally. The main ingredient of this theory, apart from the electronic exchange–correlation functional, is the electron–positive muon correlation functional that is foreign to the purely electronic DFT. A Wigner-type local electron–positive muon correlation functional, termed eμc-1, is proposed in this paper and its capability is demonstrated through its computational application to a benchmark set of muonic organic molecules. The TC-DFT equations containing eμc-1 are not only capable of predicting the muon’s binding site correctly, but they also reproduce muon’s zero-point vibrational energies and the muonic densities much more accurately than the TC-DFT equations lacking eμc-1. Thus, this study sets the stage for developing accurate electron–positive muon functionals, which can be used within the context of the TC-DFT to elucidate the intricate interaction of the positive muon with complex molecular systems.},

In order to cover the complete function space for exponentially decaying densities, the kernel of a differential operator D γ [ ρ ] is introduced and analyzed in dependence of γ . The conclusive choice of γ = 1 assures that the solution functions span the complete space of molecular electron densities. As a result, the new approximant preserves the desired feature of the older approximation, which is the reciprocal singularity if the electron density decays exponentially, and eliminates artificial shallow wells (holes), which are responsible for an artificial “charge leak.” Numerical considerations using the standard validation procedure introduced by Wesolowski and Weber [Chem.

Careful selection of the active space and basis set in the CASPT2 approach allows for a reliable description of the GSA and ESA features; cost-effective DFT-based geometries can be utilized without a significant loss of accuracy. Double excitations are shown to play a pivotal role already for higher excited states in the GSA spectrum, however, without a relevant impact on the discernible spectral features.

  abstract = {The coupled amide-I vibrational modes in peptide systems such as fibrillar aggregates can often provide a wealth of structural information, although the associated spectra can be difficult to interpret. Using exciton scattering calculations, we characterized the polarization selective 2DIR peak patterns for cross-α peptide fibrils, a challenging system given the similarity between the monomeric and fibrillar structures, and interpret the results in light of recently collected 2D data on the cross-α peptide phenol soluble modulin α3. We find that stacking of α-helices into fibrils couples the bright modes across helical subunits, generating three new Bloch-like extended excitonic states that we designate A ⊥ , E ∥ , and E ⊥ . Coherent superpositions of these states in broadband 2DIR simulations lead to characteristic signals that are sensitive to fibril length and match the experimental 2DIR spectra.},

  abstract = {Sudden cardiac death contributed to half of all deaths from cardiovascular diseases. The mechanism of the kinetic cycle of cardiac myosin is crucial for heart protection and drug development. The state change in the myosin kinetic cycle from the rigor state to the post-rigor state is fundamental to explain binding and dissociation. Here, we used β-cardiac myosin in the rigor and post-rigor states to model the actomyosin complexes. Molecular dynamics simulations, electrostatic analysis, and energetic analysis of actomyosin complexes were performed in this work. The results showed that there are fewer interactions and lower electrostatic binding strength in the post-rigor state than in the rigor state. In the post-rigor state, there were higher free binding energy, fewer salt bridges, and fewer hydrogen bonds. The results showed a lower binding affinity in the post-rigor state than in the rigor state. The decrease in the binding affinity provided important conditions for dissociation of the myosin from the actin filament. Although previous studies focused mostly on the binding process, this study provides evidence of dissociation, which is even more important in the myosin kinetic cycle. This research on the mechanism of myosin kinetic cycles provides a novel direction for future genetic disease studies.},

We define a new scalar quantity, the geodesic mixing parameter Ξ, through which we detail the effect of miscibility and the role of preferential affinity of APs with one of the two components of the mixture, distinguishing unambiguously between mixing and demixing solely induced by APs. Finally, by inspecting the distributions of void sizes, we show how void formation is ruled by miscibility and AP-mixture interactions, which control the transition from exponentially tailed to fat-tailed distributions.},

  abstract = {In this work, we studied the equilibrium structures formed by a single ( AB ) k multiblock copolymer chain. Within our model, the interactions between the A-type beads were repulsive and the B-type beads could form pairwise reversible bonds with each other (BB-bonds). Our goal was to investigate how the formation of pairwise reversible bonds between the A-type beads and the B-type beads (AB-bonds) affected the structure of the chain. We observed the formation of well-studied intramolecular micelles when the AB-bonds were absent; however, the chain folding changed dramatically when the formation of the AB-bonds was introduced. In this case, the multiblock copolymer formed a globule, which had a unique heterogeneous checkerboard-like distribution of the contact density. We discovered that contacts of beads of different types (i.e., AB-contacts) occurred much more frequently than contacts of beads of the same type (i.e., AA- and BB-contacts) in these structures. This effect can be explained by a simple model of chemical equilibrium in a two-component fluid of reversibly interacting particles, which can be solved exactly. This novel type of folding can serve as a basic model for any ( AB ) k multiblock copolymer chain with a non-vanishing attraction between A and B blocks.},

The efficiency of the surface enhancement RS (SERS) of the synthesized metasurfaces has been investigated on the example of organic compound malachite green, and the possibility to recognize extremely low fractions of the substance was demonstrated. An increase in the SERS signal with an increase in the deformation of the samples and even greater enhancement after their unloading and relaxation were found. The experiment on tensile strain and relaxation of the deformation of the samples and the consequent change in their electrical conductivity confirm the assumption that SERS appears on microcracks edges with a rather small distance between their boundaries.

  abstract = {Recently, the reversible heat production during the electric double layer (EDL) buildup in a sodium chloride solution was measured experimentally [Janssen et al. , Phys. Rev. Lett. 119 , 166002 (2017)] and matched with theoretical predictions from density functional theory and molecular dynamics simulations [Glatzel et al. , J. Chem. Phys. 154 , 064901 (2021)]. In the latter, it was found that steric interactions of ions with the electrode’s walls, which result in the so-called Stern layer, are sufficient to explain the experimental results. As only symmetric ion sizes in a restricted primitive model were examined, it is instructive to investigate systems of unequal ion sizes that lead to modified Stern layers. In this work, we explore the impact of ion asymmetry on the reversible heat production for each electrode separately. In this context, we further study an extension of the primitive model where hydration shells of ions can evade in the vicinity of electrode’s walls. We find a strong dependence on system parameters such as particle sizes and the total volume taken by particles. Here, we even found situations where one electrode was heated and the other electrode was cooled at the same time during charging, while, in sum, both electrodes together behaved very similarly to the already mentioned experimental results. Thus, heat production should also be measured in experiments for each electrode separately. By this, the importance of certain ingredients that we proposed to model electrolytes could be confirmed or ruled out experimentally, finally leading to a deeper understanding of the physics of EDLs.},

  abstract = {Efficient utilization of hot charge carriers is of utmost benefit for a semiconductor-based optoelectronic device. Herein, a one-dimensional (1D)/two-dimensional (2D) heterojunction was fabricated in the form of CdS/MoS 2 nanorod/nanosheet composite and migration of hot charge carriers was being investigated with the help of transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy. The band alignment was such that both the electrons and holes in the CdS region tend to migrate into the MoS 2 region following photoexcitation. The composite system is composed of optical signatures of both CdS and MoS 2 , with the dominance of CdS nanorods. In addition, the TA signal of MoS 2 is substantially enhanced in the heterosystem at the cost of the diminished CdS signal, confirming the migration of charge carrier population from CdS to MoS 2 . This migration phenomenon was dominated by the hot carrier transfer. The hot carriers in the high energy states of CdS are preferentially migrated into the MoS 2 states rather than being cooled to the band edge. The hot carrier transfer time for a 400 nm pump excitation was calculated to be 0.21 ps. This is much faster than the band edge electron transfer process, occurring at 2.0 ps time scale. We found that these migration processes are very much dependent on the applied pump photon energy. Higher energy pump photons are more efficient in the hot carrier transfer process and place these hot carriers in the higher energy states of MoS 2 , further extending charge carrier separation. This detailed spectroscopic investigation would help in the fabrication of better 1D/2D heterojunctions and advance the optoelectronic field.},

The volatile soluble products from methanol and formic acid oxidation on Pt have been detected by DEMS, while adsorbed intermediates have been identified with ATR-FTIR spectroscopy. Besides CO 2 and methylformate, which were detected by DEMS, other non-volatile soluble intermediates such as formaldehyde and formic acid were also generated during methanol oxidation on Pt. Besides water adsorption bands, linearly bonded CO, bridge-bonded CO, adsorbed formate, adsorbed formic acid, and adsorbed CHO bands were observed by ATR-FTIR spectroscopy during methanol and formic acid oxidation on Pt. Formic acid adsorption suppressed the formate and water adsorption. Our results suggest that formate could be an inactive adsorbed species, rather than an active intermediate, for both methanol and formic acid oxidation. Pb modification of Pt significantly enhanced formic acid oxidation through the direct pathway due to the third-body effect and electronic effects. Formic acid oxidation took place mainly at Pb modified low-coordinated defect sites at low potentials. Formic acid decomposition to form adsorbed CO occurred only in the hydrogen region, and Pb modification also slightly enhanced the successive oxidation of adsorbed CO. A double-peak infrared band was observed for linearly bound CO on the Pt film and was simulated with the Fresnel equations and Bruggeman effective medium theory.},

The defect-related surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) effect is investigated by depositing a thin copper phthalocyanine layer (5 nm) as the probe molecule on the monolayer WS 2 triangles surface. Higher SERS enhancement effects are observed at the defect-rich areas. Furthermore, tip-enhanced optical measurements are performed, which can reveal morphologically defected areas invisible in the confocal optical measurements. Furthermore, the area with high defect density appears brighter than the low-defected area in the tip-enhanced optical measurements, which are different from the observation in the confocal optical measurements. The underlying reasons are attributed to the near-field enhancement of the defect exciton emission induced by the optically excited tip and to an improved coupling efficiency between the tip-generated near-field with the altered dipole moment orientation at the local defect.},

By means of steady-state/time-resolved/temperature-dependent photoluminescence spectroscopy and ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy, we reveal that the slight Zn-doping in CdTe QDs can greatly affect the involved carrier relaxation dynamics through a density-of-state modification for both near-band-edge and localized surface trap states. Furthermore, such slight doping is found to be quite significant in modulating the photoreduction efficiency (of particular relation to the localized surface trap states) as well as altering the involved relaxation/reaction activation energy and phonon effect in this QDs system. This work enriches our fundamental understanding of the element doping-induced surface/interface effects, from the dynamics perspective in particular, and, hence, offers helpful guidance for QDs-based photoelectrochemical design and optimization.},

What are the basic structures of molecular glasses, e.g., close to the crystalline structure or some special structures such as icosahedral cluster?

We have constructed a novel cryostat to prepare simple molecular glasses by vapor deposition and performed in situ synchrotron radiation x-ray diffraction experiments. The glassy state of a simple molecule CS 2 , which cannot be vitrified by normal liquid quenching, was successfully prepared with this instrument, and its diffraction data were collected in a wide Q -range of 0.16–25.7 Å −1 with a high-energy diffractometer at BL04B2, SPring-8. The diffraction data of liquid CS 2 were also recorded in a wide temperature range of 160–300 K. These diffraction data were analyzed with molecular dynamics simulations and reverse Monte Carlo modelings to investigate orientational correlation. From the obtained 3D structure models, the orientational correlation between neighboring CS 2 molecules was investigated quantitatively as a function of temperature. At room temperature, the parallel and T-shaped arrangements are preferred for the nearest neighbor correlation. On cooling, these arrangements are developed gradually, and its rate became prominent below the melting temperature (162 K). In the glassy state, the slipped-parallel arrangement is dominant as well as the T-shaped arrangement. Both arrangements appear in the CS 2 crystal, indicating that the structure of glassy CS 2 is close to that of crystalline CS 2 .},

  abstract = {A previously introduced framework to identify local order parameters (OPs) distinctive of incipient complex mesophases, such as bicontinuous network phases, is used in this work to evaluate nucleation free-energy barriers. The sampling techniques considered are the mean-first-passage-time (MFPT) method and novel variants of umbrella sampling, including Hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) and a dual-OP-method that uses a blunter global OP for the umbrella bias while keeping record of configurations for analysis with a local OP. These methods were chosen for their ability to minimize or avoid frequent calculation of the expensive local OP, which makes their continuous on-the-fly tracking computationally very inefficient. These techniques were first validated by studying phase-transition barriers of model systems, i.e., the vapor–liquid nucleation of Lennard-Jones argon and a binary nanoparticle model. The disorder-to-order free energy barrier was then traced for the double gyroid and single diamond formed by mesoscopic bead-spring macromolecular models. The dual OP method was found to be the most robust and computationally efficient, since, unlike HMC, it does not require the expensive local OP to be computed on-the-fly, and unlike the MFPT method, it can negotiate large barriers aided by the biased sampling. The dual OP method requires, however, that a cheap global OP be identified and correlated (in a post-processing step) with the local OP that describes the structure of the critical nucleus, a process that can be aided by machine learning.},

  abstract = {Raman spectroscopy investigations on L-methionine (L-Met) performed in a large temperature range (170–420 K) and in a wide spectral window (5–3600 cm −1 ) have revealed an extended disordering mechanism triggered by thermally activated motions of the terminal side-chain atoms, from 250 up to 390 K. This very progressive disordering process is characterized by two thermodynamic features, the first corresponding to a broad endotherm (250 → 310 K) marking the beginning of the process, while the second ending the disordering transformation is a sharp endothermic peak at 390 K. These thermodynamic events are correlated with the softening of lattice vibrations and the increase of the quasielastic scattering, considered as the signatures of displacive phase transitions. The amorphous-like band-shape of the low-frequency Raman spectrum collected above 390 K, resulting from the strong anharmonicity of local motions, is contrasting with the detection of additional Bragg peaks above 390 K by x-ray diffraction, consistent with the C p jump accompanying the endothermic peak. These observations suggest that L-Met is progressively dynamically disordered adopting additional configurations in the crystalline lattice through rotations of CH 3 and the side-chain flexibility not clearly detected by x-ray diffraction. These results should be crucial for considering the stability of dried proteins composed of methionine residues.},

  abstract = {Laser-induced fluorescence spectra and excitation lifetimes of anthracene, tetracene, and pentacene molecules attached to the surface of solid argon clusters have been measured with respect to cluster size, density of molecules, and excitation density. Results are compared to previous studies on the same sample molecules attached to neon clusters. A contrasting lifetime behavior of anthracene on neon and argon clusters is discussed, and mechanisms are suggested to interpret the results. Although both neon and argon clusters are considered to be weakly interacting environments, we find that the excitation decay dynamics of the studied acenes depends significantly on the cluster material. Moreover, we find even qualitative differences regarding the dependence on the dopant density. Based on these observations, previous assignments of collective radiative and non-radiative decay mechanisms are discussed in the context of the new experimental findings.},

The best nonrelativistic final values (in MHz) are 10.64 (B), 20.22 (C), 10.59 (N), −31.74 (O), and 318.30 (F) and are in very good agreement with available experimental values for these difficult-to-describe properties. Agreement is especially close in the case of N, which has the most accurate experimental value. The spin densities derived from the best composite level of theory were found to closely follow a simple quadratic scaling with the atomic number, Z. Observed convergence rates in the 1-particle and n-particle expansions obtained here may be useful in judging likely accuracy that can be expected in studies of molecular systems.},

The reference dataset for training the neural network consists of final state distributions determined from quasi-classical trajectory (QCT) simulations for ∼ 2000 initial conditions. Overall, the prediction accuracy as quantified by the root-mean-squared difference (∼0.003) and the R 2 (∼0.99) between the reference QCT and predictions of the STD model is high for the test set, for off-grid state-specific initial conditions, and for initial conditions drawn from reactant state distributions characterized by translational, rotational, and vibrational temperatures. Compared with a more coarse grained distribution-to-distribution (DTD) model evaluated on the same initial state distributions, the STD model shows comparable performance with the additional benefit of the state resolution in the reactant preparation. Starting from specific initial states also leads to a more diverse range of final state distributions, which requires a more expressive neural network compared with DTD. A direct comparison between QCT simulations, the STD model, and the widely used Larsen–Borgnakke (LB) model shows that the STD model is quantitative, whereas the LB model is qualitative at best for rotational distributions P ( j ′) and fails for vibrational distributions P ( v ′). As such, the STD model can be well-suited for simulating nonequilibrium high-speed flows, e.g., using the direct simulation Monte Carlo method.},

  abstract = {We show that the integral cross sections for state-to-state quantum scattering of cold molecules in a magnetic field can be efficiently computed using the total angular momentum representation despite the presence of unphysical Zeeman states in the eigenspectrum of the asymptotic Hamiltonian. We demonstrate that the unphysical states arise due to the incompleteness of the space-fixed total angular momentum basis caused by using a fixed cutoff value J max for the total angular momentum of the collision complex J . As a result, certain orbital angular momentum ( l ) basis states lack the full range of J values required by the angular momentum addition rules, resulting in the appearance of unphysical states. We find that by augmenting the basis with a full range of J -states for every l , it is possible to completely eliminate the unphysical states from quantum scattering calculations on molecular collisions in external magnetic fields. To illustrate the procedure, we use the augmented basis sets to calculate the state-to-state cross sections for rotational and spin relaxation in cold collisions of 40 CaH( X 2 Σ + , v = 0, N = 1, M N = 1, M S = 1/2) molecules with 4 He atoms in a magnetic field. We find excellent agreement with benchmark calculations, validating our proposed procedure. We find that N -conserving spin relaxation from the highest-energy to the lowest-energy Zeeman state of the N = 1 manifold, | 11 1 2 〉 → | 1 − 1 − 1 2 〉 is nearly completely suppressed due to the lack of spin–rotation coupling between the fully spin-stretched Zeeman states. Our results demonstrate the possibility of rigorous, computationally efficient, and unphysical state-free quantum calculations on cold molecular collisions and on near-threshold energy levels of strongly anisotropic atom-molecule collision complexes in an external magnetic field.},

For such a Coulomb system at a charged planar interface, the Coulomb interaction averaged over the lateral directions with preserved symmetry serves as a necessary constraint in building any accurate handling that reconciles a simulated singlet charge density with the corresponding macroscopic charge/dielectric response. At present, this symmetry-preserving mean field (SPMF) condition represented in the reciprocal space is conjectured to be necessary for a simulated bulk system to reproduce correctly the charge structure factor of the macroscopic bulk as well. In this work, we further examine analytically the asymptotic behavior of the charge structure factor at small wavenumbers for an arbitrary charge–charge interaction. In light of our theoretical predictions, simulations with lengths of nearly 0.1 μ m are carried out to demonstrate that typical efficient methods violating the SPMF condition, indeed, fail to capture the exact charge correlations at small wavenumbers for both ionic and polar systems. However, for both types of systems, these existing methods can be simply amended to match the SPMF condition and subsequently to precisely probe the electrostatic correlations at all length scales.},

While existing theoretical treatments are often based on a comparative analysis of “bare” vibrations and cavity polaritons, in the strong-coupling regime, only differences between slab/bulk polaritons on the one hand and cavity polaritons on the other hand are meaningful since “bare” vibrations are not observed experimentally. We find that polaritons in cavities significantly detuned from resonance with molecular transitions at zero in-plane wavevector do not differ appreciably from bulk polaritons in their density of vibrational states. Only cavity polaritons with sufficiently weak inhomogeneous broadening and tuned to resonance near normal incidence display a pronounced density-of-state enhancement. These results shed light on the heretofore puzzling observations of modified chemical reactivity only at zero detuning and supply a new baseline for assessing the explanatory power of proposed theories of cavity-modified chemistry.},

To conserve constraints known for the exact exchange–correlation functional, the derivatives of this interpolation vanish in the slowly varying limit. While theoretically convenient, this choice introduces numerical challenges that degrade the functional’s efficiency. We have recently reported a modification to the SCAN meta-GGA, termed restored-regularized-SCAN (r 2 SCAN) [Furness et al ., J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 11 , 8208 (2020)], that introduces two regularizations into SCAN, which improve its numerical performance at the expense of not recovering the fourth order term of the slowly varying density gradient expansion for exchange. Here, we show the derivation of a progression of density functional approximations [regularized SCAN (rSCAN), r++SCAN, r 2 SCAN, and r 4 SCAN] with increasing adherence to exact conditions while maintaining a smooth interpolation. The greater smoothness of r 2 SCAN seems to lead to better general accuracy than the additional exact constraint of SCAN or r 4 SCAN does.},

  abstract = {High-accuracy electronic structure calculations on the members of the helium isoelectronic series and the H 2 molecule with a stretched bond reveal that the ground-state wavefunctions of these Coulombic systems give rise to natural orbitals (NO) with unusual properties. These solitonic NOs (SoNOs) possess fewer nodes than expected from their small occupation numbers, exhibit substantial spatial localization, and respond (with approximate retention of their shapes) in a paradoxical manner (e.g., by moving away from nuclei upon an increase in the nuclear charge or decrease in the internuclear distance) to changes in the underlying Hamiltonian. An efficient tool for the identification of the SoNOs is provided by an index constructed from two expectation values pertaining to a given NO and the corresponding occupation number. In the case of the helium-like species, the rapid decay of the occupation numbers of the SoNOs with increasing nuclear charge Z is governed by an asymptotic expression that involves the radial positions and spreads of the orbitals. Three s -type SoNOs (with the occupation numbers amounting to only ∼7.9·10 −67 , 6.8·10 −92 , and 9.0·10 −113 in the case of the helium atom) are predicted to turn into unoccupied NOs at Z equal to ∼2.673, 2.587, and 2.536, respectively. The persistence of the analogous p -type orbital beyond Z = 2 is consistent with the computed properties of the σ u -type SoNO of the H 2 molecule with a stretched bond. In particular, the profiles of this SoNO along two perpendicular lines bear great resemblance to the radial profiles of its p -type counterpart.},

In particular, the MTS algorithm has been modified to enable the simulation of non-adiabatic processes with the trajectory surface hopping (TSH) method and Tully’s fewest switches algorithm. The specificities of the implementation lie in the combination of Landau–Zener and Tully’s transition probabilities during the inner MTS time steps. The new MTS-TSH method is applied successfully to the photorelaxation of protonated formaldimine, showing that the important characteristics of the process are recovered by the MTS algorithm. A computational speed-up between 1.5 and 3 has been obtained compared to standard TSH simulations, which is close to the ideal values that could be obtained with the computational settings considered.},

  abstract = {Coarse-grained (CG) models provide superior computational efficiency for simulating soft materials. Unfortunately, CG models with conventional pair-additive potentials demonstrate limited transferability between bulk and interfacial environments. Recently, a growing number of CG models have supplemented these pair potentials with one-body potentials of the local density (LD) around each site. These LD potentials can significantly improve the accuracy and transferability of CG models. Nevertheless, it remains challenging to accurately describe interfaces where the LD varies rapidly. In this work, we consider a new class of one-body potentials that depend upon the square of the LD gradient around each site. We investigate the impact of this square gradient (SG) potential upon both top-down dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) models and also bottom-up multiscale coarse-graining (MS-CG) models. We demonstrate that SG potentials can be used to tune the interfacial properties of DPD models without significantly altering their bulk properties. Moreover, we demonstrate that SG potentials can improve the bulk pressure–density equation of state as well as the interfacial profile of MS-CG models for acetic acid. Consequently, SG potentials may provide a useful connection between particle-based top-down models and mean-field Landau theories for phase behavior. Furthermore, SG potentials may prove useful for improving the accuracy and transferability of bottom-up CG models for interfaces and other inhomogeneous systems with significant density gradients.},

That excited-state inversion is known to be very challenging to reproduce for time-dependent density functional theory employing common functionals, e.g., hybrid or range-separated expressions, but not for wavefunction methods due to the inclusion of higher-than-single excitations. Therefore, we explore here if the last developed family of density functional expressions (i.e., double-hybrid models) is able to provide not only the right excited-state energy order but also accurate Δ E ST values, thanks to the approximate inclusion of double excitations within these models. We herein employ standard double-hybrid (B2-PLYP, PBE-QIDH, and PBE0-2), range-separated ( ω B2-PLYP and RSX-QIDH), spin-scaled (SCS/SOS-B2PLYP21, SCS-PBE-QIDH, and SOS-PBE-QIDH), and range-separated spin-scaled (SCS/SOS- ω B2-PLYP, SCS-RSX-QIDH, and SOS-RSX-QIDH) expressions to systematically assess the influence of the ingredients entering into the formulation while concomitantly providing insights for their accuracy.},

  abstract = {Using a combination of high-level ab initio electronic structure methods with efficient on-the-fly semiclassical evaluation of nuclear dynamics, we performed a massive scan of small polyatomic molecules searching for a long-lasting oscillatory dynamics of the electron density triggered by the outer-valence ionization. We observed that in most of the studied molecules, either the sudden removal of an electron from the system does not lead to the appearance of the electronic coherence or the created coherences become damped by the nuclear rearrangement on a time scale of a few femtoseconds. However, we report several so far unexplored molecules with the electronic coherences lasting up to 10 fs, which can be good candidates for experimental studies. In addition, we present the full-dimensional simulations of the electronic coherences coupled to nuclear motion in several molecules which were studied previously only in the fixed nuclei approximation.},

  abstract = {The behavior of a particle in a solvent has been framed using stochastic dynamics since the early theory of Kramers. A particle in a chemical reaction reacts slower in a diluted solvent because of the lack of energy transfer via collisions. The flux-over-population reaction rate constant rises with increasing density before falling again for very dense solvents. This Kramers turnover is observed in this paper at intermediate and high temperatures in the backward reaction of the LiNC ⇌ LiCN isomerization via Langevin dynamics and mean first-passage times (MFPTs). It is in good agreement with the Pollak–Grabert–Hänggi (PGH) reaction rates at lower temperatures. Furthermore, we find a square root behavior of the reaction rate at high temperatures and have made direct comparisons of the methods in the intermediate- and high-temperature regimes, all suggesting increased ranges in accuracy of both the PGH and MFPT approaches.},

  abstract = {In an effort to illuminate the general principles governing the critical behavior of model fluids, we investigate in this study how the shape and the (attractive) interaction range of the molecule affect the gas–liquid equilibrium and the critical behavior of the system. A combination of Monte Carlo simulations and analytical theory is employed to compute critical properties, i.e., temperature and density, of a system of hard-core ellipses with an attractive square-well potential in two-dimensional space. The critical temperature is found to decrease monotonically as the asphericity of the molecule is increased. This trend can be successfully explained in terms of the strength of the effective attraction acting between molecules measured, for instance, by the second virial coefficient. The critical density shows a complex dependence on both the range of attraction and the asphericity of the molecule. We find that the properties of particle clusters formed in near-critical states reproduce some of the most important features of the critical density, including multiple minima and maxima. It is shown that a model based on the extent of the overlap between attractive shells surrounding the ellipses captures the variation of the size of the clusters. Based on the obtained results, we discuss implications of varying the shape of the attraction potential for critical density.},

  abstract = {Ab initio quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods are a state-of-the-art computational approach to obtaining highly accurate many-body wave functions. Although QMC methods are widely used in physics and chemistry to compute ground-state energies, calculation of atomic forces is still under technical/algorithmic development. Very recently, force evaluation has started to become of paramount importance for the generation of machine-learning force-field potentials. Nevertheless, there is no consensus regarding whether an efficient algorithm is available for the QMC force evaluation, namely, one that scales well with the number of electrons and the atomic numbers. In this study, we benchmark the accuracy of all-electron variational Monte Carlo (VMC) and lattice-regularized diffusion Monte Carlo (LRDMC) forces for various mono- and heteronuclear dimers (1 ≤ Z ≤ 35, where Z is the atomic number). The VMC and LRDMC forces were calculated with and without the so-called space-warp coordinate transformation (SWCT) and appropriate regularization techniques to remove the infinite variance problem. The LRDMC forces were computed with the Reynolds (RE) and variational-drift (VD) approximations. The potential energy surfaces obtained from the LRDMC energies give equilibrium bond lengths ( r eq ) and harmonic frequencies ( ω ) very close to the experimental values for all dimers, improving the corresponding VMC results. The LRDMC forces with the RE approximation improve the VMC forces, implying that it is worth computing the DMC forces beyond VMC despite the higher computational cost. The LRDMC forces with the VD approximations also show improvement, which unfortunately comes at a much higher computational cost in all-electron calculations. We find that the ratio of computational costs between QMC energy and forces scales as Z ∼2.5 without the SWCT. In contrast, the application of the SWCT makes the ratio independent of Z . As such, the accessible QMC system size is not affected by the evaluation of ionic forces but governed by the same scaling as the total energy one.},

Accompanying experiments with dynamic light scattering and Circular Dichroism (CD) spectroscopy have been performed to obtain, respectively, the global diffusion constant and the secondary structure content of the molecule for both buffers as a function of temperature. Modeling the decay of the neutron intermediate scattering function by the Mittag-Leffler relaxation function, ϕ ( t ) = E α (−( t / τ ) α ) (0 &lt; α &lt; 1), we find that trifluoroethanol slows down the relaxation dynamics of the protein at 283 K and leads to a broader relaxation rate spectrum. This effect vanishes with increasing temperature, and at 323 K, its relaxation dynamics is identical in both solvents. These results are coherent with the data from dynamic light scattering, which show that the hydrodynamic radius of MBP in TFE-enriched solutions does not depend on temperature and is only slightly smaller compared to the pure D 2 O buffer, except for 283 K, where it is much reduced. In accordance with these observations, the CD spectra reveal that TFE induces essentially a partial transition from β -strands to α -helices, but only a weak increase in the total secondary structure content, leaving about 50\% of the protein unfolded. The results show that MBP is for all temperatures and in both buffers an intrinsically disordered protein and that TFE essentially induces a reduction in its hydrodynamic radius and its relaxation dynamics at low temperatures.},

  abstract = {The avian compass and many other of nature’s magnetoreceptive traits are widely ascribed to the protein cryptochrome. There, magnetosensitivity is thought to emerge as the spin dynamics of radicals in the applied magnetic field enters in competition with their recombination. The first and dominant model makes use of a radical pair. However, recent studies have suggested that magnetosensitivity could be markedly enhanced for a radical triad, the primary radical pair of which undergoes a spin-selective recombination reaction with a third radical. Here, we test the practicality of this supposition for the reoxidation reaction of the reduced FAD cofactor in cryptochrome, which has been implicated with light-independent magnetoreception but appears irreconcilable with the classical radical pair mechanism (RPM). Based on the available realistic cryptochrome structures, we predict the magnetosensitivity of radical triad systems comprising the flavin semiquinone, the superoxide, and a tyrosine or ascorbyl scavenger radical. We consider many hyperfine-coupled nuclear spins, the relative orientation and placement of the radicals, their coupling by the electron–electron dipolar interaction, and spin relaxation in the superoxide radical in the limit of instantaneous decoherence, which have not been comprehensively considered before. We demonstrate that these systems can provide superior magnetosensitivity under realistic conditions, with implications for dark-state cryptochrome magnetoreception and other biological magneto- and isotope-sensitive radical recombination reactions.},

The dynamics in MD+MPCD suggest that the colloidal particles are only partially coupled to the solvent at short times. However, the long-time self-diffusion coefficient in MD+MPCD is comparable to that in experiments, and the sedimentation coefficient in MD+MPCD is in good agreement with that in experiments and BD+RPY, suggesting that MD+MPCD gives a reasonable description of hydrodynamic interactions in colloidal suspensions. The discrete-particle MD+MPCD approach is convenient and readily extended to more complex shapes, and we determine the long-time self-diffusion coefficient in suspensions of nearly hard cubes to demonstrate its generality.},

  abstract = {The development of coarse-grained (CG) molecular models typically requires a time-consuming iterative tuning of parameters in order to have the approximated CG models behave correctly and consistently with, e.g., available higher-resolution simulation data and/or experimental observables. Automatic data-driven approaches are increasingly used to develop accurate models for molecular dynamics simulations. However, the parameters obtained via such automatic methods often make use of specifically designed interaction potentials and are typically poorly transferable to molecular systems or conditions other than those used for training them. Using a multi-objective approach in combination with an automatic optimization engine ( SwarmCG ), here, we show that it is possible to optimize CG models that are also transferable, obtaining optimized CG force fields (FFs). As a proof of concept, here, we use lipids for which we can avail reference experimental data (area per lipid and bilayer thickness) and reliable atomistic simulations to guide the optimization. Once the resolution of the CG models (mapping) is set as an input, SwarmCG optimizes the parameters of the CG lipid models iteratively and simultaneously against higher-resolution simulations ( bottom-up ) and experimental data ( top-down references). Including different types of lipid bilayers in the training set in a parallel optimization guarantees the transferability of the optimized lipid FF parameters. We demonstrate that SwarmCG can reach satisfactory agreement with experimental data for different resolution CG FFs. We also obtain stimulating insights into the precision-resolution balance of the FFs. The approach is general and can be effectively used to develop new FFs and to improve the existing ones.},

H 2 desorbs at a higher temperature in the presence of oxygen (&gt;300 K) than the absence of oxygen (&gt;250 K) as the oxygen on the surface stabilizes the H atoms, forming surface hydroxide (OH). The surface oxygen also appears to stabilize the O–H and C–H bonds, leading to slightly higher dissociation temperatures. The CO molecules occupy both the bridge sites and the top sites of the Ni atoms as surface H appears to force the CO molecules to the top sites. There is a slight blueshift in the C–O bond vibration for both the O covered and O free surfaces due to CO being more mobile. On the O free surface, the C–O peak width broadens as low-frequency modes are activated. Finally, CO desorbs between 350 and 400 K.},

Although it was shown that the injection rate decreases as the particle size increases, this observation can be explained by the facts that (1) the platelet has a much larger surface to bulk ratio and (2) the platelet affords a much larger surface area for direct contact with the semiconductor. These two factors facilitate strong Ag–TiO 2 coupling (as indicated by the observed broadened surface plasmon resonance band of Ag) and can explain why Ag nanoplatelets have been found to be more efficient than much smaller Ag nanoparticles as photosensitizers for photocatalytic functions. The fast injection rate, together with a stronger optical absorption in comparison with Au and dye molecules, make Ag nanoplatelets a preferred photosensitizer for wide bandgap semiconductors.},

  abstract = {The diffusion length of quantum dot (QD) films is a critical parameter to improve the performance of QD-based optoelectronic devices. The dot-to-dot hopping transport mechanism results in shorter diffusion lengths compared to bulk solids. Herein, we present an experimental method to measure the diffusion length in PbS QD films using single layer graphene as a charge collector to monitor the density of photogenerated carriers. By producing devices with different thicknesses, we can construct light absorption and photocarrier density profiles, allowing extracting light penetration depths and carrier diffusion lengths for electrons and holes. We realized devices with small (size: ∼2.5 nm) and large (size: ∼4.8 nm) QDs, and use λ = 532 nm and λ = 635 nm wavelength illumination. For small QDs, we obtain diffusion lengths of 180 nm for holes and 500 nm for electrons. For large QDs, we obtain diffusion lengths of 120 nm for holes and 150 nm for electrons. Our results show that films made of small QD films have longer diffusion lengths for holes and electrons. We also observe that wavelength illumination may have a small effect, with electrons showing a diffusion length of 500 and 420 nm under λ = 532 nm and λ = 635 nm illumination, respectively, which may be due to increased interactions between photocarriers for longer wavelengths with deeper penetration depths. Our results demonstrate an effective technique to calculate diffusion lengths of photogenerated electrons and holes and indicate that not only QD size but also wavelength illumination can play important roles in the diffusion and electrical transport of photocarriers in QD films.},

Here, we develop a dual-loop active learning framework that combines a fast reduced-accuracy method (a convolutional neural network) with a slow higher-accuracy method (molecular dynamics simulations with enhanced sampling) to efficiently predict the hydration free energy, a thermodynamic descriptor of hydrophobicity, for nearly 200 000 chemically heterogeneous self-assembled monolayers (SAMs). Analysis of this dataset reveals that SAMs with distinct polar groups exhibit substantial variations in hydrophobicity as a function of their composition and patterning, but the clustering of nonpolar groups is a common signature of highly hydrophobic patterns. Further molecular dynamics analysis relates such clustering to the perturbation of interfacial water structure. These results provide new insight into the influence of chemical heterogeneity on hydrophobicity via quantitative analysis of a large set of surfaces, enabled by the active learning approach.},

  abstract = {Chemical thermodynamic models of solvent and solute activities predict the equilibrium behavior of aqueous solutions. However, these models are semi-empirical. They represent micro-scale ion and solvent behaviors controlling the macroscopic properties using small numbers of parameters whose values are obtained by fitting to activities and other partial derivatives of the Gibbs energy measured for the bulk solutions. We have conducted atomistic simulations of aqueous electrolyte solutions (MgCl 2 and CaCl 2 ) to determine the parameters of thermodynamic hydration models. We have implemented a cooperative hydration model to categorize the water molecules in electrolyte solutions into different subpopulations. The value of the electrolyte-specific parameter, k , was determined from the ion-affected subpopulation with the lowest absolute value of the free energy of removing the water molecule. The other equilibrium constant parameter, K 1 , associated with the first degree of hydration, was computed from the free energy of hydration of hydrated clusters. The hydration number, h , was determined from a reorientation dynamic analysis of the water subpopulations compared to bulk-like behavior. The reparameterized models [R. H. Stokes and R. H. Robinson, J. Solution Chem. 2 , 173 (1973) and Balomenos et al. , Fluid Phase Equilib. 243 , 29 (2006)] using the computed values of the parameters lead to the osmotic coefficients of MgCl 2 solutions that are consistent with measurements. Such an approach removes the dependence on the availability of experimental data and could lead to aqueous thermodynamic models capable of estimating the values of solute and solvent activities as well as thermal and volumetric properties for a wide range of compositions and concentrations.},

In this study, two types of PPs are considered: Octahedral PPs (Oh-PPs) and Square PPs (Sq-PPs), with octahedral and square arrangements of patches, respectively. The self-assembly is additionally facilitated by the simulated annealing procedure. The resultant structures are characterized by a combination of local correlations in cubatic ordering and a symmetry-specific variation of bond orientation order parameters (SymBOPs). By varying the PP/IP size ratio, we detected a sharp crossover between two distinct morphologies in both types of systems. High symmetry phases, NaCl crystal for Oh-PP and square lattice for Sq-PP, are observed for larger size ratios. For the smaller ones, the dominant morphologies are significantly different, e.g., Oh-PPs form a compact amorphous structure with predominantly face-to-face orientation of neighboring PPs. Unusually, for a morphology without a long-range order, it is still possible to identify well organized coherent clusters of this structure, thanks to the adoption of our SymBOP-based characterization.},

  abstract = {Benzvalyne (C 6 H 4 ) is a bicyclic structural isomer of o -benzyne that some typically trusted levels of theory do not report as a minimum on the potential energy surface (PES). The structure was found to be a C 2 v minimum at the MCSCF, MP2, coupled-cluster single double, coupled-cluster single double triple (CCSDT)-1b, and CCSDT-2 levels of theory. Density functionals at the B3LYP-D3, B2PLYP-D3, and M06-D3 levels also produced a minimum structure. On the other hand, the CCSD(T), CCSD(T)-F12, and CCSDT-1a methods produced a single imaginary frequency for benzvalyne. However, the increase in the correlation for the CCSDT-1b and CCSDT-2 methods implies that benzvalyne is, in fact, a true, if highly strained, minimum on the PES. The C–C≡C bond angle was found to be only 108°; this angle is 180° for an unstrained C–C≡C triple bond moiety. As a result, the strain energy is notably high at 159 kcal mol −1 . Comparing the strain energy of the rest of the molecule gives a strain energy of 92 kcal mol −1 for this triple bond region alone. The computed harmonic frequencies contain normal modes consisting of two hindered rotations of the C≡C diatomic part of the molecule, suggesting that the dissociation of this diatomic from the bicylobutane moiety may be important in the chemistry of this molecule. Because the putative C 2 v minimum is predicted to have a significant dipole moment (2.6 D), benzvalyne may be detectable in TMC-1, where the related o -benzyne molecule has recently been observed by radio astronomy.},

  abstract = {Iron pentacarbonyl is a textbook example of fluxionality. We trap the molecule in cryogenic matrices to study the vibrational dynamics of CO stretching modes involved in the fluxional rearrangement. The infrared spectrum in Ar and N 2 is composed of about ten narrow bands in the spectral range of interest, indicating the population of various lattice sites and a lowering of the molecular symmetry in the trapping sites. The vibrational dynamics is explored by means of infrared stimulated photon echoes at the femtosecond scale. Vibrational dephasing and population relaxation times are obtained. The non-linear signals exhibit strong oscillations useful to disentangle the site composition of the absorption spectrum. The population relaxation involves at least two characteristic times. An evolution of the photon echo signals with the waiting time is observed. The behavior of all the signals can be reproduced within a simple model that describes the population relaxation occurring in two steps: relaxation of v = 1 (population time T 1 1 ns). These two steps explain the evolution of the oscillations with the waiting time in the photon echo signals. These results discard fluxional rearrangement on the time scale of hundreds of ps in our samples. Dephasing times are of the same order of magnitude as T 1 : dephasing processes due to the matrix environment are rather inefficient. The photon echo experiments also reveal that intermolecular resonant vibrational energy transfers between guest molecules occur at the hundreds of ps time scale in concentrated samples (guest/host &gt; 10 4 ).},

Recent works have demonstrated that when an optical system contains nanoscale polar elements, these excitations can acquire a longitudinal field component as a result of the material dispersion of the lattice, leading to the formation of secondary quasiparticles termed longitudinal-transverse polaritons. In this work, we build on previous macroscopic electromagnetic theories, developing a full second-quantized theory of longitudinal-transverse polaritons. Beginning from the Hamiltonian of the light–matter system, we treat distortion to the lattice, introducing an elastic free energy. We then diagonalize the Hamiltonian, demonstrating that the equations of motion for the polariton are equivalent to those of macroscopic electromagnetism and quantize the nonlocal operators. Finally, we demonstrate how to reconstruct the electromagnetic fields in terms of the polariton states and explore polariton induced enhancements of the Purcell factor. These results demonstrate how nonlocality can narrow, enhance, and spectrally tune near-field emission with applications in mid-infrared sensing.},

Using the data-aided learning paradigm, we propose a simple prescription to accurately model the kinetic energy density of any system. Our method relies on a dictionary of functional forms for local and nonlocal contributions, which have been proposed in the literature, and the appropriate coefficients are calculated via a linear regression framework. To model the nonlocal contributions, we explore two new nonlocal functionals—a functional that captures fluctuations in electronic density and a functional that incorporates gradient information. Since the analytical functional forms of the kernels present in these nonlocal terms are not known from theory, we propose a basis function expansion to model these seemingly difficult nonlocal quantities. This allows us to easily reconstruct kernels for any system using only a few structures. The proposed method is able to learn kinetic energy densities and total kinetic energies of molecular and periodic systems, such as H 2 , LiH, LiF, and a one-dimensional chain of eight hydrogens using data from Kohn–Sham density functional theory calculations for only a few structures.},

The coupled excitons and phonons are modeled by Fröhlich–Holstein type Hamiltonians with on-site and nearest-neighbor interactions only. We reduce the memory consumption as well as the computational costs significantly by employing efficient decompositions to construct low-rank tensor-train representations, thus mitigating the curse of dimensionality. In order to compute also higher quantum states, we introduce an approach that directly incorporates the Wielandt deflation technique into the alternating linear scheme for the solution of eigenproblems. Besides systems with coupled excitons and phonons, we also investigate uncoupled problems for which (semi-)analytical results exist. There, we find that in the case of homogeneous systems, the tensor-train ranks of state vectors only marginally depend on the chain length, which results in a linear growth of the storage consumption. However, the central processing unit time increases slightly faster with the chain length than the storage consumption because the alternating linear scheme adopted in our work requires more iterations to achieve convergence for longer chains and a given rank. Finally, we demonstrate that the tensor-train approach to the quantum treatment of coupled excitons and phonons makes it possible to directly tackle the phenomenon of mutual self-trapping. We are able to confirm the main results of the Davydov theory, i.e., the dependence of the wave packet width and the corresponding stabilization energy on the exciton–phonon coupling strength, although only for a certain range of that parameter. In future work, our approach will allow calculations also beyond the validity regime of that theory and/or beyond the restrictions of the Fröhlich–Holstein type Hamiltonians.},

Such a method should also be ideally suited to describing the quantum coherences generated by interaction with light. We demonstrate that this is, indeed, the case by calculating the nonlinear optical response functions relevant for the pump–probe and 2D photon-echo spectra for a Frenkel biexciton model and the Fenna–Matthews–Olsen light-harvesting complex. One especially desirable feature of our approach is that the full spectrum can be decomposed into its constituent components associated with the various Liouville-space pathways, offering a greater insight beyond what can be directly obtained from experiments.},

  abstract = {Electronic structure calculations based on Kohn–Sham density functional theory (KSDFT) that incorporate exact-exchange or hybrid functionals are associated with a large computational expense, a consequence of the inherent cubic scaling bottleneck and large associated prefactor, which limits the length and time scales that can be accessed. Although orbital-free density functional theory (OFDFT) calculations scale linearly with system size and are associated with a significantly smaller prefactor, they are limited by the absence of accurate density-dependent kinetic energy functionals. Therefore, the development of accurate density-dependent kinetic energy functionals is important for OFDFT calculations of large realistic systems. To this end, we propose a method to train kinetic energy functional models at the exact-exchange level of theory by using a dictionary of physically relevant terms that have been proposed in the literature in conjunction with linear or nonlinear regression methods to obtain the fitting coefficients. For our dictionary, we use a gradient expansion of the kinetic energy nonlocal models proposed in the literature and their nonlinear combinations, such as a model that incorporates spatial correlations between higher order derivatives of electron density at two points. The predictive capabilities of these models are assessed by using a variety of model one-dimensional (1D) systems that exhibit diverse bonding characteristics, such as a chain of eight hydrogens, LiF, LiH, C 4 H 2 , C 4 N 2 , and C 3 O 2 . We show that by using the data from model 1D KSDFT calculations performed using the exact-exchange functional for only a few neutral structures, it is possible to generate models with high accuracy for charged systems and electron and kinetic energy densities during self-consistent field iterations. In addition, we show that it is possible to learn both the orbital dependent terms, i.e., the kinetic energy and the exact-exchange energy, and models that incorporate additional nonlinearities in spatial correlations, such as a quadratic model, are needed to capture subtle features of the kinetic energy density that are present in exact-exchange-based KSDFT calculations.},

In this paper, we explore how the issues of MP2 for metallic, polarizable, and strongly correlated periodic systems can be ameliorated through regularization. To this end, two regularized second-order methods (including a new, size-extensive Brillouin–Wigner approach) are applied to the HEG, the one-dimensional Hubbard model, and the graphene–water interaction. We find that regularization consistently leads to improvements over the MP2 baseline and that different regularizers are appropriate for the various systems.},

The resulting method is directly compatible with band structure calculations and allows for the efficient description of band-like phenomena by means of a truncation of the Brillouin zone. Using the Holstein and Peierls models as examples, we demonstrate the formal equivalence between real-space and reciprocal-space surface hopping and assess their accuracy against mean-field mixed quantum–classical dynamics and numerically exact results.

In this paper, we use a coarse-grained mixed quantum–classical method, which combines Ehrenfest and Redfield theories, to shed light on the charge generation process in small energy offset interfaces. We have investigated the influence of the energetic driving force as well as the vibronic effects on the charge generation and photovoltaic energy conversion. By analyzing the effects of the Holstein and Peierls vibrational couplings, we find that vibrational couplings produce an overall effect of improving the charge generation. However, the two vibronic mechanisms play different roles: the Holstein relaxation mechanism decreases the charge generation, whereas the Peierls mechanism always assists the charge generation. Moreover, by examining the electron–hole binding energy as a function of time, we evince two distinct regimes for the charge separation: the temperature independent excitonic spread on a sub-100 fs timescale and the complete dissociation of the charge-transfer state that occurs on the timescale of tens to hundreds of picoseconds, depending on the temperature. The quantum dynamics of the system exhibits the three regimes of the Marcus electron transfer kinetics as the energy offset of the interface is varied.},

  abstract = {By employing the time-dependent variational principle and the versatile multi-D 2 Davydov trial states, in combination with the Green’s function method, we study the dynamics of the Tavis–Cummings model and the Holstein–Tavis–Cummings model in the presence of diagonal disorder and cavity–qubit coupling disorder. For the Tavis–Cummings model, time evolution of the photon population, the optical absorption spectra, and the hetero-entanglement between the qubits and the cavity mode are calculated by using the Green’s function method to corroborate numerically exact results of Davydov’s Ansätze . For the Holstein–Tavis–Cummings model, only the latter is utilized to simulate effects of disorder on the photon population dynamics and the absorption spectra. We have demonstrated that the complementary employment of analytical and numerical methods permits uncovering a fairly comprehensive picture of a variety of complex behaviors in disordered multidimensional polaritonic cavity quantum electrodynamics systems.},

  abstract = {Tensor network decompositions of path integrals for simulating open quantum systems have recently been proven to be useful. However, these methods scale exponentially with the system size. This makes it challenging to simulate the non-equilibrium dynamics of extended quantum systems coupled with local dissipative environments. In this work, we extend the tensor network path integral (TNPI) framework to efficiently simulate such extended systems. The Feynman–Vernon influence functional is a popular approach used to account for the effect of environments on the dynamics of the system. In order to facilitate the incorporation of the influence functional into a multisite framework (MS-TNPI), we combine a matrix product state (MPS) decomposition of the reduced density tensor of the system along the sites with a corresponding tensor network representation of the time axis to construct an efficient 2D tensor network. The 2D MS-TNPI network, when contracted, yields the time-dependent reduced density tensor of the extended system as an MPS. The algorithm presented is independent of the system Hamiltonian. We outline an iteration scheme to take the simulation beyond the non-Markovian memory introduced by solvents. Applications to spin chains coupled to local harmonic baths are presented; we consider the Ising, XXZ, and Heisenberg models, demonstrating that the presence of local environments can often dissipate the entanglement between the sites. We discuss three factors causing the system to transition from a coherent oscillatory dynamics to a fully incoherent dynamics. The MS-TNPI method is useful for studying a variety of extended quantum systems coupled with solvents.},

  abstract = {One of the most intriguing phenomena in active matter has been the gas–liquid-like motility-induced phase separation (MIPS) observed in repulsive active particles. However, experimentally, no particle can be a perfect sphere, and the asymmetric shape, mass distribution, or catalysis coating can induce an active torque on the particle, which makes it a chiral active particle. Here, using computer simulations and dynamic mean-field theory, we demonstrate that the large enough torque of circle active Brownian particles in two dimensions generates a dynamical clustering state interrupting the conventional MIPS. Multiple clusters arise from the combination of the conventional MIPS cohesion, and the circulating current caused disintegration. The nonvanishing current in non-equilibrium steady states microscopically originates from the motility “relieved” by automatic rotation, which breaks the detailed balance at the continuum level. This suggests that no equilibrium-like phase separation theory can be constructed for chiral active colloids even with tiny active torque, in which no visible collective motion exists. This mechanism also sheds light on the understanding of dynamic clusters observed in a variety of active matter systems.},

Such simulations have recently been used to study several polyampholyte systems. Here, we formulate a field theory corresponding to the hydrophobic/polar (HP) lattice protein model, with finite same-site repulsion and nearest-neighbor attraction between HH bead pairs. By direct comparison with particle-based Monte Carlo simulations, we show that complex Langevin sampling of the field theory reproduces the thermodynamic properties of the HP model only if the same-site repulsion is not too strong. Unfortunately, the repulsion has to be taken weaker than what is needed to prevent condensed droplets from assuming an artificially compact shape. Analysis of a minimal and analytically solvable toy model hints that the sampling problems caused by repulsive interaction may stem from loss of ergodicity.},

It is well accepted that CNCs are made of bundles of crystalline microfibrils clustered side-by-side, and there is growing evidence that each individual microfibril is twisted. Yet, the origin of the chiral interactions between CNCs remains unclear. In this work, CNCs are described with a simple model of chiral hard splinters, enabling the prediction of the pitch using density functional theory and Monte Carlo simulations. The predicted pitch P compares well with experimental observations in cotton-based CNC dispersions in apolar solvents using surfactants but also with qualitative trends caused by fractionation or tip sonication in aqueous suspensions. These results suggest that the bundle shape induces an entropy-driven chiral interaction between CNCs, which is the missing link in explaining how chirality is transferred from the molecular scale of cellulose chains to the cholesteric order.},

  abstract = {Bottlebrush polymers are a class of highly branched macromolecules that show promise for applications such as self-assembled photonic materials and tunable elastomers. However, computational studies of bottlebrush polymer solutions and melts remain challenging due to the high computational cost involved in explicitly accounting for the presence of side chains. Here, we consider a coarse-grained molecular model of bottlebrush polymers where the side chains are modeled implicitly, with the aim of expediting simulations by accessing longer length and time scales. The key ingredients of this model are the size of a coarse-grained segment and a suitably coarse-grained interaction potential between the non-bonded segments. Prior studies have not focused on developing explicit forms of such potentials, instead, relying on scaling arguments to model non-bonded interactions. Here, we show how to systematically calculate an interaction potential between the coarse-grained segments of bottlebrush from finer grained explicit side chain models using Monte Carlo and Brownian dynamics and then incorporate it into an implicit side chain model. We compare the predictions from our coarse-grained implicit side chain model with those obtained from models with explicit side chains in terms of the potential of mean force, the osmotic second virial coefficient, and the interpenetration function, highlighting the range of applicability and limitations of the coarse-grained representation. Although presented in the context of homopolymer bottlebrushes in athermal solvents, our proposed method can be extended to other solvent conditions as well as to different monomer chemistries. We expect that our implicit side chain model will prove useful for accelerating large-scale simulations of bottlebrush solutions and assembly.},

Under such detention, particles experience an effective entropic potential which has a logarithmic form. We employ a feedback control protocol as an outcome of error-free position measurement. The protocol comprises three stages: measurement, feedback, and relaxation. We reposition the center of the confinement to the measurement distance ( x p ) instantaneously when the position of the trapped particle crosses x p for the first time. Then, the particle is allowed for thermal relaxation. We calculate the extractable work, total information, and unavailable information associated with the feedback control using this equilibrium probability distribution function. We find the exact analytical value of the upper bound of extractable work as ( 5 3 − 2 l n 2 ) k B T ⁠ . We introduce a constant force G downward to the transverse coordinate ( y ). A change in G alters the effective potential of the system and tunes the relative dominance of entropic and energetic contributions in it. The upper bound of the achievable work shows a crossover from ( 5 3 − 2 l n 2 ) k B T to 1 2 k B T when the system changes from an entropy-dominated regime to an energy-dominated one. Compared to an energetic analog, the loss of information during the relaxation process is higher in the entropy-dominated region, which accredits the less value in achievable work.

The sampling performance was analyzed with different system sizes and compared with that of the temperature replica-exchange method (tREM). It was observed that gREM is capable of sampling configurations at sufficient replica-exchange acceptance ratios even around the NI transition temperature. A bimodal distribution of the order parameter at the transition region was found, which is in agreement with the mean-field theory.

Yet, there are few implicit solvent models applicable to periodic solutes, and crystallographic structures are commonly solved assuming a flat solvent model. Here, we present a newly developed periodic version of the 3D-reference interaction site model (RISM) integral equation method that is able to solve efficiently and describe accurately water and ion distributions in periodic systems; the code can compute accurate gradients that can be used in minimizations or molecular dynamics simulations. The new method includes an extension of the Ornstein–Zernike equation needed to yield charge neutrality for charged solutes, which requires an additional contribution to the excess chemical potential that has not been previously identified; this is an important consideration for nucleic acids or any other charged system where most or all the counter- and co-ions are part of the “disordered” solvent. We present several calculations of proteins, RNAs, and small molecule crystals to show that x-ray scattering intensities and the solvent structure predicted by the periodic 3D-RISM solvent model are in closer agreement with the experiment than are intensities computed using the default flat solvent model in the refmac5 or phenix refinement programs, with the greatest improvement in the 2 to 4 Å range.

However, because ML materials are difficult to probe experimentally, much remains unresolved about ML CrI 3 ’s structural, electronic, and magnetic properties. Here, we leverage Density Functional Theory (DFT) and high-accuracy Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) simulations to predict lattice parameters, magnetic moments, and spin–phonon and spin–lattice coupling of ML CrI 3 . We exploit a recently developed surrogate Hessian DMC line search technique to determine CrI 3 ’s ML geometry with DMC accuracy, yielding lattice parameters in good agreement with recently published STM measurements—an accomplishment given the ∼10\% variability in previous DFT-derived estimates depending upon the functional. Strikingly, we find that previous DFT predictions of ML CrI 3 ’s magnetic spin moments are correct on average across a unit cell but miss critical local spatial fluctuations in the spin density revealed by more accurate DMC. DMC predicts that magnetic moments in ML CrI 3 are 3.62 μ B per chromium and −0.145 μ B per iodine, both larger than previous DFT predictions. The large disparate moments together with the large spin–orbit coupling of CrI 3 ’s I- p orbital suggest a ligand superexchange-dominated magnetic anisotropy in ML CrI 3 , corroborating recent observations of magnons in its 2D limit. We also find that ML CrI 3 exhibits a substantial spin–phonon coupling of ∼3.32 cm −1 . Our work, thus, establishes many of ML CrI 3 ’s key properties, while also continuing to demonstrate the pivotal role that DMC can assume in the study of magnetic and other 2D materials.},

  abstract = {The mechanism of charge transfer between metal ions and graphene in the presence of an ionic liquid (1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate) is investigated by means of density functional theory calculations. For that purpose, two different comparisons are established: (i) the behavior of Li + and K + when adsorbed onto the basal plane of graphene and (ii) the differences between Li + approaching the carbon surface from the basal plane and being intercalated through the edge plane of trilayer graphene. In the first case, it is found that the metal ions must overcome high energy barriers due to their interaction with the ionic liquid before reaching an equilibrium position close to the interface. In addition, no significant charge transfer between any of the metals and graphene takes place until very close energetically unfavorable distances. The second configuration shows that Li + has no equilibrium position in the proximity of the interface but instead has an equilibrium position when it is inside the electrode for which it has to cross an energy barrier. In this case, the formation of a LiC 12 complex is observed since the charge transfer at the equilibrium distance is achieved to a considerable extent. Thus, the interfacial charge transfer resistance on the electrode in energy devices based on ionic liquids clearly depends not only on the binding of the ionic liquid to the metal cations and their ability to form a dense solvation shell around them but also on the surface topography and its effect on the ion packing on the surface.},

  abstract = {Controlling electrochemical reactivity requires a detailed understanding of the charging behavior and thermodynamics of the electrochemical interface. Experiments can independently probe the overall charge response of the electrochemical double layer by capacitance measurements and the thermodynamics of the inner layer with potential of maximum entropy measurements. Relating these properties by computational modeling of the electrochemical interface has so far been challenging due to the low accuracy of classical molecular dynamics (MD) for capacitance and the limited time and length scales of ab initio MD. Here, we combine large ensembles of long-time-scale classical MD simulations with charge response from electronic density functional theory to predict the potential-dependent capacitance of a family of ideal aqueous electrochemical interfaces with different peak capacitances. We show that while the potential of maximum capacitance varies, this entire family exhibits an electrode charge of maximum capacitance (CMC) between −2.9 and −2.2 μ C/cm 2 , regardless of the details in the electronic response. Simulated heating of the same interfaces reveals that the entropy peaks at a charge of maximum entropy (CME) of −5.1 ± 0.6 μ C/cm 2 , in agreement with experimental findings for metallic electrodes. The CME and CMC both indicate asymmetric response of interfacial water that is stronger for negatively charged electrodes, while the difference between CME and CMC illustrates the richness in behavior of even the ideal electrochemical interface.},

  abstract = {Using non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate the effect of concentration and alkali cation types (K + , Na + , and Li + ) on the hydrodynamic slip of aqueous alkali chloride solutions in an uncharged graphene nanochannel. We modeled the graphene–electrolyte interactions using the potential of Williams et al. [J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 8 , 703 (2017)], which uses optimized graphene–ion Lennard-Jones interaction parameters to effectively account for surface and solvent polarizability effects on the adsorption of ions in an aqueous solution to a graphene surface. In our study, the hydrodynamic slip exhibits a decreasing trend for alkali chloride solutions with increasing salt concentration. The NaCl solution shows the highest reduction in the slip length followed by KCl and LiCl solutions, and the reduction in the slip length is very much dependent on the salt type. We also compared the slip length with that calculated using a standard unoptimized interatomic potential obtained from the Lorentz–Berthelot mixing rule for the ion–carbon interactions, which is not adjusted to account for the surface and solvent polarizability at the graphene surface. In contrast to the optimized model, the slip length of alkali chloride solutions in the unoptimized model shows only a nominal change with salt concentration and is also independent of the nature of salts. Our study shows that adoption of the computationally inexpensive optimized potential of Williams et al. for the graphene–ion interactions has a significant influence on the calculation of slip lengths for electrolyte solutions in graphene-based nanofluidic devices.},

  abstract = {The lifetime and health of lithium metal batteries are greatly hindered by nonuniform deposition and growth of lithium at the anode–electrolyte interface, which leads to dendrite formation, efficiency loss, and short circuiting. Lithium deposition is influenced by several factors including local current densities, overpotentials, surface heterogeneity, and lithium-ion concentrations. However, due to the embedded, dynamic nature of this interface, it is difficult to observe the complex physics operando . Here, we present a detailed model of the interface that implements Butler–Volmer kinetics to investigate the effects of overpotential and surface heterogeneities on dendrite growth. A high overpotential has been proposed as a contributing factor in increased nucleation and growth of dendrites. Using computational methods, we can isolate the aspects of the complex physics at the interface to gain better insight into how each component affects the overall system. In addition, studies have shown that mechanical modifications to the anode surface, such as micropatterning, are a potential way of controlling deposition and increasing Coulombic efficiency. Micropatterns on the anode surface are explored along with deformations in the solid–electrolyte interface layer to understand their effects on the dendritic growth rates and morphology. The study results show that at higher overpotentials, more dendritic growth and a more branched morphology are present in comparison to low overpotentials, where more uniform and denser growth is observed. In addition, the results suggest that there is a relationship between surface chemistries and anode geometries.},

  abstract = {Experiments reported that alkaline earth metal dopants greatly prolong carrier lifetime and improve the performance of perovskite solar cells. Using state-of-the-art ab initio time-domain nonadiabatic molecular dynamics (NAMD), we demonstrate that incorporation of alkaline earth metals, such as Sr and Ba, into MAPbI 3 (MA = CH 3 NH 3 + ) lattice at the lead site is energetically favorable due to the largely negative formation energies about −7 eV. The replacement widens the bandgap and increases the open-circuit voltage by creating no trap states. More importantly, the substitution reduces the mixing of electron and hole wave functions by pushing the hole charge density away from the dopant together with no contribution of Sr and Ba to the conduction band edge state, thus decreasing the NA coupling. The high frequency phonons generated by enhanced atomic motions and symmetry breaking accelerate phonon-induced loss of coherence. The synergy of the three factors reduces the nonradiative recombination time by a factor of about 2 in the Sr- and Ba-doped systems with respect to pristine MAPbI 3 , which occurs over 1 ns and agrees well with the experiment. The study highlights the importance of various factors affecting charge carrier lifetime, establishes the mechanism of reduction of nonradiative electron–hole recombination in perovskites upon alkaline earth metal doping, and provides meaningful insights into the design of high performance of perovskite solar cells and optoelectronics.},

Herein, we report a simple two-step hydrothermal method for the growth of Zn-doped NiSe 2 and Ni(OH) 2 nanocomposites on Ni foam [Zn–NiSe 2 /Ni(OH) 2 ]. The resulting material delivers high specific capacity (1525.8 C g −1 /564.7 mA h g −1 at 6 A g −1 and 1220 C g −1 at 10 A g −1 ) in a three-electrode system. A Zn–NiSe 2 /Ni(OH) 2 //porous carbon (PC) aqueous asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) was built by utilizing Zn–NiSe 2 /Ni(OH) 2 as the positive electrode and PC as the negative electrode. This Zn–NiSe 2 /Ni(OH) 2 //PC ASC shows an energy density of 75.8 W h kg −1 at a power density of 916.1 W kg −1 and achieves a specific capacity retention of 100\% after 25 000 cycles at 10 A g −1 .

This is done at the constant total number of particles, volume, and temperature. We show that under certain conditions, one may have several local minima in the free energy profile, one for the homogeneous liquid and others for the spherical, cylindrical, and planar solid clusters surrounded by liquid. The variation of the interfacial free energy with the radius of the solid cluster and the distance between equimolar and tension surfaces are inputs from simulation results of nucleation studies. This is possible because stable solid clusters in the canonical ensemble become critical in the isothermal–isobaric ensemble. At each local minimum, we find no difference in chemical potential between the phases. At local maxima, we also find equal chemical potential, albeit in this case the nucleus is unstable. Moreover, the theory allows us to describe the stable solid clusters found in simulations. Therefore, we can use it for any combination of the total number of particles, volume, and global density as long as a minimum in the Helmholtz free energy occurs. We also study under which conditions the absolute minimum in the free energy corresponds to a homogeneous liquid or to a heterogeneous system having either spherical, cylindrical, or planar geometry. This work shows that the thermodynamics of curved interfaces at equilibrium can be used to describe nucleation.},

Both measures of anisotropic order can be described by a single deposition rate–substrate temperature superposition (RTS). This supports the applicability of the surface equilibration mechanism and generalizes the RTS principle from previous model systems with liquid crystalline order to non-mesogenic organic semiconductors. We find that vapor-deposited glasses of ABH113 have significantly enhanced density and thermal stability compared to their counterparts prepared by liquid-cooling. For organic semiconductors, the results of this study provide an efficient guide for using the deposition rate to prepare stable glasses with controlled molecular packing.},

  abstract = {A recent study introduced a novel mean-field model system where each particle over and above the interaction with its regular neighbors interacts with k extra pseudo-neighbors. Here, we present an extensive study of thermodynamics and its correlation with the dynamics of this system. We surprisingly find that the well-known thermodynamic integration (TI) method of calculating the entropy provides unphysical results. It predicts vanishing of the configurational entropy at temperatures close to the onset temperature of the system and negative values of the configurational entropy at lower temperatures. Interestingly, well below the temperature at which the configurational entropy vanishes, both the collective and the single-particle dynamics of the system show complete relaxation. Negative values of the configurational entropy are unphysical, and complete relaxation when the configurational entropy is zero violates the prediction of the random first-order transition theory (RFOT). However, the entropy calculated using the two-phase thermodynamics (2PT) method remains positive at all temperatures for which we can equilibrate the system, and its values are consistent with RFOT predictions. We find that with an increase in k , the difference in the entropy computed using the two methods increases. A similar effect is also observed for a system where a randomly selected fraction of the particles are pinned in their positions in the equilibrated liquid. We show that the difference in entropy calculated via the 2PT and TI methods increases with pinning density.},

Several crystalline NH 4 F phases have isostructural ice counterparts and one of the famous anomalies of water, the fact that the liquid is denser than ice I h , is also found for NH 4 F. Here, we investigate the phase transitions of the pressure-quenched high-pressure phases of NH 4 F upon heating at ambient pressure with x-ray diffraction and calorimetry, and we compare the results with the corresponding ices. NH 4 F II transforms to NH 4 F I sd , which is a stacking-disordered variant of the stable hexagonal NH 4 F I h polymorph. Heating NH 4 F III gives a complex mixture of NH 4 F II and NH 4 F I sd , while some NH 4 F III remains initially. Complete conversion to NH 4 F I sd is achieved above ∼220 K. The NH 4 F II obtained from NH 4 F III persists to much higher temperatures compared to the corresponding pressure-quenched NH 4 F II. Quantification of the stacking disorder in NH 4 F I sd reveals a more sluggish conversion to NH 4 F I h for NH 4 F I sd from NH 4 F III. In general, the presence of stress and strain in the samples appears to have pronounced effects on the phase transition temperatures. NH 4 F shows a complete lack of amorphous forms at low temperatures either upon low-temperature compression of NH 4 F I h or heating NH 4 F III at ambient pressure. The amorphous forms of ice are often used to explain the anomalies of water. It will, therefore, be interesting to explore if liquid NH 4 F displays more water-like anomalies despite the apparent lack of amorphous forms at low temperatures.},

Using detailed analysis of the molecular and electronic structure, we find that the spatial character of the excess electron of the solvated radical anion follows the underlying Jahn–Teller distortions of the molecular geometry. We decompose the electronic density of states to isolate the contribution of the solute and to examine the response of the solvent to its presence. Our findings show the correspondence between instantaneous molecular structure and spin density; provide important insights into the electronic stability of the species, revealing that it is, indeed, a bound state in the condensed phase; and offer electronic densities of states that aid in the interpretation of experimental photoelectron spectra.},

Our results show that both PZSIC and especially the LSIC methods improve the barrier heights relative to the local density approximation (LDA). The version of LSIC that uses the iso-orbital indicator z as a scaling factor gives a more consistent improvement than an alternative version that uses an orbital-dependent factor w based on the ratio of orbital densities to the total electron density. We show that LDA energies evaluated using the self-consistent and self-interaction-free PZSIC densities can be used to assess density-driven errors. The LDA reaction barrier errors for the BH76 set are found to contain significant density-driven errors for all types of reactions contained in the set, but the corrections due to adding SIC to the functional are much larger than those stemming from the density for the hydrogen transfer reactions and of roughly equal size for the non-hydrogen transfer reactions.},

Considering both structural and polarization contributions concurrently, the HRS response is dominated by cooperative behavior of those effects for weak and intermediate electric field strengths.

Three rovibrational bands are identified at high S/N (20:1–40:1) and rotationally assigned to (i) the CH stretch fundamental ( v 1 ) band X ̃ 1 , 0 , 0 ← X ̃ 0 , 0 , 0 and (ii) vibrational hot bands [ X ̃ ( 1 , 1 , 0 ) ← X ̃ ( 0 , 1 , 0 ) and X ̃ ( 1 , 0 , 1 ) ← X ̃ ( 0 , 0 , 1 ) ] arising from vibrationally excited HCBr populated in the discharge with single quanta in either the H–C–Br bend ( v 2 ) or C–Br stretch ( v 3 ) modes. Precision rotational constants are reported for a total of six states, with an experimentally determined CH stretch vibrational frequency (2799.38 cm −1 ) in good agreement with previous low-resolution fluorescence studies [M. Deselnicu et al. , J. Chem. Phys. 124 (13), 134302 (2006)]. Detailed analysis of the fundamental v 1 band highlights the presence of perturbations in the X ̃ 1 , 0 , 0 level, which we tentatively attribute to arise from the nearby triplet state a ̃ ( 0 , 0 , 1 ) through spin–orbit interaction or the multiple quanta X ̃ 0 , 2 , 1 singlet state via c-type Coriolis coupling. Reduced-Doppler resolution (60 MHz) in the slit-jet IR spectrometer permits for clear observation of a nuclear spin hyperfine structure, with experimental line shapes well reproduced by nuclear quadrupole/spin-rotation coupling constants from microwave studies [C. Duan et al. , J. Mol. Spectrosc. 220 (1), 113–121 (2003)]. Finally, the a-type to b-type transition intensity ratio for the fundamental CH stretch band is notably larger than that predicted by using a bond-dipole model, which from high level ab initio quantum calculations [CCSD(T)/PVQZ] can be attributed to vibrationally induced “charge-sloshing” of electron density along the polar C–Br bond.},

  abstract = {Clathrate hydrates, or cages comprised solely of water molecules, have long been investigated as a clean storage facility for hydrogen molecules. A breakthrough occurred when hydrogen molecules were experimentally placed within a structure-II clathrate hydrate, which sparked much interest to determine their feasibility for energy storage [Mao et al. , Science 297 , 2247–2249 (2002)]. We use Path Integral Molecular Dynamics (PIMD) and Langevin equation Path Integral Ground State (LePIGS) for finite temperature and zero-temperature studies, respectively, to determine parahydrogen occupancy properties in the small dodecahedral (5 12 ) and large hexakaidecahedral (5 12 6 4 ) sized cages that comprise the structure-II unit cell. We look at energetic and structural properties of small clusters of hydrogen, treated as point-like particles, confined within each of the different sized clathrates, and treated as rigid, to determine energetic and structural properties in the zero-temperature limit. Our predicted hydrogen occupancy within these two cage sizes is consistent with previous literature values. We then calculate the energies as a function of temperature and merge the low temperature results calculated using finite temperature PIMD with the zero-temperature results using LePIGS, demonstrating that the two methods are compatible.},

This approach allows us to refine our kinetic results [Ehrhard et al ., J. Chem. Phys. (in press)] to enhance our conclusions. We focus on a selection of cluster adsorbate complexes within the ranges of i = j = 3–8 and m = 1–10. For i = j = 3, 4, DFT suggests alloy structures in the case of i = j = 4 of high (D 2d ) symmetry: Rh–Fe bonds are preferred instead of Fe–Fe bonds or Rh–Rh bonds. N 2 adsorption and IR-MPD studies reveal strong evidence for preferential adsorption to Rh sites and mere secondary adsorption to Fe. In some cases, we observe adsorption isomers. With the help of modeling the cluster adsorbate complex [Rh 3 Fe 3 (N 2 ) 7 ] + , we find clear evidence that the position of IR bands allows for an element specific assignment of an adsorption site. We transfer these findings to the [Rh 4 Fe 4 (N 2 ) m ] + cluster adsorbate complex where the first four N 2 molecules are exclusively adsorbed to the Rh atoms. The spectra of the larger adsorbates reveal N 2 adsorption onto the Fe atoms. Thus, the spectroscopic findings are well interpreted for the smaller clusters in terms of computed structures, and both compare well to those of our accompanying kinetic study [Ehrhard et al ., J. Chem. Phys. (in press)]. In contrast to our previous studies of bare rhodium clusters, the present investigations do not provide any indication for a spin quench in [Rh i Fe j (N 2 ) m ] + upon stepwise N 2 adsorption.},

  abstract = {Infrared (IR) action spectroscopy is utilized to characterize a prototypical carbon-centered hydroperoxyalkyl radical (•QOOH) transiently formed in the oxidation of volatile organic compounds. The •QOOH radical formed in isobutane oxidation, 2-hydroperoxy-2-methylprop-1-yl, •CH 2 (CH 3 ) 2 COOH, is generated in the laboratory by H-atom abstraction from tert -butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP). IR spectral features of jet-cooled and stabilized •QOOH radicals are observed from 2950 to 7050 cm −1 at energies that lie below and above the transition state barrier leading to OH radical and cyclic ether products. The observed •QOOH features include overtone OH and CH stretch transitions, combination bands involving OH or CH stretch and a lower frequency mode, and fundamental OH and CH stretch transitions. Most features arise from a single vibrational transition with band contours well simulated at a rotational temperature of 10 K. In each case, the OH products resulting from unimolecular decay of vibrationally activated •QOOH are detected by UV laser-induced fluorescence. Assignments of observed •QOOH IR transitions are guided by anharmonic frequencies computed using second order vibrational perturbation theory, a 2 + 1 model that focuses on the coupling of the OH stretch with two low-frequency torsions, as well as recently predicted statistical •QOOH unimolecular decay rates that include heavy-atom tunneling. Most of the observed vibrational transitions of •QOOH are readily distinguished from those of the TBHP precursor. The distinctive IR transitions of •QOOH, including the strong fundamental OH stretch, provide a general means for detection of •QOOH under controlled laboratory and real-world conditions.},

  abstract = {Hypericin tautomerization that involves the migration of the labile protons is believed to be the primary photophysical process relevant to its light-activated antiviral activity. Despite the difficulty in isolating individual tautomers, it can be directly observed in single-molecule experiments. We show that the tautomerization of single hypericin molecules in free space is observed as an abrupt flipping of the image pattern accompanied with fluorescence intensity fluctuations, which are not correlated with lifetime changes. Moreover, the study can be extended to a λ/2 Fabry–Pérot microcavity. The modification of the local photonic environment by a microcavity is well simulated with a theoretical model that shows good agreement with the experimental data. Inside a microcavity, the excited state lifetime and fluorescence intensity of single hypericin molecules are correlated, and a distinct jump of the lifetime and fluorescence intensity reveals the temporal behavior of the tautomerization with high sensitivity and high temporal resolution. The observed changes are also consistent with time-dependent density functional theory calculations. Our approach paves the way to monitor and even control reactions for a wider range of molecules at the single molecule level.},

  abstract = {Chirped-pulse Fourier transform microwave (CP-FTMW) spectroscopy is a powerful near-universal detection method finding application in many areas. We have previously coupled it with supersonic flows (CPUF) to obtain product branching in reaction and photodissociation. Because chirped-pulse microwave detection requires monitoring the free induction decay on the timescale of microseconds, it cannot be employed with good sensitivity at the high densities achieved in some uniform supersonic flows. For application to low-temperature kinetics studies, a truly uniform flow is required to obtain reliable rate measurements and enjoy all the advantages that CP-FTMW has to offer. To this end, we present a new setup that combines sampling of uniform supersonic flows using an airfoil-shaped sampling device with chirped-pulse mmW detection. Density and temperature variations in the airfoil-sampled uniform flow were revealed using time-dependent rotational spectroscopy of pyridine and vinyl cyanide photoproducts, highlighting the use of UV photodissociation as a sensitive diagnostic tool for uniform flows. The performance of the new airfoil-equipped CPUF rotational spectrometer was validated using kinetics measurements of the CN + C 2 H 6 reaction at 50 K with detection of the HCN product. Issues relating to product detection by rotational spectroscopy and airfoil sampling are discussed. We show that airfoil sampling enables direct measurements of low temperature reaction kinetics on a microsecond timescale, while rotational spectroscopic detection enables highly specific simultaneous detection of reactants and products.},

Moreover, the probability of single molecule detection systematically drops with the number of the moieties attached to the pyrrole ring. As steric hindrance is the only significantly changing feature among the studied chromophores, we attribute the observed phenomena to the spatial structure.

This implies that the thermodynamic potential and the fundamental forces driving chemical reaction networks out of equilibrium can be identified in the same way for both mechanisms. By analyzing the dynamics and thermodynamics of a simple enzymatic model, we also show that while the two mechanisms are equivalent at steady state, the flux control may lead to fundamentally different regimes where systems achieve stationary growth.},

In most cases, the models rely on a description of atom-centered environments and are suitable to learn atomic properties or global observables that can be decomposed into atomic contributions. Many quantities that are relevant for quantum mechanical calculations, however—most notably the single-particle Hamiltonian matrix when written in an atomic orbital basis—are not associated with a single center, but with two (or more) atoms in the structure. We discuss a family of structural descriptors that generalize the very successful atom-centered density correlation features to the N -center case and show, in particular, how this construction can be applied to efficiently learn the matrix elements of the (effective) single-particle Hamiltonian written in an atom-centered orbital basis. These N -center features are fully equivariant—not only in terms of translations and rotations but also in terms of permutations of the indices associated with the atoms—and are suitable to construct symmetry-adapted machine-learning models of new classes of properties of molecules and materials.},

  abstract = {Coulomb interaction, following an inverse-square force-law, quantifies the amount of force between two stationary and electrically charged particles. The long-range nature of Coulomb interactions poses a major challenge to molecular dynamics simulations, which are major tools for problems at the nano-/micro-scale. Various algorithms are developed to calculate the pairwise Coulomb interactions to a linear scale, but poor scalability limits the size of simulated systems. Here, we use an efficient molecular dynamics algorithm with the random batch Ewald method on all-atom systems where the complete Fourier components in the Coulomb interaction are replaced by randomly selected mini-batches. By simulating the N -body systems up to 10 8 particles using 10 000 central processing unit cores, we show that this algorithm furnishes O ( N ) complexity, almost perfect scalability, and an order of magnitude faster computational speed when compared to the existing state-of-the-art algorithms. Further examinations of our algorithm on distinct systems, including pure water, a micro-phase separated electrolyte, and a protein solution, demonstrate that the spatiotemporal information on all time and length scales investigated and thermodynamic quantities derived from our algorithm are in perfect agreement with those obtained from the existing algorithms. Therefore, our algorithm provides a promising solution on scalability of computing the Coulomb interaction. It is particularly useful and cost-effective to simulate ultra-large systems, which is either impossible or very costly to conduct using existing algorithms, and thus will be beneficial to a broad range of problems at nano-/micro-scales.},

The electron–nuclear and electron–electron scaling functions, g iA and g ij , respectively, are generalized. From the relations between SE and SSE at the inter-particle distances being zero and infinity, the scaling function must satisfy the collisional (or coalescent) condition and the asymptotic condition, respectively. Based on these conditions, general scaling functions are classified into “correct” (satisfying both conditions), “reasonable” (satisfying only collisional condition), and “approximate but still useful” (not satisfying collisional condition) classes. Several analytical scaling functions are listed for each class. Popular functions r iA and r ij belong to the reasonable class. The qualities of many electron–electron scaling functions are examined variationally for the helium atom using the FC theory. Although the complement functions of FC theory are produced generally from both the potential and kinetic operators in the Hamiltonian, those produced from the kinetic operator were shown to be less important than those produced from the potential operator. Hence, we used only the complement functions produced from the potential operator and showed that the correct-class g ij functions gave most accurate results and the reasonable-class functions were less accurate. Among the examined correct and reasonable functions, the conventional function r ij was worst in accuracy, although it was still very accurate. Thus, we have many potentially accurate “correct” scaling functions for use in FC theory to solve the SEs of atoms and molecules.},

Given that Machine Learning (ML) techniques have been shown to accelerate orders of magnitude the computation of a number of quantum mechanical observables, in this work, we take advantage of ML knowledge to develop an intuitive and fast neural network model (NNAIMQ) for the computation of QTAIM charges for C, H, O, and N atoms with high accuracy. Our model has been trained and tested using data from quantum chemical calculations in more than 45 000 molecular environments of the near-equilibrium CHON chemical space. The reliability and performance of NNAIMQ have been analyzed in a variety of scenarios, from equilibrium geometries to molecular dynamics simulations. Altogether, NNAIMQ yields remarkably small prediction errors, well below the 0.03 electron limit in the general case, while accelerating the calculation of QTAIM charges by several orders of magnitude.},

  abstract = {Modern electronic structure approximations routinely employ reference systems described by approximate Hamiltonians. This work introduces the adiabatic projection formalism for building formally exact corrections to such reference systems. Starting from the real Hamiltonian of a many-electron system, one constructs a reference system Hamiltonian by projecting the kinetic and electron–electron interaction operators onto “interesting” states. The reference system is corrected by density functionals for the difference between the projected and unprojected kinetic and electron–electron energies. These density functionals are constructed from adiabatic connections between the reference and real systems. The Hohenberg–Kohn theorems imply the existence of exact functionals, which can ensure that the reference system’s ground-state energy and density match the real system. Adiabatic projection further generalizes Kohn–Sham density functional theory (DFT) and the generalized adiabatic connection [W. Yang, J. Chem. Phys. 109 , 10107 (1998)] and recovers these methods for certain choices of projection operators. Other choices of projection operators offer new opportunities, including formally exact and systematically improvable analogues to wavefunction-in-DFT embedding, DFT+U, and semiempirical theories. Numerical results are presented for two representative choices: a projected exchange–correlation correction to small-basis-set coupled cluster theory and a projected kinetic energy density functional correcting basis set errors in DFT. The latter offers performance for dimerization energies approaching the Boys–Bernardi counterpoise correction while also correcting intramolecular basis set superposition errors.},

  abstract = {The iterative solution of the coupled cluster equations exhibits a synergistic relationship among the various cluster amplitudes. The iteration scheme is analyzed as a multivariate discrete time propagation of nonlinearly coupled equations, which is dictated by only a few principal cluster amplitudes. These principal amplitudes usually correspond to only a few valence excitations, whereas all other cluster amplitudes are enslaved and behave as auxiliary variables [Agarawal et al. , J. Chem. Phys. 154 , 044110 (2021)]. We develop a coupled cluster–machine learning hybrid scheme where various supervised machine learning strategies are introduced to establish the interdependence between the principal and auxiliary amplitudes on-the-fly. While the coupled cluster equations are solved only to determine the principal amplitudes, the auxiliary amplitudes, on the other hand, are determined via regression as unique functionals of the principal amplitudes. This leads to significant reduction in the number of independent degrees of freedom during the iterative optimization, which saves significant computation time. A few different regression techniques have been developed, which have their own advantages and disadvantages. The scheme has been applied to several molecules in their equilibrium and stretched geometries, and our scheme, with all the regression models, shows a significant reduction in computation time over the canonical coupled cluster calculations without unduly sacrificing the accuracy.},

  abstract = {We use a reactive Monte Carlo simulation method and the primitive model of electrolyte to study acid–base equilibrium that controls charge regulation in colloidal systems. The simulations are performed in a semi-grand canonical ensemble in which colloidal suspension is in contact with a reservoir of salt and strong acid. The interior of colloidal particles is modeled as a low dielectric medium, different from the surrounding water. The effective colloidal charge is calculated for different numbers of surface acidic groups, pH, salt concentrations, and types of electrolyte. In the case of potassium chloride, the titration curves are compared with the experimental measurements obtained using potentiometric titration. A good agreement is found between simulations and experiments. In the case of lithium chloride, the specific ionic adsorption is taken into account through the partial dehydration of lithium ion.},

The approach allows a general computational framework for molecular and bulk systems in which material specificity, electron correlation, and spin–orbit coupling effects can be captured accurately and on an equal footing, with favorable computational scaling vs system size. We adopt relativistic effective-core potentials that have been obtained by fitting to fully relativistic data and that have demonstrated a high degree of reliability and transferability in molecular systems. This results in a two-component spin-coupled Hamiltonian, which is then treated by generalizing the ab initio AFQMC approach. We demonstrate the method by computing the electron affinity in Pb, the bond dissociation energy in Br 2 and I 2 , and solid Bi.},

  abstract = {A property of exact density functional theory is linear fractional charge behavior as electrons are added or removed from a molecule. Typical density functional approximations (DFAs) exhibit delocalization error, which overstabilizes this fractional charge. Conversely, solvent corrections have been shown to erroneously destabilize this fractional charge. This work will show that an implicit solvent correction with a tuned dielectric can be used as an ad hoc correction to offset the delocalizing character of DFAs and achieve linear fractional charge behavior. While desirable, in principle, we find that this linear charge behavior degrades the vertical ionization energies reported by DFAs. Our results reveal that the localizing character of the solvent correction and the Hartree–Fock (HF) exchange offset each other. This helps explain the decreased ratios of HF exchange to DFA exchange in long-range hybrid tuning studies that use a solvent correction.},

  abstract = {Crystal structure prediction has been a subject of topical interest but remains a substantial challenge especially for complex structures as it deals with the global minimization of the extremely rugged high-dimensional potential energy surface. In this paper, a symmetry-orientated divide-and-conquer scheme was proposed to construct a symmetry tree graph, where the entire search space is decomposed into a finite number of symmetry dependent subspaces. An artificial intelligence-based symmetry selection strategy was subsequently devised to select the low-lying subspaces with high symmetries for global exploration and in-depth exploitation. Our approach can significantly simplify the problem of crystal structure prediction by avoiding exploration of the most complex P 1 subspace on the entire search space and has the advantage of preserving the crystal symmetry during structure evolution, making it well suitable for predicting the complex crystal structures. The effectiveness of the method has been validated by successful prediction of the candidate structures of binary Lennard-Jones mixtures and the high-pressure phase of ice, containing more than 100 atoms in the simulation cell. The work therefore opens up an opportunity toward achieving the long-sought goal of crystal structure prediction of complex systems.},

  abstract = {This paper accounts for a general procedure of bonding analysis that is, expectedly, adequate to describe any type of interaction involving the noble-gas (Ng) atoms. Building on our recently proposed classification of the Ng–X bonds (X = binding partner) [New J. Chem. 44 , 15536 (2020)], these contacts are first distinguished into three types, namely, A, B, or C, based on the topology of the electron energy density H ( r ) and on the shape of its plotted form. Bonds of type B or C are, then, further assigned as B-loose (B l ) or B-tight (B t ) and C-loose (C l ) or C-tight (C t ) depending on the sign that H ( r ) takes along the Ng–X bond path located from the topological analysis of ρ ( r ), particularly at around the bond critical point (BCP). Any bond of type A, B l /B t , or C l /C t is, finally, assayed in terms of contribution of covalency. This is accomplished by studying the maximum, minimum, and average value of H ( r ) over the volume enclosed by the low-density reduced density gradient (RDG) isosurface associated with the bond (typically, the RDG isosurface including the BCP) and the average ρ ( r ) over the same volume. The bond assignment is also corroborated by calculating the values of quantitative indices specifically defined for the various types of interactions (A, B, or C). The generality of our taken approach should encourage its wide application to the study of Ng compounds.},

Phys. 119 , 12718–12728 (2003)] loses its effectiveness as chain stiffness increases into the semiflexible regime because the energy barriers associated with double-bridging Monte Carlo moves become prohibitively high. Here we overcome this issue by combining DBH with the use of core-softened pair potentials. This reduces the energy barriers substantially, allowing us to equilibrate melts with N ≃ 40 N e and chain stiffnesses all the way up to the isotropic–nematic transition using simulations of no more than 100 × 10 6 time steps. For semiflexible chains, our method is several times faster than the standard DBH; we exploit this speedup to develop improved expressions for Kremer–Grest melts’ chain-stiffness-dependent Kuhn length ℓ K and entanglement length N e .},

  abstract = {The experimental and theoretical determination of the mean excitation energy, I (0), and the stopping power, S ( v ), of a material is of great interest in particle and material physics and radiation therapy. For calculations of I (0), the complete set of electronic transitions in a given basis set is required, effectively limiting such calculations to systems with a small number of electrons, even at the random-phase approximation (RPA)/time-dependent Hartree–Fock (TDHF) or time-dependent density-functional theory level. To overcome such limitations, we present here the implementation of a Lanczos algorithm adapted for the paired RPA/TDHF eigenvalue problem in the Dalton program and show that it provides good approximation of the entire RPA eigenspectra in a reduced space. We observe rapid convergence of I (0) with the number of Lanczos vectors as the algorithm favors the transitions with large contributions. In most cases, the algorithm recovers RPA I (0) values of up to 0.5\% accuracy at less than a quarter of the full space size. The algorithm not only exploits the RPA paired structure to save computational resources but also preserves certain sum-over-states properties, as first demonstrated by Johnson et al. [Comput. Phys. Commun. 120 , 155 (1999)]. The block Lanczos RPA solver, as presented here, thus shows promise for computing mean excitation energies for systems larger than what was computationally feasible before.},
