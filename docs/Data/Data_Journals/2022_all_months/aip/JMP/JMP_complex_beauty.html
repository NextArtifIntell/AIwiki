Each of them has the key properties of ordinary coherent states: it intertwines the representations of a given algebra, has the completeness property, and minimizes the product of variances in the Heisenberg relation. However, unlike the usual coherent states that are eigenstates for the annihilation operator, the constructed distributions belong to the continuous spectrum of Hermitian generators of the Heisenberg algebra. The inner product of functionals from different families has the main properties of the overlap function of ordinary coherent states: it is continuous in parameters, satisfies the reproducing identity, and has the corresponding geometric meaning. The application of unusual coherent states of the continuous spectrum is demonstrated by an example of solving the spectral problem for an inverted oscillator.},

  abstract     = {The General Equation for Non-Equilibrium Reversible–Irreversible Coupling (GENERIC) provides the structure of mesoscopic multiscale dynamics that guarantees the emergence of equilibrium states. Similarly, a lift of the GENERIC structure to iterated cotangent bundles, called a rate GENERIC, guarantees the emergence of the vector fields that generate the approach to equilibrium. Moreover, the rate GENERIC structure also extends Onsager’s variational principle. The maximum entropy principle in the GENERIC structure becomes the Onsager variational principle in the rate GENERIC structure. In the absence of external forces, the rate entropy is a potential that is closely related to the entropy production. In the presence of external forces when the entropy does not exist, the rate entropy still exists. While the entropy at the conclusion of the GENERIC time evolution gives rise to equilibrium thermodynamics, the rate entropy at the conclusion of the rate GENERIC time evolution gives rise to rate thermodynamics. Both GENERIC and rate GENERIC structures are put into the geometrical framework in the first paper of this series. The rate GENERIC is also shown to be related to Grad’s hierarchy analysis of reductions of the Boltzmann equation. Chemical kinetics and kinetic theory provide illustrative examples. We introduce rate GENERIC extensions (and thus also Onsager-variational-principle formulations) of both chemical kinetics and the Boltzmann kinetic theory.},

We describe the asymptotic behavior of the first hitting time from the metastable state to the set of the stable states as β → ∞ in probability, in expectation, and in distribution. We also identify the exponent of the mixing time and find an upper bound and a lower bound for the spectral gap. We identify the minimal gates for the transition from the metastable state to the set of the stable states and for the transition from the metastable state to a fixed stable state. Furthermore, we identify the tube of typical trajectories for these two transitions.

This is accomplished by the use of an asymptotic expansion of the grand potential, which is derived by ζ -regularization techniques. Herewith, we can show that the singularity structure of this expansion is directly interwoven with the phase structure of the system: In the non-condensation phase, the expansion has a form that resembles usual heat kernel expansions. By this, thermodynamic observables are directly calculable. In contrast, the expansion exhibits a singularity of infinite order above a critical density, and a renormalization of the chemical potential is needed to ensure well-defined thermodynamic observables. Furthermore, the renormalization procedure forces the system to exhibit condensation. In addition, we show that characteristic features of the thermodynamic limit, such as the critical density or the internal energy, are entirely encoded in the coefficients of the asymptotic expansion.},

Although GENERIC, which is the sum of Hamiltonian mechanics and gradient dynamics, is a framework unifying a vast range of models in non-equilibrium thermodynamics, it has unclear geometric structure due to the diverse geometric origins of Hamiltonian mechanics and gradient dynamics. The difference can be overcome by cotangent lifts of the dynamics, which leads, for instance, to a Hamiltonian form of gradient dynamics. Moreover, the lifted vector fields can be split into their holonomic and vertical representatives, which provides a geometric method of dynamic reduction. The lifted dynamics can be also given physical meaning, here called the rate-GENERIC. Finally, the lifts can be formulated within contact geometry, where the second law of thermodynamics is explicitly contained within the evolution equations.},

The approach works well in the non-relativistic case, i.e., for the Laplacian operator. Here, we study how the approach can be applied to Dirac operators. While this has successfully been done already in one space dimension, and more generally for codimension-1 boundaries, the situation of point sources in three dimensions corresponds to a codimension-3 boundary. One would expect that, for such a boundary, Dirac operators do not allow for boundary conditions because they are known not to allow for point interactions in 3D, which also correspond to a boundary condition. Indeed, we confirm this expectation here by proving that there is no self-adjoint operator on a (truncated) Fock space that would correspond to a Dirac operator with an IBC at configurations with a particle at the origin. However, we also present a positive result showing that there are self-adjoint operators with an IBC (on the boundary consisting of configurations with a particle at the origin) that are away from those configurations, given by a Dirac operator plus a sufficiently strong Coulomb potential.},

The physics of quantum field theory and holography, however, motivates entropy inequalities in type III von Neumann algebras that lack a semifinite trace. The Haagerup and Kosaki L p spaces enable re-expressing trace inequalities in non-tracial von Neumann algebras. In particular, we show this for the generalized Araki–Lieb–Thirring and Golden–Thompson inequalities from the work of Sutter et al. [Commun. Math. Phys. 352 (1), 37 (2017)]. Then, using the Haagerup approximation method, we prove a general von Neumann algebra version of universal recovery map corrections to the data processing inequality for relative entropy. We also show subharmonicity of a logarithmic p-fidelity of recovery. Furthermore, we prove that the non-decrease of relative entropy is equivalent to the existence of an L 1 -isometry implementing the channel on both input states.},

Based on these results, we obtain a kind of inequality known as quasi-factorization or approximate tensorization of relative entropy. Quasi-factorization lower bounds the sum of a density’s relative entropies to several subalgebraic restrictions in terms of its relative entropy to their intersection’s subalgebraic restriction.

We also extend UPB to the notions of unextendible product operator basis, unextendible product unitary operator basis (UPUOB), and strongly UPUOB. We construct their examples and show the nonlocality of some strongly UPUOBs under local operations and classical communications. We study the phenomenon of these operators acting on quantum states. As an application, we distinguish the two-dimensional strongly UPUOB, which only consumes three ebits of entanglement. Our results imply that such UPUOBs exhibit nonlocality as UPBs, and the distinguishability of them requires entanglement resources.},

  abstract     = {The NLTS (No Low-Energy Trivial State) conjecture [M. H. Freedman and M. B. Hastings, Quantum Inf. Comput. 14 , 144 (2014)] posits that there exist families of Hamiltonians with all low energy states of high complexity (with complexity measured by the quantum circuit depth preparing the state). Here, we prove a weaker version called the combinatorial no low error trivial states (NLETS), where a quantum circuit lower bound is shown against states that violate a (small) constant fraction of local terms. This generalizes the prior NLETS results [L. Eldar and A. W. Harrow, in 2017 IEEE 58th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS) (IEEE, 2017), pp. 427–438] and [Nirkhe et al. , in 45th International Colloquium on Automata, Languages, and Programming (ICALP 2018), Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics (LIPIcs) , edited by Chatzigiannakis et al. (Schloss Dagstuhl–Leibniz-Zentrum fuer Informatik, Dagstuhl, Germany, 2018), Vol. 107 , pp. 1–11]. Our construction is obtained by combining tensor networks with expander codes [M. Sipser and D. Spielman, IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 42 , 1710 (1996)]. The Hamiltonian is the parent Hamiltonian of a perturbed tensor network, inspired by the “uncle Hamiltonian” of Fernández-González et al. [Commun. Math. Phys. 333 , 299 (2015)]. Thus, we deviate from the quantum Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) code Hamiltonians considered in most prior works.},

We then show that they converge exponentially fast to an integer value when we increase the system size and also show that bulk and edge index estimates coincide at finite size. The theorem applies to any non-homogeneous system, such as disordered or defect configurations. We focus on one-dimensional chains with chiral symmetry, such as the Su–Schrieffer–Heeger model, but the proof actually only requires the Hamiltonian to be of short range and with a spectral gap in the bulk. The definition of bulk and edge index estimates relies on a finite-size version of the switch-function formalism where the Fermi projector is smoothed in energy using a carefully chosen regularization parameter.},

In this paper, we treat all these algebras as instances of the class of quadratic (and higher degree) commutator bracket algebras of Poincaré–Birkhoff–Witt type. We provide a general approach for simplifying the constraints arising from the diamond lemma and apply this in particular to give a comprehensive analysis of the quadratic case. We present new examples of quadratic algebras, which admit a cubic Casimir invariant. The connection with other approaches, such as Gröbner bases, is developed, and we suggest how our explicit and computational techniques can be relevant in other contexts.},

Complex analysis techniques allow us to consider several notions linked to the radial basis function (RBF) kernels, such as the feature space and the feature map, using the so-called Segal–Bargmann transform. We also show how the RBF kernels can be related to some of the most used operators in quantum mechanics and time frequency analysis; specifically, we prove the connections of such kernels with creation, annihilation, Fourier, translation, modulation, and Weyl operators. For the Weyl operators, we also study a semigroup property in this case.},

With the above-mentioned operators as the shift operators on the position space, we introduce a discrete-time quantum walk model on a general hypercube and obtain an explicit formula for calculating its probability distribution at any time. We also establish two limit theorems showing that the averaged probability distribution of the walk even converges to the uniform probability distribution. Finally, we show that the walk produces the uniform measure as its stationary measure on the hypercube provided its initial state satisfies some mild conditions. Some other results are also proven.},

From Laura–Andoyer equations, we recover the variational formulation in terms of the potential energy and the total inertia moment, including constraints on the distances. We use coordinates to prove the permanence of the central configuration by Newton equations of motion. The masses appear in our coordinates, forming a rigid orthocentric simplex in four dimensions, with the masses at the vertices. The linear dimensions are determined by a distance. We use different angles, with one angle measuring the rotation around the center of mass. The rest of the coordinates are angles that are constants of motion for central configurations. One angle measures the ratio of the two principal moments of inertia. The rest of the coordinates determine the rotation around the center of mass of the rigid simplex of masses with respect to the plane and to the direction of projection from four to two dimensions. We transform the Laura–Andoyer equations into different expressions in 10 and 5 dimensions, including the properties of the areas formed by five point bodies in the plane. Furthermore, we presented three numerical computed configurations of planar five-body central configurations, one convex and two concave, which give numerical confirmation of our equations with a precision better than 10 −12 .},

The existence of response tori for the degenerate Hamiltonian system has already been proved by Si and Yi [Nonlinearity 33 , 6072–6098 (2020)] if [ ∂ P ( θ , 0 , 0 ) ∂ x ] satisfies some non-zero conditions, see condition (H) in the work of Si and Yi [Nonlinearity 33 , 6072–6098 (2020)], where [·] denotes the average value of a continuous function on T d ⁠ . However, when [ ∂ P ( θ , 0 , 0 ) ∂ x ] = 0 ⁠ , no results were given by Si and Yi [Nonlinearity 33 , 6072–6098 (2020)] for response tori of the above system. This paper attempts at carrying out this work in this direction. More precisely, with 2 p 0 and ϵ * sufficiently small, there exists a Cantor set E ∈ ( 0 , ϵ * ) with almost full Lebesgue measure such that response tori exist for each ϵ ∈ E if ω satisfies a Diophantine condition. In the case where λ − 1 [ ∂ p + 1 P ( θ , 0 , 0 ) ∂ x p + 1 ] &gt; 0 and n − p is even, we prove that the system admits no response tori in most regions.

Firstly, we derive general solutions for linear homogeneous equations and give the algorithm for calculating the fundamental matrix in the case of the diag onalizable form and Jordan form. Secondly, we apply the variation of the constant formula and Z transformation to study general solutions of linear nonhomogeneous equations. We obtain the representation of solutions in the case of quaternion and complex numbers. Thirdly, we adopt the ideas from the Gram matrix and the rank of the criteria to establish sufficient and necessary conditions to guarantee that linear quaternion-valued difference equations are controllable and observable in the sense of quaternion-valued and complex numbers, respectively. In addition, a direct method to solve the control function and duality is also given. Finally, we illustrate our theoretical results with some examples.},

In the model, the gravitational constant originates from a coupling between the gravitational field and a scalar field. If the scalar field, as it should be in the real physical world, is a quantum field, the gravitational constant will have a quantum correction. The quantum correction, generally speaking, varies with spacetime coordinates. Therefore, the gravitational constant is no longer a constant. In different spacetime, the quantum correction is different, for the coupling in different spacetime is different. As a result, the gravitational constant in different spacetime is different, though the difference is only at the quantum level. We calculate the quantum correction of the gravitational constant in the Schwarzschild spacetime, the H 3 (Euclidean AdS 3 ) spacetime, the H 3 / Z spacetime, the universe model, the de Sitter spacetime, and the Rindler spacetime.},

Our analysis shows that 2D Lifshitz-like black hole solutions can be physical solutions, provided that the cosmological constant is negative (Λ &lt; 0). Indeed, there is a phase transition between stable and unstable cases by increasing the radius of AdS black holes. In other words, the 2D Lifshitz-like AdS black holes with large radii are physical and enjoy thermal stability. The obtained 2D Lifshitz-like AdS-black holes in F ( R ) gravity turn into the well-known 2D Schwarzschild AdS-black holes when the Lifshitz-like parameter is zero ( s = 0).

  abstract     = {Employing internal quantum systems as reference frames is a crucial concept in quantum gravity, gauge theories, and quantum foundations whenever external relata are unavailable. In this work, we give a comprehensive and self-contained treatment of such quantum reference frames (QRFs) for the case when the underlying configuration space is a finite Abelian group, significantly extending our previous work [M. Krumm, P. A. Höhn, and M. P. Müller, Quantum 5 , 530 (2021)]. The simplicity of this setup admits a fully rigorous quantum information–theoretic analysis, while maintaining sufficient structure for exploring many of the conceptual and structural questions also pertinent to more complicated setups. We exploit this to derive several important structures of constraint quantization with quantum information–theoretic methods and to reveal the relation between different approaches to QRF covariance. In particular, we characterize the “physical Hilbert space”—the arena of the “perspective-neutral” approach—as the maximal subspace that admits frame-independent descriptions of purifications of states. We then demonstrate the kinematical equivalence and, surprising, dynamical inequivalence of the “perspective-neutral” and the “alignability” approach to QRFs. While the former admits unitaries generating transitions between arbitrary subsystem relations, the latter, remarkably, admits no such dynamics when requiring symmetry-preservation. We illustrate these findings by example of interacting discrete particles, including how dynamics can be described “relative to one of the subystems.”},

We show that winning strategies in the various quantum models for the game is an analog of the notion of non-commutative graph homomorphisms due to Stahlke [IEEE Trans. Inf.

Next, we investigate the continuity of the set of thermal operations in certain parameters, such as energies of the system and temperature of the bath. We will see that the set of thermal operations changes discontinuously with respect to the Hausdorff metric at any Hamiltonian, which has the so-called degenerate Bohr spectrum, regardless of the temperature. Finally, we find a semigroup representation of (enhanced) thermal operations in two dimensions by characterizing any such operation via three real parameters, thus allowing for a visualization of this set. Using this, in the qubit case, we show commutativity of (enhanced) thermal operations and convexity of thermal operations without the closure.

  abstract     = {Stabilizer operations (SO) occupy a prominent role in fault-tolerant quantum computing. They are defined operationally by the use of Clifford gates, Pauli measurements, and classical control. These operations can be efficiently simulated on a classical computer, a result which is known as the Gottesman–Knill theorem. However, an additional supply of magic states is enough to promote them to a universal, fault-tolerant model for quantum computing. To quantify the needed resources in terms of magic states, a resource theory of magic has been developed. SO are considered free within this theory; however, they are not the most general class of free operations. From an axiomatic point of view, these are the completely stabilizer-preserving (CSP) channels, defined as those that preserve the convex hull of stabilizer states. It has been an open problem to decide whether these two definitions lead to the same class of operations. In this work, we answer this question in the negative, by constructing an explicit counter-example. This indicates that recently proposed stabilizer-based simulation techniques of CSP maps are strictly more powerful than Gottesman–Knill-like methods. The result is analogous to a well-known fact in entanglement theory, namely, that there is a gap between the operationally defined class of local operations and classical communication and the axiomatically defined class of separable channels.},

Lett. 42 , 1698–1701 (1979)] is a well-known one-dimensional translation-invariant model in condensed matter physics. The model consists of two atoms per unit cell and describes in-cell and out-of-cell electron-hopping between two sub-lattices. It is among the simplest models exhibiting a non-trivial topological phase; to the SSH Hamiltonian, one can associate a winding number, the Zak phase, which depends on the ratio of hopping coefficients and takes on values 0 and 1 labeling the two distinct phases. We display two homotopically equivalent continuum Hamiltonians whose tight binding limits are SSH models with different topological indices. The topological character of the SSH model is, therefore, an emergent rather than fundamental property, associated with emergent chiral or sublattice symmetry in the tight-binding limit. In order to establish that the tight-binding limit of these continuum Hamiltonians is the SSH model, we extend our recent results on the tight-binding approximation [J. Shapiro and M. I. Weinstein, Adv. Math. 403 , 108343 (2022)] to lattices, which depend on the tight-binding asymptotic parameter λ .},

  abstract     = {In this paper, two problems related to FitzHugh–Nagumo lattice systems are analyzed. The first one is concerned with the asymptotic behavior of random delayed FitzHugh–Nagumo lattice systems driven by nonlinear Wong–Zakai noise. We obtain a new result ensuring that such a system approximates the corresponding deterministic system when the correlation time of Wong–Zakai noise goes to infinity rather than to zero. We first prove the existence of tempered random attractors for the random delayed lattice systems with a nonlinear drift function and a nonlinear diffusion term. The pullback asymptotic compactness of solutions is proved thanks to the Ascoli–Arzelà theorem and uniform tail-estimates. We then show the upper semicontinuity of attractors as the correlation time tends to infinity. As for the second problem, we consider the corresponding deterministic version of the previous model and study the convergence of attractors when the delay approaches zero. That is, the upper semicontinuity of attractors for the delayed system to the non-delayed one is proved.},

There are specific difficulties connected with considering such systems. Using the semigroup approach, we discuss here the existence-uniqueness of solutions to the Navier–Stokes–Cahn–Hilliard system, explaining, in particular, the limitation of maximal regularity of the local solutions imposed by the chosen boundary conditions.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we present a notion of the harmonic oscillator on the Heisenberg group H n , which, under a few reasonable assumptions, forms the natural analog of a harmonic oscillator on R n ⁠ : a negative sum of squares of operators on H n , which is essentially self-adjoint on L 2 ( H n ) with purely discrete spectrum and whose eigenvectors are Schwartz functions forming an orthonormal basis of L 2 ( H n ). The differential operator in question is determined by the Dynin–Folland group—a stratified nilpotent Lie group—and its generic unitary irreducible representations, which naturally act on L 2 ( H n ). As in the Euclidean case, our notion of harmonic oscillator on H n extends to a whole class of so-called anharmonic oscillators, which involve left-invariant derivatives and polynomial potentials of order greater or equal 2. These operators, which enjoy similar properties as the harmonic oscillator, are in one-to-one correspondence with positive Rockland operators on the Dynin–Folland group. The latter part of this article is concerned with spectral multipliers. We obtain useful L p - L q -estimates for a large class of spectral multipliers of the sub-Laplacian L H n , 2 and, in fact, of generic Rockland operators on graded groups. As a by-product, we obtain explicit hypoelliptic heat semigroup estimates and recover the continuous Sobolev embeddings on graded groups, provided 1 &lt; p ≤ 2 ≤ q &lt; ∞.},

It should be noted that, when s = 3 2 ⁠ , the existence of suitable weak solutions is not trivial due to the possible lack of compactness.

  abstract     = {This work develops a magnetic pseudodifferential calculus for super operators Op A ( F ); these map operators onto operators (as opposed to L p functions onto L q functions). Here, F could be a tempered distribution or a Hörmander symbol. An important example is Liouville super operators L ̂ = − i o p A ( h ) , ⋅ defined in terms of a magnetic pseudodifferential operator op A ( h ). Our work combines ideas from the magnetic Weyl calculus developed by Măntoiu and Purice [J. Math. Phys. 45 , 1394–1417 (2004)]; Iftimie, Măntoiu, and Purice [Publ. Res. Inst. Math.

Thus, our calculus is inherently gauge-covariant, which means that all essential properties of Op A ( F ) are determined by properties of the magnetic field B = d A rather than the vector potential A . There are conceptual differences to ordinary pseudodifferential theory. For example, in addition to an analog of the (magnetic) Weyl product that emulates the composition of two magnetic pseudodifferential super operators on the level of functions, the so-called semi-super product describes the action of a pseudodifferential super operator on a pseudodifferential operator.},

We apply this method to the non-Abelian two-dimensional Toda lattice. It is shown that already the stationary equation of the simplest higher flow gives a non-trivial non-autonomous constraint that reduces the Toda lattice to a non-Abelian analog of pumped Maxwell–Bloch equations. The Toda lattice itself is interpreted as an auto-Bäcklund transformation acting on the solutions of this system. Further self-similar reduction leads to non-Abelian analogs of the Painlevé III equation.},

Some explicit formulas are derived for those changes by introducing certain fundamental linear integral equations for the corresponding unperturbed and perturbed linear systems. This generalized method is applicable in a unified manner on a wide class of linear systems. This is in contrast to the standard method for a Darboux transformation, which is specific to the particular linear system on which it applies. A comparison is provided in some special cases between this generalized method and the standard method for the Darboux transformation. In particular, when a bound state is added to the discrete spectrum, some Darboux transformation formulas are presented for the full-line Schrödinger equation, where those formulas resemble the Darboux transformation formulas for the half-line Schrödinger equation.

  abstract     = {We analyze a two-body non-Hermitian two-site Sachdev–Ye–Kitaev (SYK) model with the couplings of one site complex conjugated to the other site. This model, with no explicit coupling between the sites, shows an infinite number of second-order phase transitions, which is a consequence of the factorization of the partition function into a product over Matsubara frequencies. We calculate the quenched free energy in two different ways: first in terms of the single-particle energies and second by solving the Schwinger–Dyson equations of the two-site model. The first calculation can be done entirely in terms of a one-site model. The conjugate replica enters due to non-analyticities when Matsubara frequencies enter the spectral support of the coupling matrix. The second calculation is based on the replica trick of the two-site partition function. Both methods give the same result. The free-fermion partition function can also be rephrased as a matrix model for the coupling matrix. Up to minor details, this model is the random matrix model that describes the chiral phase transition of QCD, and the order parameter of the two-body model corresponds to the chiral condensate of QCD. Comparing to the corresponding four-body model, we are able to determine which features of the free energy are due to the chaotic nature of the four-body model. The high-temperature phase of both models is entropy dominated, and in both cases, the free energy is determined by the spectral density. The chaotic four-body SYK model has a low-temperature phase whose free energy is almost temperature-independent, signaling an effective gap of the theory even though the actual spectrum does not exhibit a gap. On the other hand, the low-temperature free energy of the two-body SYK model is not flat; in fact, it oscillates to arbitrarily low temperature. This indicates a less desirable feature that the entropy of the two-body model is not always positive in the low-temperature phase, which most likely is a consequence of the non-hermiticity.},

In contrast to the well-known symmetric exclusion process, the number of particles at each site is unbounded. We show that a finite chain of N sites connected at its ends to two reservoirs can be solved exactly, i.e., the factorial moments of the non-equilibrium steady-state can be written in the closed form for each N . The solution relies on probabilistic arguments and techniques inspired by integrable systems. It is obtained in two steps: (i) the introduction of a dual absorbing process reducing the problem to a finite number of particles and (ii) the solution of the dual dynamics exploiting a symmetry obtained from the quantum inverse scattering method. Long-range correlations are computed in the finite-volume system. The exact solution allows us to prove by a direct computation that, in the thermodynamic limit, the system approaches local equilibrium. A by-product of the solution is the algebraic construction of a direct mapping between the non-equilibrium steady state and the equilibrium reversible measure.},

In such coordinates, the invariant metric of the Dubrovin–Frobenius manifold takes a special form, which is the starting point of our construction. We give a complete classification in the case where the Jordan canonical form of the operator of multiplication by the Euler vector field has a single Jordan block, and we reduce the classification problem to a third-order ordinary differential equation and to a system of third-order PDEs in the remaining three-dimensional and four-dimensional cases. In all the cases, we provide explicit examples of Dubrovin–Frobenius potentials.},

The probabilistic study of K n was motivated by important questions in quantum information theory and allowed us to provide the smallest known dimension for the dimension of an ancilla space, allowing for Minimum Output Entropy (MOE) violation. With our estimates, we are able, as an application, to provide actual bounds for the dimension of spaces where the violation of MOE occurs.},

In this paper, we provide tight inequalities to describe the structure of quantum coupling. These inequalities directly imply that the trace distance between two quantum states cannot be determined by the quantum analog of the earth mover’s distance, thus ruling out the equality version of the quantum Kantorovich–Rubinstein theorem for trace distance even in the finite-dimensional case. In addition, we provide an inequality that can be regarded as a quantum generalization of the Kantorovich–Rubinstein theorem. Then, we generalize our inequalities and apply them to the three tripartite quantum marginal problems. Numerical tests with a three-qubit system show that our criteria are much stronger than the known criteria: the strong subadditivity of entropy and the monogamy of entanglement.},

  abstract     = {We address in this work the problem of minimizing quantum entropies under local constraints. We suppose that macroscopic quantities, such as the particle density, current, and kinetic energy, are fixed at each point of R d and look for a density operator over L 2 ( R d ) ⁠ , minimizing an entropy functional. Such minimizers are referred to as local Gibbs states. This setting is in contrast with the classical problem of prescribing global constraints, where the total number of particles, total current, and total energy in the system are fixed. The question arises, for instance, in the derivation of fluid models from quantum dynamics. We prove, under fairly general conditions, that the entropy admits a unique constrained minimizer. Due to a lack of compactness, the main difficulty in the proof is to show that limits of minimizing sequences satisfy the local energy constraint. We tackle this issue by introducing a simpler auxiliary minimization problem and by using a monotonicity argument involving the entropy.},

The eigenvalues of energy are calculated, and the result derived by us algebraically agrees with the known energy eigenvalues calculated by using classical analytical methods.

To do so, we make use of the Clifford group that arises in quantum information theory. We consider translation invariant Clifford group transformations that can be described by matrix product operators (MPOs). We classify translation invariant Clifford group transformations that consist of a shift operator and an MPO of bond dimension two—this includes transformations that preserve locality of all Hamiltonians and those that lead to non-local images of particular operators but, nevertheless, preserve locality of certain Hamiltonians. We characterize translation invariant Clifford group transformations that take single-site Pauli operators to local operators on at most five sites—examples of Quantum Cellular Automata—leading to a discrete family of Hamiltonians that are equivalent to the canonical XXZ model under such transformations. For spin chains solvable by the algebraic Bethe ansatz, we explain how conjugating by an MPO affects the underlying integrable structure. This allows us to relate our results to the usual classifications of integrable Hamiltonians. We also treat the case of spin chains solvable by free fermions.},

In this paper, we focus on the stability problem for two-dimensional Boussinesq equations with only vertical viscosity and horizontal thermal diffusion near a stratified, hydrostatic equilibrium in the domain Ω = T × R ⁠ , where T = [ − 1 2 , 1 2 ] is a 1 D periodic box. We are mainly concerned with the H 2 -stability of global solutions when the initial data are closed to an equilibrium state and sufficiently small. Due to the lack of horizontal viscosity in velocity equations and vertical thermal diffusion in temperature equation, this problem seems to be not trivial and becomes particularly difficult. In order to achieve our main goal, we divide the velocity field and temperature into two parts: the horizontal average and the remaining oscillation part. Besides, we fully exploit the L t 2 L x 2 -norm of ∂ x u 2 to help us dominate the nonlinear parts. Our result shows that with a small initial perturbation, there exists a unique global solution to the stated Boussinesq equations. In addition, the perturbation remains small for all time. In particular, our result also demonstrates the stabilizing effect of internal gravity waves, which are induced by the stratified background hydrostatic state.},

  abstract     = {Motivated by current interest in understanding statistical properties of random landscapes in high-dimensional spaces, we consider a model of the landscape in R N obtained by superimposing M &gt; N plane waves of random wavevectors and amplitudes and further restricted by a uniform parabolic confinement in all directions. For this landscape, we show how to compute the “annealed complexity,” controlling the asymptotic growth rate of the mean number of stationary points as N → ∞ at fixed ratio α = M / N &gt; 1. The framework of this computation requires us to study spectral properties of N × N matrices W = KTK T , where T is a diagonal matrix with M mean zero independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) real normally distributed entries, and all MN entries of K are also i.i.d. real normal random variables. We suggest to call the latter Gaussian Marchenko–Pastur ensemble as such matrices appeared in the seminal 1967 paper by those authors. We compute the associated mean spectral density and evaluate some moments and correlation functions involving products of characteristic polynomials for such matrices.},

  abstract     = {We derive the vorticity equation for an incompressible fluid on a two-dimensional surface with an arbitrary topology, embedded in three-dimensional Euclidean space and arising from a first integral of the flow, by using a tailored Clebsch parameterization of the velocity field. In the inviscid limit, we identify conserved surface energy and enstrophy and obtain the corresponding noncanonical Hamiltonian structure. We then discuss the formulation of the diffusion operator on the surface by examining two alternatives. In the first case, we follow the standard approach for Navier–Stokes equations on a Riemannian manifold and calculate the diffusion operator by requiring that flows corresponding to Killing fields of the Riemannian metric are not subject to dissipation. For an embedded surface, this leads to a diffusion operator, including derivatives of the stream function across the surface. In the second case, using an analogy with the Poisson equation for the Newtonian gravitational potential in general relativity, we construct a diffusion operator taking into account the Ricci scalar curvature of the surface. The resulting vorticity equation is two-dimensional, and the corresponding diffusive equilibria minimize dissipation under the constraint of curvature energy.},

We study these effects employing the relativistic Hamiltonian formalism under the assumption of stationarity and axisymmetry. The necessary and sufficient conditions on the metric and on the plasma frequency are formulated such that the rays can be analytically determined from a fully separated Hamilton–Jacobi equation. We demonstrate how these results allow us to analytically calculate the photon region and the shadow if they exist. Several specific examples are discussed in detail: the “hairy” Kerr black holes, the Hartle–Thorne spacetime metrics, the Melvin universe, and the Teo rotating traversable wormhole. In all of these cases, a plasma medium is present as well.},

This approach leads to the concept of intertwining , defined through the resulting quadratic Hamiltonians of bosons and, separately, of fermions with coefficients given in terms of the same coefficients of Π. Intertwining is invariant under transformations of Π, which leave certain binary forms of the coefficients of Π in the Hamiltonian unchanged. Alternatively, the coefficients can be interpreted as simultaneous time-dependent (super-) control parameters for both spin-statistics. Time-dependent inhomogeneous linear supercanonical transformations of wave vectors leave invariant the Heisenberg superalgebra n ( m ′ / n ′ ) and belong to the semidirect product Osp( m ′/ n ′) ⋉ N e ( n ′ + 1) of the orthosymplectic supergroup with the even Heisenberg group. The unitary time evolution operator is constructed using the adjoint map in canonical coordinates determined by the supercanonical transformation. The method is a generalization of an Inönu–Wigner contraction procedure and a Wei–Norman method for superalgebras with a selection of subalgebras associated with the root space decomposition of the Lie superalgebra. Analogously, this is a separation of variables method for quantum mechanical problems in systems with bosons and fermions. The standard Floquet theory leads to new results concerning stability for locally periodic coefficients. The lowest dimensional cases are explicitly computed. The intertwining of boson and fermions systems and the Hamiltonians considered here are of interest in quantum control theory for systems including fermions and bosons, in quantum optics, and quantum computation.},

Let G be a compact quantum group, and let T ≔ R e p ( G ) be the rigid C *-tensor category of finite-dimensional continuous unitary representations of G . Let M o d ( T ) be the rigid C *-2-category of cofinite semisimple finitely decomposable T -module categories. We show that finite-dimensional G - C *-algebras can be identified with equivalence classes of 1-morphisms out of the object T in M o d ( T ) ⁠ . For 1-morphisms X : T → M 1 ⁠ , Y : T → M 2 ⁠ , we show that covariant completely positive maps between the corresponding G - C *-algebras can be “dilated” to isometries τ : X → Y ⊗ E , where E : M 2 → M 1 is some “environment” 1-morphism. Dilations are unique up to partial isometry on the environment; in particular, the dilation minimizing the quantum dimension of the environment is unique up to a unitary. When G is a compact group, this recovers previous covariant Stinespring-type theorems.},

For any λ ∈ k , we construct a differential graded Lie algebra whose Maurer–Cartan elements are given by λ -weighted relative Rota–Baxter operators. Using such characterization, we define the cohomology of a λ -weighted relative Rota-Baxter operator T and interpret this as the Hochschild cohomology of a suitable algebra with coefficients in an appropriate bimodule. We study linear, formal, and finite order deformations of T from cohomological points of view. Among others, we introduce Nijenhuis elements that generate trivial linear deformations and define a second cohomology class to any finite order deformation, which is the obstruction to extend the deformation. In the end, we also consider the cohomology of λ -weighted relative Rota–Baxter operators in the Lie case and find a connection with the case of associative algebras.},

Compared to the physical nature of the bodies, the coating layers are thin and anisotropic, and their thermal conductivity is small. To resolve the issue caused by multiscale in the scenario, the asymptotic behavior of the Dirichlet problem for the heat equation is studied and effective boundary conditions (boundary conditions satisfied by the limiting function on the boundary of the isotropically body) are derived [Li et al. , Proc. Am. Math. Soc. 137 , 1711–1721 (2009)] as the thickness of the coating layer shrinks. It is shown that the convergence holds in any fixed finite time interval. This paper is devoted to finding the maximal time interval (called lifespan ) in which the uniform convergence still holds when the effective boundary condition is of the Dirichlet or Robin type. In particular, we show that the lifespan is, indeed, infinite, provided that the source term itself or the source term minus a time-independent function is square integrable over the half space.

  abstract     = {This paper considers the two species cancer invasion haptotaxis model without cell proliferation in three space dimensions. The system consists of two parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs) describing the migration of differentiated cancer cells and cancer stem cells and the epithelial–mesenchymal transition between the two families of cells, a parabolic/elliptic PDE governing the evolution of matrix degrading enzymes , and an ordinary differential equation reflecting the degradation and remodeling of the extracellular matrix . We underline that the absence of a logistic source aggravates mathematical difficulties that are overcome by constructing a delicate energy-functional. For any suitably regular initial data, we establish the global existence of weak solutions to the associated initial-boundary value problem. This result affirmatively answers the open question proposed by Dai and Liu [SIAM J. Math. Anal. 54 , 1–35 (2022)].},

That work studied the maximal classical development of smooth initial data. The present review article is a presentation of my 2019 work, which addresses the problem of the physical continuation of the solution past the point of shock formation. The problem requires the construction of a hypersurface, the shock hypersurface, originating from a given singular spacelike surface, which is acoustically spacelike as viewed from its past, and the construction of a new solution in the future of the union of a given regular null hypersurface with the shock hypersurface, a solution which extends continuously the prior maximal classical solution across the given regular null hypersurface, but which displays discontinuities in physical variables across the shock hypersurface in accordance with the mass, momentum, and energy conservation laws. Moreover, the shock hypersurface is to be acoustically timelike as viewed from its future. Mathematically, this is a free boundary problem, with nonlinear conditions at the free boundary, for a first order quasilinear hyperbolic system of PDE, with characteristic initial data, which are singular at the past boundary of the initial null hypersurface, that boundary being the singular surface of origin. My 2019 work solved a restricted form of the problem through the introduction of new geometric and analytic methods. This Review is focused on the presentation of these methods.},

Furthermore, there is a state space of distributional 1-forms S to which gauge equivalence approximately extends and such that the renormalized stochastic Yang–Mills heat flow projects to a Markov process on the quotient space of gauge orbits S / ∼ ⁠ .

We show that this limit exists, under appropriate scaling of the O–U parameters, and is expressed as the solution of a variational problem. The asymptotic growth rate is equal to the thermodynamical pressure of a one-dimensional lattice gas with attractive exponential potentials. For Z t , a stationary O–U process of the lattice gas coincides with a model considered previously by Kac and Helfand. We derive upper and lower bounds on λ . In the large mean-reversion limit γnτ ≫ 1, the two bounds converge and the growth rate is given by a lattice version of the van der Waals equation of state.

The corresponding potential that depends on the mean flow profile can then be approximated by a quartic polynomial, leading to a triconfluent Heun equation whose solution based on the triconfluent Heun functions is generally known. The quality of this approximation procedure is presented for the case of symmetric polynomial flow profiles for various values of polynomial order and the Mach number.

Important examples include the Manev potential ( a = 1, b = 2) and the Schwarzschild potential ( a = 1, b = 3). It is well known that power two serves as a threshold value for the homogeneous potential: One is able to observe significant differences regarding the solution dynamics as the power of the homogeneous potential exceeds two from below. This phenomenon remains observable for quasi-homogeneous potentials. In this paper, we shall provide a complete characterization of the whole phase space of the quasi-homogeneous two-body problem in terms of global existence and singularity for all the possible b &gt; a &gt; 0. In particular, one is able to generalize the result of the Manev and Schwarzschild two-body problem to all the quasi-homogeneous potentials. Two techniques are presented in this paper: One is the variational method based on the energy, and the other is a direct computation of collision time based on the integrability of two-body systems.},

To overcome obstacles in applying the Kolmogorov–Arnold–Moser (KAM) method due to the finite smoothness of V , especially when α is not an integer and to obtain a sharp estimate of the localization rate of the quasi-periodic breathers, the proof of our result uses the Jackson–Moser–Zehnder analytic approximation technique but with refined estimates on error bounds, depending on the smoothness and dimension, which provide crucial controls on the convergence of KAM iterations.},

This rule admits various modifications, which lead to 48 different inflation rules, known as the direct product variations. They all result in tilings that are measure-theoretically isomorphic by the Halmos–von Neumann theorem. They can be described as cut and project sets with characteristic windows in a two-dimensional Euclidean internal space. Here, we analyze and classify them further, in particular, with respect to topological conjugacy.},

  abstract     = {We present sufficient frameworks for the uniform-in-time nonrelativistic limits for the relativistic Cucker–Smale (RCS) model and the relativistic kinetic Cucker–Smale (RKCS) equation. For the RCS model, one can easily show that the difference between the solutions to the RCS model and the CS model can be bounded by a quantity proportional to the exponential of time and inversely proportional to some power of the speed of light via a standard Grönwall-type differential inequality. However, this finite-in-time nonrelativistic limit result cannot be used in a uniform-in-time estimate due to the exponential factor of lifespan of solution as it is. For the uniform-in-time nonrelativistic limit, we split the deviation functional between the relativistic solution and the nonrelativistic solution into two parts (finite-time interval and infinite-time interval). In the finite-time interval, the deviation functional is bounded by a finite-in-time nonrelativistic limit result, and then, after a finite time, we use asymptotic flocking estimates with the same asymptotic momentum-like quantity for the RCS model and the CS model to show that the deviation functional can be made as small as possible. In this manner, we can derive a uniform-in-time nonrelativistic limit for the RCS model. For the RKCS equation, we use a uniform-in-time mean-field limit in a measure theoretic framework and a uniform-in-time nonrelativistic limit result for the RCS model to derive a uniform-in-time nonrelativistic limit for the RKCS equation.},

The main objective of this analysis is to understand the effects of non-linearities of this system on the regularity of solutions and polyhomogeneous expansions at null infinity and, in particular, at the critical sets where null infinity touches spatial infinity. The main outcome from our analysis is that the nonlinear interaction makes both fields more singular at the conformal boundary than what is seen when the fields are non-interacting. In particular, we find a whole new class of logarithmic terms in the asymptotic expansions, which depend on the coupling constant between the Maxwell and scalar fields. We analyze the implications of these results on the peeling (or rather lack thereof) of the fields at null infinity.},

This fuzzy Schwarzschild slice is built as a deformation of the noncommutative plane. Quantum time observables are introduced to add a time quantization in the model. We study the structure of the quasi-coherent state of the fuzzy Schwarzschild slice with respect to the quasi-coherent state and the deformation states of the noncommutative plane. The quantum dynamics of a fermion interacting with a fuzzy black hole described by the present model is studied. In particular, we study the decoherence effects appearing in the neighborhood of the fuzzy event horizon. An extension of the model to describe a quantum wormhole is also proposed, where we show that fermions cross the wormhole not by traveling by its internal space but by quantum tunneling, in accordance with the non-traversable character of classical Einstein–Rosen bridges.},

We obtain two classes of solutions written as a finite series of square integrable functions that support a tridiagonal matrix representation of the wave operator. The differential wave equation becomes an algebraic three-term recursion relation for the expansion coefficients of the series, which is solved in terms of finite polynomials in the energy and/or potential parameters. These orthogonal polynomials contain all physical information about the system. The basis elements in configuration space are written in terms of either the Romanovski–Bessel polynomial or the Romanovski–Jacobi polynomial. The maximum degree of both polynomials is limited by the polynomial parameter(s). This makes the size of the basis set finite but sufficient to give a very good approximation of the bound state wavefunctions that improves with an increase in the basis size.},

The corresponding “crossing with the circle” condition, thus, formalizes the process by which loop-like excitations are formed out of string-like ones.

  abstract     = {In the framework of (vector valued) quantized holomorphic functions defined on non-commutative spaces, “quantized Hermitian symmetric spaces,” an obvious problem is to describe (quantum) holomorphically induced representations in terms of some manageable structures. An intimately related problem is to decide what the algebras of quantized differential operators with variable coefficients should be. It is an immediate point that even zeroth order operators, given as multiplications by polynomials, have to be specified as, e.g., left or right multiplication operators since the polynomial algebras are replaced by quadratic, non-commutative algebras. In the settings we are interested in, there are bilinear pairings that allow us to define differential operators as duals of multiplication operators. Indeed, there are different choices of pairings which lead to quite different results. We consider three different pairings while specializing to U q ( s u ( n , n ) ) ⁠ . The pairings are between quantized generalized Verma modules and quantized holomorphically induced modules. It is a natural demand that the corresponding representations can be expressed by (matrix valued) differential operators. We show that a quantum Weyl algebra W e y l q ( n , n ) introduced by Hayashi [Commun. Math. Phys. 127 (1), 129–144 (1990)] plays a fundamental role. In fact, for one pairing, the algebra of differential operators, though inherently depending on a choice of basis, is precisely matrices over W e y l q ( n , n ) ⁠ . We determine explicitly the form of the (quantum) holomorphically induced representations and determine, for the different pairings, if they can be expressed by differential operators.},

  abstract     = {We consider the problem of finding orthogonal projections P of a rank r that gives rise to representations of the Hecke algebra H N ( q ) in which the generators of the algebra act locally on the N th tensor power of the space C n ⁠ . It is shown that such projections are global minima of a certain functional. It is also shown that a characteristic property of such projections is that a certain positive definite matrix A has only two eigenvalues or only one eigenvalue if P gives rise to a representation of the Temperley–Lieb algebra. Apart from the parameters n , r , and Q = q + q −1 , an additional parameter k proves to be a useful characteristic of a projection P . In particular, we use it to provide a lower bound for Q when the values of n and r are fixed and we show that k = rn if and only if P is of the Temperley–Lieb type. In addition, we propose an approach to constructing projections P and give some novel examples for n = 3.},

  abstract     = {In this Review, we review some recent rigorous results on large N problems in quantum field theory, stochastic quantization, and singular stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) and their mean field limit problems. In particular, we discuss the O ( N ) linear sigma model on a two- and three-dimensional torus. The stochastic quantization procedure leads to a coupled system of N interacting Φ 4 equations. In d = 2, we show uniformity in N bounds for the dynamics and convergence to a mean-field singular SPDE. For large enough mass or small enough coupling, the invariant measures [i.e., the O ( N ) linear sigma model] converge to the massive Gaussian free field, the unique invariant measure of the mean-field dynamics, in a Wasserstein distance. We also obtain tightness for certain O ( N ) invariant observables as random fields in suitable Besov spaces as N → ∞ , along with exact descriptions of the limiting correlations. In d = 3, the estimates become more involved since the equation is more singular. We discuss in this case how to prove convergence to the massive Gaussian free field. The proofs of these results build on the recent progress of singular SPDE theory and combine many new techniques, such as uniformity in N estimates and dynamical mean field theory. These are based on joint papers with Scott Smith, Rongchan Zhu, and Xiangchan Zhu.},

Our goal is to prove that the spectral gap above the ground-state energy of such Hamiltonians persists for sufficiently small values of | t |, independently of the size of the lattice. New ideas and concepts are necessary to extend our method to systems in dimension d &gt; 1: As in our earlier work, a sequence of local block-diagonalization steps based on judiciously chosen unitary conjugations of the original Hamiltonian is introduced. The supports of effective interaction potentials generated in the course of these block-diagonalization steps can be identified with what we call minimal rectangles contained in the lattice, a concept that serves to tackle combinatorial problems that arise in the course of iterating the block-diagonalization steps. For a given minimal rectangle, control of the effective interaction potentials generated in each block-diagonalization step with support in the given rectangle is achieved by exploiting a variety of rather subtle mechanisms, which include, for example, the use of weighted sums of paths consisting of overlapping rectangles and of large denominators , expressed in terms of sums of orthogonal projections, which serve to control analogous sums of projections in the numerators resulting from the unitary conjugations of the interaction potential terms involved in the local block-diagonalization step.},

We derive a second-order differential equation for an extended partition function z [ β , β ′, J ] that describes a transformation from a “parent” partition function z [0, β ′, J ] (or anti-commutativity graph) to a “child” partition function z [ β , 0, J ] (or anti-commutativity graph). The procedure can be iterated, and then one forms a pseudo-forest of duality transformations between quantum systems, i.e., a directed graph in which every vertex (or quantum system) has at most one incoming edge (from its parent system). The pseudo-forest has a single tree connected to a constant partition function, many pseudo-trees connected to self-dual systems, and all other pseudo-trees connected to closed cycles of transformations between mutually dual systems.

Cognitive psychologists developed experimental paradigms involving randomly collected lists of items that make possible quantitative measures of performance in memory tasks, such as recall and recognition. Here, we describe a set of mathematical models designed to predict the results of these experiments.

This method provides a precise control on the exponential moments of the empirical measure, from which the fluctuating Boltzmann equation and large deviation estimates have been deduced. The cluster expansion originally devised by the authors was implemented at the level of the Bogoliubov–Born–Green–Kirkwood–Yvon hierarchy, which is a standard tool to investigate the deterministic dynamics. In this paper, we introduce an alternative approach in which the cluster expansion is applied directly on real trajectories of the particle system. This offers a fresh perspective on the study of the hard sphere dynamics in the low density limit, allowing us to recover the results previously obtained by the authors and also to describe the actual clustering of particle trajectories.},

The whole real line is divided into three intervals of the parameter to discuss the dynamics. The existence of chaos is first established in the sense of the exponential growth of total variation when the parameter locates in the central interval, which allows it to be positive, negative, or zero. By analyzing the chaotic dynamics of the piecewise continuous map induced by the hyperbolic PDE, such a PDE is further rigorously proved to be chaos in the interval of the positive parameter that is to the right of the central interval. Finally, the asymptotic behaviors of the hyperbolic PDE are systematically presented in the rest of the whole real line; more precisely, the hyperbolic PDE is either globally stable or unbounded.},

  abstract     = {Quantum devices are subject to natural decay. We propose to study these decay processes as the Markovian evolution of quantum channels, which leads us to dynamical semigroups of superchannels. A superchannel is a linear map that maps quantum channels to quantum channels while satisfying suitable consistency relations. If the input and output quantum channels act on the same space, then we can consider dynamical semigroups of superchannels. No useful constructive characterization of the generators of such semigroups is known. We characterize these generators in two ways: First, we give an efficiently checkable criterion for whether a given map generates a dynamical semigroup of superchannels. Second, we identify a normal form for the generators of semigroups of quantum superchannels, analogous to the Gorini-Kossakowski-Lindblad-Sudarshan form in the case of quantum channels. To derive the normal form, we exploit the relation between superchannels and semicausal completely positive maps, reducing the problem to finding a normal form for the generators of semigroups of semicausal completely positive maps. We derive a normal for these generators using a novel technique, which applies also to infinite-dimensional systems. Our work paves the way for a thorough investigation of semigroups of superchannels: Numerical studies become feasible because admissible generators can now be explicitly generated and checked. Analytic properties of the corresponding evolution equations are now accessible via our normal form.},

The geodesic connecting two points on P is a weighted matrix geometric mean, and its tangent vector is the relative operator entropy. It is a natural idea to use the relative operator entropy to describe the difference between two points on P ⁠ . The quantum version of the classical results of Rényi divergence does not always hold due to its non-commutativity. Due to this difficulty, we use the upper bound and the lower one of the spectrum of positive definite matrices to estimate the order relation between quantum divergences, which is called the Mond Pečarić method in operator theory. In this paper, we show fundamental properties of the ♮ α -Rényi divergence of real order α ∈ R ⁠ , including monotonicity of order, the relation of max- and min-divergence, data processing inequality, bound estimates, and convexity. We also estimate the difference without the α – z -Rényi divergence and ♮ α -Rényi divergence in terms of the generalized Kantorovich constant and the Specht ratio.},

In addition, using the evolution operator formalism, we construct linear and quadratic quantum dynamical invariants that provide connection of the present results with those obtained via the Malkin–Man’ko–Trifonov and the Lewis–Riesenfeld approaches.

J. Theor. Phys. 37 , 2669 (1998)]. Here, we broaden this perspective considerably (partly drawing on existing, but scattered results) and show that apart from the Kochen–Specker theorem, Wigner’s theorem, Gleason’s theorem, and Bell’s theorem also relate fundamentally to contextuality. We provide reformulations of the theorems using the language of presheaves over contexts and give general versions valid for von Neumann algebras. This shows that a very substantial part of the structure of quantum theory is encoded by contextuality.},

  abstract     = {We review some recent results from the mathematical theory of transport of charge and spin in gapped crystalline quantum systems. The emphasis will be on transport coefficients, such as conductivities and conductances. As for the former, those are computed as appropriate expectations of current operators in a non-equilibrium almost-stationary state (NEASS), which arises from the perturbation of an equilibrium state by an external electric field. While for charge transport the usual double-commutator Kubo formula is recovered (also beyond linear response), we obtain formulas for appropriately defined spin conductivities, which are still explicit but more involved. Certain “Kubo-like” terms in these formulas are also shown to agree with the corresponding contributions to the spin conductance. In addition to that, we employ similar techniques to show a new result, namely that even in systems with non-conserved spin, there is no generation of spin torque, that is, the spin torque operator has an expectation in the NEASS which vanishes faster than any power of the intensity of the perturbing field.},

Using those analytic results, we obtain the energy quantization and Uhlenbeck compactness for the moduli space of inhomogeneous Yang–Mills connections that have a uniformly L n 2 -bounded curvature.

Based on a free probability argument, it was claimed in those papers that, in the limit of infinite width (matrix size), the singular value distribution of the Jacobian coincides with that of the analog of the Jacobian with special random but weight independent diagonal matrices, the case well known in random matrix theory. In this paper, we justify the claim for random Haar distributed weight matrices and Gaussian biases. This, in particular, justifies the validity of the mean field approximation in the infinite width limit for the deep untrained neural networks and extends the macroscopic universality of random matrix theory to this new class of random matrices.},

Based on the ladder operator approach, two auxiliary quantities are defined. We show that the auxiliary quantities and the recurrence coefficients satisfy some equations with the aid of three compatibility conditions, which will be used to derive the Riccati equations and Painlevé III. We show that the Hankel determinant has an integral representation involving a particular σ -form of Painlevé III and to calculate the asymptotics of the Hankel determinant under a suitable double scaling, i.e., n → ∞ and t → 0 such that s = (2 n + 1 + λ ) t is fixed, where λ is a parameter with λ ≔ ( α ∓ 1)/2. The asymptotic behaviors of the Hankel determinant for large s and small s are obtained, and Dyson’s constant is recovered here. They have generalized the results in the literature [Min et al. , Nucl. Phys. B 936 , 169–188 (2018)] where α = 0. By combining the Coulomb fluid method with the orthogonality principle, we obtain the asymptotic expansions of the recurrence coefficients, which are applied to derive the relationship between second order differential equations satisfied by our monic orthogonal polynomials and the double-confluent Heun equations as well as to calculate the smallest eigenvalue of the large Hankel matrices generated by the above weight. In particular, when α = t = 0, the asymptotic behavior of the smallest eigenvalue for the classical Gaussian weight exp(− z 2 ) [Szegö, Trans. Am. Math. Soc. 40 , 450–461 (1936)] is recovered.},

Furthermore, the first-order chemical reaction is also accounted. Adequate transformation is used to get the ordinary differential system tackled through a local non-similar technique via the built-in Matlab function bvp4c. Prominent characteristics of flow parameters on the entropy rate, temperature, velocity, and concentration are studied. Thermal and solutal transport rates are studied. Reverse impacts for velocity and temperature are noted for the Reiner–Philippoff liquid parameter. Reduction in velocity is seen for the Bingham number. A larger Prandtl number reduces temperature distribution. Concentration is decreased for both the Lewis number and chemical reaction parameter. A reverse trend is observed for the entropy rate against Brinkman and Bingham numbers. A larger magnetic variable enhances entropy generation.},

The component interacts with two neighbors: if its neighbors are in an equal state, then the component assumes the same state as its neighbors. If its neighbors are in different states, the following can happen: a one on the right-hand side of a zero, in which case the component becomes one with probability α or zero with probability 1 − α , and conversely, a zero on the right-hand side of a one, in which case the component becomes one with probability β or zero with probability 1 − β . For a set of initial distributions when both neighbors are placed on the right-hand side (respectively, both on the left-hand side) of a component, we prove that the process always converges weakly to the measure concentrated on the configuration where all the components are zeros. When one neighbor is placed on the left-hand side and the other is on the right-hand side, the same convergence happens when β 1/2 α . Thus, in this case, we get the regimes of ergodicity and non-ergodicity. Moreover, we exhibit another type of phase transition, independent of neighbors’ locations.

We prove that in the two-cut region, the endpoints of the cuts are analytic functions of the real and imaginary parts of the parameter t , but not of the parameter t itself (so that the Cauchy–Riemann equations are violated for the endpoints). We also obtain the semiclassical asymptotics of the orthogonal polynomials associated with the ensemble of random matrices and their recurrence coefficients. The proofs are based on the Riemann–Hilbert approach to semiclassical asymptotics of the orthogonal polynomials and the theory of S -curves and quadratic differentials.},

We consider the electric field transverse to the heat flux as well as the electric field parallel to the heat flux; in the latter case, we consider a superlattice composed of alternating layers with defects and without defects. For transverse electric fields, the effective thermal conductivity is increased in bulk systems and decreased in nanosystems.

The background vorticity consists of two terms: first, a term exponentially related to the stream function and a second term arising from the curvature of the torus, which leads to a Liouville-type equation for the stream function. By using a stereographic projection of the torus onto an annulus in a complex plane, the Liouville-type equation admits a class of exact solutions, given in terms of a loxodromic function on the annulus. We show that appropriate choices of the loxodromic function in the solution lead to stationary vortex patterns with 4 n ̂ point vortices of identical strengths, n ̂ ∈ N ⁠ . The quantized point vortices are stationary in the sense that they are equilibria of a “one-way interaction” model where the evolution of point vortices is subject to the continuous background vorticity, while the background vorticity distribution is not affected by the velocity field induced by the point vortices. By choosing loxodromic functions continuously dependent on a parameter and taking appropriate limits with respect to this parameter, we show that there are solutions with inhomogeneous point vortex strengths, in which the exponential part of the background vorticity disappears. The point vortices are always located at the innermost and outermost rings of the torus owing to the curvature effects. The topological features of the streamlines are found to change as the modulus of the torus changes.},

  abstract     = {Multicavity Klystron (MCK) is a high power microwave vacuum electronic device used to amplify radio frequency (RF) signals. MCKs have numerous applications, including radar, radio navigation, space communication, television, radio repeaters, and charged particle accelerators. The microwave-generating interactions in klystrons take place mostly in coupled resonant cavities positioned periodically along the electron beam axis. Importantly, there is no electromagnetic coupling between cavities. The cavities are coupled only by the flow of bunched electrons drifting from one cavity to the next. We advance here a Lagrangian field theory of MCKs with the space being represented by a one-dimensional continuum. The theory integrates into it the space-charge effects, including the so-called debunching (electron-to-electron repulsion). The corresponding Euler–Lagrange equations are ordinary differential equations with coefficients varying periodically in the space. Utilizing the system periodicity, we develop the instrumental features of the Floquet theory, including the monodromy matrix and its Floquet multipliers. We use them to derive closed form expressions for a number of physically significant quantities.

  abstract     = {The Golden–Thompson trace inequality, which states that Tr e H + K ≤ Tr e H e K , has proved to be very useful in quantum statistical mechanics. Golden used it to show that the classical free energy is less than the quantum one. Here, we make this G–T inequality more explicit by proving that for some operators, notably the operators of interest in quantum mechanics, H = Δ or H = − − Δ + m and K = potential, Tr e H +(1− u ) K e uK is a monotone increasing function of the parameter u for 0 ≤ u ≤ 1. Our proof utilizes an inequality of Ando, Hiai, and Okubo (AHO): Tr X s Y t X 1− s Y 1− t ≤ Tr XY for positive operators X , Y and for 1 2 ≤ s , t ≤ 1 ⁠ , and s + t ≤ 3 2 ⁠ . The obvious conjecture that this inequality should hold up to s + t ≤ 1 was proved false by Plevnik [Indian J. Pure Appl. Math. 47 , 491–500 (2016)]. We give a different proof of AHO and also give more counterexamples in the 3 2 , 1 range. More importantly, we show that the inequality conjectured in AHO does indeed hold in the full range if X , Y have a certain positivity property—one that does hold for quantum mechanical operators, thus enabling us to prove our G–T monotonicity theorem.},

  abstract     = {The theory of quantum jump trajectories provides a new framework for understanding dynamical phase transitions in open systems. A candidate for such transitions is the atom maser, which for certain parameters exhibits strong intermittency in the atom detection counts and has a bistable stationary state. Although previous numerical results suggested that the “free energy” may not be a smooth function, we show that the atom detection counts satisfy a large deviations principle and, therefore, we deal with a phase crossover rather than a genuine phase transition. We argue, however, that the latter occurs in the limit of an infinite pumping rate. As a corollary, we obtain the central limit theorem for the counting process. The proof relies on the analysis of a certain deformed generator whose spectral bound is the limiting cumulant generating function. The latter is shown to be smooth so that a large deviations principle holds by the Gärtner–Ellis theorem. One of the main ingredients is the Krein–Rutman theory, which extends the Perron–Frobenius theorem to a general class of positive compact semigroups.},

In the present article, we review recent results on the maximal noise robustness of incompatible measurements, which have been obtained by the present authors using free spectrahedra, and rederive them using tensor norms. In this way, we make them accessible to a broader audience from quantum information theory and mathematical physics and contribute to the fruitful interactions between Banach space theory and quantum information theory. We also describe incompatibility witnesses using the tensor norm and matrix convex set duality, emphasizing the relation between the different notions of witnesses.},

If the Hamiltonian of the particles is quadratic in position- and momentum operators, as in the examples of a freely moving particle or a particle in a homogeneous external magnetic field, we show how symmetries, such as spherical symmetry, of the initial state of a particle are broken by tracks consisting of infinitely many approximately measured particle positions and how, in the classical limit, the initial position and velocity of a classical particle trajectory can be reconstructed from the observed particle track.},

Previous work has focused on a one-to-one correspondence between symmetric spaces and many but not all of the classical random matrix ensembles. This work shows that we can completely capture all of the classical random matrix ensembles from Cartan’s symmetric spaces through the use of alternative coordinate systems. In the end, we have to let go of the notion of a one-to-one correspondence. We emphasize that the KAK decomposition traditionally favored by mathematicians is merely one coordinate system on the symmetric space, albeit a beautiful one. However, other matrix factorizations, especially the generalized singular value decomposition from numerical linear algebra, reveal themselves to be perfectly valid coordinate systems that one symmetric space can lead to many classical random matrix theories. We establish the connection between this numerical linear algebra viewpoint and the theory of generalized Cartan decompositions. This, in turn, allows us to produce yet more random matrix theories from a single symmetric space. Yet, again, these random matrix theories arise from matrix factorizations, though ones that we are not aware have appeared in the literature.},

Our approach is based on the Lyapunov–Schmidt reduction, which transforms the construction into a problem of seeking critical points for a function related to the kinetic energy. The method in this paper has a wide applicability and can be used to deal with general elliptic equations in divergence form with Heaviside nonlinearity.},

After that, we study the p th moment boundedness, asymptotic pathwise estimation, asymptotic behavior, and global attractivity of the solutions of the stochastic system in turn. Moreover, we establish sufficient criteria for the existence and uniqueness of a stationary distribution of positive solutions of the stochastic system with the help of Lyapunov function methods. It is worth mentioning that we derive the exact expression of the local probability density for the stochastic system by solving the relevant four-dimensional Fokker–Planck equation. We find that the smaller intensity of volatility or the bigger speed of reversion is helpful for preserving the biodiversity of the species.

  abstract     = {In this paper, a dynamical process in a statistical thermodynamic system of spins exhibiting a phase transition is described on a contact manifold, where such a dynamical process is a process that a metastable equilibrium state evolves into the most stable symmetry broken equilibrium state. Metastable and the most stable equilibrium states in the symmetry broken phase or ordered phase are assumed to be described as pruned projections of Legendre submanifolds of contact manifolds, where these pruned projections of the submanifolds express hysteresis and pseudo-free energy curves. Singularities associated with phase transitions are naturally arose in this framework as has been suggested by Legendre singularity theory. Then, a particular contact Hamiltonian vector field is proposed so that a pruned segment of the projected Legendre submanifold is a stable fixed point set in a region of a contact manifold and that another pruned segment is a unstable fixed point set. This contact Hamiltonian vector field is identified with a dynamical process departing from a metastable equilibrium state to the most stable equilibrium one. To show the statements above explicitly, an Ising type spin model with long-range interactions, called the Husimi–Temperley model, is focused, where this model exhibits a phase transition.},

To this end, we make use of Friedrich’s framework of the cylinder at spatial infinity to obtain asymptotic expansions of the Maxwell and spin-2 fields near spatial infinity, which are fully determined in terms of initial data on a Cauchy hypersurface. With expanding the initial data in terms of spin-weighted spherical harmonics, it is shown that only a subset of the initial data, which satisfy certain regularity conditions, gives rise to well-defined charges at the point where future (past) infinity meets spatial infinity. Given such initial data, the charges are shown to be fully expressed in terms of the freely specifiable part of the data. Moreover, it is shown that there exists a natural correspondence between the charges defined at future and past null infinities.},

We give a thorough characterization and analysis of likelihood functions arising from certain classes of quantum circuits and combine this with the tools of Bayesian inference to give a procedure for picking optimal ELF tunable parameters.

In the present study, we establish a relationship between the variable separation and the algebraic structure of SO (10) symmetry. Each of the spherical, parabolic, or prolate spheroidal bases is proved to be a set of eigenfunctions of a corresponding nonuplet of algebraically independent integrals of motion. This finding also helps us establish connections between the bases by the algebraic method. This connection, in turn, allows calculating complicated integrals of confluent Heun, generalized Laguerre, and generalized Jacobi polynomials, which are important in physics and analytics.},

  abstract     = {During the last three decades, Pavel Bóna developed a non-linear generalization of quantum mechanics, which is based on symplectic structures for normal states. One important application of such a generalization is a general setting that is very convenient to study the emergence of macroscopic classical dynamics from microscopic quantum processes. We propose here a new mathematical approach to Bóna’s non-linear quantum mechanics. It is based on C 0 -semigroup theory and has a domain of applicability that is much broader than Bóna’s original one. It highlights the central role of self-consistency. This leads to a mathematical framework in which the classical and quantum worlds are naturally entangled. In this new mathematical approach, we build a Poisson bracket for the polynomial functions on the Hermitian weak * -continuous functionals on any C * -algebra. This is reminiscent of a well-known construction for finite-dimensional Lie algebras. We then restrict this Poisson bracket to states of this C * -algebra by taking quotients with respect to Poisson ideals. This leads to densely defined symmetric derivations on the commutative C * -algebras of real-valued functions on the set of states. Up to a closure, these are proven to generate C 0 -groups of contractions. As a matter of fact, in generic commutative C * -algebras, even the closableness of unbounded symmetric derivations is a non-trivial issue. Some new mathematical concepts are introduced, which are possibly interesting by themselves: the convex weak * Gâteaux derivative and the state-dependent C * -dynamical systems. Our recent results on macroscopic dynamical properties of lattice-fermion and quantum-spin systems with long-range, or mean-field, interactions corroborate the relevance of the general approach we present here.},

General free energies are considered satisfying some structural assumptions, with a pressure containing a γ -power law. The model is thermodynamically consistent and contains the Maxwell–Stefan cross-diffusion equations in the Fick–Onsager form as a special case. Compared to previous works, a very general model class is analyzed, including cross-diffusion effects, temperature gradients, compressible fluids, and different molar masses. A priori estimates are derived from the entropy balance and the total energy balance. The compactness for the total mass density follows from an estimate for the pressure in L p with p &gt; 1, the effective viscous flux identity, and uniform bounds related to Feireisl’s oscillation defect measure. These bounds rely heavily on the convexity of the free energy and the strong convergence of the relative chemical potentials.},

Based on a graphical construction of the model as the invariant measure of a birth and death process, we prove the existence and uniqueness of a measure defined on graphs with vertices in Z d ⁠ , which coincides with the limit along the measures over graphs with the finite vertex set. As a consequence, theoretical properties, such as exponential mixing of the infinite volume measure and central limit theorem for averages of a real-valued function of the graph, are obtained. Moreover, a perfect simulation algorithm based on the clan of ancestors is described in order to sample a finite window of the equilibrium measure defined on Z d ⁠ .},

These sharp estimates allow us to prove that, when the signal-to-noise ratio is large enough, the expected number of deep minima is asymptotically finite as N tends to infinity and to establish the occurrence of topological trivialization by showing that this number vanishes when the strength of the signal-to-noise ratio diverges. We also derive an explicit formula for the value of the absolute minimum (the limiting ground state energy) on the N -dimensional sphere, similar to the recent work of Jagannath, Lopatto, and Miolane [Ann. Appl. Probab. 4 , 1910–1933 (2020)].},

We tackle the problem of solving for the quenched statistical pressures of these models both at the replica symmetric level and under the first step of replica symmetry breaking by relying upon two techniques: the former is an adaptation of the celebrated Guerra’s interpolation (closer to probability theory in its spirit) and the latter is an adaptation of the transport partial differential equation (closer to mathematical physics in spirit). We recover, in both assumptions, the same expression for quenched statistical pressure and self-consistency equation found with other techniques, including the well-known replica trick technique.},

  abstract     = {Given a theory containing both heavy and light fields (the UV theory), a standard procedure is to integrate out the heavy field to obtain an effective field theory (EFT) for the light fields. Typically, the EFT equations of motion consist of an expansion involving higher and higher derivatives of the fields, whose truncation at any finite order may not be well-posed. In this paper, we address the question of how to make sense of the EFT equations of motion and whether they provide a good approximation to the classical UV theory. We propose an approach to solving EFTs, which leads to a well-posedness statement. For a particular choice of UV theory, we rigorously derive the corresponding EFT and show that a large class of classical solutions to the UV theory are well approximated by EFT solutions. We also consider solutions of the UV theory, which are not well approximated by EFT solutions, and demonstrate that these are close, in an averaged sense, to solutions of a modified EFT.},

Nonintegrable systems exhibiting such behavior include a generalization of the Ablowitz–Ladik system with power-law nonlinearity and the discrete nonlinear Schrödinger equation with power-law and saturable nonlinearities. The outcome of numerical simulations illustrates, in excellent agreement with the analytical results, the persistence of small amplitude Ablowitz–Ladik analytical solutions in all the nonintegrable systems considered in this work, with the most striking example being that of the Peregine soliton.},

The TFT data, including the three-point coefficients and lasso diagrams, are determined by solving all the sphere four-point crossing equations and torus one-point modular invariance equations. We further verify that the Cardy states furnish a non-negative integer matrix representation under TDL fusion. While many of the constraints we derive are not limited to this particular TFT with six vacua, we leave open the construction of TFTs with two or four vacua. Finally, TFTs realizing the Haagerup H 1 and H 2 fusion categories can be obtained by gauging algebra objects.

Here, we choose a significantly different system of expansion functions. We start with an L 2 -orthonormal wavelet basis { Ψ w : w ∈ W } ⁠ , where each Ψ w has the properties of a Daubechies wavelet in the temporal coordinate and the properties of a Meyer wavelet in the spatial coordinates. We consider the matrix elements G ww ′ ( m ) of the mass- m Feynman propagator based on the expansion functions v w = L w − 1 Ψ w ⁠ , where L w denotes the length scale of w ∈ W ⁠ . For every finite Λ ⊂ W ⁠ , we let G Λ ( m ) denote the Λ × Λ matrix of such elements. We define a constructive mass to be any value of m such that G Λ ( m ) is nonsingular for each finite Λ ⊂ W ⁠ . We prove that the set of such masses is at least co-countable (although we expect every mass value to be constructive). For an arbitrary constructive mass m and an arbitrary finite Λ ⊂ W ⁠ , we rigorously construct the interacting characteristic functional as an integral in amplitudes, where the Λ-cutoff on the quartic interaction is supplemented by a cutoff on the free-field action defined by G Λ ( m ) −1 .},

  abstract     = {We revisit the Kitaev model for fault tolerant quantum computing on a square lattice with underlying quantum double D ( G ) symmetry, where G is a finite group. We provide projection operators for its quasiparticles content as irreducible representations of D ( G ) and combine this with D ( G )-bimodule properties of open ribbon excitation spaces L ( s 0 , s 1 ) to show how open ribbons can be used to teleport information between their endpoints s 0 , s 1 . We give a self-contained account that builds on earlier work but emphasizes applications to quantum computing as surface code theory, including gates on D ( S 3 ). We show how the theory reduces to a simpler theory for toric codes in the case of D ( Z n ) ≅ C Z n 2 ⁠ , including toric ribbon operators and their braiding. In the other direction, we show how our constructions generalize to D ( H ) models based on a finite-dimensional Hopf algebra H , including site actions of D ( H ) and partial results on ribbon equivariance even when the Hopf algebra is not semisimple.},

  abstract     = {In tri-partite systems, there are three basic biseparability, A - BC , B - CA , and C - AB , according to bipartitions of local systems. We begin with three convex sets consisting of these basic biseparable states in the three-qubit system, and consider arbitrary iterations of intersections and/or convex hulls of them to get convex cones. One natural way to classify tri-partite states is to consider those convex sets to which they belong or do not belong. This is especially useful to classify partial entanglement of mixed states. We show that the lattice generated by those three basic convex sets with respect to convex hull and intersection has infinitely many mutually distinct members to see that there are infinitely many kinds of three-qubit partial entanglement. To do this, we consider an increasing chain of convex sets in the lattice and exhibit three-qubit Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger diagonal states distinguishing those convex sets in the chain.},

We make use of a corresponding family of representations of the canonical commutation relations (CCR) in an infinite number of degrees of freedom. A key feature of our construction is explicit formulas for associated transforms; these are infinite-dimensional analogs of Fourier transforms. Our framework is that of Gaussian Hilbert spaces, reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces and Fock spaces. The latter forms the setting for our CCR representations. We further show, with the use of representation theory and infinite-dimensional analysis, that our pairwise inequivalent probability spaces (for the Gaussian processes) correspond in an explicit manner to pairwise disjoint CCR representations.},

It turns out that an octonionic Hilbert space can be decomposed as an orthogonal direct sum of two subspaces, each of them isomorphic to a tensor product of an irreducible octonionic Hilbert space with a real Hilbert space. As an application, we find that for a given orthogonal basis, the octonionic Parseval equality holds if and only if the basis is weak associative. Fortunately, there always exists a weak associative orthogonal basis in an octonionic Hilbert space. This completely removes the obstacles caused by the failure of the octonionic Parseval equality.},

Our main result is a lower bound on the spectral gap of this Hamiltonian, which is uniform in the system size and total particle number. The gap is also uniform with respect to small values of the coupling constant in the model. The proof adapts the strategy of individually estimating the gap in invariant subspaces used for the bosonic ν = 1/2 model to the present fermionic case.},

More precisely, based on De Giorgi–Nash–Moser estimates and the refined logarithmic Gronwall-type inequality, we prove that it is globally well-posed, provided that the initial data belong to H s with s &gt; 1. Finally, we show that it is also valid for the two-dimensional zero diffusivity Boussinesq equations with variable viscosity in the non-divergence form.},

We explicitly construct a map, defined on a certain four-dimensional manifold of barycenters, which characterizes key static and dynamical properties of the ACW flow. In particular, using this map, we find an explicit four-dimensional effective dynamics of barycenters, which serves as a uniform asymptotic approximation for the (infinite-dimensional) ACW flow, so long as the initial surface satisfies certain mild geometric constraints (which determine the validity interval). Conversely, given any prescribed flow of barycenters evolving according to this effective dynamics, we construct a family of surfaces evolving by the ACW flow, whose barycenters are uniformly close to the prescribed ones on a large time interval (whose size depends on the geometric constraints of initial configurations).},

This defined model of the two-dimensional curved systems depends on a curvature/deformation parameter of the underlying space involving reflection operators. The curved Hamiltonian H κ admits the separation of variables in both geodesic parallel and polar coordinates, which generalizes the Cartesian coordinates of the plane. Similar to the behavior of the Euclidean case, which is the κ → 0 limit case of the curved space, the superintegrability of a curved Dunkl oscillator is naturally understood from the factorization approach viewpoint in that setting. Therefore, their associated sets of polynomial constants of motion (symmetries) as well as algebraic relations are obtained for each of them separately. The energy spectrum of the Hamiltonian H κ and the separated eigenfunctions are algebraically given in terms of hypergeometric functions and in the special limit case of null curvature occur in the Laguerre and Jacobi polynomials. Finally, the overlap coefficients between the two bases of the geodesic parallel and polar coordinates are given by hypergeometric polynomials.},

Next, the Darboux transformations of this new SmKP hierarchy are expressed in the form of free superfermions and various solutions are derived.

We show that the behavior of the equation depends on the value of the coupling constant λ . In the absence of a cosmological constant, we recover the existence and uniqueness properties of the original equation when λ &gt; 1/3 and the trace of the momentum of the metric, π , is non-vanishing. For π = 0, we recover the original Lichnerowicz equation regardless of the value of λ and must therefore restrict the metric to the positive Yamabe class. The same restriction holds for λ &lt; 1/3, a case in which we show that if the norm of the transverse-traceless data is small enough, then there are two solutions. Taking the equations of motion into account, this allows us to prove that there is, in general, no way of matching both constraint-solving data and time evolution of phase-space variables between the λ -R model and general relativity, thereby proving the non-equivalence between the theories outside of the previously known cases λ = 1 and π = 0 and of the limiting case of λ → ∞ , with a finite π , which we show to yield geometries corresponding to those of general relativity in the maximal slicing gauge.},

Moreover, we prove that the general covariance of natural Finsler field Lagrangians leads to an averaged energy–momentum conservation law that, in the particular case of Lorentzian spacetimes, is equivalent to the usual pointwise energy–momentum covariant conservation law.},

As a corollary, we infer that, unlike the FLRW background, the perturbed solutions do not describe a regular irrotational stiff fluid with a linear equation of state p = ρ for general asymptotic data at infinity. The reason for the breakdown of this interpretation is that the gradient of the scalar field stops being timelike at large times, eventually becoming null and then spacelike near infinity. Our results hold for open sets of initial data in Sobolev spaces without symmetries.},

We analyze a Floquet model with disorder, characterized by a family of local, time-periodic, and random quantum circuits in one spatial dimension. We observe that the evolution operator enjoys an extra symmetry at times that are a half-integer multiple of the period. With this, we prove that after the scrambling time, namely, when any initial perturbation has propagated throughout the system, the evolution operator cannot be distinguished from a (Haar) random unitary when all qubits are measured with Pauli operators. This indistinguishability decreases as time goes on, which is in high contrast to the more studied case of (time-dependent) random circuits. We also prove that the evolution of Pauli operators displays a form of mixing. These results require the dimension of the local subsystem to be large. In the opposite regime, our system displays a novel form of localization, produced by the appearance of effective one-sided walls, which prevent perturbations from crossing the wall in one direction but not the other.},

These vector fields are elements of the complexification of the regular representation of the Lie algebra s o ( 2 n + 1 ) ⁠ . As such, they do not satisfy the canonical anticommutation relations; however, once they have been projected onto an appropriate subspace of L 2 (Spin(2 n + 1)), these relations are satisfied. We define a free time evolution of this system of fermions in terms of a symmetric positive-definite quadratic form in the creation–annihilation operators. The realization of fermionic creation and annihilation operators brought by the (invariant) vector fields allows us to interpret this time evolution in terms of a positive self-adjoint operator that is the sum of a second order operator, which generates a stochastic diffusion process, and a first order complex operator, which strongly commutes with the second order operator. A probabilistic interpretation is given in terms of a Feynman–Kac-like formula with respect to the diffusion process associated with the second order operator.},

  abstract     = {The Rajeev–Ranken (RR) model is a Hamiltonian system describing screw-type nonlinear waves of wavenumber k in a scalar field theory pseudodual to the 1 + 1D SU(2) principal chiral model. Classically, the RR model is Liouville integrable. Here, we interpret the model as a novel 3D cylindrically symmetric quartic oscillator with an additional rotational energy. The quantum theory has two dimensionless parameters. Upon separating variables in the Schrödinger equation, we find that the radial equation has a four-term recurrence relation. It is of type [0, 1, 1 6 ] and lies beyond the ellipsoidal Lamé and Heun equations in Ince’s classification. At strong coupling λ , the energies of highly excited states are shown to depend on the scaling variable λk . The energy spectrum at weak coupling and its dependence on k in a double-scaling strong coupling limit are obtained. The semi-classical Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) quantization condition is expressed in terms of elliptic integrals. Numerical inversion enables us to establish a ( λk ) 2/3 dispersion relation for highly energetic quantized “screwons” at moderate and strong coupling. We also suggest a mapping between our radial equation and the one of Zinn-Justin and Jentschura that could facilitate a resurgent WKB expansion for energy levels. In another direction, we show that the equations of motion of the RR model can also be viewed as Euler equations for a step-3 nilpotent Lie algebra. We use our canonical quantization to uncover an infinite dimensional reducible unitary representation of this nilpotent algebra, which is then decomposed using its Casimir operators.},

  abstract     = {The fermionic fields of one generation of the Standard Model (SM), including the Lorentz spinor degrees of freedom, can be identified with components of a single real 64-dimensional semi-spinor representation S + of the group Spin(11, 3). We describe an octonionic model for Spin(11, 3) in which the semi-spinor representation gets identified with S + = O ⊗ O ̃ ⁠ , where O , O ̃ are the usual and split octonions, respectively. It is then well known that choosing a unit imaginary octonion u ∈ I m ( O ) equips O with a complex structure J . Similarly, choosing a unit imaginary split octonion u ̃ ∈ I m ( O ̃ ) equips O ̃ with a complex structure J ̃ ⁠ , except that there are now two inequivalent complex structures, one parameterized by a choice of a timelike and the other of a spacelike unit u ̃ ⁠ . In either case, the identification S + = O ⊗ O ̃ implies that there are two natural commuting complex structures J , J ̃ on S + . Our main new observation is that the subgroup of Spin(11, 3) that commutes with both J , J ̃ on S + is the direct product Spin(6) × Spin(4) × Spin(1, 3) of the Pati–Salam and Lorentz groups, when u ̃ is chosen to be timelike. The splitting of S + into eigenspaces of J corresponds to splitting into particles and anti-particles. The splitting of S + into eigenspaces of J ̃ corresponds to splitting of Lorentz Dirac spinors into two different chiralities. This provides an efficient bookkeeping in which particles are identified with components of such an elegant structure as O ⊗ O ̃ ⁠ . We also study the simplest possible symmetry breaking scenario with the “Higgs” field taking values in the representation that corresponds to three-forms in R 11 , 3 ⁠ . We show that this Higgs can be designed to transform as the bi-doublet of the left/right symmetric extension of the SM and thus breaks Spin(11, 3) down to the product of the SM, Lorentz, and U(1) B − L groups, with the last one remaining unbroken. This three-form Higgs field also produces the Dirac mass terms for all the particles.},

Using the fact that the singular perturbation τ * τ is a sort of rank one perturbation of the operator A , it is possible to prove the invariance of the essential spectrum of A under these singular perturbations. The main idea is to apply an adequate Krein’s formula in this singular framework. As an additional result, we found the corresponding relationship between the Green’s functions associated with the operators H 0 = Δ + V and H β , and we give a result about the existence of a pure point spectrum (eigenvalues) of H β . We also study the case β goes to infinity.},

In particular, we show that the giant cycle erasure threshold p E 0 (related to the conventional erasure threshold for the corresponding sequence of generalized toric codes) coincides with the edge percolation threshold p c ( H ) if the ratio d t /ln n t diverges, where n t is the number of edges of G t ⁠ , and we give evidence that p E 0 &lt; p c ( H ) in several cases where this ratio remains bounded, which is necessarily the case if H is non-amenable.},

  abstract     = {Helicity, a topological degree that measures the winding and linking of vortex lines, is preserved by ideal (barotropic) fluid dynamics. In the context of the Hamiltonian description, the helicity is a Casimir invariant characterizing a foliation of the associated Poisson manifold. Casimir invariants are special invariants that depend on the Poisson bracket, not on the particular choice of the Hamiltonian. The total mass (or particle number) is another Casimir invariant, whose invariance guarantees the mass (particle) conservation (independent of any specific choice of the Hamiltonian). In a kinetic description (e.g., that of the Vlasov equation), the helicity is no longer an invariant (although the total mass remains a Casimir of the Vlasov’s Poisson algebra). The implication is that some “kinetic effect” can violate the constancy of the helicity. To elucidate how the helicity constraint emerges or submerges, we examine the fluid reduction of the Vlasov system; the fluid (macroscopic) system is a “sub-algebra” of the kinetic (microscopic) Vlasov system. In the Vlasov system, the helicity can be conserved if a special helicity symmetry condition holds. To put it another way, breaking helicity symmetry induces a change in the helicity. We delineate the geometrical meaning of helicity symmetry and show that for a special class of flows (the so-called epi-two-dimensional flows), the helicity symmetry is written as ∂ γ = 0 for a coordinate γ of the configuration space.},

First, we find a critical exponent p * = n + 4 α n − 2 β for the well-posedness of energy solutions. In fact, if the nonlinear term grows with the order p ∈ [1, p *) and satisfies some dissipative conditions, then the equation is globally well-posed in the energy space. Moreover, both u and ∂ t u have a smoothing effect as a parabolic equation. Finally, we show that the solution semigroup has a global attractor A in the energy space. The main difficulties come from the non-compactness of the Sobolev embedding on R n and the nonlocal characteristic of the equation. We overcome them by establishing some new commutator estimates.},

Synchronous correlation sets introduced by Paulsen et al. [J. Funct. Anal. 270 , 2188–2222 (2016)] are a subclass of correlations that has proven particularly useful to study and arises naturally in applications. We show that any correlation that is almost synchronous, in a natural ℓ 1 sense, arises from a state and measurement operators that are well-approximated by a convex combination of projective measurements on a maximally entangled state. This extends a result of Paulsen et al. [J. Funct. Anal. 270 , 2188–2222 (2016)] that applies to exactly synchronous correlations. Crucially, the quality of approximation is independent of the dimension of the Hilbert spaces or of the size of the correlation. Our result allows one to reduce the analysis of many classes of nonlocal games, including rigidity properties, to the case of strategies using maximally entangled states that are generally easier to manipulate.},

Moreover, we extend the self-similar solution to the Boltzmann equation with infinite energy shown by Bobylev and Cercignani [J. Stat.

The usual lump is a stable weakly localized two-dimensional soliton, which keeps its shape and velocity in the course of the evolution from t → − ∞ to t → + ∞ . However, the lumps would become localized in time as instantons , as a result of two types of resonant collisions with spatially periodic (quasi-1D) soliton chains. These are partly resonant and fully resonant collisions. In the former case, the lump does not exist at t → − ∞ , but it suddenly emerges from the periodic soliton chain, keeping its amplitude and velocity constant as t → + ∞ ; or it exists as t → − ∞ and merges into the periodic chain, disappearing at t → + ∞ . In the case of the fully resonant interaction, the lump is an instanton, which emerges from the periodic chain and then merges into another chain, keeping its identify for a short time. Thus, in the case of the fully resonant collisions, the lumps are completely localized in time as well as in two-dimensional space, and they are call rogue lumps.},

In this gas, a log-Coulomb interaction between two charged particles occurs only when the sites of the particles are connected by an edge of the network. The partition functions of such gases turn out to be a particular class of multivariate local zeta functions attached to the network and a positive test function, which is determined by the confining potential. The methods and results of the theory of local zeta functions allow us to establish that the partition functions admit meromorphic continuations in the parameter β (the inverse of the absolute temperature). We give conditions on the charge distributions and the confining potential such that the meromorphic continuations of the partition functions have a pole at a positive value β UV , which implies the existence of phase transitions at finite temperature. In the case of p -adic fields, the meromorphic continuations of the partition functions are rational functions in the variable p − β . We give an algorithm for computing such rational functions. For this reason, we can consider the p -adic log-Coulomb gases as exact solvable models. We expect that all these models for different local fields share common properties and that they can be described by a uniform theory.},

  abstract     = {We are concerned with the dependence of the lowest positive eigenvalue of the Dirac operator on the geometry of rectangles, subject to infinite-mass boundary conditions. We conjecture that the square is a global minimizer under both the area or perimeter constraints. Contrary to the well-known non-relativistic analogs, we show that the present spectral problem does not admit explicit solutions. We prove partial optimization results based on a variational reformulation and newly established lower and upper bounds to the Dirac eigenvalue. We also propose an alternative approach based on symmetries of rectangles and a non-convex minimization problem; this implies a sufficient condition formulated in terms of a symmetry of the minimizer which guarantees the conjectured results.},

Inspired by the construction of the corresponding advanced and retarded Green operator G A , G R as done by Bär, Ginoux, and Pfäffle { Wave Equations on Lorentzian Manifolds and Quantization [European Mathematical Society (EMS), Zürich, 2007]}, we construct the remaining two Green operators G F , G aF locally in terms of Hadamard series. Afterward, we provide the global construction of i 2 G ̃ a F − G ̃ F ⁠ , which relies on new techniques such as a well-posed Cauchy problem for bisolutions and a patching argument using Čech cohomology. This leads to global bisolutions of the Hadamard form, each of which can be chosen to be a Hadamard two-point-function, i.e., the smooth part can be adapted such that, additionally, the symmetry and the positivity condition are exactly satisfied.},

  abstract     = {The mathematical models for describing the evolution of complex systems in the framework of the Kinetic Theory for Active Particles (KTAPs), based on suitable generalizations of Boltzmann’s kinetic theory of gases, nowadays seem to be the most versatile and effective ones to formulate in sufficiently precise and accurate terms, and possibly to solve, the most important and difficult problems not only of our everyday’s individual life but also of the life of human collectivities in the long term. In this connection, a simple examination of the application of KTAP to practical problems in which the state variables are not the usual position-velocity variables (and the kinetic state can, indeed, be completely disregarded), such as the prediction of the evolution of an epidemic in a given population in view of possible containment measures, suggests that the scheme is not always so general as it would be desirable for the simple reason that it is conditioned by the implicit (and natural) assumption of the principle of inertia, which in non-mechanical contexts should be rejected. Starting from this remark, this paper has a threefold aim: (1) to point out that KTAP equations make a tacit use of the principle of inertia; (2) to recall the reasons why the principle of inertia is naturally connected to the origin of KTAP models; and (3) to suggest a suitable modification of the KTAP general system, enabling the user to choose to adopt or reject the principle of inertia.},

In contrast, for a singular communication weight, when particles collide, the associated Cucker–Smale vector field becomes unbounded and the standard Cauchy–Lipschitz theory cannot be applied so that existence theory after collisions is problematic. Thus, the collision avoidance problem is directly linked to the global solvability of the singular RCS model and asymptotic flocking dynamics.

Recent progress in the understanding of conformal geometry in dimension higher than two has naturally led to a generalization of the Polyakov formalism to higher dimensions based on conformally invariant operators: Graham–Jenne–Mason–Sparling operators and the Q -curvature. This article is dedicated to providing a rigorous construction of Liouville conformal field theory on even-dimensional spheres. This is done at the classical level in terms of a generalized uniformization problem and at the quantum level, thanks to a probabilistic construction based on log-correlated fields and Gaussian multiplicative chaos. The properties of the objects thus defined are in agreement with the ones expected in the physics literature.},

In order to investigate the problem of unistochasticity, we introduce the set L d of bracelet matrices that forms a subset of B d ⁠ , but a superset of U d ⁠ . We prove that for every dimension d , this set contains the set of factorizable bistochastic matrices F d and is closed under matrix multiplication by elements of F d ⁠ . Moreover, we prove that both L d and F d are star-shaped with respect to the flat matrix. We also analyze the set of d × d unistochastic matrices arising from circulant unitary matrices and show that their spectra lie inside d -hypocycloids on the complex plane. Finally, applying our results to small dimensions, we fully characterize the set of circulant unistochastic matrices of order d ≤ 4 and prove that such matrices form a monoid for d = 3.},

  abstract     = {Recently, in the context of Relativistic Quantum Information Theory (RQI) of massive spin-1/2 particles, it has been suggested that it is impossible to perform a momentum-independent spin measurement, showing the inadequacy of the spin reduced density matrix as a legitimate information resource. This is because there is an unavoidable ambiguity in the definition of the spin of a moving particle. In this paper, by introducing a vector bundle theoretic way to view the single-particle state space, we try to rule out this ambiguity. The discrete degree of freedom of the resulting representation space contains information about the Pauli–Lubanski four-vector of the particle instead of the ambiguous spin. Comparing this representation with the standard one used in the RQI literature, we show that the discrete degree of freedom of the standard representation space attains the meaning of the Newton–Wigner spin. In addition, using this viewpoint, we give a mathematical proof of why the spin reduced density matrix is meaningless, which is stronger than the previous claims in that it asserts that the matrix is void of any meaning at all, not just in terms of the impossibility of measurement or Lorentz non-covariance. We give a way (which turns out to be the only way) to modify it to obtain the Pauli–Lubanski reduced density matrix, which is covariant under Lorentz transformations.},

We focus entirely on the case that the (ratios of) frequencies ω 1 , ω 2 , …, ω d together with 1 form a basis for an algebraic number field Φ of degree d + 1, allowing us to use tools from algebraic number theory. This special case was studied by Dyson, Bleher, Bleher–Homma–Ji–Roeder–Shen, and others. Under a suitable rescaling, we prove that the distribution of spacings behaves asymptotically quasiperiodically in log E . We also prove that the distribution of ratios of neighboring spacings behaves asymptotically quasiperiodically in log E . The same holds for the distribution of finite words in the finite alphabet of rescaled spacings. Mathematically, our work is a higher dimensional version of the Steinhaus conjecture (three gap theorem) involving the fractional parts of a linear form in more than one variable, and it is of independent interest from this perspective.},

  abstract     = {In this article, a novel characterization of Bose–Einstein condensates is proposed. Instead of relying on occupation numbers of a few dominant modes, which become macroscopic in the limit of infinite particle numbers, it focuses on the regular excitations whose numbers stay bounded in this limit. In this manner, subspaces of global, respectively, local regular wave functions are identified. Their orthogonal complements determine the wave functions of particles forming proper (infinite) condensates in the limit. In contrast to the concept of macroscopic occupation numbers, which does not sharply fix the wave functions of condensates in the limit states, the notion of proper condensates is unambiguously defined. It is outlined how this concept can be used in the analysis of condensates in models. The method is illustrated by the example of trapped non-interacting ground states and their multifarious thermodynamic limits, differing by the structure of condensates accompanying the Fock vacuum. The concept of proper condensates is also compared with the Onsager–Penrose criterion based on the analysis of eigenvalues of one-particle density matrices. It is shown that the concept of regular wave functions is also useful in that approach for the identification of wave functions forming proper condensates.},

  abstract     = {We show that recent results on adiabatic theory for interacting gapped many-body systems on finite lattices remain valid in the thermodynamic limit. More precisely, we prove a generalized super-adiabatic theorem for the automorphism group describing the infinite volume dynamics on the quasi-local algebra of observables. The key assumption is the existence of a sequence of gapped finite volume Hamiltonians, which generates the same infinite volume dynamics in the thermodynamic limit. Our adiabatic theorem also holds for certain perturbations of gapped ground states that close the spectral gap (so it is also an adiabatic theorem for resonances and, in this sense, “generalized”), and it provides an adiabatic approximation to all orders in the adiabatic parameter (a property often called “super-adiabatic”). In addition to the existing results for finite lattices, we also perform a resummation of the adiabatic expansion and allow for observables that are not strictly local. Finally, as an application, we prove the validity of linear and higher order response theory for our class of perturbations for infinite systems. While we consider the result and its proof as new and interesting in itself, we also lay the foundation for the proof of an adiabatic theorem for systems with a gap only in the bulk, which will be presented in a follow-up article.},

Such a problem cannot be studied by applying variational methods in a standard way, even by restricting its corresponding energy functional on the Nehari manifold, because ( PS ) sequence may not be bounded. In this paper, by the decomposition of the Nehari manifold and Ljusternik–Schnirelmann category, we relate the number of positive solutions to the category of the global minima set of a suitable ground energy function. This is perhaps the first work of studying such problems via the Ljusternik–Schnirelmann category.

Next, we consider persistence and asymptotic properties for the solutions of the equation considered. In particular, we analyze the behavior of the solutions of the equation for large values of the spatial variable. We show that if the initial data has a certain asymptotic exponential decaying, then such a property persists for any time as long as the solution exists. Moreover, depending on the behavior of the initial data for large values of the spatial variable and if for some further time the solution shares the same behavior, then it necessarily vanishes identically.
