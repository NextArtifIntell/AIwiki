However, most of the current acoustic wireless methods could support single wireless function and control single device. A converged wireless infrastructure that simultaneously supports the mainstream wireless functions remains inaccessible for acoustics. The difficulty lies in constructing the dynamic control network consisting of multiple nodes with acoustic method. Here, we develop the converged wireless infrastructure based on the acoustic holographic array, which serves as the central hub of the system. The holographic array allows for simultaneous control of multiple targets and integrates multiple mainstream wireless functions. We experimentally present the acoustic version of the converged wireless system that realizes a series of functions, including (i) selective wireless power transfer, (ii) stable remote monitoring, (iii) dynamic programmable logic control, and (iv) wireless acoustic communication. The wireless system is capable of powering and controlling free-moving devices. The unique immunity against electromagnetic and biological interferences is further demonstrated. The acoustic-based wireless infrastructure provides a route to wireless technologies, especially for those in electromagnetic-restricted conditions.},

However, classical solid-state theories referenced for parameter extraction are based on simplistic assumptions that may not be strictly valid for a new generation of devices from unconventional materials and processing. In this study, we show that contact-limited currents dominate the entire operating regime in thin-film or nanoscale diodes even at a small charge-injection barrier. This assessment can make many reported values and analysis routines debatable, because they do not generally take any contact effects into consideration. Physical origins of the validity problem and guidelines for holistic parameterization are detailed through systematic correlation of analytical models, numerical simulation, and an experimental investigation into an organic diode with a graphene contact.},

However, incommensurate interfaces are notoriously defective and rarely benefit from first-principles predictions, because no explicit atomic-structure models exist. Here, we adopt a bulk crystal structure prediction method to the interface geometry and apply it to SnO 2 /CdTe heterojunctions without and with the addition of CdCl 2 , a ubiquitous and beneficial, but abstruse processing step in CdTe photovoltaics. Whereas the direct SnO 2 /CdTe interface is highly defective, we discover a unique two-dimensional CdCl 2 interphase, unrelated to the respective bulk structure. It facilitates a seamless transition from the rutile to zincblende lattices and removes defect-states from the interface bandgap. Implementing the predicted interface electronic structure in device simulations, we demonstrate the theoretical feasibility of bufferless oxide-CdTe heterojunction solar cells approaching the Shockley–Queisser limit. Our results highlight the broader potential of designing atomically thin interlayers to enable defect-free incommensurate interfaces.},

  abstract     = {Dielectric engineering of heterostructures made from two-dimensional van der Waals semiconductors is a unique and powerful tool to tailor the electric and optical band gaps solely via the dielectric environment and the crystal thickness modulation. Here, we utilize high quality MoTe 2 monolayer and bilayer crystals as a candidate for near-infrared photonic applications. The crystals are exfoliated on various technologically relevant carrier substrates: silicon/silicon dioxide, poly(methyl methacrylate), hexagonal boron nitride, silicon carbide, and silicon nitride. These substrates provide a large range of high frequency dielectric constants from 2.1 to 7.0 for MoTe 2 -containing heterostructures. We assess the relationship between the environmental dielectric function and Coulomb screening by combining detailed spectroscopic measurements, utilizing low-temperature and high-spatially resolved photoluminescence and contrast reflectivity, with microscopic many-body modeling, to explore the potential of this less-recognized material platform for applications in optoelectronics at photon wavelengths above 1 μ m. We observe a redshift of the optical gap emission energy from the monolayer to bilayer regime on the order of 30 meV. Furthermore, the thickness controlled shift is slightly larger than the one induced by the local dielectric environment, which ranges on the order of 20 meV for the MoTe 2 monolayers and on the order of 8 meV for the MoTe 2 bilayers. We also show that the local dielectric screening barely affects the trion binding energy, which is captured by our microscopic model, accounting for the screened Coulomb potential for the heterostructures.},

However, in spite of their excellent luminescence properties in green and red regions, blue emission—a critical component for white light generation—from pristine manganese-based composites is currently missing. In this work, we successfully achieve blue luminescence center in manganese-based composites through selecting specific organic component methylbenzylamine (MBA). Our approach is fundamentally different from green and red emission in manganese-based composites, which result from manganese-halide frameworks. The coexistence of different luminescence centers in our manganese-based composites is confirmed by photoluminescence (PL) and photoluminescence excitation (PLE) results. As a result of different photoluminescence excitation responses of different emission centers, the resulting emission color can be tuned with selecting different excitation wavelengths. Specifically, a white light emission can be obtained with Commission Internationale de l&#39;éclairage coordinates of (0.33, 0.35) upon the 330 nm excitation. We further demonstrate the promise of our manganese-based composites in the anti-counterfeiting technology and multicolor lighting. Our results provide a novel strategy for full-spectral emission in manganese-based organic–inorganic metal halide composites and lay a solid foundation for a range of new applications.},

  abstract     = {Secondary hyperoxaluria (SH) is a multifactorial disorder that extends from inflamed intestinal epithelium with oxalate malabsorption to kidney stone disease; its prevalence is increasing annually. Studying complex SH has been a considerable challenge because of the lack of an in vitro multiorgan model that describes dynamic pathophysiological interactions between the native intestinal epithelium and proximal tubule (PT). An in vitro multiorgan model is developed using a multi-biofabrication technique to address this challenge; this developed microfluidic in vitro multiorgan model demonstrates the enhanced functional interconnection between the intestinal epithelium and a vascularized PT by printing compartmentalized two organs close together. This spatially organized multiorgan model with enhanced fluidic connectivity provides a tool for recapitulating the critical pathophysiological features of SH, which includes intestinal barrier disruption, calcium oxalate (CaOx) crystallization, and crystal-induced PT injuries. The biophysical properties (e.g., glucose reabsorption and tubular fluid flow behavior-dependent CaOx crystal formation) of an in vitro SH model are thoroughly analyzed by comparison with the pathophysiology of human PT. Further, the efficiency of the in vitro 3D model as a drug testing platform is validated by assessing CaOx crystal dissolution on perfusing the device with trisodium citrate and grape seed extract. With no U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved SH therapeutics, this optimized in vitro SH model can be actively utilized as a promising platform for discovering integrative therapeutics to reverse intestinal epithelial inflammation and recurrent kidney stone disease in a single assay.},

  abstract     = {The presence of surface defects, such as epoxy and carbonyl groups, is known to control the charge-carrier transport in graphene oxide (GO). In addition, these surface entities also provide an opportunity to synthesize novel hybrid (NH) materials via chemical bonding. These hybrid materials are particularly interesting for sensing as they offer novel properties like larger surface area and improved physical/chemical properties. Herein, we are proposing a novel SiO 2 @GO–NH based room-temperature (RT) ethanol sensor. The NH is realized from solution-route by following the sol–gel chemistry of tetraethyl orthosilicate. The attachment of SiO 2 with the GO network occurs via the formation of Si–O–C bonds, which also leads to the reduction in the atomic percentage of electron-withdrawing groups. This reduction results in the improvement in electron charge transport in GO, which leads to the RT detection of ethanol. Specifically, the charge transport in NH is found to be dominated by a field-driven temperature-independent 2D variable-range hopping mechanism. While the ethanol sensing mechanism is found to be governed by two processes, i.e., via direct interaction of ethanol with NH and interaction with chemisorbed oxygen ions on the Pt/Si@GO–NH interface. Detailed observations reveal that the SiO 2 –GO NH has great potential to be used as a biomarker for food quality control.},

Here, we report an observation of d – d emission in antiferromagnetic nickel phosphorus trisulfides (NiPS 3 ) and its strong enhancement by stacking it with monolayer tungsten disulfide (WS 2 ). We attribute the observation of the strong d – d emission enhancement to the charge transfer between NiPS 3 and WS 2 in the type-I heterostructure. The d – d emission peak splits into two peaks, D 1 and D 2 , at low temperature below 150 K, from where an energy splitting due to the trigonal crystal field is measured as 105 meV. Moreover, we find that the d – d emissions in NiPS 3 are nonpolarized lights, showing no dependence on the zigzag antiferromagnetic configuration.

  abstract     = {Although anionic-redox-based layered oxide materials have attracted great attention as promising cathodes for Na-ion batteries because of their high practical capacities, they suffer from undesirable structural degradation, resulting in the poor electrochemical behavior. Moreover, the occurrence of stable anionic-redox reaction without the use of expensive elements such as Li, Co, and Ni is considered one of the most important issues for high-energy and low-cost Na-ion batteries. Herein, using first-principles calculation and various experimental techniques, we investigate the combination of vacancy ( □ ) and Ti 4+ cations in the transition-metal sites to enable outstanding anionic-redox-based electrochemical performance in the Na-ion battery system. The presence of vacancies in the P2-type Na 0.56 [Ti 0.1 Mn 0.76□0.14 ]O 2 structure suppresses the large structural change such as the P2–OP4 phase transition, and Ti 4+ cations in the structure result in selectively oxidized oxygen ions with structural stabilization during Na + deintercalation in the high-voltage region. The high structural stability of P2-type Na 0.56 [Ti 0.1 Mn 0.76□0.14 ]O 2 enables not only the high specific capacity of 224.92 mAh g −1 at 13 mA g −1 (1C = 264.1 mA g −1 ) with an average potential of ∼2.62 V (vs Na + /Na) but also excellent cycle performance with a capacity retention of ∼80.38\% after 200 cycles at 52 mA g −1 with high coulombic efficiencies above 99\%. Although there are some issues such as low Na contents in the as-prepared state, these findings suggest potential strategies to stabilize the anionic-redox reaction and structure in layered-oxide cathodes for high-energy and low-cost Na-ion batteries.},

Both ionoelastomers use 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate to provide high stretchability. The junction between the two ionoelastomers creates a diode with excellent non-Faradaic ionic current rectification. The voltage-dependent modulation of the ionic double layer at the interface between the two ionoelastomers provides the rectification.

Conflicting reports on the lack or existence of thermal percolation in polymer composites have made it the subject of great controversy for decades. Here, we develop a generalized percolation framework that describes both electrical and thermal conductivity within a remarkably wide range of filler-to-matrix conductivity ratios ( ⁠ Y f / Y m ⁠ ), covering 20 orders of magnitude. Our unified theory provides a genuine classification of electrical conductivity with typical Y f / Y m ≥ 10 10 as insulator–conductor percolation with the standard power-law behavior and of thermal conductivity with 10 2 ≤ Y f / Y m ≤ 10 4 as poor–good conductor percolation characterized by two universal critical exponents. Experimental verification of the universal and unified features of our theoretical framework is conducted by constructing a 3D segregated and well-extended network of multiwalled carbon nanotubes in polypropylene as a model polymer matrix under a carefully designed fabrication method. We study the evolution of the electrical and thermal conductivity in our fabricated composites at different loading levels up to 5 vol.\%. Significantly, we find an ultralow electrical percolation threshold at 0.02 vol.\% and a record-low thermal percolation threshold at 1.5 vol.\%. We also apply our theoretical model to a number of 23 independent experimental and numerical datasets reported in the literature, including more than 350 data points, for systems with different microscopic details, and show that all collapse onto our proposed universal scaling function, which depends only on dimensionality.},

  abstract     = {Surface engineering of carbon materials induces structural modulation with appealing functionalities for versatile applications. However, practical deployment demands simplified modification steps and time-saving operations. Microwave technology can produce a strong instant magnetic-heating effect, avoiding the presence of a temperature gradient to cause nanoparticle agglomeration and multiple synthesis stages. Herein, we propose a rapid Joule carbothermal synthesis of a 3D flexible carbon cloth with ultrasmall metal oxide nanoparticles (MO x @CC) upon microwave irradiation within several minutes. Owing to the extensive selection of metal precursors, this approach can be applied to achieve a variety of active metal oxide nanoparticles decorated on carbon cloth. Furthermore, the modified carbon cloth can serve as a lithiophilic framework to efficiently homogenize Li + flux and mitigate the dendrite formation. Ascribed to these merits, a prototype of the prelithiation MO x @CC anode paired with the LiFePO 4 cathode exhibits satisfactory performance upon repetitive cycling, highlighting the possibility for a safe battery system.},

  abstract     = {The generation of perpendicular effective magnetic field or perpendicular spins ( σ z ) is central for the development of energy-efficient, scalable, and external-magnetic-field-free spintronic memory and computing technologies. Here, we report the first identification and the profound impacts of a significant effective perpendicular magnetic field that can arise from asymmetric current spreading within magnetic microstrips and Hall bars. This effective perpendicular magnetic field can exhibit all the three characteristics that have been widely assumed in the literature to “signify” the presence of a flow of σ z , i.e., external-magnetic-field-free current switching of uniform perpendicular magnetization, a sin 2 φ -dependent contribution in spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance signal of in-plane magnetization ( φ is the angle of the external magnetic field with respect to the current), and a φ -independent but field-dependent contribution in the second harmonic Hall voltage of in-plane magnetization. This finding suggests that it is critical to include current spreading effects in the analyses of various spin polarizations and spin–orbit torques in the magnetic heterostructure. Technologically, our results provide a perpendicular effective magnetic field induced by asymmetric current spreading as a novel, universally accessible mechanism for efficient, scalable, and external-magnetic-field-free magnetization switching in memory and computing technologies.},

PCs have in recent years been widely explored to significantly improve the performance of perovskite luminescent materials and/or photoelectric devices. Therefore, a full understanding of the key role of PCs and a further learning of the correct use of PCs in perovskite photonic/photoelectric devices are essential for realizing the inherent potential of the superior performance of such devices. By means of this first review, we aim at offering a comprehensive framework description for PCs suitable for high-performance perovskite photoelectric devices. We start with a brief introduction to the basic aspects of PCs. Then, we summarize the influences of PCs on emission/absorption for perovskite luminescent materials. Subsequently, we systematically discuss concepts like light extraction, light trapping, slow-light effects, and structural effects of PCs for perovskite devices, with a particular emphasis on their theoretical descriptions. We argue that the marriage of perovskite materials with PCs can open up a novel frontier in photoelectric devices that potentially can spawn many exciting new fields.},

The synthesis of high-quality few-layer BP thin films is critical to investigate their distinctive crystal structure, fundamental characteristics, as well as the potential applications in electronics, biomedicine, energy storage, photonics, and optoelectronics. Therefore, this review provides an overview of mono- and few-layer BP topic in the synthesis methods beyond exfoliation, including thinning treatments accompanied to exfoliation, conversion from red phosphorus to BP, and direct growth techniques. We summarize various attempts to control the BP sample&#39;s thickness and lateral dimensions during the synthesis. Furthermore, we discuss the current challenges and perspectives of large-scale growth of ultrathin BP which has been a bottleneck hindering wafer-scale device&#39;s development in this field.

The high-power pulsed laser-assisted synthesis of nanomaterials in liquids provides many degrees of parameter control (i.e., pulsed laser power, wavelength, reaction time duration, laser pulse repetition rate, and solvent) and numerous advantages over traditional physical and chemical synthetic methods, such as high purity, no byproducts, simple, nontoxic, and no need for surfactants and reducing agents.

  abstract     = {Conductive and semiconductive oxides constitute a class of materials of which the electrical conductivity and optical transparency can be modulated through material design (e.g., doping and alloying) and external influences (e.g., gating in a transistor or gas exposure in a gas sensor). These (semi)conductive oxides, often categorized as amorphous oxide semiconductors or transparent conductive oxides, have, therefore, been commonplace in, for example, solar cells and displays, as well as in an increasing variety of other applications including memory, logic, photonics, and sensing. Among the various deposition techniques, the use of atomic layer deposition (ALD) has been gaining in popularity in recent years. Specifically since the early 2000s, many ALD processes for doped and compound conductive metal oxides have been developed. The interest in such oxides prepared by ALD can most likely be attributed to the distinct merits of ALD, such as low-temperature processing, excellent uniformity and conformality, and accurate control over the doping level and composition. Moreover, as device dimensions shrink the need for high-quality, ultrathin materials becomes ever more important. These merits of ALD stem directly from the self-limiting nature of the surface chemistry that drives the ALD growth. On the other hand, the strong role that surface chemistry has in the growth mechanism brings in many intricacies, and detailed understanding of these aspects has been vital for the development of high-quality doped and compound oxides by ALD. Examples of growth effects that can occur during ALD of compound oxides include growth delays, clustering of dopants, and interruption of grain growth by doping. Such effects often need to be accounted for or mitigated, while on the other hand, there are also clear cases where such growth effects can be leveraged to achieve enhanced or new functionality. In this review paper, an overview of the library of ALD processes that has emerged is presented. Available precursor chemistries, dopants as well as achieved film properties—most notably the carrier densities and (field-effect) mobilities of the films—are presented. A selection of important ALD effects that can occur during the deposition of doped and compound conductive oxides is showcased, and their effect on the optical and electrical properties are highlighted. Mitigation and improvement strategies for negative growth effects are presented. This is done through case studies that clearly illustrate these effects, drawing both from literature and from our own recent work.},

Magnonics in antiferromagnetic oxides is also presented, where the spin-wave resonance frequency enters THz regime.

  abstract     = {LEDs based on hexagonal InGaN/GaN quantum wells are dominant technology for many lighting applications. However, their luminous efficacy for green and amber emission and at high drive currents remains limited. Growing quantum wells instead in the cubic phase is a promising alternative because, compared to hexagonal GaN, it benefits from a reduced bandgap and is free of the strong polarization fields that can reduce the radiative recombination rate. Initial attempts to grow cubic GaN in the 1990s employed molecular beam epitaxy, but now, metal-organic chemical vapor deposition can also be used. Nonetheless, high phase purity requires careful attention to growth conditions and the quantification of any unwanted hexagonal phase. In contrast to hexagonal GaN, in which threading dislocations are key, at its current state of maturity, the most important extended structural defects in cubic GaN are stacking faults. These modify the optical properties of cubic GaN films and propagate into active layers. In quantum wells and electron blocking layers, segregation of alloying elements at stacking faults has been observed, leading to the formation of quantum wires and polarized emission. This observation forms part of a developing understanding of the optical properties of cubic InGaN quantum wells, which also offer shorter recombination lifetimes than their polar hexagonal counterparts. There is also growing expertise in p-doping, including dopant activation by annealing. Overall, cubic GaN has rapidly transitioned from an academic curiosity to a real prospect for application in devices, with the potential to offer specific performance advantages compared to polar hexagonal material.},

  abstract     = {The demand for wearable electronics in the fields of human healthcare monitoring and disease diagnosis has significantly increased in recent years. In particular, there is a need for light-weight, skin-friendly, soft elastic devices that can attach comfortably to human skin and communicate information via the Internet of Things. Rigorous research has been carried out to find new materials and device designs that can meet the challenging demands of skin-mountable devices. The emergence of atomically thin two-dimensional (2D) materials with exceptional electrical, optical, and mechanical properties, and low cytotoxicity has facilitated the fabrication of low-dimensional electronic devices on flexible/stretchable platforms that can be easily integrated into the human body. Herein, we provide a comprehensive review of recent research progress on 2D material-based wearable sensors that are proposed for a wide range of applications including human health monitoring. Several potential applications based on wearable electronic devices have already been well established and documented, while many others are at a preliminary stage. Based on current research progress, the challenges and prospects toward commercial implementation of such clinical sensors are also discussed.},

  abstract     = {Measurements of the thermal properties of the skin can serve as the basis for a noninvasive, quantitative characterization of dermatological health and physiological status. Applications range from the detection of subtle spatiotemporal changes in skin temperature associated with thermoregulatory processes, to the evaluation of depth-dependent compositional properties and hydration levels, to the assessment of various features of microvascular/macrovascular blood flow. Examples of recent advances for performing such measurements include thin, skin-interfaced systems that enable continuous, real-time monitoring of the intrinsic thermal properties of the skin beyond its superficial layers, with a path to reliable, inexpensive instruments that offer potential for widespread use as diagnostic tools in clinical settings or in the home. This paper reviews the foundational aspects of the latest thermal sensing techniques with applicability to the skin, summarizes the various devices that exploit these concepts, and provides an overview of specific areas of application in the context of skin health. A concluding section presents an outlook on the challenges and prospects for research in this field.},

  abstract     = {The Year 2022 marks 100 years since Leon Brillouin predicted and theoretically described the interaction of optical waves with acoustic waves in a medium. Accordingly, this resonant multi-wave interaction is referred to as Brillouin scattering. Today, Brillouin scattering has found a multitude of applications, ranging from microscopy of biological tissue, remote sensing over many kilometers, and signal processing in compact photonic integrated circuits smaller than the size of a thumbnail. What allows Brillouin scattering to be harnessed over such different length scales and research domains are its unique underlying properties, namely, its narrow linewidth in the MHz range, a frequency shift in the GHz range, large frequency selective gain or loss, frequency tunability, and optical reconfigurability. Brillouin scattering is also a ubiquitous effect that can be observed in many different media, such as freely propagating in gases and liquids, as well as over long lengths of low-loss optical glass fibers or short semiconductor waveguides. A recent trend of Brillouin research focuses on micro-structured waveguides and integrated photonic platforms. The reduction in the size of waveguides allows tailoring the overlap between the optical and acoustic waves and promises many novel applications in a compact footprint. In this review article, we give an overview of the evolution and development of the field of Brillouin scattering over the last one hundred years toward current lines of active research. We provide the reader with a perspective of recent trends and challenges that demand further research efforts and give an outlook toward the future of this exciting and diverse research field.},

Recently, some sustainable and cost-effective electronic devices have been designed with gLIG, resulting in diverse solutions to the environmental impact caused by electronic waste (e-waste). However, there are still several challenges that must be addressed regarding the widespread market implementation of gLIG-based products, from synthesis to practical applications. In this review, we focus on sustainable precursor sources, their conversion mechanisms, physical and chemical properties and applications, along with the challenges related to its implementation, showing the future opportunities and perspectives related to this promising new material. Various systems based on gLIG for energy storage, electrocatalysis, water treatment, and sensors have been reported in the literature. Additionally, gLIG has been proposed for ink formulation or incorporation into polymer matrices, to further expand its use to non-carbon-based substrates or applications for which pristine LIG cannot be directly used. In this way, it is possible to apply gLIG on diverse substrates, aiming at emerging wearable and edible electronics. Thus, this review will bring an overview of gLIG developments, in accordance with the European Green Deal, the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and the new era of internet-of-things, which demands cost-effective electronic components based on the principles of energy efficiency and sustainable production methods.},

Like electrons, phonons can also be studied using critical theorems and topology concepts, giving impetus to the birth of topological phonons. Among the topological phonons, the topological nodal line phonons in crystalline materials have emerged as a new area of rapid development in both experiment and theory. Researchers have been hunting for realistic materials with nodal line phonons for the last four years. To date, however, a timely review of recent advances in topological nodal line phonons, and especially their material realization, is still lacking. Considering the classification of the nodal line states, in this review, we will first review the identification of the materials hosting the nodal line phonons with different degeneracies, different types of dispersion, and different geometric shapes in theory. Moreover, we will review and discuss the reasons for the appearance of the nodal line phonons from the viewpoint of symmetry. Second, we will review the case where the nodal line appears in the projected surface phonon states instead of the bulk phonon states. Third, we will review the experimental material realization of nodal line phonons. Finally, we will present a summary, outlook, and additional notes. We believe that this review will contribute to a more advanced understanding of topological nodal line phonons in solid materials and will offer new perspectives on this rapidly expanding field.},

  abstract     = {Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) uses a large magnetic field and radio waves to generate images of tissues in the body. Conventional MRI techniques have been developed to image and quantify tissues and fluids with long transverse relaxation times (T 2 s), such as muscle, cartilage, liver, white matter, gray matter, spinal cord, and cerebrospinal fluid. However, the body also contains many tissues and tissue components such as the osteochondral junction, menisci, ligaments, tendons, bone, lung parenchyma, and myelin, which have short or ultrashort T 2 s. After radio frequency excitation, their transverse magnetizations typically decay to zero or near zero before the receiving mode is enabled for spatial encoding with conventional MR imaging. As a result, these tissues appear dark, and their MR properties are inaccessible. However, when ultrashort echo times (UTEs) are used, signals can be detected from these tissues before they decay to zero. This review summarizes recent technical developments in UTE MRI of tissues with short and ultrashort T 2 relaxation times. A series of UTE MRI techniques for high-resolution morphological and quantitative imaging of these short-T 2 tissues are discussed. Applications of UTE imaging in the musculoskeletal, nervous, respiratory, gastrointestinal, and cardiovascular systems of the body are included.},

This exfoliation of 2D materials can yield large 2D nanosheets, hundreds of micrometers wide, that can be as thin as one or a few atomic layers thick. However, the underlying physical mechanisms unique to each exfoliation technique can produce a wide distribution of defects, yields, functionalization, lateral sizes, and thicknesses, which can be appropriate for specific end applications. The five most commonly used exfoliation techniques include micromechanical cleavage, ultrasonication, shear exfoliation, ball milling, and electrochemical exfoliation. In this review, we present an overview of the field of 2D material exfoliation and the underlying physical mechanisms with emphasis on progress over the last decade. The beneficial characteristics and shortcomings of each exfoliation process are discussed in the context of their functional properties to guide the selection of the best technique for a given application. Furthermore, an analysis of standard applications of exfoliated 2D nanosheets is presented including their use in energy storage, electronics, lubrication, composite, and structural applications. By providing detailed insight into the underlying exfoliation mechanisms along with the advantages and disadvantages of each technique, this review intends to guide the reader toward the appropriate batch-scale exfoliation techniques for a wide variety of industrial applications.},

The resultant green afterglow OLEDs exhibit the state-of-the-art maximum external quantum efficiency, luminance, and OURTP lifetimes of up to 1.47\%, 743 cd m −2 , and 356 ms, respectively, with the low turn-voltage of 4.4 V. Due to the inherent stable afterglow properties and outstanding carrier transport ability of the emitting layer, the OLEDs show admirable afterglow emission stability with the intensity and lifetimes keeping almost the same for more than ten repeated voltage pulses.

We resonantly drive a two-level system and add a tailored modulation to the dressing field to increase robustness to frequency detuning noise and microwave amplitude fluctuations. We measure a coherence time of 2 ms, corresponding to two orders of magnitude improvement compared to a bare spin, and an average Clifford gate fidelity exceeding 99\%, despite the relatively long qubit gate times. We stress that the potential of this work lies in the scalability of the protocol and the relaxation of the engineering constraints for a large-scale quantum processor.

A boson sampling machine, an analog quantum computer that only requires multiphoton interference and single-photon detection, is considered to be a promising candidate to reach this goal. However, the probabilistic nature of photon sources and the inevitable loss in evolution network make the execution time exponentially increasing with the problem size. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a timestamp boson sampling scheme that can effectively reduce the execution time for any problem size. By developing a time-of-flight storage technique with a precision up to picosecond level, we are able to detect and record the complete time information of 30 individual modes out of a large-scale 3D photonic chip. We perform the three-photon injection and one external trigger experiment to demonstrate that the timestamp protocol works properly and effectively reduce the execution time. We further verify that timestamp boson sampler is distinguished from other samplers in the case of limited datasets through the three heralded single photons injection experiment. The timestamp protocol can speed up the sampling process, which can be widely applied in multiphoton experiments at low-sampling rate. The approach associated with newly exploited resource from time information can boost all the count-rate-limited experiments, suggesting an emerging field of timestamp quantum optics.},

Here, we present a phase-shifter design with double vacuum channels to alternate the phase velocity that effectively extends the THz–electron interaction length in THz-powered dielectrically loaded waveguides. The electrons are swept multiple-times back and forth through the accelerating phase of the THz wave to undergo continuous acceleration along the entire interaction. In addition, the double vacuum channel design enables increases in both the phase and group velocities of the THz wave, which leads to an adaptive synchronous acceleration with extended interaction length. This method paves the way for the practical implementation of THz-powered devices for high-energy ultrafast electron sources.},

We report herein a unique silica template method to synthesize cetrimonium bromide free silver nanorods (AgNRs). The application of AgNRs in metal enhanced fluorescence (MEF) was explored by immobilizing visible/near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent dyes on AgNR assembled substrates exhibiting broadband optical properties. Theoretical modeling was performed to analyze the nanoscale “chaotic nature” of the AgNR substrates, showing that the plasmon band shifts and broadening were attributed to the resonance coupling between assembled nanorods with different conformations. The quantum yield (QY) of NIR dye Alex Fluor 790 was increased dramatically from 4\% to 84\%, with total fluorescence enhancement up to two orders of magnitudes. In addition, AgNR substrates can also amplify fluorescence emissions from high quantum yield dyes, nearly 10-fold for Alexa Fluor 647 (QY:33\%) and threefold for Alexa Fluor 488 (QY:92\%). The AgNR demonstrates the capability of dramatically enhancing NIR dye&#39;s QY, holding great potential for building up an ultra-sensitive fluorescence bioassay platform for early diagnosis of diseases.},

  abstract     = {The effects of atomic-scale disorder and charge (de)localization hold significant importance, and they provide essential insights to unravel the role that strong and weak correlations play in condensed matter systems. In the case of perovskite oxide heterostructures, while disorders introduced via various external stimuli have strong influences over the (de)localization of interfacial two-dimensional (2D) electrons, these factors alone could not fully account for the system&#39;s charge dynamics where interfacial hybridization holds very strong influence. Here, we determine that the displaced 2D free electrons have been localized in the specific hybridized states of the LaAlO 3 /SrTiO 3 interface. This experimental study combines both transport measurements and temperature-dependent x-ray absorption spectroscopy and suggests that the localization of 2D electrons can be induced via temperature reduction or ionic liquid gating. Furthermore, this localization effect is found to be applicable to both amorphous and crystalline interfacial systems. In particular, we demonstrate that interfacial hybridization plays a pivotal role in regulating the 2D electron localization effects. Our study resolves the location where the 2D electrons are localized not only does it highlight the importance of interfacial hybridization but it also opens a new avenue for device fabrication in amorphous film systems where charge localization can be done at much great ease as compared to epitaxial crystalline heterostructures.},

Consequently, developing a wearable and skin-conformal interface that simultaneously features waterproofness, low cost, and low power consumption for human–machine interaction remains highly desired. Herein, a stretchable, inexpensive, and waterproof magnetoelastic sensor array has been developed as a secondary skin for self-powered human–machine interaction. The magnetoelastic sensor array utilizes the giant magnetoelastic effect in a soft system, which converts mechanical pressure to magnetic field variation and, when coupled with the magnetic induction, can generate electricity. In such a way, our magnetoelastic sensor array comprises the giant magnetomechanical coupling layer made up of nanomagnets and a porous silicone rubber matrix, and the magnetic induction layer, which are coils patterned by liquid metal. With programmable functionalities, the soft magnetoelastic sensor array can supply different commands by producing bespoke electric signals from human finger touch with an optimal signal-to-noise ratio of 34 dB and a rapid response time of 0.2s. To pursue a practical application, the soft magnetoelastic sensor array can wirelessly turn on and off a household lamp and control a music speaker via Bluetooth continuously in real time, even with contact with high-humidity environments such as heavy perspiration. With a collection of compelling features, the soft magnetoelastic sensor array puts forth a unique and savvy avenue of self-powered bioelectronic technology that practically enables a wider variety of applications for wearable human–machine interaction.},

  abstract     = {The all-solid-state battery (ASSB) has become one of the most promising next-generation battery systems, since the aspect of safety has emerged as a crucial criterion for new large-scale applications such as in electric vehicles. Despite the recent remarkable progress in the performance enhancement, the real-world implementation of the ASSB still requires full comprehension/evaluation of its properties and performance under various practical operational conditions. Unlike batteries employed in conventional electronic devices, those in electric vehicles—the major application that the ASSB is expected to be employed—would be exposed to wide temperature variations (−20 to ∼70 °C) at various states of charges due to their outdoor storage and irregular discharge/rest/charge conditions depending on vehicle drivers&#39; usage patterns. Herein, we investigate the reliability of a Li 6 PS 5 Cl-based ASSB system in practically harsh but plausible storage conditions and reveal that it is vulnerable to elevated-temperature storage as low as 70 °C, which, in contrast to the common belief, causes significant degradation of the electrolyte and consequently irreversible buildup of the cell resistance. It is unraveled that this storage condition induces the decomposition of Li 6 PS 5 Cl in contact with the cathode material, involving the SO x gas evolution particularly at charged states, which creates a detrimental porous cathode/electrolyte interface, thereby leading to the large interfacial resistance. Our findings indicate that the stability of the solid electrolyte, which has been believed to be failsafe, needs to be carefully revisited at various practical operational conditions for actual applications in ASSBs.},

The broken inversion symmetry interface and the resulting electric field induce a Rashba-type spin–orbit field (SOF), which has been demonstrated to generate spin–orbit torque for data storage applications. In this study, we found that spin flipping can be achieved by the valley-Zeeman SOF in monolayer WSe 2 at room temperature, which manifests as a negative magnetoresistance in the vertical spin valve. Quantum transmission calculations based on an effective model near the K valley of WSe 2 confirm the precessional spin transport of carriers under the giant SOF, which is estimated to be 650 T. In particular, the valley-Zeeman SOF-induced spin dynamics was demonstrated to be tunable with the layer number and stacking phase of WSe 2 as well as the gate voltage, which provides a novel strategy for spin manipulation and can benefit the development of ultralow-power spintronic devices.},

In view of the realization of plasmon-enhanced devices, it is crucial to investigate the effects induced by light confinement within metallic nanostructures on the excitonic properties of these materials at the nanoscale. Here, we exploit tip-enhanced photoluminescence spectroscopy to locally control the excitons of monolayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ) coupled with gold nanotriangles in the quantum tunneling regime. The spatial resolution of 10 nm in the tip-enhanced photoluminescence measurements made it possible to image the light-emission related properties of monolayer MoS 2 across one single metallic nanostructure and to investigate the effect of the plasmonic enhancement on its photoluminescence peak. Moreover, by taking advantage of the degree of freedom given by the tuning of the tip-sample distance; it was possible to probe the effect of the plasmonic pico-cavity size on the photoluminescence quenching rate of monolayer MoS 2 .},

Their hexagonal symmetry, oxygen trigonal bipyramid coordination, and quasi-two dimensional layering give rise to properties distinct from those of the cubic AB O 3 perovskites. As bulk materials, most of the focus in this class of materials has been on the rare-earth manganites, R MnO 3 ( R = rare earth); these materials display coupled ferroelectricity and antiferromagnetic order. In this review, we focus on the thin-film manifestations of the hexagonal AB O 3 oxides. We cover the stability of the hexagonal oxides and substrates which can be used to template the hexagonal structure. We show how the thin-film geometry not only allows for further tuning of the bulk-stable manganites but also allows for the realization of metastable hexagonal oxides such as the R FeO 3 that combine ferroelectricity with weak ferromagnetic order. The thin-film geometry is a promising platform to stabilize additional metastable hexagonal oxides to search for predicted high-temperature superconductivity and topological phases in this class of materials.},

Organic transistors possess unique advantages in detecting low-amplitude signals at the physiologically relevant time scales in biotic environments, given their inherent amplification capabilities for in situ signal processing, designable flexibility, and biocompatibility features.

In this Review, we summarize the physical insights into the role of defects induced by various monomers at the molecular level on the physical properties and the structure–property relationship of defect-modified ferroelectric polymers. We focus on the fundamentals of the different structural defects on tailoring the dielectric, ferroelectric, electromechanical, and electrocaloric properties, along with the device performance enhancement in capacitors, actuators, and solid-state cooling. The influence of defects on the electric field dependence of the electrostriction and electrocaloric response is highlighted. The role of chiral defects in driving the emergent relaxor properties and morphotropic phase boundary behavior of ferroelectric polymers is discussed. Finally, we offer insightful perspectives on the challenges and opportunities in this rapidly evolving field.

We discuss the growth mechanism and fundamental challenges for vdWE on 2D substrates. We also examine emerging vdWE techniques that use epitaxial liftoff and confinement epitaxial growth in detail.

  abstract     = {Most modern high-rise buildings&#39; facades use glasses for esthetics, daylight, and better environmental view through them. However, with the increasing use of a larger area of transparent glasses as walls, the visual privacy preservation of the indoors and heat energy loss through the windows are becoming a rising concern. Recent studies showed that nearly half of the energy consumed in a building goes to heating and air conditioning while approximately 40\% of this energy is lost through windows. Windows with tunable optical properties that are generically termed “tunable windows or smart windows or switchable glass” are perceived as a potential solution for these problems. An optically tunable window can adjust the amount of daylighting passing through it, control the heat radiation, and/or change the transparency of the glasses for visual privacy preservation of indoors. Electrochromic glasses, polymer dispersed liquid crystal glasses, and suspended particle devices are available as commercial tunable windows but their high cost, limited optical performance, reliability, and operational complexity are hindering the widespread adaptation. Therefore, several other technologies for low-cost actively tunable windows capable of actively adjusting transparency are increasingly explored. However, most of such new technologies, working based on various optical principles, do not fulfill all the requirements of tunable windows. For instance, some can tune optical transmittance but do not affect energy transmission, and some can adjust heat radiation transmission but has a limited change in visual appearances. To fully take the advantage of the strengths as well as recognize the limitations of such emerging technologies, their optical principles need to be understood in-depth. Here, we review the recent developments in transmittance tunable windows by categorizing them based on the optics involved, namely, light absorption, reflection, and scattering. This in-depth review comprehensively discusses how the tunable window technologies compare to each other and offers insight into how their performance can be improved in the future.},

Conventional optical tweezers are widely based on refractive optics, and they require excessive auxiliary optical elements to reshape both amplitude and phase, as well as wavevector and angular momentum of light, and thus impose limitations on the overall cost and integration of optical systems. Metamaterials can provide both electric and optically induced magnetic responses in subwavelength optical structures, and they are highly beneficial to achieve unprecedented control of light required for many applications and can open new opportunities for optical manipulation . Here, we review the recent advances in the field of optical manipulation employing the physics and concepts of metamaterials and demonstrate that metamaterial structures could not only help to advance classical operations such as trapping, transporting, and sorting of particles, but they can uncover exotic optical forces such as pulling and lateral forces. In addition, apart from optical manipulation of particles (that can also be called “meta-tweezers”), metamaterials can be powered dynamically by light to realize ingenious “meta-robots.” This review culminates with an outlook discussing future novel opportunities in this recently emerged field ranging from enhanced particle manipulation to meta-robot actuation.},

  abstract     = {Photonic integrated circuits (PICs) based on lithographically patterned waveguides provide a scalable approach for manipulating photonic bits, enabling seminal demonstrations of a wide range of photonic technologies with desired complexity and stability. While the next generation of applications such as ultra-high speed optical transceivers, neuromorphic computing and terabit-scale communications demand further lower power consumption and higher operating frequency. Complementing the leading silicon-based material platforms, the third-generation semiconductor, silicon carbide (SiC), offers a significant opportunity toward the advanced development of PICs in terms of its broadest range of functionalities, including wide bandgap, high optical nonlinearities, high refractive index, controllable artificial spin defects and complementary metal oxide semiconductor-compatible fabrication process. The superior properties of SiC have enabled a plethora of nano-photonic explorations, such as waveguides, micro-cavities, nonlinear frequency converters and optically-active spin defects. This remarkable progress has prompted the rapid development of advanced SiC PICs for both classical and quantum applications. Here, we provide an overview of SiC-based integrated photonics, presenting the latest progress on investigating its basic optoelectronic properties, as well as the recent developments in the fabrication of several typical approaches for light confinement structures that form the basic building blocks for low-loss, multi-functional and industry-compatible integrated photonic platform. Moreover, recent works employing SiC as optically-readable spin hosts for quantum information applications are also summarized and highlighted. As a still-developing integrated photonic platform, prospects and challenges of utilizing SiC material platforms in the field of integrated photonics are also discussed.},

  abstract     = {With the increasing exhaustion of the traditional fossil energy and ongoing enhanced awareness of environment protection, research works on electrochemical energy storage (EES) devices have been indispensable. Now, a significant amount of works (design and fabrication of electrode materials, electrolytes, separators, etc.) devoted to improving energy and power density, safety, and service life of EES devices are under way to meet the demand for various applications. However, besides the intrinsic factors, the service environments of EES devices, such as ultra-low or ultra-high temperatures, external magnetic field, external stress, severe radiation, and other factors (electric field, light, etc.) in practical applications, will greatly affect their performance, particularly when applied to aerospace, submarine, polar scientific research, and so on. Yet, research works on EES devices in the extreme environments are limited, and enormous efforts are highly needed to overcome the existing fundamental and technological barriers. Herein, we mainly focus on the EES devices under particular service environments. On the one hand, we present a comprehensive analysis into the inherent effects of external service environments on electrochemical behaviors of EES devices and underlying effect mechanisms. On the other hand, a summary of recent progress in EES devices under particular service environments, including systematic experiments and simulations, is provided along with the well-established strategies/methodologies toward enhanced electrochemical properties under these external environments. Finally, current challenges and future perspectives are proposed. The review is of enormous significance for the development of advanced EES devices especially under particular service environments.},

  abstract     = {Transverse thermoelectric generators (TTEGs) have the potential to overcome two challenging problems that limit the commercial application of classical thermoelectric generators (TEGs): the significant irreversible efficiency losses in the contacts and the thermal degradation of the contacts at the hot end. TTEGs are built from a single material that can generate a thermoelectric current in a direction that is orthogonal to a temperature gradient. They only require a single set of contacts that are displaced away from the hot end. Here, we experimentally explore the device design considerations for optimizing the performance of this far less explored class of thermal-to-electric generation devices. We fabricate Re 4 Si 7 TTEGs and show that there is no measurable loss in efficiency with a single set of contacts that are midway between the hot and cold ends. We show that a new effect must be considered: the appearance of transverse thermal gradients that lead to significant differences between the performance of TTEGs implemented in isothermal and adiabatic geometries. The isothermal TTEG configuration leads to much higher device efficiencies. Overall, this work highlights how different the design of TTEGs is from that of conventional TEGs and the importance of controlling the device geometry for optimum waste heat recovery.},

  abstract     = {Quantum conductance, known as Sharvin point contact, has been extensively investigated in many electronic devices, including diodes, transistors, and switches, especially in conductive filaments-based memristors. Quantum conductance with one or multiple atoms point connection can overcome the limitations of scaling and operating speed of nonvolatile multiple memory, logic device, and brain-inspired computing systems. However, because of the instability of the atomic arrangement in the one/multiple atoms connection in a conductive filaments-based memristor, it is a great challenge to maintain quantum conductance states for a long time. Here, we demonstrate that the stable long-time retention of multi-level quantum conductance states can be realized in Mott insulator vanadium dioxide with a highly oriented crystalline texture. According to in situ transmission electron microscope, conductive atomic force microscope, and detailed energy band analysis results, it is proposed that the grain boundaries act as reservoirs for oxygen vacancies and confine the oxygen vacancy diffusion in the narrow grain boundaries due to the higher bulk diffusion barrier. Our approach is extremely crucial for realizing quantum conductance-based electronic devices, such as multi-level and high-density storage and neuromorphic computing.},

Current implementations have left a four order of magnitude gap between optical pump and electron probe resolution, which particularly hampers spatial resolution in the investigation of carrier induced local surface photovoltages. Here, we present a system capable of focusing the laser using an inverted optical microscope built into an ultrafast scanning electron microscopy setup to enable high numerical aperture pulsed optical excitation in conjunction with ultrafast electron beam probing. We demonstrate an order of magnitude improvement in optical pump resolution, bringing this to sub-micrometer length scales. We further show that temporal laser pump resolution can be maintained inside the scanning electron microscope by pre-compensating dispersion induced by the components required to bring the beam into the vacuum chamber and to a tight focus. We illustrate our approach using molybdenum disulfide, a two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenide, where we measure ultrafast carrier relaxation rates and induced negative surface potentials between different flakes selected with the scanning electron microscope as well as on defined positions within a single flake.},

However, the traditional two-terminal memristor still suffers from nonideal device characteristics, raising challenges for its further application in versatile biomimetic emulation for neuromorphic computing owing to insufficient control of filament forming for filamentary-type cells and a transport barrier for interfacial switching cells. Here, we propose three-terminal memristors with a top-gate field-effect geometry by employing a ferroelectric material, poly(vinylidene fluoride–trifluoroethylene), as the dielectric layer. This approach can finely modulate ion transport and contact barrier at the switching interface in non-filamentary perovskite memristors, thus, creating two distinct operation modes (volatile and nonvolatile). Additionally, perovskite memristors show desirable resistive switching performance, including forming-free operation, high yield of 88.9\%, cycle-to-cycle variation of 7.8\%, and low operating current of sub-100 nA. The dual-mode memristor is capable of emulating biological nociception in both active (perceiving pain) and blocked states (suppressing pain signaling).},

Here, in situ high-speed imaging and high-fidelity multi-physics modeling are leveraged to investigate flow characteristics and liquid-to-solid transformation in UADED for Inconel 718. The inertial force activated by ultrasound is revealed to drive the molten pool to flow forward and backward along the vibration direction, resulting in poor surface quality. A hybrid deposition strategy is developed to minimize ultrasound-induced defects and produce superior microstructure with alternating coarse- and fine- grains. Such a layered microstructure results in 28\% and 15\% improvement in the yield strength and ultimate tensile strength compared to the counterpart by additive manufacturing without ultrasound. This work provides unprecedented understanding into the molten pool dynamics in the UADED process as well as valuable guidance to manipulate molten pool flow.},

In this study, one of the main structural proteins in tissues and organs, collagen, was incorporated into SMHs, and by varying the fabrication procedure, two different collagen-based SMHs were obtained. The first was a collagen Cryo-gel that could immediately recover its programmed shape. The second was a fibrous collagen gel (F-gel) fabricated by collagen fibrillation that required more time for recovery but possessed a much higher shape fixity ratio and better supported cell adhesion and growth in vitro . To combine the advantages of the two hydrogels, we fabricated a new collagen-based biocomposite that incorporated fibrillated collagen and photo-crosslinkable methacrylated collagen (Col-ma).

Here, we explore the near-field response of strong coupling between propagating and localized polariton modes sustained in SiC phonon polaritonic crystals (PhPCs) to reveal the evolution of Rabi splittings with the change of lattice constant in the near-field perspective. The near-field nano-spectra of PhPCs show distinct Rabi splitting near the forbidden bands of ∼16 cm −1 in the band structures. In particular, an exotic three-polariton-coupling effect is observed with three splitting peaks in the nano-spectra induced by the interaction between local monopolar modes in nano-pillars and zone-folded phonon polaritons. Furthermore, sharp dips indicating weak near-field scatterings appear in nano-spectra at the intrinsic frequencies of the monopolar modes with strong local-field enhancement, which are estimated to be bright scattering peaks intuitively. These results would inspire the dispersion engineering and characterization of coupled phononic nano-resonators for diverse nanophotonic applications.},

This approach can induce favorable interfacial interactions between electrocatalysts and significantly improve the electron transfer kinetics of electrodes.

In addition, there is a transition from a metal state to a super-semiconducting state at near room temperatures, which is accompanied by an increase in hole carrier density and the mobility increase in electrons. For the first time, a hole-dominated carrier metal is observed in nanostructured bimetallic arrays near room temperature, and no other special conditions are required. Such a behavior is due to the generation of hot electrons and holes induced by metal plasmon resonance in the infrared range in the nanostructured bimetallic arrays.

Among these, techniques for efficient measurement of thermal transport can be a bottleneck limiting the experimental database size, especially for diverse materials with a range of roughness, porosity, and anisotropy. Traditional contact thermal measurements have challenges with throughput and the lack of spatially resolvable property mapping, while non-contact pump-probe laser methods generally need mirror smooth sample surfaces and also require serial raster scanning to achieve property mapping. Here, we present structured illumination with thermal imaging (SI-TI), a new thermal characterization tool based on parallelized all-optical heating and thermometry. Experiments on representative dense and porous bulk materials as well as a 3D printed thermoelectric thick film (∼50 μ m) demonstrate that SI-TI (1) enables paralleled measurement of multiple regions and samples without raster scanning; (2) can dynamically adjust the heating pattern purely in software, to optimize the measurement sensitivity in different directions for anisotropic materials; and (3) can tolerate rough (∼3 μ m) and scratched sample surfaces.

  abstract     = {The efficient selective and directional coupling of light to waveguiding circuitry at the nanoscale is one of the key challenges in nanophotonics, as it constitutes a prerequisite for many applications, including information processing, routing, and quantum technologies. Various exotic nanostructures and nanoparticle arrangements have been designed to achieve directional coupling with compact on-chip integration remaining one of the foremost hurdles to realizing many real-world devices. At the same time, selective coupling to one of several neighboring waveguides is much more difficult to achieve and control. To address this challenge, we demonstrate a subwavelength selective coupler integrated in a waveguide network, with selectivity controlled by wavelength, polarization, and angle of incidence. We utilize a Janus source, which is composed of a superposition of electric and magnetic dipoles, supported by a silicon nanocylinder. By placing the nanocylinder between identical single mode silicon waveguides, we successfully achieve selective coupling with a high contrast ratio between the waveguides. The operating wavelength of the Janus dipolar source can be easily tailored, and the coupling efficiency is also shown to be conveniently boosted by the addition of multiple nanocylinders. Our compact approach provides a direct path toward on-chip highly directional nanoscale sources for a plethora of applications, including information routing, metrology, and quantum technologies.},

  abstract     = {Traditional inorganic semiconductors can be electronically doped with high precision. Conversely, there is still conjecture regarding the assessment of the electronic doping density in metal-halide perovskites, not to mention of a control thereof. This paper presents a multifaceted approach to determine the electronic doping density for a range of different lead-halide perovskite systems. Optical and electrical characterization techniques, comprising intensity-dependent and transient photoluminescence, AC Hall effect, transfer-length-methods, and charge extraction measurements were instrumental in quantifying an upper limit for the doping density. The obtained values are subsequently compared to the electrode charge per cell volume under short-circuit conditions ( ⁠ C U bi / e V ⁠ ), which amounts to roughly 10 16 cm −3 . This figure of merit represents the critical limit below which doping-induced charges do not influence the device performance. The experimental results consistently demonstrate that the doping density is below this critical threshold (∼10 12 cm −3 , which means ≪ C U bi / e V ⁠ ) for all common lead-based metal-halide perovskites. Nevertheless, although the density of doping-induced charges is too low to redistribute the built-in voltage in the perovskite active layer, mobile ions are present in sufficient quantities to create space-charge-regions in the active layer, reminiscent of doped pn -junctions. These results are well supported by drift–diffusion simulations, which confirm that the device performance is not affected by such low doping densities.},

Neutron scattering is a unique and versatile characterization technique for probing the magnetic structure and behavior of materials. However, instruments at neutron scattering facilities in the world is limited, and instruments at such facilities are perennially oversubscribed. We demonstrate a significant reduction in experimental time required for neutron diffraction experiments by implementation of autonomous navigation of measurement parameter space through machine learning. Prior scientific knowledge and Bayesian active learning are used to dynamically steer the sequence of measurements. We show that ANDiE can experimentally determine the magnetic ordering transition of both MnO and Fe 1.09 Te all while providing a fivefold enhancement in measurement efficiency. Furthermore, in a hypothesis testing post-processing step, ANDiE can determine transition behavior from a set of possible physical models. ANDiE&#39;s active learning approach is broadly applicable to a variety of neutron-based experiments and can open the door for neutron scattering as a tool of accelerated materials discovery.},

  abstract     = {Highly performing mixed Sn/Pb-metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are among the most promising options to reduce Pb content in perovskite devices and enable, owing to their reduced bandgap, the fabrication of all-perovskite tandem solar cells. Whereas pure-Pb perovskite devices exhibit efficiency up to 25.5\%, alongside a high open-circuit voltage (≈1.2 V), Sn-Pb PSCs still show lower performances (22.2\%) due to higher open-circuit voltage losses. Here, we introduced 2, 3, 4, 5, 6-pentafluorophenethylammonium cations in a perovskite active layer of composition (FASnI 3 ) 0.5 (MAPbI 3 ) 0.5 to obtain highly oriented films with improved thermal stability. The treated films exhibit merged grains with no evidence of 2D structures, which could help to reduce the trap state density at the surface and grain boundaries. Solar cells fabricated with the fluorinated cation added to the active layer displayed reduced trap-assisted recombination losses and lower background carrier density, which leads to enhanced open-circuit voltages with respect to the reference samples and the active layers incorporating unfluorinated phenethylammonium cations. The best device reached an efficiency of 19.13\%, with an open-circuit voltage of 0.84 V, which is substantially improved with respect to the reference sample showing 17.47\% efficiency and 0.77 V open-circuit voltage. More importantly, the fluorinated cations&#39; addition is instrumental to improve the device&#39;s thermal stability; 90.3\% of the solar cell initial efficiency is maintained after 90 min of thermal stress at 85 °C in a nitrogen atmosphere.},

In this paper, we show that instead of using organics as a hole transporting layer, metal halide perovskite can be used to fabricate high-efficiency carbon dots-based light-emitting diodes for the first time. The organic light-emitting layer and the underlying perovskite layer combine to form an organic–inorganic perovskite planar heterojunction, and the sufficient contact at the junction takes advantage of the high charge mobility of perovskite, facilitating the hole transportation and injection. Moreover, the interaction between perovskite and the organic emitting layer can be engineered via manipulating the halogenic component, thickness, surface morphology, etc., contributing to the device optimization and the understanding of the carrier kinetics in this unique organic–inorganic hybrid optoelectronic device. Our work comprehensively evaluates the full potentials of metal halide perovskite as a hole transporting layer by uncovering the positive effect on hole transportation and injection. As a consequence, our findings open up new avenues for the development of efficient carbon dot-based light-emitting diodes.},

Despite this promising feature, the reported photodectors still suffer from relatively large dark currents at high bias voltages. To overcome this drawback, a mechanistic understanding of the photomultiplication effect in organic photodiodes is required. In this work, we advanced the performance of photomultiplication-type organic photodetectors by tuning the active layer composition and interfacial layers. The optimized devices exhibit small dark currents and flat dark current–voltage curves under the reverse bias condition up to −10 V. The optimized photodetectors also reached an ultra-high responsivity of 23.6 A/W and the specific detectivity of 1.04 × 10 12 Jones at −10 V. More importantly, we investigated the photomultiplication process with multiple transient techniques and revealed that the photoconductive gain effect is a slow process, which relies on the photo-Schottky effect enabled by charge carrier tunneling and the accumulation of holes. Furthermore, we also demonstrated prototypical pulsed-light detection based on the optimized devices, which showed great potential for real applications.},

The out-of-plane magnetization hysteresis loops and first-order reversal curves show that the nucleation and annihilation of the artificial skyrmion can be controlled by tuning the diameter of and spacing between the nanodots. Moreover, when the bottom layer thickness increases, the annihilation of skyrmion shifts from evolving into a ferromagnetic spin texture to evolving into an antiferromagnetic spin texture. Most significantly, nonvolatile multiple states are realized at zero magnetic field via controlling the proportion of the annihilated skyrmions in the skyrmion crystal. Our results demonstrate the tunability and flexibility of the artificial skyrmion platform, providing a promising route to achieve skyrmion-based multistate devices, such as neuromorphic spintronic devices.},

Merging both electronic and photonic functions in a single skin is highly desirable, but challenging and remains yet unexplored. We report herein a brand-new type of artificial intelligent skin, an optoelectronic skin ( o -skin), which combines the advantages of both e -skins and p -skins in a single skin device based on one-dimensional photonic crystal-based hydrogels. Taking advantage of its anisotropic characteristics, the resulting o -skin can easily distinguish vector stimuli such as stress type and movement direction to meet the needs of multi-dimensional perception. Furthermore, the o -skin also demonstrates advanced functions such as full-color displays and intelligent response to the environment in the form of self-adaptive camouflage.

Here, we report a distinct, giant bulk damping-like spin–orbit torque in strong-PMA ferrimagnetic Fe 100− x Tb x single layers that are integration-friendly (composition-uniform, amorphous, and sputter-deposited). For sufficiently thick layers, this bulk torque is constant in the efficiency per unit layer thickness, ξ DL j / t , with a record-high value of 0.036 ± 0.008 nm −1 , and the damping-like torque efficiency ξ DL j achieves very large values for thick layers, up to 300\% for 90 nm layers. This giant bulk torque by itself switches tens of nm thick Fe 100− x Tb x layers that have very strong PMA and high coercivity at current densities as low as a few MA/cm 2 . Surprisingly, for a given layer thickness, ξ DL j shows strong composition dependence and becomes negative for composition where the total angular momentum is oriented parallel to the magnetization rather than antiparallel. Our findings of giant bulk spin torque efficiency and intriguing torque-compensation correlation will stimulate study of such unique spin–orbit phenomena in a variety of ferrimagnetic hosts.

  abstract     = {Breakthrough of graphene dictates that decreasing dimensionality of the semiconducting materials can generate unusual electronic structures, excellent mechanical, and thermal characteristics with remarkable stability. Silicene, germanene, and stanene are the next 2D stable counterparts of other elements belonging to the same group. Since these monolayers possess hexagonal symmetry, scientists had already explored the possibility in the post graphene era of whether hexagonal symmetry was the main and utmost criterion for achieving Dirac cone. This motivation gave birth to T-graphene, a tetragonal network comprised of carbon atoms. However, T-graphene is not the only candidate for exhibiting Dirac fermion. In recent days, tetragonal monolayers of Si and Ge, i.e., T-Si and T-Ge, have been predicted to be stable. These 2D tetragonal allotropes remarkably possess double Dirac cones in their electronic band structure. As these monolayers possess buckling similar to silicene and germanene, the electronic bandgap can be easily introduced in the presence of an external electric field. Another technique to open bandgap is to apply strain in hydrogenated tetragonal networks. Tunable electronic properties in these tetragonal systems make them efficient for optoelectronics as well as thermoelectric applications. Moreover, due to delocalized π electrons, quantum dot systems comprised of tetragonal Si and Ge network show remarkable characteristics in the field of nonlinear optics. Recently, based on theoretical calculations, a bilayer T-graphene system is predicted with excellent mechanical strength relative to its monolayer variant. Not only group-IVA, group-VA elements also exhibit stable monolayer structures. Rather than T-graphene, T-Si, and T-Ge, these monolayers, however, possess intrinsic semiconducting properties, which enable them as a potential candidate for optoelectronic applications. Furthermore, several possible routes have been introduced to realize these systems experimentally. In this topical Review, we would critically explore the recent advancements of 2D tetragonal networks containing group-IVA and VA elements and their possible application perspectives in the field of thermoelectrics and nano-photonics.},

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials constitute one of the most advanced research targets in materials science and engineering in this century. Among various methods for the synthesis of 2D nanomaterials, including top-down exfoliation and bottom-up crystal growth, chemical exfoliation has been widely used to yield monolayers of various layered compounds, such as clay minerals, transition metal chalcogenides (TMDCs), and oxides, long before the discovery of graphene. Soft chemical exfoliation is a technique to weaken the layer-to-layer interaction in layered compounds by chemical modification of interlayer galleries, which promotes monolayer exfoliation. The chemical exfoliation process using organic substances, typically amines, has been applied to a range of layered metal oxides and hydroxides for two decades, establishing high-yield exfoliation into their highly crystalline monolayers and colloidal integration processes have been developed to assemble the resultant 2D nanomaterials into well-organized nanoscale devices. Recently, such a strategy was found to be effective for TMDC and MXene nanosheets, expanding the lineup of functionalities of solution-processed 2D nanomaterial devices from dielectrics, optics, magnetics, and semiconductors to superconductors. Throughout this review, we share the historical research flow, recent progress, and prospects in the development of soft-chemical exfoliation, colloidal integration, and thin film applications of oxides, TMDC, and MXene nanosheets.},

Compared with the cases of the wearable devices based on conventional rigid electronic materials, the wearable devices based on polymer nanocomposites exhibit excellent conformal contacts with the skin due to the soft mechanical properties of these nanocomposites; therefore, soft polymeric nanocomposites can be applied to stretchable wirings, electrodes, and sensor units in various on-skin electronics. The types of polymers and nanofillers used for the synthesis of these nanocomposites are critical factors determining the properties of polymer nanocomposites. The overall physical properties of nanocomposites depend on the type of polymer used, whereas the electrical properties of nanocomposites are governed by the type of nanofiller employed. Herein, we review the latest studies on the polymer nanocomposites constructed using different polymers and nanofillers that are applied to wearable devices. We have classified the polymers into non-elastic polymers, hydrogels, chemically crosslinked elastomers, and physically crosslinked elastomers and the nanofillers into C, liquid metal, Ag, Au, and other emerging nanomaterials. Detailed characteristics, fabrication methods, applications, and limitations of these nanocomposites are reviewed. Finally, a brief outlook for future research is provided.},

  abstract     = {Solar cells based on organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials have emerged as the most efficient next-generation thin-film solar cells within just a decade of research and show great promise for commercialization. As control of the thin-film microstructure of the perovskite layer is a key factor enabling high photovoltaic efficiency, good stability, and successful up-scaling of high-quality perovskite thin films for commercialization, a reliable and accurate characterization of the thin-film microstructure is paramount. X-ray diffraction (XRD)-based techniques, including conventional laboratory-based XRD and synchrotron-based grazing-incidence wide-angle x-ray scattering, are widely used to probe the microstructure of photovoltaic perovskite thin films. Nevertheless, it is common for these XRD experiments to be poorly executed and diffraction data to be improperly interpreted. This review focuses on principles of XRD techniques and their application for the characterization of the perovskite thin-film microstructure. Fundamentals of XRD techniques are presented with a strong emphasis on best practices in data collection and analysis. Approaches for the reliable and accurate extraction of microstructural information from diffraction data are discussed, including the need for simulating diffraction patterns. Applications of XRD techniques in characterizing perovskite thin films are demonstrated for both three-dimensional and layered hybrid perovskites, covering various microstructural aspects including phase identification and quantification, texture analysis, microstrain, and macrostrain as well as in situ and operando characterization. The additional subtleties and complexities associated with the XRD characterization of layered hybrid perovskites due to a more complex thin-film microstructure are discussed. Common mistakes and pitfalls that lead to misinterpretation of diffraction data are also highlighted.},

However, due to the spatial separation of the memory unit from the computing processor, continuous data movements between them result in intensive time and energy consumptions, which unfortunately hinder the further development of modern computers. Inspired by biological brain, the in situ computing of memristor architectures, which has long been considered to hold unprecedented potential to solve the von Neumann bottleneck, provides an alternative network paradigm for the next-generation electronics. Among the materials for designing memristors, i.e., nonvolatile memories with multistate tunable resistances, ferroelectric polymers have drawn much research interest due to intrinsic analog switching property and excellent flexibility. In this review, recent advances on artificial synapses based on solution-processed ferroelectric polymers are discussed. The relationship between materials&#39; properties, structural design, switching mechanisms, and systematic applications is revealed. We first introduce the commonly used ferroelectric polymers. Afterward, device structures and the switching mechanisms underlying ferroelectric synapse are discussed. The current applications of organic ferroelectric synapses in advanced neuromorphic systems are also summarized. Eventually, the remaining challenges and some strategies to eliminate non-ideality of synaptic devices are analyzed.},

Their unbalanced carrier injection and non-radiative recombination assisted by defects lead to the destruction of perovskite crystal structures and poor device stability, which hinders their commercialization process. Thus, to understand the origin of device performance, the key is to figure out the charge-carrier dynamics of the devices. In this review, the charge-carrier dynamics of perovskites are discussed, including radiative and non-radiative recombination, together with the various passivation strategies. Second, we focus on the interfacial carrier dynamics and its influence on device performance. Various strategies to improve the injection balance have been implemented to address the inherent challenges associated with PeLEDs. Last but not least, the characterization techniques of PeLEDs are provided to study the carrier dynamics of PeLEDs.},

Located between transition- and non-metals in the periodic table, post-transition elements exhibit unique properties in particular low melting points. Taking on a liquid form at low temperature, post-transition liquid metals can be used as solvents for metallic solutes. The enigmatic surface of liquid metals is also ultra-active and smooth, offering opportunities for fabricating and templating two-dimensional (2D) films. So far, various 2D materials have been harvested from the surface of liquid metals including 2D metal compounds and nonmetallic materials. Utilizing different extraction and transfer techniques, the produced 2D films can be uniformly deposited on desired substrates at large lateral dimensions. Here, we present a comprehensive overview of the fundamentals underlying post-transition-elements-based liquid metals and alloys and explain the effect of atomic level electron configurations on their characteristics. We discuss the key physical properties of liquid metals including the origin of their low melting points and their high thermal and electrical conductivities.

  abstract     = {Peptide and protein biomolecules folded into two fundamentally different conformations, either α-helical or β-sheet, carry out dissimilar biological functions. In living organisms, an α-helical secondary structure is adopted by different types of proteins such as myoglobin, keratin, collagen, and more. They can be found in diverse biological tissues of muscle, bone, cartilage, etc.. Biological functions of β-sheet peptide/protein structures are different and associated with a wide range of human mental amyloid diseases such as Alzheimer and Parkinson. The fundamental basis of these diseases is misfolding or refolding of natively soluble α-helical amyloid proteins into solid-state β-sheet fibrillary structures. Bioinspired chemically synthesized biomolecules mimic their biological counterparts. Although these artificial and biological peptides/proteins molecules are completely dissimilar in origin and environment, they demonstrate the common properties of folding and refolding into identical secondary architectures. In this review, we show that these two structural conformations, native (helix-like) and β-sheet, exhibit exclusive and different sets of fold-sensitive physical properties that are surprisingly similar in both biological and bioinspired materials. A native (helix-like) self-assembled fold having asymmetric structure demonstrates ferroelectric-like pyroelectric, piezoelectric, nonlinear optical, and electro-optical effects. β-sheet peptide/protein structures acquire unique visible fluorescence (FL) and reveal a new property of lossless FL photonic transport followed by a long-range FL waveguiding in amyloidogenic fibers. An applied thermally mediated refolding native-to-β-sheet allows us to observe adoption, disappearance, and switching of the revealed physical properties in detail in each fold and study dynamics of all critical stages of refolding from the metastable (native) helix-like conformation via intermediate disordered state to stable β-sheet fibrillary ordering. In the intermediate state, the appearance of the visible FL provides imaging, monitoring, and direct observation of the early stages of seeding and nucleation of β-sheet fibrils. The diverse fold-sensitive physical properties found, give a new insight into biological refolding processes and pave the way for the development of advanced physical methods of fold recognition, bioimaging, light theranostics at nanoscale, and peptide/protein nanophotonics from new visible FL bionanodots to bioinspired multifunctional peptide photonic chips.},

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional (2D) materials with layered structures have a variety of exceptional electronic and optical attributes for potentially developing basic functions of light wave technology from light-emitting to -modulating and -sensing. Here, we present state-of-the-art 2D materials-enabled optical intensity modulators according to their operation spectral ranges, which are mainly determined by the optical bandgaps of the 2D materials. Leveraging rich electronic structures from different 2D materials and the governed unique light–matter interactions, the working mechanisms and device architectures for the enabled modulators at specific wavelength ranges are discussed. For instance, the tunable excitonic effect in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides allows the modulation of visible light. Electro-absorptive and electro-refractive graphene modulators could be operated in the telecom-band relying on their linear dispersion of the massless Dirac fermions. The bendable electronic band edge of the narrow bandgap in few-layer black phosphorus promises the modulation of mid-infrared light via the quantum-confined Franz–Keldysh or Burstein–Moss shift effect. Electrically and magnetically tunable optical conductivity in graphene also supports the realizations of terahertz modulators. While these modulators were demonstrated as proof of concept devices, part of them have great potential for future realistic applications, as discussed with their wavelength coverage, modulation depth, insertion loss, dynamic response speed, etc. Specifically, benefiting from the well-developed technologies of photonic chips and optical fibers in telecom and datacom, the 2D materials-based modulators integrated on these photonic structures are expected to find applications in fiber and chip optical communications.

  abstract     = {One-dimensional (1D) nanoscale objects abundant in nature commonly possess hierarchical structures and are generally constructed via bottom-up self-assembly strategies. The unique high aspect ratio morphology of the assembled nanofibrillar materials, such as collagen, cellulose, and silk, together with highly ordered architectures, endows a range of remarkable functionalities in nature. Inspired by this hierarchical building principle, block copolymers (BCPs) have been developed and employed to engineer man-made functional 1D nanostructures and as models to study the self-assembly process. The rapid development of advanced polymerization techniques allows for the precise design of BCPs and the resulting assemblies with intensive studies on distinct structure–property–function relationships. In this Review, we summarize and discuss the formation of fiber-like micelles from the perspectives of fundamental driving forces and molecular interactions involved in the solution self-assembly process. Three main formation mechanisms are highlighted, including covalent bonding, volume exclusion, and crystallization, which are involved in the corresponding domains of coronal, interfacial, and core segments of BCPs. Two spatiotemporal levels of fiber-like assemblies are discussed. In addition, the emerging applications and a general guidance for the rational design of advanced BCPs are proposed in light of the unique traits of fiber-like micelles.},

To be practical, monitoring devices must be wearable, comfortable, and stable, even during exercise. This study develops a breathable, stretchable sensor sheet by employing a kirigami structure, and we examine the size dependence of electrocardiographic sensors. Because the kirigami film has many holes, sweat readily passes through the sensor from the skin to the environment. For comfort, in addition to breathability, electrocardiographic sensor size is minimized. The limitation of the size is studied in relation to the signal-to-noise ratio of electrocardiographic signals, even under exercise. We found that the optimal size of the sensor is ∼200 mm 2 and the distance between electrodes is 1.5 cm. Finally, long-term wireless electrocardiographic monitoring is demonstrated using data transmission to a smart phone app during different activities.},

  abstract     = {Composite lithium metal anodes with three-dimensional (3D) conductive fabric present great potential to be used in high-energy-density flexible batteries for next-generation wearable electronics. However, lithium dendrites at the top of the fabric anode increase the risk of separator piercing and, therefore, cause a high possibility of short circuits, especially when undergoing large mechanical deformation. To ensure the safe application of the flexible lithium metal batteries, we herein propose a 3D Janus current collector by a simple modification of the bottom side of carbon fabric (CF) with a lithiophilic Au layer to construct highly flexible, stable, and safe Li metal anodes. The Janus Au layer can guide an orientated deposition of Li to the bottom of the CF. The lithium dendrite problem can be largely alleviated due to the lithium-free interface between the anode and separator, and meanwhile, the porous upper skeleton of the CF also provides large space to buffer the volume expansion of lithium metal. The resulting composite lithium metal anode exhibits a significant improvement in the life cycle (∼two fold) compared to the traditional top deposition of lithium metal. More importantly, assembled full batteries using the Janus anode structure exhibit high stability and safety during severe mechanical deformation, indicating the opportunity of the orientated deposition strategy to be used in future flexible and wearable electronics.},

  abstract     = {Recently, significant progress has been made in the development of new techniques for the fabrication of mechanically durable, bright, and deformable electroluminescent devices, leading to the emergence of various technologies, such as soft robots, actuators, flexible/stretchable/wearable electronics, and self-healable devices. However, these devices mostly possess coplanar structures, wherein the internally generated light must be transmitted through at least one of the electrodes, and require a thin emissive layer (EML), causing low brightness and less applicability in soft devices. This is particularly challenging in the case of stretchable electroluminescent devices, which require electrodes exhibiting both high transmittance and low resistance even in the stretchable state because thin EMLs have low tolerance to external mechanical deformations. Herein, we report in-plane electric-field-driven, stretchable alternating-current electroluminescent devices with high brightness by utilizing a thick EML comprising multiple parallelly patterned silver nanowires embedded in a zinc-sulfide-embedded polydimethylsiloxane layer. Since the device is driven by an internal in-plane electric field, it can utilize a thick EML without using planar electrodes. At an electric field of 8 V/ μ m, the device showed 3.8 times higher electroluminescence luminance than a thin coplanar-structured device and achieved a maximum brightness of 1324 cd/m 2 (at 9.12 V/ μ m), suggesting that the electric field expands throughout the thick EML. Furthermore, the device exhibited strong mechanoluminescence and good durability of dual-channel luminescence under simultaneous electromechanical stimulation. We believe that our results represent a breakthrough in electroluminescence and mechanoluminescence research and provide important insights into the development of sustainable and stretchable devices with high brightness.},

  abstract     = {Exploring effective, facile, and universal tuning strategies to optimize material physicochemical properties and catalysis processes is critical for many sustainable energy systems, but still challenging. Herein, we succeed to introduce tensile strain into various perovskites via a facile thermochemical reduction method, which can greatly improve material performance for the bottleneck oxygen-evolving reaction in water electrolysis. As an ideal proof-of-concept, such a chemical-induced tensile strain turns hydrophobic Ba 5 Co 4.17 Fe 0.83 O 14- δ perovskite into the hydrophilic one by modulating its solid–liquid tension, contributing to its beneficial adsorption of important hydroxyl reactants as evidenced by fast operando spectroscopy. Both surface-sensitive and bulk-sensitive absorption spectra show that this strategy introduces oxygen vacancies into the saturated face-sharing Co-O motifs of Ba 5 Co 4.17 Fe 0.83 O 14- δ and transforms such local structures into the unsaturated edge-sharing units with positive charges and enlarged electrochemical active areas, creating a molecular-level hydroxyl pool. Theoretical computations reveal that this strategy well reduces the thermodynamic energy barrier for hydroxyl adsorption, lowers the electronic work function, and optimizes the charge/electrostatic potential distribution to facilitate the electron transport between active sites and hydroxyl reactants. Also, this strategy is reliable for other single, double, and Ruddlesden–Popper perovskites. We believe that this finding will enlighten rational material design and in-depth understanding for many potential applications.},

In this work, we develop a data-driven framework to recover the sample parameters from polarized neutron reflectometry data with minimal user intervention. We train a variational autoencoder to map reflectometry profiles with moderate experimental noise to an interpretable, low-dimensional space from which sample parameters can be extracted with high resolution. We apply our method to recover the scattering length density profiles of the topological insulator–ferromagnetic insulator heterostructure Bi 2 Se 3 /EuS exhibiting proximity magnetism in good agreement with the results of conventional fitting. We further analyze a more challenging reflectometry profile of the topological insulator–antiferromagnet heterostructure (Bi, Sb) 2 Te 3 /Cr 2 O 3 and identify possible interfacial proximity magnetism in this material.

The addition of 10 nm thick manganese interlayer provides optimal organic thin film transistor device performance with the lowest level of contact resistance. Improved organic thin film transistors were characterized using an improved organic virtual-source emission diffusion model, which provides a simple and effective method to extract the critical device parameters. The organic virtual-source emission diffusion model led to nearly perfect prediction using effective gate voltages and a gate dependant contact resistance, providing a significant improvement over common metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor models such as the Shichman–Hodges model.},

For the next generation of fully organic devices, molecular exchange bias, if existing, could have a huge impact for developing mechanically soft and environment friendly devices. The observation of molecular exchange bias has been reported recently in hybrid systems where a metallic ferromagnet is exchanged biased by an organic film, and it is considered to be a spinterface effect. To understand this effect, we investigate if the molecular exchange bias exists in Co/metal tetra-phenyl porphyrin hybrid bilayer systems. The molecular exchange bias is never observed when the samples are properly encapsulated, and when the exchange bias is eventually observed, it is not a spinterface effect, but it results from air-driven partial oxidation of the cobalt film transforming part of the metallic cobalt into a cobalt oxide that is well known to induce exchange bias effects. Surprisingly, oxidation is very difficult to prevent even by using very thick metallic encapsulating layers. A similar effect is observed in the Co/metal-phthalocyanine bilayer system, showing that the molecular exchange bias is not a spinterface effect also in the hybrid system in which this effect was originally discovered.},

To address this challenge, we herein report a pre-inserted dual-cation vanadate (Na x Zn y V 3 O 8 ·nH 2 O) cathode, which combines the Zn 2+ -reinforced cathode structure with the Na + -enlarged lattice distance for fast and stable Zn 2+ migration. Multiple ex situ analysis found that electrochemically active Zn 3 (OH) 2 V 2 O 7 ·2H 2 O was generated after discharging, and this corresponds to the efficient suppression of vanadium dissolution by strong ionic bonding. As a result, a certain Na x Zn y V 3 O 8 ·nH 2 O cathode having a Na + to Zn 2+ ratio of 2:1 retains 99.6\% of capacity after 418 cycles at 0.1 A g −1 , 90.5\% after 6000 cycles at 1.0 A g −1 , and 96.7\% after 9499 cycles at 10.0 A g −1 .

Although an intense focus has been put on the design of new organic semiconductors, fewer efforts are directed toward the development of optimized electrolytes. However, the electrolyte is an integral part of OECTs and strongly influences the transient responses of these devices. Also, best performing OECTs currently use liquid electrolytes, but there is a growing need for solid electrolytes, as they can be easily integrated into wearable devices. In this paper, we demonstrate that ionic liquid crystal elastomers (iLCEs) can be used as solid electrolytes of flexible, substrate-free organic electrochemical transistors. We introduce the alignment of the director of the liquid crystal elastomers as a new parameter to tune and improve both steady state and transient responses. The normalized maximum transconductance g m /w of the most sensitive iLCE was found to be the highest (7 Sm −1 ) among all solid state-based OECTs.},

The Thomson coefficient of FeRh-based alloys reaches large values approaching –1000 μ V K −1 around room temperature because of the steep temperature dependence of the Seebeck coefficient associated with the antiferromagnetic–ferromagnetic phase transition. The Thomson coefficient is several orders of magnitude larger than the Seebeck coefficient of the alloys. Using the active thermography technique, we demonstrate that the Thomson cooling can be much larger than Joule heating in the same material even in a nearly steady state. The operation temperature of the giant Thomson effect in the FeRh-based alloys can be tuned over a wide range by applying an external magnetic field or by slightly changing the composition. Our findings provide a new direction in the materials science of thermoelectrics and pave the way for thermal management applications using the Thomson effect.},

  abstract     = {Practical applications of next-generation stretchable electronics hinge on the development of sustained power supplies to drive highly sensitive on-skin sensors and wireless transmission modules. Although the manufacture of stretchable self-charging power units has been demonstrated by integrating stretchable energy harvesters and power management circuits with energy storage units, they often suffer from low and unstable output power especially under mechanical deformation and human movements, as well as complex and expensive fabrication processes. This work presents a low-cost, scalable, and facile manufacturing approach based on laser-induced graphene foams to yield a self-powered wireless sensing platform. 3D porous foams with high specific surface area and excellent charge transport provide an efficient flow of triboelectric electrons in triboelectric nanogenerators. The surface coating or doping with second laser irradiation on these foams can also form a 3D composite to provide high energy density in micro-supercapacitor arrays. The integration of a triboelectric nanogenerator and power management circuits with micro-supercapacitor arrays can efficiently harvest intermittent mechanical energy from body movements into stable power output. 3D foams and their composites patterned into various geometries conveniently create various deformable sensors on large scale at low cost. The generated stable, yet high, power with adjustable voltage and current outputs drives various stretchable sensors and wireless transmission modules to wirelessly measure pulse, strain, temperature, electrocardiogram, blood pressure, and blood oxygen. The self-powered, wireless, wearable sensing platform paves the way to wirelessly detect clinically relevant biophysical and biochemical signals for early disease diagnostics and healthy aging.},

  abstract     = {Deterministic solid state quantum light sources are considered key building blocks for future communication networks. While several proof-of-principle experiments of quantum communication using such sources have been realized, most of them required large setups—often involving liquid helium infrastructure or bulky closed-cycle cryotechnology. In this work, we report on the first quantum key distribution (QKD) testbed using a compact benchtop quantum dot single-photon source operating at telecom wavelengths. The plug&amp;play device emits single-photon pulses at O-band wavelengths (1321 nm) and is based on a directly fiber-pigtailed deterministically fabricated quantum dot device integrated into a compact Stirling cryocooler. The Stirling is housed in a 19 in. rack module including all accessories required for stand-alone operation. Implemented in a simple QKD testbed emulating the BB84 protocol with polarization coding, we achieve an multiphoton suppression of g ( 2 ) ( 0 ) = 0.10 ± 0.01 and a raw key rate of up to ( 4.72 ± 0.13 ) kHz using an external pump laser. In this setting, we further evaluate the performance of our source in terms of the quantum bit error ratios, secure key rates, and tolerable losses expected in full implementations of QKD while accounting for finite key size effects. Furthermore, we investigate the optimal settings for a two-dimensional temporal acceptance window applied on the receiver side, resulting in predicted tolerable losses up to 23.19 dB. Not least, we compare our results with previous proof-of-concept QKD experiments using quantum dot single-photon sources. Our study represents an important step forward in the development of fiber-based quantum-secured communication networks exploiting sub-Poissonian quantum light sources.},

  abstract     = {In a blueprint for topological electronics, edge state transport in a topological insulator material can be controlled by employing a gate-induced topological quantum phase transition. Here, by studying the width dependence of electronic properties, it is inferred that zigzag-Xene nanoribbons are promising materials for topological electronics with a display of unique physical characteristics associated with the intrinsic band topology and the finite-size effects on gate-induced topological switching. First, due to intertwining with intrinsic band topology-driven energy-zero modes in the pristine case, spin-filtered chiral edge states in zigzag-Xene nanoribbons remain gapless and protected against backward scattering even with finite inter-edge overlapping in ultra-narrow ribbons, i.e., a 2D quantum spin Hall material turns into a 1D topological metal. Second, mainly due to width- and momentum-dependent tunability of the gate-induced inter-edge coupling, the threshold-voltage required for switching between gapless and gapped edge states reduces as the width decreases, without any fundamental lower bound. Third, when the width of zigzag-Xene nanoribbons is smaller than a critical limit, topological switching between edge states can be attained without bulk bandgap closing and reopening. This is primarily due to the quantum confinement effect on the bulk band spectrum, which increases the nontrivial bulk bandgap with decrease in width. The existence of such protected gapless edge states and reduction in threshold-voltage accompanied by enhancement in the bulk bandgap overturns the general wisdom of utilizing narrow-gap and wide channel materials for reducing the threshold-voltage in a standard field effect transistor analysis and paves the way toward low-voltage topological devices.},

  abstract     = {Recent experiments on bulk Zintl CaAl 2 Si 2 reveal the presence of nontrivial topological states. However, the large family of two-dimensional (2D) Zintl materials remains unexplored. Using first-principles calculations, we discuss the stability and topological electronic structures of 12 Zintl single-quintuple-layer (1-QL) AM 2 X 2 compounds in the CaAl 2 Si 2 -structure (A = Ca, Sr, or Ba; M = Zn or Cd; and X = Sb or Bi). Considering various layer-stackings, we show that the M-X-A-X-M stacking, where the transition metal M is exposed, is energetically most favorable. Phonon dispersion computations support the thermodynamic stability of all the investigated compounds. Nontrivial topological properties are ascertained through the calculation of Z 2 invariants and edge states using the hybrid functional. Insulating topological phases driven by a band inversion at the Γ-point involving Bi-( p x + p y ) orbitals are found in CaZn 2 Bi 2 , SrZn 2 Bi 2 , BaZn 2 Bi 2 , CaCd 2 Bi 2 , SrCd 2 Bi 2 , and BaCd 2 Bi 2 with bandgaps (eV) of 0.571, 0.500, 0.025, 0.774, 0.650, and 0.655, respectively. Interestingly, van Hove singularities are found in CaCd 2 Bi 2 and BaCd 2 Bi 2 , implying the possibility of coexisting insulating and superconducting topological phases. We discuss how topological 1-QL Zintl compounds could be synthesized through atomic substitutions resulting in Janus materials (1-QL AM 2 XY). In particular, the thermodynamically stable Janus BaCd 2 SbBi film is shown to exhibit both an insulating topological state and the Rashba effect. Our study identifies a new family of materials for developing 2D topological materials platforms and paves the way for the discovery of 2D topological superconductors.},

  abstract     = {Cr (1+δ) Te 2 are pseudo-layered compounds consisting of CrTe 2 transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) layers with additional (δ) self-intercalated Cr atoms. The recent search for ferromagnetic 2D materials revived the interest into chromium tellurides. Here, Cr (1+δ) Te 2 nanolayers are epitaxially grown on MoS 2 (0001), forming prototypical van der Waals heterostructures. Under optimized growth conditions, ultrathin films of only two TMD layers with a single intercalated Cr-layer are achieved, forming a 2D sheet with van der Waals surfaces. Detailed compositional and structural characterization by scanning tunneling microscopy, grazing incidence x-ray diffraction, and high-resolution Rutherford backscattering indicate the layer-by-layer growth and that the δ can be tuned by post-growth annealing in a range between ∼0.5 and 1. X-ray magnetic circular dichroism and magnetometry measurements demonstrate that all self-intercalated Cr (1+δ) Te 2 nanolayers exhibit strong ferromagnetism with magnetic moments larger than 3 μ B per Cr-atom. The magnetic properties are maintained in the ultrathin limit of a material with a single intercalation layer. Interestingly, the magnetic anisotropy can be tuned from close to isotropic (δ = 1) to a desirable perpendicular anisotropy for low δ values. Thus, the bottom-up growth of these 2D Cr (1+δ) Te 2 sheets is a promising approach for designing magnetic van der Waals heterostructures.},

  abstract     = {For an engineered thick tissue construct to be alive and sustainable, it should be perfusable with respect to nutrients and oxygen. Embedded printing and then removing sacrificial inks in a cross-linkable yield-stress hydrogel matrix bath can serve as a valuable tool for fabricating perfusable tissue constructs. The objective of this study is to investigate the printability of sacrificial inks and the creation of perfusable channels in a cross-linkable yield-stress hydrogel matrix during embedded printing. Pluronic F-127, methylcellulose, and polyvinyl alcohol are selected as three representative sacrificial inks for their different physical and rheological properties. Their printability and removability performances have been evaluated during embedded printing in a gelatin microgel-based gelatin composite matrix bath, which is a cross-linkable yield-stress bath. The ink printability during embedded printing is different from that during printing in air due to the constraining effect of the matrix bath. Sacrificial inks with a shear-thinning property are capable of printing channels with a broad range of filaments by simply tuning the extrusion pressure. Bi-directional diffusion may happen between the sacrificial ink and matrix bath, which affects the sacrificial ink removal process and final channel diameter. As such, sacrificial inks with a low diffusion coefficient for gelatin precursor are desirable to minimize the diffusion from the gelatin precursor solution to minimize the post-printing channel diameter variation. For feasibility demonstration, a multi-channel perfusable alveolar mimic has been successfully designed, printed, and evaluated. The study results in the knowledge of the channel diameter controllability and sacrificial ink removability during embedded printing.},

  abstract     = {Spin–orbit torque induced ferromagnetic magnetization switching brought by injecting a charge current into strong spin–orbit-coupling materials is an energy-efficient writing method in emerging magnetic memories and spin logic devices. However, because of the short spin coherence length in ferromagnetic layers, the interfacial effective spin–orbit torque typically leads to high critical current density for switching thick ferromagnet, which goes against low-power and high-density requirements. Here, we experimentally demonstrate efficient bulk spin–orbit torque-driven perpendicular magnetization switching under relatively low critical current density in thick Pt/Co multilayers with gradient-induced symmetry breaking. Through tuning the thickness gradient of Pt, the spin–orbit torque efficiency and switching chirality can be highly controlled, which also indicates that net spin current arises from gradient. Meanwhile, x-ray absorption spectroscopy results reveal that the atomic intermixing can significantly enhance the spin–orbit torque efficiency through improving the strength of spin–orbit-coupling of Pt. We also establish a micromagnetic model by taking both gradient-induced and intermixing-enhanced spin–orbit torque into account to well describe the experimental observations. This work would blaze a promising avenue to develop novel spin–orbit torque devices for high-performance spintronic memory and computation systems.},

Since the early 2000s, there has been notable progress in the automation of each step of the scientific process. With recent advances in using machine learning for hypothesis generation and artificial intelligence for decision-making, the opportunity to automate the entire closed-loop process has emerged as an exciting research frontier.

These are particularly enticing in resonant NEMS enabled by emerging two-dimensional (2D) layered crystals, toward revealing fundamental limits and potential of 2D NEMS in both science explorations and engineering applications. Fortunately, their ultimately thin nature and unconventional elastic properties offer rich opportunities for manipulating oscillations via parametric and nonlinear effects. Here, we report on the experimental demonstration of giant parametric amplification and spectral linewidth narrowing in atomically thin molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ) 2D NEMS resonators vibrating at ∼30–60 MHz. Parametric amplification is examined by photothermally modulating the stiffness of each atomic layer resonator at twice its resonance frequency (2 f ). Thanks to exceptionally efficient parametric effects in these atomically thin membranes, the parametric amplification of undriven thermomechanical resonance leads to giant parametric gains up to 3605 (71 dB) and spectral linewidth narrowing factors up to 1.8 × 10 5 , before the onset of parametric oscillation. The remarkable parametric amplification and spectral narrowing (including effective Q boosting in the sub-threshold regime) in 2D NEMS validated in this study may open new possibilities for creating ultimately thin yet high-performance resonators and oscillators for signal transduction and sensing in classical and quantum engineering applications.},

However, finding inexpensive MGs is daunting; finding one with enhanced wear resistance is a further challenge. Relying on machine learning (ML) predictions of MGs alone requires a highly precise model; however, incorporating high-throughput (HiTp) experiments into the search rapidly leads to higher performing materials even from moderately accurate models. Here, we exploit this synergy between ML predictions and HiTp experimentation to discover new hard and wear-resistant MGs in the Fe–Nb–B ternary material system. Several of the new alloys exhibit hardness greater than 25 GPa, which is over three times harder than hardened stainless steel and only surpassed by diamond and diamond-like carbon. This ability to use less than perfect ML predictions to successfully guide HiTp experiments, demonstrated here, is especially important for searching the vast Multi-Principal-Element-Alloy combinatorial space, which is still poorly understood theoretically and sparsely explored experimentally.},

  abstract     = {The widespread application of high-frequency electronic and communication devices has caused increasingly severe electromagnetic pollution. It is highly desirable but challenging to develop ultralight electromagnetic wave (EMW) absorbers with strong absorption performance to eliminate the negative effects of electromagnetic pollution. Herein, a secondary ion adsorption and defect-anchoring strategy was proposed to construct ultralight N-doped graphene aerogels containing isolated single cobalt atoms (Co-SAs/GAs) with a tunable content of Co-SAs from 1.13 to 2.58 wt.\%. The optimal Co-SAs/GAs with a matching thickness of 1.5 mm and an ultralow filler ratio of 5 wt.\% attenuated about 99.999\% electromagnetic energy and exhibited specific EMW absorption performance (SMAP) of 37 220 dB cm 2 g −1 , which was 15 000 dB cm 2 g −1 higher than that of the best reported absorber in literature. Permittivity and electrical conductivity measurements indicated that the introduction of Co-SAs significantly increased the conduction and polarization losses of the GAs, which was confirmed by simulation results based on the Havriliak–Negami equation. Theoretical calculations demonstrated that the Co–N 4 moiety exhibited obvious polarization behavior, which could be further tuned by defective sites in its vicinity. This comprehensive investigation of the relationships between single-atom structure and electromagnetic wave absorption property provides an efficient route toward the rational design of ultralight absorbers with metal single-atoms.},

Herein, we develop galvanically replaced artificial interfacial layers, where Sn, Sb, and Bi layers are uniformly grown on Zn anodes, for use in high-performance aqueous rechargeable zinc batteries. The corrosion and dendrite formation of Zn metal are inhibited by manipulating the uniform Zn deposition behavior and facile plating/stripping, as verified by electrochemical characterizations and postmortem, in situ optical, and computational analyses. Considering that the thickness, morphology, and crystallinity of the interfacial layers vary depending on their chemical identity, the Sn modified Zn anode (Zn|Sn) exhibits the optimum electrochemical performance owing to its highest Zn affinity and hierarchical structure. Consequently, symmetric cells with Zn|Sn anodes demonstrate stable plating/stripping over 2200 h at 1 mA cm −2 and a long cycle life of 2000 h at a high current density of 4 mA cm −2 . In particular, the full cells by pairing Zn|Sn with β-MnO 2 deliver a high capacity of 92.8 mA h g −1 even at a high current rate of 5000 mA g −1 , 73\% capacity retention after 1000 cycles at 1000 mA g −1 , and improved cycle stability under low N/P ratio (&lt;50) and high cathode mass loading (∼15.8 mg cm −2 ).},

The practical use of three-dimensional (3D) nanostructured materials breaks several limitations of conventional sensors, including the large surface-to-volume ratio, precisely tunable pore size and porosity, and efficient signal transduction of 3D geometries. This review provides an in-depth discussion on recent advances in chemical and mechanical sensors based on 3D nanostructures, which are rationally designed and manufactured by advanced 3D nanofabrication techniques that consider structural factors (e.g., porosity, periodicity, and connectivity). In particular, we focus on a proximity-field nanopatterning technique that specializes in the production of periodic porous 3D nanostructures that satisfy the structural properties universally required to improve the performance of various sensor systems. State-of-the-art demonstrations of high-performance sensor devices such as supersensitive gas sensors and wearable strain sensors realized through designed 3D nanostructures are summarized. Finally, challenges and outlooks related to nanostructures and nanofabrication for the practical application of 3D nanostructure-based sensor systems are proposed.},

We critically review the resulting treatment of corrosion initiation and propagation as two distinct, successive stages. We conclude that this concept presents a major barrier for developing reliable corrosion forecast models, and that a new approach is needed. In reality, steel corrosion in concrete is a continuous process, that is, rarely separable into uncoupled, sequential phases. We propose that the focus be placed on the quantification of the time- and space-variant corrosion rate from the moment steel is placed in concrete until it reaches the end of the service life. To achieve this, a multi-scale and multi-disciplinary approach is required to combine the scientific and practical contributions from materials science, corrosion science, cement/concrete research, and structural engineering.},

Their functionality is a ubiquitous aspect of our lives. We use wood to construct furniture, bacterial colonies to modify the texture of dairy products and other foods, intestines as violin strings, bladders in bagpipes, and so on. The mechanical properties of these biological materials differ from those of other simpler synthetic elastomers, glasses, and crystals. Reproducing their mechanical properties synthetically or from first principles is still often unattainable. The challenge is that biomaterials often exist far from equilibrium, either in a kinetically arrested state or in an energy consuming active state that is not yet possible to reproduce de novo. Also, the design principles that form biological materials often result in nonlinear responses of stress to strain, or force to displacement, and theoretical models to explain these nonlinear effects are in relatively early stages of development compared to the predictive models for rubberlike elastomers or metals. In this Review, we summarize some of the most common and striking mechanical features of biological materials and make comparisons among animal, plant, fungal, and bacterial systems. We also summarize some of the mechanisms by which living systems develop forces that shape biological matter and examine newly discovered mechanisms by which cells sense and respond to the forces they generate themselves, which are resisted by their environment, or that are exerted upon them by their environment. Within this framework, we discuss examples of how physical methods are being applied to cell biology and bioengineering.},

Herein, the lessons learned over three decades of research, innovations, and designs on electrospinning products are discussed in detail. The historical developments, engineering, and future opportunities of electrospun nanofibers (ESNFs) are critically addressed. The laboratory-to-industry transition gaps for electrospinning technology and ESNFs products, the potential of electrospun nanostructured materials for various applications, and academia-industry comparison are comprehensively analyzed. The current challenges and future trends regarding the use of this technology to fabricate promising nano/macro-products are critically demonstrated. We show that future research on electrospinning should focus on theoretical and technological developments to achieve better maneuverability during large-scale fiber formation, redesigning the electrospinning process around decarbonizing the materials processing to align with the sustainability agenda and the integration of electrospinning technology with the tools of intelligent manufacturing and IR 4.0.},

We review the linear stability analysis of oscillatory systems that operate by current–voltage control using the method of impedance spectroscopy. Based on a general minimal model that contains a fast-destabilizing variable and a slow stabilizing variable, a set of characteristic frequencies that determine the shape of the spectra and the associated dynamical regimes are derived. We apply this method to several self-sustained rhythmic oscillations in the FitzHugh–Nagumo neuron, the Koper–Sluyters electrocatalytic system, and potentiostatic oscillations of a semiconductor device. There is a deep and physically grounded analogy between different oscillating systems: neurons, electrochemical, and semiconductor devices, as they are controlled by similar fundamental processes unified in the equivalent circuit representation. The unique impedance spectroscopic criteria for widely different variables and materials across several fields provide insight into the dynamical properties and enable the investigation of new systems such as artificial neurons for neuromorphic computation.},

Moreover, nanomaterial-based PDT and PTT match the simultaneous immune therapy and increase the immune system stimulation resulting from the denaturation of cancer cells. Nevertheless, nanomaterials should have sufficient biocompatibility and efficiency to meet PDT and PTT requirements as therapeutic agents.

Rather, at the free surfaces of glassy materials with arrested bulk dynamics, a highly mobile ultrathin layer is present, wherein molecular mobility is much faster than in the bulk. Enhanced surface mobility has become an important scientific concept and is intrinsic and universal to various categories of glasses (e.g., molecular, metallic, and polymeric glasses), thus having technological implications for processing and applications of glasses. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the historical evolution of the concept, characterization, theoretical modeling, and unique features of dynamics at the surfaces of glasses.

Based on literature availability, we review the temperature dependence of properties such as bandgap energy and carrier mobility among the oxides. Infrared and Raman modes are presented and discussed for each oxide providing insight into the phonon properties. The phonon properties also provide an explanation as to why some of the oxide parameters experience limitations due to phonon scattering such as carrier mobility. Thermal properties of interest include the coefficient of thermal expansion, Debye temperature, thermal diffusivity, specific heat, and thermal conductivity. Anisotropy is evident in the non-cubic oxides, and its impact on bandgap energy, carrier mobility, thermal conductivity, coefficient of thermal expansion, phonon modes, and carrier effective mass is discussed.

Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) are gradually reshaping the landscape of meta-imaging. Most recent works use AI for data analysis, but some also use it to program the physical meta-hardware. The role of “intelligence” in the measurement process and its implications for critical metrics like latency are often not immediately clear. Here, we comprehensively review the evolution of computational meta-imaging from the earliest frequency-diverse compressive systems to modern programmable intelligent meta-imagers. We introduce a clear taxonomy in terms of the flow of task-relevant information that has direct links to information theory: compressive meta-imagers indiscriminately acquire all scene information in a task-agnostic measurement process that aims at a near-isometric embedding; intelligent meta-imagers highlight task-relevant information in a task-aware measurement process that is purposefully non-isometric. The measurement process of intelligent meta-imagers is, thus, simultaneously an analog wave processor that implements a first task-specific inference step “over-the-air.” We provide explicit design tutorials for the integration of programmable meta-atoms as trainable physical weights into an intelligent end-to-end sensing pipeline. This merging of the physical world of metamaterial engineering and the digital world of AI enables the remarkable latency gains of intelligent meta-imagers. We further outline emerging opportunities for cognitive meta-imagers with reverberation-enhanced resolution, and we point out how the meta-imaging community can reap recent advances in the vibrant field of metamaterial wave processors to reach the holy grail of low-energy ultra-fast all-analog intelligent meta-sensors.},

These transiently occupied states are termed “metastable” and have been linked to important sensory and cognitive functions. In the rodent gustatory cortex, for instance, metastable dynamics have been associated with stimulus coding, with states of expectation, and with decision making. In frontal, parietal, and motor areas of macaques, metastable activity has been related to behavioral performance, choice behavior, task difficulty, and attention. In this article, we review the experimental evidence for neural metastable dynamics together with theoretical approaches to the study of metastable activity in neural circuits. These approaches include (i) a theoretical framework based on non-equilibrium statistical physics for network dynamics; (ii) statistical approaches to extract information about metastable states from a variety of neural signals; and (iii) recent neural network approaches, informed by experimental results, to model the emergence of metastable dynamics. By discussing these topics, we aim to provide a cohesive view of how transitions between different states of activity may provide the neural underpinnings for essential functions such as perception, memory, expectation, or decision making, and more generally, how the study of metastable neural activity may advance our understanding of neural circuit function in health and disease.},

Vectorial metasurface holography, which not only controls the intensity profile, but also modifies the polarization distributions of the light field, has recently attracted enormous attention due to their promising applications in photonics and optics. Here, we review the recent progresses of the vectorial metasurface holography, from the basic concept to the practical implementation.

  abstract     = {For photonic devices, structural disorder and light scattering have long been considered annoying and detrimental features that were best avoided or minimized. This review shows that disorder and complexity can be harnessed for photonic device applications. Compared to ordered systems, disordered systems provide much more possibilities and diverse optical responses. They have been used to create physical unclonable functions for secret key generation, and more recently for random projection, high-dimensional matrix multiplication, and reservoir computing. Incorporating structural disorder enables novel devices with unique functionalities as well as multi-functionality. A random system can function as an optical lens, a spectrometer, a polarimeter, and a radio frequency receiver. It is also employed for optical pulse measurement and full-field recovery. Multi-functional disordered photonic devices have been developed for hyperspectral imaging, spatial, and spectral polarimetry. In addition to passive devices, structural disorder has been incorporated to active devices. One prominent example is the random laser, which enables speckle-free imaging, super-resolution spectroscopy, broad tunability of high-power fiber laser, and suppression of lasing instabilities. Disordered devices have low fabrication costs, and their combination with advanced computational techniques may lead to a paradigm shift in photonics and optical engineering.},

  abstract     = {Leon Chua&#39;s Local Activity theory quantitatively relates the compact model of an isolated nonlinear circuit element, such as a memristor, to its potential for desired dynamical behaviors when externally coupled to passive elements in a circuit. However, the theory&#39;s use has often been limited to potentially unphysical toy models and analyses of small-signal linear circuits containing pseudo-elements (resistors, capacitors, and inductors), which provide little insight into required physical, material, and device properties. Furthermore, the Local Activity concept relies on a local analysis and must be complemented by examining dynamical behavior far away from the steady-states of a circuit. In this work, we review and study a class of generic and extended one-dimensional electro-thermal memristors (i.e., temperature is the sole state variable), re-framing the analysis in terms of physically motivated definitions and visualizations to derive intuitive compact models and simulate their dynamical behavior in terms of experimentally measurable properties, such as electrical and thermal conductance and capacitance and their derivatives with respect to voltage and temperature. Within this unified framework, we connect steady-state phenomena, such as negative differential resistance, and dynamical behaviors, such as instability, oscillations, and bifurcations, through a set of dimensionless nonlinearity parameters. In particular, we reveal that the reactance associated with electro-thermal memristors is the result of a phase shift between oscillating current and voltage induced by the dynamical delay and coupling between the electrical and thermal variables. We thus, demonstrate both the utility and limitations of local analyses to understand non-local dynamical behavior. Critically for future experimentation, the analyses show that external coupling of a memristor to impedances within modern sourcing and measurement instruments can dominate the response of the total circuit, making it impossible to characterize the response of an uncoupled circuit element for which a compact model is desired. However, these effects can be minimized by proper understanding of the Local Activity theory to design and utilize purpose-built instruments.},

Hafnia (HfO 2 )-based materials have attracted significant interest due to the advantages of complementary-metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) compatibility, large coercive voltage, and superior ferroelectricity at an ultra-thin thickness. The comparable ferroelectricity to that of traditional perovskite materials and size advantage of HfO 2 result in fascinating storage performance, which can be readily applicable to the fields of integrated non-volatile memories. This Review provides a comprehensive overview of recent developments in HfO 2 -based ferroelectrics with attention to the origin of ferroelectricity, performance modulation, and recent achievements in the material. Moreover, potential solutions to existing challenges associated with the materials are discussed in detail, including the wake-up effect, long-term fatigue behavior, and imprint challenges, which pave the way for obtaining HfO 2 -based ferroelectric materials and devices with long service life and high stability. Finally, the range of potential applications for these fascinating new materials is presented and summarized, which include non-volatile memories and neuromorphic systems. This Review intends to present the state-of-the-art HfO 2 -based ferroelectrics and to highlight the current challenges, possible applications, and future opportunities and can act as an update for recent developments in these intriguing materials and provide guidance for future researchers in the design and optimization of HfO 2 -based ferroelectric materials and devices.},

  abstract     = {There has been a challenge for many decades to understand how heterogeneities influence the behavior of materials under shock loading, eventually leading to spall formation and failure. Experimental, analytical, and computational techniques have matured to the point where systematic studies of materials with complex microstructures under shock loading and the associated failure mechanisms are feasible. This is enabled by more accurate diagnostics as well as characterization methods. As interest in complex materials grows, understanding and predicting the role of heterogeneities in determining the dynamic behavior becomes crucial. Early computational studies, hydrocodes, in particular, historically preclude any irregularities in the form of defects and impurities in the material microstructure for the sake of simplification and to retain the hydrodynamic conservation equations. Contemporary computational methods, notably molecular dynamics simulations, can overcome this limitation by incorporating inhomogeneities albeit at a much lower length and time scale. This review discusses literature that has focused on investigating the role of various imperfections in the shock and spall behavior, emphasizing mainly heterogeneities such as second-phase particles, inclusions, and voids under both shock compression and release. Pre-existing defects are found in most engineering materials, ranging from thermodynamically necessary vacancies, to interstitial and dislocation, to microstructural features such as inclusions, second phase particles, voids, grain boundaries, and triple junctions. This literature review explores the interaction of these heterogeneities under shock loading during compression and release. Systematic characterization of material heterogeneities before and after shock loading, along with direct measurements of Hugoniot elastic limit and spall strength, allows for more generalized theories to be formulated. Continuous improvement toward time-resolved, in situ experimental data strengthens the ability to elucidate upon results gathered from simulations and analytical models, thus improving the overall ability to understand and predict how materials behave under dynamic loading.},

  abstract     = {Persistent room temperature phosphorescence ( p RTP) is important to high-resolution imaging independent of autofluorescence and the scattering of excitation light for security and imaging applications. Although efficient and bright p RTP is crucial to imaging applications, photophysical processes from the triple states of heavy-atom-free chromophores have been explained by making many assumptions that are potentially based on incorrect photophysical explanations. This often confuses researchers in their efforts to control and enhance the p RTP characteristics. This paper introduces recent advances in our understanding of photophysical processes from the lowest triplet excited state of heavy-atom-free chromophores based on statistical evidence from experimental and theoretical viewpoints. After the introduction of two photophysical processes showing persistent RT emissions and the characteristics of the persistent emissions, physical parameters relating to p RTP and appropriate techniques for measuring the parameters are explained. For molecularly dispersed heavy-metal-free chromophores in a solid state, recent understandings of the physical parameters verified by correlations from optically estimated and theoretical viewpoints are summarized. Using the photophysical insights obtained for the dispersed chromophores, uncertainties regarding the photophysical processes of aggregated chromophores are discussed. After highlighting recently developed materials showing efficient p RTP, the potential advantages of p RTP over previous persistent emissions are discussed considering recent demonstrations of persistent emitters. This review quantitatively summarizes the relationship between the molecular backbone and physical parameters of p RTP characteristics and guides the reader in their efforts to appropriately design materials with efficient p RTP and control long-lived triplet excitons for promising applications.},

Thermoelectric materials enable an environmentally friendly conversion between heat and electricity, and therefore serve as an optimum candidate for solving the current dilemma and contribute to the carbon-neutral target. Among the thermoelectric family, layered materials have shared a great portion with impressive thermoelectric performance originating from their (quasi-)two-dimensional crystal structure with hierarchical bonding, i.e., strong intralayer and weak interlayer bonds. This structure and bonding feature is believed to be propitious to low lattice thermal conductivity, low-dimensional electrical features, and anisotropic electron and phonon transport behaviors, which offer great opportunity to disentangle the inter-coupled thermoelectric parameters. For those benefits, layered materials emerge endlessly in the field of thermoelectricity and have achieved extensive attention. In this review, we highlight the recent progress in the field of layered thermoelectric materials. The structure and bonding peculiarities of layered thermoelectric materials are outlined. Then, following the classification of single-unit, quasi-double-unit, and double-unit layered thermoelectric materials, the crystal and bonding features in some typical layered thermoelectric materials are discussed, with focus on their current research interest and progresses. The possible mechanisms behind the performance optimization will be analyzed.
