Magnetically active ferrofluids facilitate reconfiguration couplings for breaking and tunneling ultrasonic wave energy transmission. This Letter presents a magnetic fluid–solid interactive metamaterial to achieve the tunable manipulation of multimodal, dispersive ultrasonic guided waves. It is revealed that the phenomenon of the fluid–structure interaction plays an indispensable role in the achievement of bandgap formation and translation. The tunable mechanism stems from the variation of the fluid–solid coupling reconfiguration arising from liquid morphing via electromagnetic stimuli. The tunable wave control performance was explicitly validated through both numerical simulations and experimental verifications. Such an active metamaterial system may possess application potential for future highly flexible and tunable wave control, e.g., selective-tunnel waveguiding and adaptive mechanical frequency filtering.},

In this study, it was experimentally determined that the influence of the radial position of an externally mounted hollow cathode on the performance of an MSHT is quite different from that of a USHT. The measured plasma parameters demonstrate that in addition to the coupling voltage loss and plume divergence loss, the electron cross-field transport loss (not considered previously and introduced by the outward shifting of the magnetic field) is also important to explaining the performance variation in the MSHT. This study refines the coupling theory between the cathode and Hall thruster and provides a valuable reference for determining the radial position of an externally mounted hollow cathode in an MSHT.},

  abstract     = {Proton-conducting BaZrO 3 -doped electrolytes are considered as potential high temperature proton conductors due to their high ionic conductivity and electrical efficiency in the operating temperature range of solid oxide fuel cells. However, doping leads to a decrease in grain boundary conductivity and greatly limits its applications. Here, the charge transport properties of sub-micro and nano-BaZrO 3 electrolytes were studied by in situ high-pressure impedance measurements and first-principles calculations. Mixed ionic-electronic conduction was found in both samples in the whole pressure range. Pressure-induced negative capacitance in the tetragonal phase of nano-BaZrO 3 was observed, which was related to the space charge layer of grain boundaries as well as the electrostrictive strain of grains. The enhanced electrostrictive effect was attributed to the existence of polar nano-domains in nano-BaZrO 3 . Furthermore, the coincident imaginary part of impedance and modulus peaks on the frequency scale indicated a non-localized carrier conduction in the tetragonal phase of nano-BaZrO 3 . The grain boundary conductivity of nano-BaZrO 3 was enhanced by four orders of magnitude, and the impedance response changed from a constant phase element to an ideal capacitance, which was accompanied by the cubic to tetragonal phase transition. At a switching frequency of 0.1 Hz, the real part of the dielectric function of nano-BaZrO 3 increases sharply with frequencies from negative to positive values, exhibiting a plasma-like Drude behavior. Our results provide insight into the optimization and application of BaZrO 3 -based proton conductors in solid oxide fuel cells.},

Therefore, the NBTHZS film achieves a ∼16 times enhancement of energy density (from 5.1 J/cm 3 of the NBT film to 81 J/cm 3 of the NBTHZS film) and a high efficiency of 74.1\% as well as an excellent performance reliability.

However, one confusing issue is that what are specifically effective strategies for the one-step process may not be applicable for the two-step process, and vice versa. Herein, the PSCs with the same perovskite composition and device configuration were prepared by one- and two-step processes, respectively. The results indicated that high performance PSCs with comparable power conversion efficiency over 22\% were achieved by both methods, while the detailed photovoltaic parameters varied greatly depending on the one- or two-step process. Compared to the one-step counterpart, the two-step processed PSCs exhibit lower open-circuit voltage and fill factor, but superior short-circuit current, which was in-depth interpreted in terms of the crystalline growth mode, optical properties, defect types, and carrier transport mechanisms related to a perovskite film surface (including a top and a bottom surface). Understanding the root cause for such differences would be central toward identifying what is really crucial for further producing high performance PSCs.},

By applying vibration under the excitation of ultrasound with various frequencies and powers, it is found that CO is the ultimate product with a selectivity of 100\%, and the optimal CO yield of 8.3 μ mol g −1 h −1 is achieved with the addition of sacrificial agents. The H 2 Ti 3 O 7 catalysts are also found to present a good recycling utilization ability.

The established one-to-one correspondence of each sub-THz line to pair combinations of THz lines proves the nonlinear mechanism of difference-frequency generation (DFG) in the QCL active region. The conversion efficiencies W ( f i − f k )/[ W ( f i ) × W ( f k )] estimated from the experimental data are about 4 × 10 −3 and 5 × 10 −5 W −1 for the sub-THz lines found at 132 and 310 GHz, correspondingly. Considering nonlinear polarization of QCL active regions as the reason for DFG, we have evaluated the following values of the second-order nonlinear susceptibility χ (2) (132 GHz) ≅ 7 × 10 5 pm/V and χ (2) (310 GHz) ≅ 4 × 10 4 pm/V from the experimental data.

In this study, photoactive PENGs based on methylammonium lead halides-poly(vinylidene) (MAPI-PVDF) composite were fabricated, in which the presence of MAPI in the PVDF matrix plays a dual role in enhancing the nucleation of the electroactive β -phase as well as inducing photoactivity in the composite. It has an optimal open-circuit voltage of 4.7 V and short-circuit current of 0.2 μ A at 10 wt.\% concentration of MAPI under illumination, which is nearly halved in the dark. Furthermore, we have thoroughly explored the interaction mechanism between photogenerated carriers and piezoelectric charges by piezoresponse scanning force microscopy techniques, photoluminescence spectroscopy, and a bandgap analysis. The results demonstrate that the photogenerated carriers screen part of the piezoelectric potential induced by the piezoelectric charges, while the piezoelectric charges promote more photogenerated carriers recombination.

Temperature-dependent transport is performed for deeper insight of the physical origin of the much higher μ at the vacuum/InGaZnO interface. We have found the density of states (DOS) of tail states is notably lower for the transport near the vacuum (8 × 10 17 compared to 1.1 × 10 19 cm −3 eV −1 at the SiO 2 /vacuum interface). These indicate that traditional dielectric materials like SiO 2 have strong effects on the charge transport degradation in InGaZnO TFTs by introducing extra energetic disorders, and the intrinsic charge transport in InGaZnO is potentially approaching those in poly-silicon TFTs.

It is found that the stability of the FET is improved after H 2 O 2 incorporation, while the mobility is decreased. Surprisingly, after UV irradiation, the FET with both high mobility and high stability was obtained. It is assumed that under UV irradiation, H 2 O 2 is decomposed into highly reactive hydroxyl radicals (•OH), which contributes to the degradation of the polymer. XPS and FT-IR analysis verify that oxygen- and carbon-related defects can be removed through the hydroxyl-assistant strategy. Furthermore, the flexible FET based on In 2 O 3 nanofibers with H 2 O 2 addition and UV irradiation was fabricated on the PI substrate, and the high electrical performance is further demonstrated.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to reveal an a 1 /a 2 domain structure, which remained unchanged down to a film thickness of 2 nm. The a 1 and a 2 polydomains do not have a simple tetragonal symmetry because a a∥ and a a ⊥ do not have the same values. The crystallographic tilt angle, α , is defined based on the rotation angle of the PTO lattice with respect to the cubic phase of KTO substrates. The in-plane tetragonal distortion ( c a∥ / a a∥ ) and α decreased with the decrease in the film thickness, following the in-plane tetragonal geometric equation: α = tan − 1 ( c a ∥ a a ∥ ) − 45 ° ⁠ . The isotropic tensile strains induced in-plane polarization directions along the [100] and [010] axes of the substrates. These axes are formed via the a 1 / a 2 polydomain of the tetragonal-like phase. Moreover, synchrotron in-plane grazing incidence XRD and piezoelectric force microscopy were used to reveal the thickness dependency of the periodic domain width of the ferroelastic a 1 / a 2 domain. The periodic domain width in the PTO films decreased, following Kittel&#39;s law, with the reduction in the film thickness.},

Microstrips with a critical temperature of 5.15 K and widths from 1.0 to 2.5 μ m have been fabricated by optical lithography. We demonstrate single photon detection sensitivity at 1.5 μ m wavelength at a temperature of 1.79 K. By investigating the detection process at this temperature, we find that the current bias threshold is at 21\% of the depairing current. This threshold is similar to what should be observed in typical amorphous superconductors, which confirms that ultrathin disordered Nb 0.15 Re 0.85 is an interesting material for superconducting microstrip single photon detectors that operate above 1 K.},

Both angular-dependent magnetoresistance and field-dependent magnetoresistance have featured a sign change characteristic with varying temperature, which is ascribed to the competition between a modulated interface magnetic state and an antiferromagnetic bulk state of the α -Fe 2 O 3 film. According to a generalized theoretical model, which takes the effective spin conductance into consideration, the spin transport can be mathematically expressed as the change of field dependent average spin operators with varying temperature. The critical temperature also depends on the α -Fe 2 O 3 film thickness and the magnetic field, which are ascribed to the magnons transport and long-range order of non-collinear spin textures, respectively. Furthermore, we have given a phenomenological form to fit the SMR curves in the critical temperature interval, which further reveals the origin of SMR with complex magnetic structures.},

  abstract     = {Voltage control of magnetic properties is a promising path to realize low-power spintronic devices and meets the requirements for quicker information processing speed and ongoing scale reduction. Hydrogen migration induced by voltage gating has been demonstrated to modify the intrinsic magnetic properties of materials by affecting the exchange interaction, electron occupancy, and magnetoelastic effect. Herein, the magnetic properties of a ferrimagnetic Gd 29 Fe 71 film in an all-solid-state multilayer device, which is constructed using a GdO x electrolyte, can be reversibly modulated by voltage-controlled hydrogen migration. Polar MOKE results indicate that hydrogen intercalation/deintercalation can modulate the Gd 29 Fe 71 film&#39;s degree of compensation and control the dominant magnetic sublattice. Furthermore, the polarity of the polar MOKE curves can be reversibly switched. As with the increase in hydrogen loading, the compensation point in the Gd 29 Fe 71 film is approached, the density of magnetic domain nucleation sites decreases, and the magnetic domain structures transform from labyrinth domains to uniform large area domains. At the same time, a strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy is developed. This work shows a possible pathway for reversible control of magnetism in spintronic devices.},

The measurement of Hall effects showed that the anomalous Hall resistivity has different coercivity and remanence between the two phases. By optimizing the Mn/Bi ratio, it is even possible to repeatedly switch the sign of Hall resistivity, which could be utilized as a concept of phase-change memory based on ferromagnetic transport.},

In this paper, we report on the AHE of high-quality epitaxial Au/Fe 4 N bilayer films, which were grown by a plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy system. A scaling involving multiple competing scattering mechanisms and a shunting model were adopted to analyze the AHE in detail. Compared with Fe 4 N single layers and Cu/Fe 4 N bilayers, the AHE of Au/Fe 4 N bilayers is dramatically modified by strong SOC of the Au layer. Analysis has shown that aside from extra scatterings from Au atoms that diffused from an Au layer to a Fe 4 N layer, both spin Hall effect of Au and magnetic proximity effect near the Au/Fe 4 N interface contribute to the modification of the AHE. Variation of coercivity with the change of current, which could be attributed to spin–orbit torque, implies that the measured AHE is a combination of the AHE of Fe 4 N and strong SOC of Au.},

This study developed an artificial synaptic device exhibiting tunable and multi-state excitatory and inhibitory responses by using a dual-gated (DG) ambipolar boron-doped SnO thin-film transistor. We demonstrated dynamic modulation of multi-state potentiation/depression responses in both reconfigurable excitatory and inhibitory modes by the DG operation in a single ambipolar transistor. In comparison with conventional single-gate devices, the DG configuration improved the linearity and the symmetricity of synaptic weight updates in addition to the capability of conduction level tuning. Therefore, the presented DG ambipolar oxide synaptic transistor exhibited distinct advantages in learning-accuracy and energy-efficiency, and high pattern recognition accuracy over 90\% and low energy operation of ∼200 pJ per pulse in excitatory and inhibitory responses were achieved. It demonstrates the high potential of the DG ambipolar oxide synaptic transistor for next-generation energy-efficient multi-input neuromorphic devices to emulate diverse functionalities in bio-neural network systems.},

Here, we systematically investigated the optical properties and photophysical mechanisms of CsPbBr 3 nanoparticles (NPs)-incorporated chlorophyll material. Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) studies reveal a large fluorescence enhancement in the chlorophyll once the perovskite was incorporated in the pristine chlorophyll with an associated PL quenching of the CsPbBr 3 emission. A spectral overlap was measured from the PL and absorption spectra of CsPbBr 3 NPs and chlorophyll indicative of a Förster-type resonance energy transfer (FRET). Using time-resolved PL, faster PL decay curves were observed from the CsPbBr 3 NPs in the mixture suggesting that most of its energy was transferred to the chlorophyll. The corresponding Jablonski diagram was built and the energy transfer parameters, such as FRET efficiencies and transfer rates, were calculated to fully explain the FRET process. Slow PL degradation for the mixtures was also observed, highlighting the advantage of the FRET proposed. The demonstration of the photophysical mechanism in biomaterial–semiconductor systems is influential in improving the performance of emerging bio-inspired optoelectronic devices.},

A large configurational ensemble is employed to reliably predict the distribution of localized defects as well as their response to the thermal and light activation. The results reveal that the illumination effects on the carrier concentration are greater in amorphous configurations with shorter In–O bond length and reduced polyhedral sharing as compared to the structures with a more uniform morphology. The obtained correlation between the photo-induced carrier density and the reduction in the number of fully coordinated In-atoms implies that metal oxides with a significant fraction of crystalline/amorphous interfaces would show a more pronounced response to illumination. Photo-excitation also produces In–O 2 –In defects that have not been previously found in sub-stoichiometric amorphous oxides; these defects are responsible for carrier instabilities due to overdoping.},

Here, we report on the fascinating low-temperature dielectric relaxation of Yb 2- x Ba x Ti 2 O 7- δ ( x = 0–0.20) and demonstrate that this phenomenon is related to structural distortion. A-site Ba substitution, which increases the density of point defects and introduces a different atomic radius, enhances the chemical disorder and structural distortion. As a result, the increases in oxygen vacancies and nonmagnetic Ba 2+ and Yb 2+ ions dilute the ferromagnetic Yb 3+ –Yb 3+ interactions, as indicated by the decrease in effective magnetic moment. On the other hand, the distorted octahedra facilitate the hopping of Yb ions, and the random distribution of Ba 2+ ions at the Yb 3+ sites gives rise to additional random fields, leading to significantly increased dielectric relaxation. The room-temperature dielectric constant is improved to ∼170, twice that of pristine Yb 2 Ti 2 O 7 . This work provides a comprehensive view of the structural, magnetic, and dielectric properties of Yb 2 Ti 2 O 7 and lays the foundation for additional research into pyrochlore compounds.},

The device consists of a heterogeneously integrated Mach–Zehnder interferometer with arms composed of silicon and silicon nitride waveguides whose thermo-optic coefficients differ by an order of magnitude. The waveguides are fabricated in distinct layers of a monolithic device and guide light in a single transverse-electric mode. The resulting small bend radii enable compact sensing of temperatures local to integrated photonic components with a device footprint of 580 × 410 μ m 2 ⁠ . Furthermore, the dual layers of the sensor enable overlaying of the spiral arms of the interferometer over each other or other photonic circuit components. We measure a sensitivity of 324 pm/K, an over threefold enhancement compared to the measurement of an asymmetric Mach–Zehnder constructed of silicon waveguides on the same device. We additionally define a useful figure of merit for the side-of-fringe measurement regime, which uses direct detection of a narrow linewidth laser and show that the reported device is also competitive on this metric.},

  abstract     = {Topological band theory provides a framework to establish the equivalence/inequivalence of bandgaps in photonic topological insulators. However, experimental discernment of bandgap topological characteristics encounters inherent measurement complexities, particularly beyond the terahertz frequencies. To surmount this difficulty, we resort to the prolific optical technique of spectroscopic ellipsometry and carry out detailed experimental examination of attributes of one-dimensional photonic crystal stopbands and, in consequence, identify an appropriate classifier of the implicit topological characteristics. It is found that governed by the bulk topology, the band edge locations in the dispersion diagram provide a conditional site for the appearance of zeros of a complex reflection ratio. This leads to a selective appearance of topologically robust phase singularities with integer (unity positive) topological charge. We demonstrate that the presence of these phase singularities on either the blue or the red band edges of the stopbands provides us with an experimental marker of their distinctive topological characteristics.},

The traditional way to achieve nonreciprocity is using magneto-optical nonreciprocal polarization rotation, which is incompatible with existing on-chip integration due to the applied magnetic field. Here, we theoretically and experimentally realize unidirectional polarization rotation with a magnetic-free mechanism using atomic ensembles. Free-space isolators and circulators are further formed based on the nonreciprocity of polarization rotation. As only one direction of the signal changes its polarization, the forward transmission and backward isolation can be adjusted separately. Compared with the existing magnetic-free circulators that rely on high-Q factor cavities or Mach–Zehnder interferometers, we experimentally realized circulators in free space. This dramatically simplifies the magnetic-free circulator structure and provides better stability.},

Among numerous UWBG semiconductors, this work focuses on the corundum-structured α-Ga 2 O 3 , which is a metastable polymorph of Ga 2 O 3 . The large bandgap energy of 5.3 eV, a large degree of freedom in band engineering, and availability of isomorphic p-type oxides to form a hetero p–n junction make α-Ga 2 O 3 an attractive candidate for power device applications. Promising preliminary prototype device structures have been demonstrated without advanced edge termination despite the high dislocation density in the epilayers owing to the absence of native substrates and lattice-matched foreign substrates. In this Perspective, we present an overview of the research and development of α-Ga 2 O 3 for power device applications and discuss future research directions.},

However, the mechanism of producing the torque and the determinant factor of the rotation direction for these planar ultrasonic rotors have been elusive. We, therefore, study the impact of the size and shape on the rotation characteristics of these ultrasonic rotors in air and further study the influence of the viscosity of fluid. Theory and experiment demonstrate the essential role of the short blades in producing the acoustic torque both in air and water. In the airborne case, the shape and arrangement of the blades are found to determine the rotation direction. In water, with a dynamic viscosity 55 times higher than that of air, we demonstrate that ultrasonic rotors down to 25- μ m-disk-diameter function in an optimized experimental geometry with approximately the same actuation efficiency as in air. Our results will be beneficial to further improve the applicability of the ultrasonic rotors as sample holders for airborne experiments and to explore the micrometer-scale ultrasonic rotors in liquid.},

A peak surface electric field of 450 MV/m was achieved in the CuAg structure for a klystron input power of 14.5 MW and a 1 μ s pulse length, which was 25\% higher than the peak surface electric field achieved in the Cu structure. The superb high gradient performance was achieved because of the two major optimizations in the cavity&#39;s geometry: (1) the shunt impedance of the cavity was maximized for a peak surface electric field to accelerating gradient ratio of ∼2 for a fully relativistic particle, and (2) the peak magnetic field enhancement due to the input coupler was minimized to limit pulse heating. These tests allow us to conclude that C-band accelerating structures can operate at peak fields similar to those at higher frequencies while providing a larger beam iris for improved beam transport.},

Here, we demonstrate a mechano-optical transducer of a single trapped ion with the force sensitivity about 600 zN / Hz for the DC force. This method utilizes the Doppler shift of the time-resolved fluorescence to detect the ion&#39;s micromotion that is coupled to a vector force. By alternating the directions of the detection laser beams, the vector DC forces can be precisely measured.

The oscillation wavelength, differential quantum efficiency, and slope efficiency of a laser diode were 300 nm, 3.6\%, and 0.15 W/A, respectively. These results were obtained by increasing the injection efficiency and decreasing the positive fixed polarization charge formed at the interface between a p-side waveguide layer and an electron blocking layer when polarization doping is formed in a p-AlGaN cladding layer.},

  abstract     = {Since the raise of 2D materials, significant research has been dedicated to their strain-dependent electronic and mechanical properties. In this work, we studied exciton energies and low-frequency phonon modes in CVD-grown mono- and few-layer WS 2 transferred on PDMS micropillars. The modification of the band structure under strain was investigated by photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy at room temperature. Machine learning (ML) methods were used to analyze the PL spatial maps and facilitate the spectral deconvolution. For monolayer (1L) WS 2 , red shift in the exciton energy was detected as a function of the position, which was ascribed to the presence of residual strain. For three-layer (3L) strained WS 2 , a significant increase in the PL intensity corresponding to direct (K–K) band transition together with a change of exciton energy was observed. From the PL spectra, strain distribution maps were extracted for both studied samples, which strongly resembled the ML clustering results. Finally, the low-frequency Raman modes of WS 2 were studied on both Si/SiO 2 and PDMS substrates and no significant change of their frequency was observed for the 3L-WS 2 .},

  abstract     = {Thickness shear mode (TSM) resonators consisting of metal films and quartz plates are widely used for sensor applications such as film thickness monitoring, force sensors, and odor sensors. However, the current sensor geometry prevents further improvements in its sensitivity and stability. Thinning the plate is necessary for high sensitivity, and advanced fabrication technologies are required for their commercialization. The solution is to use a support substrate to increase the mechanical strength, which can guide the transmittance of the electric field. Herein, we report a TSM resonator bonded to a support substrate. An AT-cut quartz resonator with a floating electrode on the top side was bonded to the support substrate. Two excitation electrodes were placed under the substrate. The support substrates evaluated in this study included borosilicate glass, Z-cut quartz crystals, and AT-cut quartz crystal plates. The quartz crystal resonator (QCR) bonded to the AT-cut quartz crystal plate and positioned at 90° to the crystallographic x -axis shows an excellent temperature coefficient of frequency of −60 ± 14 ppb/°C for a temperature range 11–40 °C. The proposed method reduces temperature sensitivity to 1/4 or less compared to that without a substrate. Furthermore, the resonator could be used as a quartz crystal microbalance. The proposed method may inspire further high-frequency QCR-based biochemical chips or various sensor applications with TSM resonators.},

The mechanisms including charge trapping and depolarization field (E dep ) are discovered and related to surface potential and coercive field (E C ). The trapped charge can be effectively detrapped by opposite polarity stimulation and validated by technology computer-aided design modeling. In addition, the E dep is revealed to be serious with ferroelectric HfZrO 2 (FE-HZO) thin-down due to the unstable low-V T state at a gate voltage (V G ) of 0 V. The tunable base voltage (V base ) compensates the E dep -based polarization degradation. A stable low-V T read-after-write for a 5-nm-thick HZO FeFET is experimentally demonstrated by the opposite polarity detrapping scheme hybrid with a V base optimization simultaneously for a wide range of delay times from 10 −7 to 10 2 s.

Experiments demonstrate that the array of dielectric cylinders placed in a U-shape open metal cavity can be profitably exploited to act as a high-efficiency splitting directive antenna in particular modes. Highly directional radiation has been observed at the fundamental electromagnetic resonance of band edge crystal with a maximum gain of 20.73 dBi and an aperture efficiency of 49.77\%. The side-lobes on the E -plane ( yoz ) are almost constrained in −20 dB benefitting from the band edge lattice-induced resonance on the H -plane ( xoy ), suppressing the effect of aperture diffraction, and retaining high directivity performance in space. The detected half-power beam widths on the E -plane and H -plane are 7.7° and 8.9°, respectively, agreeing well with the simulations. Different from traditional orientation approaches, the photonic crystal antenna delivers performance of high directivity gain with compact structure, facile preparation, low cost, and high efficiency, which make it suitable for spatial information transmission and modulation and offer potential applications in remote sensing and wireless communication.},

The VCMA modifies the local magnetic properties such that the magnetodynamics transitions between regimes of (i) confinement, (ii) tuning, and (iii) separation with qualitatively different behaviors. We find that the strongest tuning is achieved for gate widths of the same size as the constriction width, for which the effective damping can be increased an order of magnitude compared to its intrinsic value. As a consequence, voltage control remains efficient over a very large frequency range, and subsequent manufacturing advances could allow spin Hall nano-oscillators to be easily integrated into next-generation electronics for further fundamental studies and industrial applications.},

The changes upon propagation through CoF 2 are found to depend strongly on both the incoming polarization and temperature. In particular, the ellipticity and polarization rotation acquired by initially linearly polarized light are quantified and explained in terms of magnetic linear birefringence and dichroism. Although the magneto-optical effects are often considered to be relatively weak, our experiments reveal that the polarization of the THz pulse substantially changes along the pulse duration. The pulse shape is further complicated by features assigned to the formation of magnon-polaritons. The findings clearly show the importance of accounting for propagation effects in antiferromagnetic spintronics and magnonics.},

Therefore, in this study, a Ta/Co–Fe–B/Ta/MgO junction that hosts a skyrmion was utilized to fabricate a device to investigate the effect of applying a voltage in the direction perpendicular to the film plane. Magneto-optical Kerr effect microscopy was performed in a polar configuration to observe the difference in the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy by observing the behavior of the magnetic domain structure and the skyrmions. Our findings suggest that voltage-induced magnetic domain structure modulation and the creation/annihilation of skyrmions are both possible. Furthermore, manipulation of skyrmions was realized by utilizing repulsive magnetic dipole interaction between the voltage-created skyrmion and skyrmion, exhibiting Brownian motion, outside the top electrode. Thus, our proposed method can enable controlling the creation and annihilation of skyrmions and their positions by manipulating the externally applied voltage. These findings can advance unconventional computing fields, such as stochastic and ultra-low-power computing.},

The exploration of phonon hydrodynamics bears importance in understanding phonon collective behavior, and its window is crucial for determining the phonon transport regime and engineering the heat transport. Thus, strategies for continuous tuning of the hydrodynamic window are needed, but it remains a challenge. In this work, we demonstrate that the phonon hydrodynamic window in bilayer graphene can be strongly altered by the strain based on theoretical calculations. In particular, the phonon hydrodynamics can be observed at 60 K in unstrained bilayer graphene, while only 0.25\% strain can reduce this temperature to 28 K. This strong strain dependence not only provides an efficient way of modulating the phonon collective behavior but also renders a possibility of strain-induced transition of phonon transport regime.},

Understanding the role of the thermal boundary resistance (TBR) and the laser pulse duration in the generation mechanism of acoustic waves is essential to implement efficient photoacoustic nanotransducers. This work theoretically investigates, for the paradigmatic case of water-immersed gold nanocylinders, the role of the TBR and laser pulse duration in the competition between the launching mechanisms: the thermophone and the mechanophone. In the thermophone, the nanoparticle acts as a nanoheater and the wave is launched by water thermal expansion. In the mechanophone, the nanoparticle directly acts as a nanopiston. Specifically, for a gold–water interface, the thermophone prevails under ns light pulse irradiation, while the mechanophone dominates shortening the pulse to the 10 ps regime. For a graphene-functionalized gold–water interface, instead, the mechanophone dominates over the entire range of explored laser pulse durations. The results point to high-TBR, liquid-immersed nanoparticles as potentially efficient photoacoustic nanogenerators, with the advantage of keeping the liquid environment temperature unaltered.},

  abstract     = {Identifying atomic configurations of impurities in semiconductors is of fundamental interest and practical importance in designing electronic and optoelectronic devices. C impurity acting as one of the most common impurities in GaN, it is believed for a long time that it substitutes at Ga site forming C Ga with +1 charge-state in p -type GaN, while it substitutes at N site forming C N with -1 charge-state in n -type GaN. However, by combining x-ray absorption spectroscopy and first-principles simulations, we observed that C is mainly occupying the N site rather than the Ga one in p -GaN. We further reveal that this is due to an H-induced E F -tuning effect. During growth, the existing H can passivate Mg dopants and upshifts the E F to the upper region of bandgap, leading to the C N formation. After the p -type activation by annealing out H, although the E F is pushed back close to the valence band maximum, whereas the extremely large kinetic barrier can prevent the migration of C from the metastable C N site to ground-state C Ga site, hence stabilizing the C N configuration. Additionally, the C N with neutral charge-state ( ⁠ C N 0 ⁠ ) in the p -GaN is further observed. Therefore, the real C-related hole-killer in p -type GaN could be C N rather than the commonly expected C Ga . Our work not only offers the unambiguous evidence for the C defect formation in p -GaN but also contributes significantly to an in-depth understanding of the C-related hole-killers and their critical role on electrical and optoelectrical properties of p -GaN and even p -AlGaN.},

  abstract     = {The emergence of anisotropic two-dimensional (2D) materials provides a platform for the cutting-edge nano- and optoelectronic devices. Exploring low-dimensional materials and revealing their anisotropic behavior are crucial for designing angle-dependent nanodevices. The metallicity of molybdenum dioxide (MoO 2 ) crystal differentiates it from the most commonly studied semi-conductive anisotropic 2D materials. However, the studies on its optical anisotropy are still lacking. Here, two most commonly obtained shapes of rhombic and hexagonal MoO 2 were synthesized by one step method of chemical vapor deposition. The rhombic and hexagonal MoO 2 display a slight frequency shift of 1–5 cm −1 depending on the variation modes, but the Raman modes at 366 cm −1 remain unaltered. Using a combination of differential reflectance spectroscopy and reflectance difference spectroscopy, we revealed the unusual narrow-band optical anisotropies of rhombic and hexagonal MoO 2 crystals in the visible wavelength region due to its unique metallic properties. Furthermore, it is found that the center wavelengths of the narrow-band optical anisotropy of the MoO 2 crystal can be effectively adjusted by coherent optical interference. Our results present an interesting anisotropic metallic 2D candidate and an effective cavity-based approach to regulate the center wavelengths of as-obtained narrow-band optical anisotropy, which is highly beneficial for the wavelength-selected devices.},

An analytic relationship between the beam direction and the array parameters was established and experimentally confirmed. The lasers exhibit single mode emission around 3.4 THz, with a low divergence of 14° × 14°.

  abstract     = {Transient optical response in perovskite quantum dots (QDs) has remained elusive until now, which hinders their full utilization in optoelectronics. Herein, we reveal that the bandgap renormalization (BGR) dictates the main spectral and dynamical features of transient response in CsPbBr 3 QDs. By monitoring the absorption spectral evolution of the monodispersed QDs, the representative BGR is explicitly observed, giving rise to the photoinduced absorption at the higher energy side of the lowest exciton peak in transient absorption spectroscopy. The BGR gradually increases upon photoexcitation as a result of the carrier distribution dependent screening effect. We further demonstrate that the BGR arises from both Coulomb screening and phonon heating under high pump intensities in CsPbBr 3 QDs. The synergistic effect leads to the giant BGR energy (Δ E &gt; 60 meV) and the unconventional relationship of Δ E ∝ n 1/2 , where n is the carrier density. These findings are important for the fundamental understanding and potential applications of the emerging halide perovskite semiconductors.},

The elasto-optic coefficients of common liquids are measured with only 10 ms and an averaged relative standard deviation of 1.52\%, complementing the rare liquid data. By deciphering Brillouin spectra, the elasto-optic coefficient and viscoelastic parameters can be obtained simultaneously, and the introduction of the elasto-optic coefficient makes the characterization more sensitive.

In this work, we show their light emission properties in the THz spectral range, up until now unexplored, and show how THz pulse generation can be used for microscopic insights into these NCs. In particular, we report on coherent THz emission from large HgTe NCs excited by linearly polarized optical pulses via second-order nonlinear effects. The peak emission frequency is tunable from 0.4 to 0.8 THz by varying incident angles of optical pulses from 0° to 45°. Our results reveal that the THz emission is induced by transient photocurrents arising from both photogalvanic and photon drag effects. By pushing the light emission of colloidal quantum dots down to the THz spectral range, our study expands the application fields of NCs, especially toward the development of easily integrable and tunable THz emitters and quantum THz devices.},

The pattern is typically created in a single step and often relies on wave-forming techniques to achieve the desired pattern geometries. We show that multiple acoustic waves can be applied sequentially in a multi-step process to create particle patterns not achievable by the individual waves alone. We demonstrate this approach in spherical particles using two planar pseudo-standing waves. Applied individually, each of the two waves would create linear particle bands with uniform spacing in between the bands. However, when applied sequentially, the banding pattern created in the first step is further manipulated by the second wave to create non-uniform spacing in between the bands. The experimentally achieved particle pattern geometry agrees well with the theoretical prediction.},

In order to clarify the common origin of the atomic-size dependence of these quantities, we establish these quantities as functions of bond length and bond energy by developing a bond relaxation theory approach. Theoretical reproduction of periodic trends confirms that bond expansion and energy weakening dominate their atomic-size dependence. The proposed approach is not only helpful to understand the physical origins of atomic-size dependence in different MA 2 Z 4 monolayers but also can be extended to study the periodic trends of the related physical properties in other systems.},

In most cases, the objects are pre-existing, but it is also possible for the forces to essentially create the target objects. Recently, we reported on the ability of high power ultrasound to extract and controllably manipulate droplets from the organic solvent CCl 4 using a near-field type of acoustic tweezers [Lirette et al. , Phys. Rev. Appl. 12 , 061001 (2019)]. The extraction used a fraxicon lens which produced trapping zones in the near-field. With the addition of extraction to trapping and manipulation, the process can be considered a form of contact-free pipetting. In the present work, we demonstrate the capability of this system to co-axially extract two droplets of SAE30ND motor oil (between 70\%–80\% liquid hydrocarbon) at a water interface against a positive radiation pressure. In the experiments with oil, several differences in the process have been observed relative to the CCl 4 study: a second near-field trapping zone is revealed; the surface deformation is small and opposite to the direction of extraction; the extraction and trapping forces are sufficient to overcome both interfacial tension and buoyancy; and the target liquid has distinct physical properties, such as density, viscosity, and acoustic impedance. Non-contact and label-free extraction of oil droplets remotely in an aqueous environment could have significant biological and environmental applications. Finding that the process works with two distinct liquids demonstrates its more general applicability and broadens its potential uses.},

Currently, there is a lack of detailed plasma measurements in these switches, yet such measurements are needed to elucidate the detailed physics, which include a range of processes such as laser breakdown, streamer formation and growth, current flow, plasma evolution, and cooling. Detailed spatially- and temporally resolved measurements of plasma properties within the switches could contribute to validating and advancing numeric models of these systems. This contribution presents laser Thomson scattering measurements of the electron number density and temperature evolution in a HV-LTS. The switch was operated at 6 kV with current flow for a duration of 145 ns and a peak current density of 0.2 MA/cm 2 into a matched load. The Thomson scattering diagnostic system uses a 532 nm probe from an Nd:YAG laser allowing a temporal resolution of ∼10 ns. We find that during the switch current pulse, the plasma electron temperature rose from a starting value of 8.1 ± 1.6 eV (due to cooling of the earlier trigger laser plasma) to a peak value of 26 ± 5 eV with an associated increase in the electron density from 8.6 ± 1.7 × 10 17 to 3.1 ± 0.6 × 10 18 cm −3 .},

  abstract     = {Precise manipulation of the time–frequency modes of entangled photons is crucial for future quantum science and technologies. Recently, the frequency-domain-quantum-optical-synthesis (FD-QOS) method was demonstrated by creating a superposition of different joint temporal amplitudes: those temporal distributions can be controlled by manipulating the joint spectral amplitude in 2D frequency space via a Fourier optical relation. This FD-QOS method provides an efficient, flexible, and easy-to-control way to precisely modulate the temporal distributions of the entangled photon in an ultrafast region. However, manipulation of only the temporal modes is not sufficient for various applications in quantum information, since spectral modulations are also needed on many occasions. Here, we present a proof-of-concept experiment of two-photon spectral modulation via temporal manipulation of a biphoton wave packet. This protocol, called time-domain-quantum-optical-synthesis (TD-QOS), is achieved by adjusting the relative phases between two joint temporal distributions. In addition, the two-photon joint spectral distributions are characterized by measuring the joint spectral intensities and Hong–Ou–Mandel interferences. The combination of FD-QOS and TD-QOS enables complete control over the biphoton states. Our work would further develop quantum technologies that rely on the time–frequency modes of entangled photons.},

  abstract     = {Typically, multipartite entangled coherent states are difficult to be extended and produced without measurement. We here propose a way to deterministically generate a GHZ (Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger)-type entangled coherent state of cavities, utilizing a system consisting of a single superconducting qutrit (i.e., a three-level quantum system) and multiple microwave cavities. Due to the use of only a coupler qutrit, the architecture of the circuit system is quite simple. More importantly, our proposal does not require measurement on the state of qutrit compared with the previous proposals. Since the qutrit&#39;s third energy level is not populated during the operation, decoherence from the higher energy level is greatly minimized. Furthermore, the entire operation time is independent of the number of microwave cavities. As an example, our numerical simulations show that high-fidelity generation of a three-cavity GHZ-type entangled coherent state is feasible with present circuit quantum electrodynamics technology. This proposal is universal and can be applied to other physical systems, such as microwave or optical cavities, which are coupled to a single natural or artificial three-level atom.},

However, a microscopic mechanism responsible for such improvement, thought to be closely related to local field fluctuation in the nanocomposites, has never been directly demonstrated experimentally. Here, we develop a powerful yet readily applicable in situ technique to evaluate the fluctuation of electric field in dielectrics, revealing reduced field fluctuation in interfacial engineered nanocomposites that clearly correlates with its enhanced breakdown strength. This work, thus, validates field fluctuation-based breakdown criterion of nanocomposite proposed more than one decade ago and provides further support to improve organic–inorganic nanocomposites for high density dielectric energy storage.},

  abstract     = {Solid-state Li-ion batteries are emerging as promising next-generation energy storage devices, but new solid-state Li-ion conductors or electrolytes, a critical component of such devices, are highly demanded to meet the conductivity and stability requirements. In this study, one of the cost-effective and stable silicate-based solid Li-ion conductors, β-eucryptite LiAlSiO 4 , was studied via ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. The Si/Al ratio from 0 to 7 corresponding to x in Li 1+ x Al 1+ x Si 1- x O 4 from 1 (Li-rich) to −0.75 (Li-poor) was adjusted to investigate its impact on Li-ion diffusion. The results show that the Li-ion diffusion barrier can be greatly decreased from 0.61 eV in β-eucryptite LiAlSiO 4 ( x = 0) to 0.20 eV in Li 0.5 Al 0.5 Si 1.5 O 4 ( x = −0.5; Si/Al = 3) and 0.24 eV in Li 1.25 Al 1.25 Si 0.75 O 4 ( x = 0.25; Si/Al = 0.6). The predicted Li-ion conductivity is 6.976 mS/cm in Li 0.5 Al 0.5 Si 1.5 O 4 and 3.773 mS/cm in Li 1.25 Al 1.25 Si 0.75 O 4 at 25 °C, both allowing room-temperature operation of solid-state batteries. The modulation of Li–Li correlation at these two distinctive Si/Al ratios results in significantly lower diffusion barrier and higher Li-ion conductivity than those of the parent composition. Our work facilitates the design of low-cost silicate-based Li-ion conductors with high Li conductivity.},

In this study, using the first-principles density functional theory calculations, we present a systematic computational investigation on LBOs in the respect of electronic structures, mechanical and thermodynamic properties, Li-ion transport, and interfacial (with Li metal) behaviors. Our results show that LBO is a thermodynamically and mechanically stable insulator with an indirect wide bandgap of 6.4 eV. Notably, LBOs could behave as a fast Li-ion conductor with a low migration energy barrier (15 meV) and are characterized by a zig–zag Li + -diffusion path along the c direction. We found that the interface between Li metal and LBO is both physically and chemically stable with no new phase formed while exhibiting a metallic character due to the charge transfer from a Li metal. Our study highlights the intriguing promise of LBOs as solid-state electrolytes for high-energy cells.},

The frequency-domain power spectral density analysis of the fluctuation signal extracts the characteristic frequency f c , by which the molecular affinity kinetics manifest the identifiable measurand. By measuring the kinetics of two different aptameric affinity systems in the same microscope field of view, the obtained equilibrium dissociation constants ( K D values) are demonstrated to be in agreement with previous studies, which were measured by traditional techniques. We expect that our NanoSPR method may pave the way for a deeper understanding of the physiological essence of biological affinity systems by accurately quantifying multiple affinity constants.

However, some parameters in thermoacoustic imaging, such as speed of sound, are difficult to be obtained in advance, and a constant velocity value is assumed in the reconstructed algorithm. Thermoacoustic signals propagate through the soft brain tissue and the skull in actual stroke detection. This mismatch between the assumed and actual sound velocity will degrade the imaging quality. In this Letter, we propose a full waveform autofocus inversion method to reconstruct thermoacoustic images for stroke noninvasive and non-ionizing detection. Employing the difference between the simulation forward sensor signals and the measured signals, the approximate speed of sound distribution is updated continuously. The numerical simulation of a real human brain model and the experiment of a real human skull help us to validate the performance of the proposed method in clinical transcranial thermoacoustic detection.},

A theoretical model that can be used for various substrates was established after considering the anisotropic properties of graphene and the principle of action of pressure sensors. Tests on the graphene pressure sensor device fabricated using semiconductor technology revealed that the GF [ GF = (ΔR/R)/ε] of the device was 1.14, which was within the theoretical prediction range (1.06–2.08). Furthermore, the reported Poisson&#39;s ratio values of various substrates were substituted into the calculation formula of the GF . The results revealed that the predicted value was highly consistent with the experimental test results. This result indicated that the theoretical model suitable for predicting the GF of graphene pressure sensors with various substrates is universal.

Devices were characterized in DC mode at different temperatures up to 500 °C in vacuum. These variable-temperature measurements showed a reduction in gate modulation of the drain current due to an increase in gate leakage across the gate/semiconductor Schottky barrier. Devices exhibited a reduction in transconductance with increasing temperature; despite this, drain current increased with temperature due to a reduction in threshold voltage caused by the de-trapping of electrons from deep-level traps. Devices also showed negligible change in semiconductor epitaxy and source/drain contacts, hence demonstrated recovery to their room-temperature electrical properties after the devices were tested intermittently at different high temperatures in vacuum.

In particular, Au-contacted devices exhibited pronounced ambipolar conduction whereas Ni-contacted devices retained fairly good unipolar properties.

Thermal and structural analyses revealed that the initial temperatures for condensation and crystallization were reduced down to 130 and 200 °C, respectively, by the in situ generation of reactive chemical species enabled by DUV-assisted nitrate photolysis. Furthermore, transmission electron microscopy confirmed that the degree of indium oxide film crystallinity was gradually enhanced as the amount of nitrate in the precursor solution was increased. Finally, electrical characterizations showed that carrier mobility, threshold voltage, subthreshold swing, and threshold voltage shift under the positive bias stress of sol–gel indium oxide thin-film transistors were improved from 0.21 to 5.03 cm 2 /V s, from 4.18 to 1.64 V, from 1.33 to 0.72 V/dec, and from 6.44 to 4.04 V, respectively, by combining ammonium nitrate and DUV photoactivation.},

Recently, the valley edge state of a bilayer sonic crystal, regarded as a new degree of freedom, gives a powerful platform for manipulating acoustic waves. In this Letter, we realize valley spin insulators in a bilayer sonic crystal and find that the layer-mixed, layer-polarized, and layer-locked edge states exist on both zigzag and armchair interfaces. There are significant differences between the armchair edge states and the zigzag edge states at the interfaces formed by two domains of distinct acoustic layer-valley Hall phases. Based on the projected dispersion relations for a bilayer sonic crystal, we achieve theoretically and experimentally bilayer multichannel transmission with different layers locking. This paper provides a design approach for applications of bilayer acoustic multichannel communication devices.},

Despite the experimental evidence, the underlying microscopic mechanisms of the enhanced reliability of SL remain elusive. This Letter explores the mechanism by performing first-principle calculations on SL and HZO systems. The enhanced endurance in the SL can be well explained by higher oxygen vacancy (Vo) migration energy barriers along the FE polarization direction, which slow down the increase in Vo. The suppression of Vo increase will potentially help maintain the stability of the FE phase and alleviate the fatigue. Based on this mechanism, we suggest that doping materials with higher Vo migration barriers can further improve the endurance of HfO 2 -based FE devices. This work facilitates the future development of HfO 2 -based FE devices with enhanced endurance and reliability.},

With the development of straintronics, acoustic waves could remotely control the topological magnetic structures, including skyrmionium. In this work, the acoustic wave induced dynamics of a skyrmionium on a strip film is studied by means of micromagnetic simulations. The results show that the motion of a skyrmionium is significantly influenced by the magnetic damping, the amplitude, and the frequency of the acoustic wave. The skyrmionium tends to acquire higher velocity at larger amplitude of the acoustic wave and smaller magnetic damping. With the increase in the acoustic wave amplitude, the skyrmionium deforms and moves faster due to stronger magnetoelastic interaction. When the frequency increases from 1 to 15 GHz, the velocity of skyrmionium generally increases except for the velocity fluctuation caused by magnetization resonance at a few frequencies. This work suggests a mechanical way to drive the motion of magnetic skyrmioniums by acoustic waves, offering potential applications in future information memory devices.},

To probe the current-induced spin polarization in NbSe 2 , we used a graphene-based non-local spin-valve device, where the spin-polarization in NbSe 2 is efficiently injected and detected using non-local spin-switch and Hanle spin precession measurements. A significantly higher charge-spin conversion in NbSe 2 is observed at a lower temperature.

  abstract     = {Active control of propagating short-wavelength spin waves in perpendicularly magnetized materials is promising for designing nanoscale magnonic devices. One method of manipulating spin waves on the nanoscale is through their interaction with magnetic textures, an example of which is the magnetic skyrmion—a particle-like topological object stabilized in thin film heterostructures by the Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction (DMI) and perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. In this paper, the interaction between spin waves and skyrmions is studied using micromagnetic simulations. The magnetic parameters chosen are similar to those found experimentally, leading to a skyrmion with an extended core of reversed magnetization. The effect of a propagating spin wave on the skyrmion is to cause the emission of a secondary spin wave by the skyrmion. At low frequencies, where the incoming spin wave wavelength is much larger than the skyrmion, this leads to a nearly circular re-emitted spin wave. The pattern of emission becomes increasingly complex at higher frequencies as the wavelength becomes similar to the skyrmion size due to the complex excitation of the extended core. The emitted spin wave profile can be controlled by altering the size of the skyrmion through the magnitude of the DMI, providing a method of tuning the system.},

The pressure dependence of fundamental bandgap has been studied using a diamond anvil cell technique. It has been found that the band-to-band transition shifts toward higher energy with an applied pressure.

The most popular technique is doping transition metals; however, these structural imperfections are unstable due to significant lattice incompatibility with the host. As a result, the fabrication of high-quality samples is quite difficult through the current growth techniques. Therefore, realizing intrinsic and robust magnetism in III-nitrides is quite desirable. Here, we adapted aluminum nitride as the example to theoretically predict the stable magnetism driven by the ubiquitous grain boundaries (GBs). The magnetism strongly depends on GBs tilt angles. These GBs cores contain homo-elemental bonds antiferromagnetically coupled at high tilt angles (&gt;16.7°) due to the short coupling distances. The T c was as high as 293 K at the tilt angle of 32.2°. Importantly, the magnetism induced by GBs is robust regarding carrier doping and strain, implying stable magnetism under working conditions. Our results provided a feasible and flexible approach to convert III-nitride into a wide-gap DMS by engineering the topological GBs.},

  abstract     = {In this work, a high-performance flexible radio frequency transistor using an ultrathin indium tin oxide film channel based on a solution-cast thin polyimide substrate has been demonstrated. The 60 nm short channel transistor shows a record high cut-off frequency of 5 GHz and a maximum oscillation frequency of 11 GHz with high uniformity among 40 devices. The radio frequency characteristics under various bending conditions have been systematically studied under a bending radius of 5 mm for 10 000 times and a bending radius of 1 mm for 1000 times, showing excellent stability with only 20\% decrease in the cut-off frequency. Furthermore, a flexible frequency mixer has also been demonstrated at 2.4 GHz with decent conversion gains.},

  abstract     = {Here, we report the thermal transport properties of lead telluride (PbTe) 1− x (AgBiTe 2 ) x ( x = 0.05 and 0.15) alloys. It is found that the prominent peak in lattice thermal conductivity at 15 K for PbTe disappears after forming solid solution with AgBiTe 2 , exhibiting a typical glass-like thermal transport behavior. The high energy phonons are scattered by the point defects induced by cationic disorder, while the appearance of soft vibrational modes arises from Ag atoms acting like Einstein oscillators ( Θ E1 = 5.4 K, Θ E2 = 67.3 K), which substantially affects the lattice thermal conductivity. Further with nanostructuring, the mid-frequency phonons are scattered by the high-density disc-like Ag 2 Te precipitates. As a result, an ultralow lattice thermal conductivity (≤1.0 W m −1 K −1 ) for (PbTe) 0.85 (AgBiTe 2 ) 0.15 is obtained, which is the lowest value ever reported to date for the PbTe-based TE materials. Our work highlights a synthetic route to achieve glass-like lattice thermal conductivity in PbTe over the entire temperature range.},

The wide applications of THz technology benefited from the rapid development of various THz functional devices. Metasurface, an essential means of manipulating THz waves, has widely been applied in multiple THz functional devices. However, it is still a great challenge to construct flexible THz metasurface devices due to the lack of flexibility of traditional semiconductor and metal materials. In this work, a two-dimensional material, MXene, is used to prepare flexible metasurfaces with frequency filtering and polarization functions. By further combining with the phase-transition-material vanadium dioxide, the VO 2 /MXene metasurface exhibits good performance in amplitude modulation under electrical stimulation. The modulation depth of the device reaches 86\% under a lower trigger power of 11.6 mW/mm 2 and the response time is only ∼100 ms. Such a flexible active metasurface with superior performance and high integration will be useful in THz imaging systems, THz sensing systems, etc.},

Our findings reveal that the periodicity and particle size of the particle array are main parameters to control both emission spectrum and direction. The derived simple expression for thermal emission enables insightful interpretation of physics. This model will lay a foundation for analytical derivation of thermal radiation from metasurfaces.

To overcome this problem, we propose dual-bias modulation heterodyne frequency modulation KPFM (DM-hetero-FM KPFM), in which dual AC biases at 2 f 1 ± f m are applied between the tip and the sample. DM-hetero-FM KPFM enables us to measure the contact potential difference and capacitance gradient simultaneously at high frequencies (in the MHz range) beyond the bandwidth of phase-lock loop. Moreover, the present method allows us to perform it in the open-loop mode, which is highly desired for performing KPFM on semiconductors or in liquids at high frequencies.},

The photo-induced conductance of the BFO/STO interface shows a large increase which is 20.62 times more than the sum of photo-induced conductance from each individual BFO thin film and STO crystal. Since this photo-induced conductance of the BFO/STO heterostructure can be adjusted to become higher and lower by applying an electric field to the top surface, we attribute this large increase to the strong photo-induced electrical polarization of BFO. With the two-point setup of positive bias and negative bias, the conductivity also exhibits diode-like behavior where the forward and backward resistances are different.

The superlattice structure not only reduces the mobility of the electrons, which helps to balance the distribution of carriers in the active region, thus, promoting radiative recombination, but also facilitates the lateral transport of the electrons, thus, reducing the current crowding effect through band engineering.

A high-resolution blue-emitting μ LED array is fabricated by optimizing ion species of a near-surface selectively positioned isolation process. The μ LED array exhibiting inhibited surface recombination and higher output power is achieved by using heavy ions, such as fluorine (F − ), due to more stable opto-electrical isolation and better process reliability. Furthermore, the low forward voltage of F − -IST-based μ LED pixels can effectively improve the wall-plug efficiency for the μ LED array with a pixel diameter of 6 μ m. Conversely, the poor thermal stability of light hydrogen (H + ) ions limits its device applications.

In this study, a robust orbital angular momentum (OAM) beams-based Fizeau interferometer is proposed and experimentally demonstrated, which is more compact and stable than the OAM interferometers with other structures due to the common optical path characteristic. In accordance with such an interferometric scheme, a phase-demodulation method operated in the domain of the OAM complex spectrum is also proposed and demonstrated in this study. In contrast to other phase-demodulation techniques, the proposed phase-demodulation technique neither requires phase shifters or phase modulators nor brings spectral leakage, which provides a robust alternative enabling to accurately and quickly extract the phase from the OAM interferogram. As a proof-of-concept of the proposed scheme, tiny displacements ranging from 0 to 800 nm were measured.

By means of Yb 3+ and Tm 3+ as dual bridging sensitizers, NaYF 4 :Yb 3+ , Tm 3+ , and Gd 3+ microcrystals were excited by near-infrared light and generated high-energy (&gt;6 eV) excited states. We fabricated a photoelectric conversion device by attaching the microcrystals to the surfaces of the h-BN thin film. When the device was irradiated with 980-nm near-infrared light, the Gd 3+ ions in the microcrystals were populated to the high-energy excited states 5 G J through an internal 7-photon process, emitting 205 nm deep ultraviolet fluorescence and 195.3 nm vacuum ultraviolet fluorescence, which provided enough energy for h-BN photoexcitation. Dynamic analysis showed that Förster resonance energy transfer played a very important role in the optical excitation, and populating Gd 3+ ions to high-energy excited states was the technical key.},

The structural defect formation mechanism, substrate treatment strategies, and different growth windows are analyzed to optimize the grown film to fulfill the requirements for device fabrication. Toward industrial applications, MOVPE-grown β-Ga 2 O 3 thin films are evaluated in two aspects: thick layers with smooth surface roughness and the electrical properties in terms of high carrier mobility and low doping concentration.

For broad-scale impact, long-term performance and reliability of devices using hafnia will require knowledge of the phases present and how they vary with time and use. In this Perspective article, the importance of phases present on device performance is discussed, including the extent to which specific classes of devices can tolerate phase impurities. Following, the factors and mechanisms that are known to influence phase stability, including substituents, crystallite size, oxygen point defects, electrode chemistry, biaxial stress, and electrode capping layers, are highlighted. Discussions will focus on the importance of considering both neutral and charged oxygen vacancies as stabilizing agents, the limited biaxial strain imparted to a hafnia layer by adjacent electrodes, and the strong correlation of biaxial stress with resulting polarization response. Areas needing additional research, such as the necessity for a more quantitative means to distinguish the metastable tetragonal and orthorhombic phases, quantification of oxygen vacancies, and calculation of band structures, including defect energy levels for pure hafnia and stabilized with substituents, are emphasized.},

We experimentally demonstrate an average absorptance of 48\% ± 2.5\% in the 8–13 μ m (769–1250 cm −1 ) spectral range for 10 nm thick titanium nitride (TiN), a value bordering on the 50\% fundamental absorptance limit for a suspended thin film. The heat capacity per unit area of this absorber is only 1.2 × 10 −6 J/K/cm 2 , which is beneficial for improving the response time of a microfabricated bolometer.

In our experiment, we use a transmon qubit with dispersive readout. The QCR is capacitively coupled to the qubit through its normal-metal island. We employ rapid, square-shaped QCR control voltage pulses with durations in the range of 2–350 ns and a variety of amplitudes to optimize the reset time and fidelity. Consequently, we reach a qubit ground-state probability of roughly 97\% with 80-ns pulses starting from the first excited state. The qubit state probability is extracted from averaged readout signal, where the calibration is based on Rabi oscillations, thus not distinguishing the residual thermal population of the qubit.},

  abstract     = {The nitrogen-vacancy center (NV) in diamond, with its exceptional spin coherence and convenience in optical spin initialization and readout, is increasingly used both as a quantum sensor and as a building block for quantum networks. Employing photonic structures for maximizing the photon collection efficiency in these applications typically leads to broadened optical linewidths for the emitters, which are commonly created via nitrogen ion implantation. With studies showing that only native nitrogen atoms contribute to optically coherent NVs, a natural conclusion is to either avoid implantation completely or substitute nitrogen implantation by an alternative approach to vacancy creation. Here, we demonstrate that implantation of carbon ions yields a comparable density of NVs as implantation of nitrogen ions and that it results in NV populations with narrow optical linewidths and low charge-noise levels even in thin diamond microstructures. We measure a median NV linewidth of 150 MHz for structures thinner than 5 μ m, with no trend of increasing linewidths down to the thinnest measured structure of 1.9 μ m. We propose a modified NV creation procedure in which the implantation is carried out after instead of before the diamond fabrication processes and confirm our results in multiple samples implanted with different ion energies and fluences.},

Pinholes and voids are two important structural defects hiding in blade-coated large-area perovskite films to deteriorate device efficiency and stability. However, the formation of pinholes and voids is still difficult to predict. On substrates with moderate wettability, Dion–Jacobson perovskite films can be blade-coated with good coverage, but we highlight that the formation of nanoscale voids buried at the bottom side of perovskite films can occur frequently, depending critically on the wettability of substrates. It is revealed that super hydrophilic NiO x substrates with contact angle θ &lt; 5° possesses strong bubble repellent property, which thermal dynamically prevents the retraction of precursor solution and plays an important role to suppress the attachment and growth of bubbles on its surface. The probabilities of forming both pinholes and buried voids in perovskite films on super hydrophilic NiO x substrates are one order of magnitude lower than that on hydrophilic PTAA and poly-TPD substrates. The blade-coated (BDA)MA 4 Pb 5 I 16 films on NiO x substrate offer PSCs with excellent interfacial hole extraction and reduced leakage current, contributing a significant power conversion efficiency improvement from ∼10\% to 16.26\%.},

Multiple TD peaks are observed in the reverse breakdown area of the dark-state I–V curve, while with increased laser power, the peaks break into more subpeaks successively, and the subcell photocurrent steps are found to shrink due to the moving subpeaks at the right side of the steps. A model of a multijunction LPC under localized illumination is proposed, and the shrinkage of a step originates from the larger local overproduced subcell photocurrent than the local peak current of the very TD below this subcell. Therefore, the correspondences between TD peaks in the I–V curves and their physical locations in the structure of the LPC are determined.

The origin of gate current variations under stress has been ascribed to charge trapping occurring at different interfaces in the metal/p-GaN/AlGaN/GaN system. In particular, depending on the stress bias level, electrons (V G 6 V) are trapped, causing a positive or negative threshold voltage shift ΔV TH , respectively. By monitoring the gate current variations at different temperatures, activation energies associated with the electrons and holes trapping could be determined and correlated with the presence of nitrogen (electron traps) or gallium (hole traps) vacancies. Moreover, the electrical measurements suggested the generation of a new electron-trap upon long-time bias stress, associated with the creation of crystallographic dislocation-like defects extending across different interfaces (p-GaN/AlGaN/GaN) of the gate stack.},

  abstract     = {The effect of annealing on the switching characteristics of memristor devices cannot be overlooked because the thermal process can exhibit both positive and negative effects on the performance of the devices. We investigated the switching behavior of TaO x -based memristors (electrochemical metallization cell type, ECM) that were Ar-ambient annealed under two conditions, with and without the active electrode. We found a high concentration of metal species in the TaO x films, even in the device where the TaO x was annealed without the active top electrode. This indicates that the properties of the annealed films encourage the diffusion of metal species in the oxide. We suggest that the increase in non-lattice oxygen (by 4.1\%, indicating a higher concentration of V o defects) after the annealing process plays a role in this phenomenon. In addition, the concentration of metal species that exist prior to the switching activation as well as the structure of the conducting bridge determines the switching stability of the devices. The device that annealed before top electrode deposition shows the worst stability; conversely, the device that annealed after top electrode deposition has the best coefficient of variation of the LRS and HRS which is 4.69\% and 78.8\%, respectively. Electrical and materials analyses were conducted to understand this phenomenon. This study provides insight into the compatibility of ECM in CMOS post-processing.},

With the increase in temperature, leakage current increased about two orders of magnitude combined with the variation of leakage mechanisms.

The conduction band offset present at the In 2 O 3 /ZnO heterointerface affects the device&#39;s operating characteristics, as is the thickness of the individual oxide layers. The latter is investigated using a variety of experimental and computational modeling techniques. An average field-effect mobility ( μ FE ) of &gt;50 cm 2 V −1 s −1 , accompanied by a low threshold voltage and a high on/off ratio (∼10 8 ), is achieved using an optimal channel configuration. The high μ FE in these TFTs is found to correlate with the presence of a quasi-two-dimensional electron gas at the In 2 O 3 /ZnO interface. This work provides important insight into the operating principles of heterojunction metal oxide TFTs, which can aid further developments.},

In this study, we controllably relieve the local strain field of AlGaN/GaN HEMTs by milling micro-trenches underneath the channel and compare the device performance as a function of the relieved strain as well as radiation dosage. Micro-Raman results suggest that the trenches locally relax the strain in device layers, decreasing the 2DEG density and mobility. Intriguingly, such strain relaxation is shown to minimize the radiation damage, measured after 10 Mrads of 60 Co-gamma exposure. For example, a 6-trench device showed only ∼8\% and ∼6\% decrease in saturation drain current and maximum transconductance, respectively, compared to corresponding values of ∼15\% and ∼30\% in a no-trench device. Negative and positive threshold voltage shifts are observed in 6-trench and no-trench devices, respectively, after gamma radiation. We hypothesize that the extent of gamma radiation damage depends on the strain level in the devices. Thus, even though milling a trench decreases 2DEG mobility, such decrease under gamma radiation is far less in a 6-trench device (∼1.5\%) compared to a no-trench device (∼20\%) with higher built-in strain.},

The device exhibits stable bipolar resistive switching behavior with a high on–off ratio, long retention time, and good endurance.

Photoactive films with intrinsic optical anisotropy are necessary for IPPDs. This study reports an achievement of photoactive films based on all-polymer heterojunction films with in-plane optical anisotropy using a simple bottom-up self-assembly method. Both the donor (TQ1) and acceptor (N2200) polymers have the same spatial orientation with distinct anisotropy, approaching a dichroic ratio (DR) of 8. Polarization-sensitive light absorption is due to the uniaxially oriented polymer chains, which are dominated by lamellar packing with edge-on orientation. For IPPDs based on this anisotropic all-polymer heterojunction film, a photocurrent anisotropy was found with a polarized photocurrent ratio of 2.6. The detectivity of these IPPDs was found to be 1.9 × 10 11 Jones (@ ∼600 nm, 0 V bias). Our work shows that oriented polymer donor–acceptor films fabricated using bottom-up self-assembly have great potential in applications, such as polarization detection.},

Phase-pure films of Sr 3 SnO can be grown by molecular beam epitaxy, but they do not have the required extremely high hole-doping densities (&gt;1 × 10 21 cm −3 ) for which superconductivity has been observed in bulk materials. To date, high hole-doping densities have been achieved via inducing strontium deficiency, which inevitably results in impurity phases. Here, we show that indium acts as an effective hole dopant in Sr 3 SnO and can be used to achieve high hole doping densities in stoichiometric films. Films with carrier densities as high as 1.5 × 10 21 cm −3 remain non-superconducting. We, therefore, suggest that Sr 3 SnO is probably not an intrinsic superconductor. A second question addressed in this work is the measurement of the intrinsic electrical transport properties of Sr 3 SnO, given its rapid degradation in air. We show that even in inert atmospheres, reducing the time needed for establishing electrical contacts and protecting the Sr 3 SnO film result in improved electrical properties. We demonstrate low carrier density films (4 × 10 18 cm −3 ) with carrier mobilities of 400 cm 2 V −1 s −1 at 10 K.},

  abstract     = {Intensive research into functional oxides has been triggered by the quest for a solid-state universal memory with high-storage density, non-volatility, high read/write speed, and random access. The ferroelectric random-access memory (FeRAM), in which the information is stored in the spontaneous ferroelectric polarization of the material, offers great promise as nonvolatile and multistate memory, but its destructive electrical reading step requires a rewrite step after each reading, increasing energy consumption. As an alternative, optical nondestructive readout is based on the ferroelectric polarization dependence of the photovoltaic response in materials and has been reported in two-states ferroelectric memories and multistate devices with limited photocurrent switchability due to asymmetric interfacial effects. In this work, we report a nonvolatile oxide memory device based on a symmetric heterostructure with eight stable and well-controlled remanent polarization (P r ) states, written electrically by voltage pulse and read optically through polarization-dependent short-circuit photocurrent I sc or open circuit photovoltage V oc . This symmetric capacitor demonstrates a clear proportionality between I sc (V oc ) and P r , allowing to achieve a 100\% switchability of the photovoltaic response. The memory devices based on 3-bit data storage show good performance in terms of data retention, fatigue behavior, and repeatability of writing and reading cycles. Thanks to the very high sensitivity of the optical reading method, the number of states could largely exceed eight, being limited only by the electrical writing step precision. These results are particularly exciting for the development of next-generation ferroelectric memory devices with increased memory storage density and lower power consumption.},

The results indicate that the twisting response originating from the structural phase transitions between vortex and helical states is tunable in magnitude and orientation by manipulating the external electric fields.

  abstract     = {Josephson parametric amplifiers are an important part of a modern superconducting quantum computing platform and squeezed quantum states generation devices. Traveling wave and impedance-matched parametric amplifiers provide broad bandwidth for high-fidelity single-shot readout of multiple qubit superconducting circuits. Here, we present a quantum-limited 3-wave-mixing parametric amplifier based on superconducting nonlinear asymmetric inductive elements (SNAILs), whose useful bandwidth is enhanced with an on-chip two-section impedance-matching circuit based on microstrip transmission lines. The amplifier dynamic range is increased using an array of 67 SNAILs with 268 Josephson junctions, forming a nonlinear quarter-wave resonator. Operating in a current-pumped mode, we experimentally demonstrate an average gain of 17 dB across 300 MHz bandwidth, along with an average saturation power of –100 dBm, which can go as high as −97 dBm with quantum-limited noise performance. Moreover, the amplifier can be fabricated using a simple technology with just one e-beam lithography step.},

Realizing spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) in synaptic electronics is critical toward bio-inspired neuromorphic computing systems. Here, we report on stochastic artificial synapses based on nanoscale magnetic tunnel junctions that can implement STDP harnessing stochastic magnetization switching. We further demonstrate that both the magnitude and the temporal requirements for STDP can be modulated via engineering the pre- and post-synaptic voltage pulses. Moreover, based on arrays of binary magnetic synapses, unsupervised learning can be realized for neuromorphic computing tasks such as pattern recognition with great computing accuracy and efficiency.

In this paper, we predicted a stable 2D noncollinear antiferromagnetic triangular lattice T-FeO 2 . The ground state is 120 ° antiferromagnetic with stronger next nearest neighbor exchange coupling than that of nearest neighbor exchange coupling because of the RKKY interaction. Our Monte Carlo simulations reveal that the magnetic phase transition is from a 120 ° antiferromagnetic state to a stripy state and then to a paramagnetic state with increasing temperature. In addition, by tuning the spin direction from an in plane antiferromagnetic state to a canted weak ferromagnetic state, a nontrivial topological phase transition could be induced. Our investigation about magnetic property and nontrivial topological phase transition is very promising for antiferromagnetic spintronics.},

Apart from giant negative magnetoresistance (MR) at T C , plateau-like MR and a topological Hall effect (THE) are observed at a low magnetic field for each compound below respective T C . The plateau-like MR is attributed to a compensation of negative MR with a ferromagnetically ordered structure of Tb atoms by positive MR with a noncoplanar spin structure of the Co Kagome lattice. The THE is attributed to the noncoplanar spin structure of the Co Kagome lattice only. The MR and the Hall resistivity of each compound are reduced dramatically and undergo a reversal of its sign during cooling. The reversal phenomenon at the low temperature can be related to the freezing of spins of Co atoms. The transport in DyCo 2 is more sensitive to magnetic fields than that in TbCo 2 which is consistent with a stronger 4 f– 3 d interaction. Observations of these transport phenomena make RCo 2 compounds promising for functional applications in spintronic devices.},

The SMR in the Pt/YIG grown on Si substrate is comparable to that grown on widely used Gd 3 Ga 5 O 12 substrate, indicating that the large SMR can be achieved irrespective of the crystallinity. We deduced the spin mixing conductance from the Pt thickness dependence of the SMR to find the high interface quality of the optimized Pt/YIG grown on Si in terms of spin current. We also clarified that the SMR correlates well with the magnetization, the interface roughness, and carrier density. These findings highlight that optimizing YIG properties is a key to control of magnetization by spin current, leading to the development of the low power consumption spintronic device based on the magnetic insulator.},

A normalization factor introduced to SP analysis eliminates a contribution provoked by deviation of spin sources and leads to a more accurate determination of the spin diffusion length in PTCDA. While SP with Permalloy as a spin source is effective in generating detectable V ISHE ⁠ , the LSSE from yttrium iron garnet shows no convincing sign of spin injection. In addition, spin-flip scattering induced by hybrid states undermining electrical spin injection is negligible in SP. These results are attributed to interfaces between spin sources and PTCDA, indicative of the importance of injection methods and material choices.},

The measurements are complemented by a three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain solution to the elastic wave equation, in which the rms roughness and correlation length at heterointerfaces are varied, and the parameters yielding best agreement with experiment are determined using machine learning. Both experimental measurements and simulations demonstrate the existence of a minimum in the cross-plane thermal conductivity as a function of interface density, which is evidence of a crossover from incoherent to coherent phonon transport as the interface density increases. This minimum persists with increasing temperature, indicating the continued dominance of the temperature-independent interface and alloy-disorder scattering over the temperature-dependent three-phonon scattering in thermal transport through III–V alloy superlattices.},

Despite their low ϕ m , Ti and Al gave unusually small ϕ B TE probably due to the interfacial reaction between metal and p-type GaN. We also found that Mo/p-GaN SBDs exhibited a clear rectifying property even at 800 K, and the thermionic emission diffusion (TED) model explained well their high-temperature I–V characteristics. Furthermore, the temperature variation of Schottky barrier heights determined using a TED model (ϕ B TED ) almost agrees with half of the temperature variation of the bandgap energy.

The TCO/p-In 0.53 Ga 0.47 As contact exhibits explicit rectifying behavior in current–voltage measurement, with an effective Schottky barrier height of 0.587 eV ( I – V ) and 0.567 eV ( C – V ). Conversely, the TCO/n-In 0.53 Ga 0.47 As exhibits the Ohmic behavior. From high-resolution transmission electron microscopy observations, we identified two types of interfacial layers between TCO and InGaAs: an In/Ga-rich InGaAs oxide layer and an In/Ga-deficient InGaAs layer. These interfacial layers may have a significant impact on the performance of the Schottky barrier contact. An ultra-thin Ni-layer insertion at the TCO/n + -InGaAs interface reduces the contact resistivity by more than an order of magnitude while maintaining high transparency. The TCO/p-InGaAs Schottky barrier contact also performs broadband light detection from the visible to SWIR region in a front-side illumination manner, which is highly promising for detecting wavelengths covering the optical communication band.},

  abstract     = {Black silicon (BSi) is a synthetic nanomaterial with high aspect ratio nano protrusions inducing several interesting properties such as a very large absorptivity of incident radiation. We have recently shown that heavily doping the BSi in volume enables to significantly enhance its mid-infrared absorptivity and tune its spectral range of interest up to 20 μ m. In the present letter, we explore the effect of surface doping on BSi radiative properties and its absorptance in particular since surface doping enables reaching even larger dopant concentrations than volume doping but at more limited penetration depths. We considered 12 different wafers of BSi, fabricated with cryogenic plasma etching on n- and p-type silicon wafers and doped using ion-implantation with different dopant types, dosages, and ion beam energies, leading to different dopant concentrations and profiles. The different wafers radiative properties, reflectance, transmittance, and absorptance are experimentally measured using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. We show that doping an n-type BSi wafer with phosphorous with a dose of 10 17 atm/cm 2 and an energy of 100 keV increases its absorptivity up to 98\% in the spectral range of 1–5 μ m. We propose a simple phenomenological explanation of the observed results based on the dopant concentration profiles and the corresponding incident radiation penetration depth. Obtained results provide simple design rules and pave the way for using ion-implanted BSi for various applications, such as solar energy harvesting, thermo-photovoltaics, and infrared radiation sensing, where both high absorptance and variable dopant concentration profiles are required.},

  abstract     = {Dissipation alone can produce counterintuitive topological wave transport that is otherwise absent in a non-dissipative system. This work demonstrates the influence of dissipation on degeneracies that arise in the context of elastic wave transport. The conditions on the parameters necessary to observe non-Hermitian degeneracies in the Bloch spectrum are precisely derived. It will be shown—contrary to the expectation from singularity theory of a linear eigenvalue problem—that a proportionally damped system with commutative damping does not exhibit non-Hermitian degeneracies. The necessity of a non-commutative and non-proportional dissipation model to observe non-Hermitian degeneracies (or exceptional points) is emphasized. Non-proportional dissipation is used to induce a non-Hermitian degeneracy in a local resonance sub-Bragg bandgap of a linear chain, without using negative damping. While Bloch waves are chosen to illustrate the influence of dissipation, the results readily extend to waves in non-periodic media as well as other wave and vibration transport problems.},

The Co monolayer grows in two different modifications, such as hcp stacking and a reconstructed ε -like phase. While hcp islands show a weak proximity effect on Co and a little suppression of superconductivity in the substrate next to it, the more complex ε-like stacking becomes almost fully superconducting. We explain the weak proximity effect between Ru and hcp Co and the rather abrupt jump of the superconducting order parameter by a low transparency of the interface. In contrast, the strong proximity effect without a jump of the order parameter in the ε-like phase indicates a highly transparent interface. This work highlights that the proximity effect between a superconductor and a normal metal strongly depends on the crystal structure of the interface, which allows to engineer the proximity effect in hybrid structures.},

Cross-sectional STEM characterization of the YIG-rich films reveals three distinct sublayers: the bottom layer is a coherent epitaxial garnet layer with higher unit cell volume than that of YIG; the second layer is garnet exhibiting crystalline defects and misorientation; and the upper layer is amorphous. Highly defective regions within the second layer are richer in Ba, suggesting that the microstructure is promoted by the insolubility of Ba in YIG.

Here, hydrogenation/fluorination covalent functionalized graphene (HC/FC) was employed, and the synergistic effect of covalent functionalization and intrinsic electric field ( E in ) was introduced to further improve and understand the interfacial properties of the heterostructure. Under the covalent functionalization, type-II band alignment with UV-infrared dual-band absorption was found for β -Ga 2 O 3 /HC heterostructure, while reserved type-II band alignment with hole doping was realized for p -type β -Ga 2 O 3 /FC heterostructure. Upon introducing the synergistic effect of covalent functionalization and E in for β -Ga 2 O 3 /hydro-fluorinated graphene (HCF) heterostructure, except for the above similar characters, both the band offsets and optical absorption are further enhanced in β -Ga 2 O 3 /HCF heterostructures. When the direction of intrinsic E in points to the contact interface, the Fermi level of β -Ga 2 O 3 /F-HCF was much closer to the valence band of β -Ga 2 O 3 . It was thought that the synergistic effect of covalent functionalization and E in was more beneficial to promote the application of p -type β -Ga 2 O 3 . These findings were deeply revealed by the band levels, electrostatic potential, and charge transfer introduced.

In this study, an organic ligand on CdSe/ZnS QDs was exchanged with F − ligand in a non-polar solvent, which is suitable for device fabrication. As a result, stability of the QDs was improved, while the processability of QLED devices was maintained. Both external quantum efficiency of electroluminescence and device lifetime were improved, mainly because the thinner ligand layer improved the carrier injection efficiency.},

By embedding an H-shaped resonance structure, which consists of a fin-line and two flip-flopped GaAs Schottky diodes, into the E-wall of a waveguide, the fed terahertz waves are modulated by the inductive-capacitive (LC) resonance transformation of the structure. Based on this mechanism, a modulator working in the frequency band around 140 GHz is fabricated and packaged. Thanks to the LC resonance transformation, the presented modulator exhibits a low insertion loss of 1.8 dB at 138 GHz, a large modulation depth higher than 99\% at 148 GHz, and high modulation speeds up to 30 Gbps at 146 GHz.

Furthermore, by introducing bias retardation, we also reconstruct the original phase distribution.

The position of this emissive p–n junction in the interelectrode gap is important, because it determines whether the emission is affected by constructive or destructive interference. An appealing LEC feature is that the entire device can be fabricated by low-cost solution-based printing and coating. Here, we show, somewhat unexpectedly, that the replacement of conventional vacuum-deposited indium-tin-oxide (ITO) for the positive anode with solution-processed poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene-sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) can result in an increase in the peak light-emission output by 75\%. We demonstrate that this emission increase is due to that the p–n junction shifts from a position of destructive interference in the center of the interelectrode gap with ITO to a position of constructive interference closer to the anode with PEDOT:PSS. We rationalize the anodic p–n junction shift by significant anion transfer into the soft and porous PEDOT:PSS electrode during LEC operation, which is prohibited for the ITO electrode because of its compact and hard nature. Our study, thus, contributes with important design criteria for the attainment of efficient light emission from solution-processed LEC devices.},

In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the so-called radiative sky cooling strategy. This approach consists in optimizing the thermal radiation of cells or modules—with the help of photonic structures—by taking advantage of the atmospheric transparency in the 8–13 range. In this paper, we present an in-depth analysis of radiative sky cooling applied to silicon based photovoltaic modules. A simulation of a preliminary design of a photonic structure for possible radiative sky cooling of a module is also proposed.},

Despite recent breakthroughs, it is generally recognized that significant advances in n- type organic thermoelectric materials must be made before organic TEGs can make a real impact. Yet, in this perspective, we make the argument that to accelerate progress in the field of organic TEGs, future research should focus more effort into the design and fabrication of application-oriented devices, even though materials have considerable room for improvement.

  abstract     = {Free-standing carbon nanofibers have been recognized as an effective interlayer to improve sulfur cathode electronic conductivity and inhibit shuttling of polysulfides. However, carbon materials show a limited effect on improving electrochemical performance of lithium–sulfur batteries (LSBs) due to their nonpolar and weak physical limitations for the dissolvable polysulfides. It has been reported that introducing chemical bonds between polar compounds and polysulfides helps to suppress the shuttle effect of polysulfides via combining physical confinement with chemical adsorption. Herein, free-standing N-doped carbon nanofibers embedded with bimetallic CoNi (CoNi@N-CNFs) are constructed as an interlayer for LSBs. Apart from improving electronic conductivity of the sulfur cathode, the CoNi@N-CNF interlayer also displays excellent adsorption ability to the dissolvable polysulfides and promotes conversion reactions between sulfur species. Under the synergistic effect of the carbon framework and CoNi bimetals, the CoNi@N-CNF interlayer achieves decent electrochemical performance with a high initial discharge capacity of 1563 mAh g −1 at 0.2C and 0.53\% capacity decay per cycle during 100 cycles.},

Coupled with the spectroscopic studies, impedance and nuclear magnetic resonance investigations also show that the ion transport is independent of the polymer segmental motion and is governed by the solvated species {[Li(G4)] + }, very similar to the scenario in ionic liquids. As a result, the magnitude of ionic conductivity and activation energies of the gel polymer electrolyte are very similar to that of the liquid electrolyte.

However, NPG encounters significant shortcomings in practical cooling process that hinders its further application. Here, we systematically investigate the effect of defects and substituting a small amount of additional alien molecules on the barocaloric performance of NPG plastic crystals. It is found that low concentration of defects and substitution moderately affect the isothermal entropy, adiabatic temperature, and thermal hysteresis of NPG. Importantly, the substituted carbon nanotubes significantly enhance the thermal conductivity by more than one order of magnitude, arising from structural-modification enhanced acoustic phonons. Using dimensionless variable, we define the comprehensive cooling performance that represents the most promising working materials for barocaloric refrigeration. The present work provides important guidance on improving the barocaloric performance of NPG as prototypical plastic crystals for practical cooling applications.},

  abstract     = {The improvement of the interface between a lithium metal and a solid electrolyte layer is very important for the application of a lithium anode coated by solid electrolytes in lithium metal batteries. In order to address the issues of interface performance and compatibility between solid electrolyte films prepared by magnetron sputtering and lithium metals and the suppression of lithium dendrite during the cycling, a three-layer interface solid electrolyte film based on carbon-doped lithium phosphate oxynitride (LiCPON) was employed for coating a lithium metal. The sandwich structure of LiCPON by introducing an ultra-thin lithium niobium oxynitride (LiNbON) layer prepared by sputtering LiNbO 3 in nitrogen ambient can be confirmed by time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry. Atomic force microscopy data indicated that the surface of the LiCPON thin film with the sandwich structure is flatter and smoother than that of the LiCPON thin film on the lithium metal. The interface impedance of the symmetric battery based on the sandwich structure of the LiCPON coating lithium metal was reduced from 512.2 to 65.4 Ω, and the symmetric battery stable cycles from 300 h with an overpotential of more than 200 mV to 400 h with low overpotential of about 77 mV. These results suggest that functional multilayer solid electrolyte films become an effective method for protecting lithium. The incorporation of ultra-thin LiNbON into the LiCPON thin film could significantly decrease interface impedance between the lithium metal and solid electrolyte layer.},

The choice of the HM and its arrangement plays a major role for the SOT induced magnetization switching in magnetic heterostructures. Generally, thin Ta is used as an underlayer to the HM layer for better adhesion and smoothness of the HM layer. Here, we show that Ta addition to the asymmetric stack Pt/Co/Pt gives rise to several compelling effects, viz., thermoelectric effects [particularly, anomalous Nernst effect (ANE)], and enhanced perpendicular magnetic anisotropy which was negligible in a Pt/Co/Pt stack. For this Ta/Pt/Co/Pt stack, the antidamping-SOT values are evaluated after carefully removing the contribution from the ANE and it is found to match the AD-SOT of the Pt/Co/Pt stack. We have observed current-induced field-free magnetization switching Ta/Pt/Co/Pt stack with Co thickness gradient. Furthermore, we have utilized the thermoelectric effects to develop a technique to detect the field-free magnetization switching. This technique detects the second harmonic ANE signal as a reading mechanism. Using ANE symmetry with the applied current, the switching can be detected in a single current sweep which was corroborated to the conventional DC Hall method.},

The CBL thicknesses of different annealing temperatures were derived from C–V measurements and the Fermi level position of the sample surfaces of different annealing temperature was characterized by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements, indicating good process controllability. Furthermore, photoluminescence spectra were measured to study the effect of oxygen annealing. The fabricated UMOSFET showed normally off with a V th of 11.5 V, an on-state resistance of 1.48 Ω cm 2 , a maximum on-state current of 11 A/cm 2 , an on–off ratio of 6 × 10 4 , and a three-terminal breakdown voltage over 100 V.

However, the high throughput and reproducible methods for nanopatterning of such films for advanced light-emitting applications are still missing.

Using theoretical calculations, we design the period of the structures to achieve high quality-factor optical modes in the emission band of NPLs.

Both microstructural characteristics can be altered by applying electric fields, but changes are time-dependent and relax, upon field removal, into a diverse range of remanent states. As a result, the measured conductance is a complex history-dependent function of electric field and time. Here, we show that complexity in the kinetics of microstructural change, in this ferroelectric system, can generate transport behavior that is strongly reminiscent of that seen in key neurological building blocks, such as synapses. Successive voltage pulses, of positive and negative polarity, progressively enhance or suppress domain wall related conductance (analogous to synaptic potentiation and depression), in a way that depends on both the pulse voltage magnitude and frequency. Synaptic spike-rate-dependent plasticity and even Ebbinghaus forgetting behavior, characteristic of learning and memory in the brain, can be emulated as a result. Conductance can also be changed according to the time difference between designed identical voltage pulse waveforms, applied to top and bottom contact electrodes, in a way that can mimic both Hebbian and anti-Hebbian spike-timing-dependent plasticity in synapses. While such features have been seen in, and developed for, other kinds of memristors, few have previously been realized through the manipulation of conducting ferroelectric domain walls.},

We demonstrate that the lower crystallization temperature of HZO films originates from a densified film deposition with an anhydrous H 2 O 2 oxidant in the atomic layer deposition process. As a consequence of this densification, H 2 O 2 -based HZO films showed completely crystallinity with fewer defects at a lower annealing temperature of 350 °C. This reduction in the crystallization temperature additionally suppresses the oxidation of TiN electrodes, thereby improving device reliability. The low-temperature crystallization process produces an H 2 O 2 -based HZO capacitor with a high remanent polarization ( P r ), reduced leakage current, high breakdown voltage, and better endurance. Furthermore, while an O 3 -based HZO capacitor requires wake-up cycling to achieve stable P r , the H 2 O 2 -based HZO capacitor demonstrates a significantly reduced wake-up nature. Anhydrous H 2 O 2 oxidant enables the fabrication of a more reliable ferroelectric HZO device using a low process thermal budget (350 °C).},

  abstract     = {The energy of an Andreev bound state in a clean normal metal in contact with two superconductors disperses with the difference Δ ϕ in the superconducting phase between the superconductors in much the same way as the energies of electrons in a one-dimensional crystal disperse with the crystal momentum k of the electrons. A normal metal with n superconductors maps onto a n − 1 dimensional crystal, each dimension corresponding to the phase difference Δ ϕ i between a specific pair of superconductors. The resulting band structure as a function of the phase differences { Δ ϕ i } in such ballistic devices has been proposed to have a topological nature with gapped regions characterized by different Chern numbers separated by regions where the gap in the quasiparticle spectrum closes. A similar complex evolution of the quasiparticle spectrum with { Δ ϕ i } has also been predicted for diffusive normal metals in contact with multiple superconductors. While the underlying topological description is different in diffusive devices, gapped regions of the band diagram associated with different topological indices are also separated by regions where the gap closes. Here, we show that the variation of the density of states at the Fermi energy of such a system can be directly probed by relatively simple conductance measurements, allowing rapid characterization of the energy spectrum.},

  abstract     = {In ferromagnetic metals, transverse spin currents are thought to be absorbed via dephasing—i.e., destructive interference of spins precessing about the strong exchange field. Yet, due to the ultrashort coherence length of ≈1 nm in typical ferromagnetic thin films, it is difficult to distinguish dephasing in the bulk from spin-flip scattering at the interface. Here, to assess which mechanism dominates, we examine transverse spin-current absorption in ferromagnetic NiCu alloy films with reduced exchange fields. We observe that the coherence length increases with decreasing Curie temperature, as weaker dephasing in the film bulk slows down spin absorption. Moreover, nonmagnetic Cu impurities do not diminish the efficiency of spin-transfer torque from the absorbed spin current. Our findings affirm that the transverse spin current is predominantly absorbed by dephasing inside the nanometer-thick ferromagnetic metals, even with high impurity contents.},

  abstract     = {Magneto-ionic control of magnetic anisotropy is an emerging voltage-controlled approach that aims to offer much lower power consumption than current-controlled manipulation of magnetization. Moreover, magneto-ionic systems are ideal candidates for non von Neumann computing architectures, such as neuromorphic and stochastic computing due to their non-volatile and analog nature. One of the key metrics to quantify the efficiency of voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy (VCMA) is the magneto-electric voltage coefficient ( ⁠ Δ H c / | Δ V | ⁠ ). Here, we show greater than one order of magnitude improvement in this efficiency compared to existing solid-state systems using a Co/Pd multilayer heterostructure. By performing a systematic study of the Co thickness, the Pd thickness, and the number of repeat units of engineered Co/Pd multilayers, we identify a narrow bandwidth of the Co thickness from 2–2.5 Å, Pd thickness from 1.4–1.7 nm, and repeat units from 7–9, to maximize the VCMA. Compared to rivaled liquid electrolyte systems, this platform has the advantage of faster speeds and easier integration for on-chip logic and memory devices.},

  abstract     = {Incorporating metallic nanostructures into a cesium lead halide [CsPbX 3 (X = Cl, Br, I)] perovskite system has attracted considerable attention for improving the performance of amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) and lasing. However, the ASE/lasing threshold is normally quite high since the photophysical properties of pristine CsPbX 3 quantum dots (QDs) are limited and the traditionally utilized metal nanoparticles suffer from a weak localized surface plasmon resonance within a narrow spectral range. Herein, a configuration of a silica coated CsPbBr 3 QDs (CsPbBr 3 @SiO 2 QDs) film incorporated with the deposition of gold nanorods (AuNRs) underneath has been proposed for high-performance ASE. In this configuration, SiO 2 coating not only serves as an insulation layer to avoid the large Ohmic loss between CsPbBr 3 and Au but also contributes to improved photoluminescence quantum yield and stability against water, heat, and ultraviolet light compared to the counterparts of pristine CsPbBr 3 QDs. As a result, the fabricated CsPbBr 3 @SiO 2 -AuNRs hybrid film yields a low-threshold ASE (23.6 μ J/cm 2 ) with excellent photostability owing to efficient exciton–plasmon coupling effect, which is only 23\% of the pristine CsPbBr 3 QDs film (102 μ J/cm 2 ). The demonstration of metallic NRs coupled perovskite QDs not only provides a strategy for realizing strong light–matter interactions but also paves the way for improving the performance of perovskite-based optoelectronic devices.},

To address this issue, a detailed analysis revealed that the dark line defects were dislocations generated by local residual shear stresses associated with mesa formation on highly strained epitaxial layers. A technique for controlling the local concentration of shear stress using a sloped mesa geometry was proposed based on insight gained by modeling the stress distribution at the edge of the mesa stripe. Experimental results showed that this technique succeeded in completely suppressing the emergence of dark-line defects.

Here, we demonstrate that FPD plays critical roles in determining the electronic properties of ferroelectric superlattices and creates coexisted two-dimensional hole gas (2DHG) and two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG). We further unravel that FPD competes the traditional polar discontinuity, thus, can lead to various final interface states.

  abstract     = {Achieving giant magneto-optical birefringence is a long-standing goal in view of its intriguing physics and potential applications in transmitted light modulation. Due to the unique geometric features of two-dimensional materials with extremely large shape anisotropy, the resultant couplings among magnetic, electric, and optical properties enable giant magneto-optical birefringence effects, as represented by a record-breaking magneto-optical Cotton–Mouton coefficient in two-dimensional material systems. In this Perspective, we introduce the discovery of the giant magneto-optical birefringence effect in two-dimensional metal oxide dispersion in 2020, followed by analyses of the underlying mechanisms. We then discuss how the interplay of anisotropy and colloidal behavior affects the Cotton–Mouton effect. Finally, we proceed to potential applications and give our ideas about future developments in this emerging field.},

It demonstrates that the curved sheath field on the “plasma lens” plays an important role in the beam collimation. Such an approach considerably relaxes the constraints of complex design for the target fabrication and auxiliary laser pulse, opening new doors for high-repetition-rate collimated proton accelerations for innovative applications in upcoming high-repetition-rate petawatt laser systems.},

  abstract     = {Doping Magnéli phase Ti 4 O 7 by cation substitution has attracted some interest for modulating structure and properties enhancement, but it remains a big problem to understand how doping elements impact the thermodynamic and structural stability of Ti 4 O 7 . We utilized first-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) combined with machine learning (ML) to forecast the stability of doped Ti 4 O 7 . DFT calculations are used to model the thermodynamic and structural stability, as well as the electronic structure, of doped (Ti,M) 4 O 7 complexes (M = Sc, Y, La, Ce, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, and W). The results reveal that even if all (Ti,M) 4 O 7 are thermodynamically stable, the introduction of rare earth elements Y, La, and Ce causes great structural distortion. Employing Zr, Nb, Mo, and W can improve Ti 4 O 7 thermodynamic stability due to strong bond strength and minimal lattice distortion. The relevance of 78 doping element qualities and one processing feature (doping site) for (Ti,M) 4 O 7 stability is discovered using ML. The results show that modulus of rigidity and entropy of solid of doping atoms have the greatest influence on the thermodynamic and structural stability of doped Ti 4 O 7 , which is useful for predicting additional (Ti,M) 4 O 7 stability without DFT calculations. At a low doping concentration, Ce-doped Ti 4 O 7 with massive lattice distortion was synthesized, supporting the DFT results. This study not only applies to all doped Ti 4 O 7 complexes, setting the groundwork for stability of the planned high-performance cation substitution in defect Ti 4 O 7 , but also introduces a unique way of predicting stability in defect engineering.},

Herein, this work demonstrates a facile strategy to design highly efficient and stable Si photocathodes by utilizing the reduced graphene oxide (rGO) as a multifunctional interlayer to bridge the Pt catalysts and p-Si. The covalently grafted rGO layer forms a Schottky junction with p-Si allowing effective charge carrier extraction required for high efficiency, and, simultaneously, protects the Si surface and anchors Pt catalysts with enhanced stability. Consequently, the as-fabricated Pt/rGO/p-Si photocathodes exhibit an impressive PEC performance under simulated AM1.5G illumination with a high applied bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE) of 4.9\% and stability of over 110 hours, outperforming the Pt/p-Si control sample and state-of-the-art p-Si based photocathodes.

In this study, we realized the surface-enhanced photoacoustic effect by using high-refractive-index dielectric nanoparticles in their ultralow light absorption Ohmic-loss wavelength band. We performed finite element method simulation on a model with gallium phosphide nanorod dimmer and light absorbers in the dimmer gap. The Au nanowire, carbon nanotube, and nanotube filled with melanin molecules were sequentially considered as the light absorber. It is found that a photoacoustic wave surface enhancement factor of approximately 10 was achieved and the enhanced photoacoustic wave ensures the photoacoustic spectral signature of the light absorber. The potential of optimization for boosting enhancement factors was further analyzed. These results can provide considerable insight into molecular photoacoustic sensing and imaging.},

The two-port gyrator, which is essentially a lateral overtone bulk acoustic resonator, consists of a planar coil for Lorentz-force transduction and two top-bottom electrode pairs for piezoelectric transduction. The non-reciprocity is generated by the phase transition in the Lorentz-force coupling when an external vertical magnetic field is applied. The Lorentz-force gyrators based on both AlN and Al 0.7 Sc 0.3 N thin films demonstrate good non-reciprocity, i.e., the 180° phase difference, at approximately 517 and 388 MHz, respectively. Thanks to larger piezoelectric constants, the Al 0.7 Sc 0.3 N gyrator demonstrates easier impedance matching and a wider fractional bandwidth of 6.3\% at a magnetic field of 1.65 T compared to 1.3\% for an AlN device. Finally, an isolator consisting of the Lorentz-force gyrator and a shunt resistor is demonstrated over 35 dB of isolation and flat unidirectional transmission.},

  abstract     = {We introduce BULLKID, a phonon detector consisting of an array of dices acting as particle absorbers sensed by multiplexed Kinetic Inductance Detectors (KIDs). The dices are carved in a thick crystalline wafer and form a monolithic structure. The carvings leave a thin common disk intact in the wafer, acting both as holder for the dices and as substrate for the KID lithography. The prototype presented consists of an array of 64 dices of 5.4 × 5.4 × 5 mm 3 carved in a 3˝ diameter, 5 mm thick silicon wafer, with a common disk of 0.5 mm thick, hosting a 60 nm patterned aluminum layer. The resulting array is highly segmented but avoids the use of dedicated holding structures for each unit. Despite the fact that the uniformity of the KID electrical response across the array needs optimization, the operation of eight units with similar features shows, on average, a baseline energy resolution of 26 ± 7 eV. This makes it a suitable detector for low-energy processes such as direct interactions of dark matter and coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering.},

  abstract     = {The current response to sub-terahertz radiation was studied experimentally over a wide range of temperatures for AlGaN/GaN and graphene transistors. It was found that the responsivity is enhanced at low temperatures by about an order of magnitude for AlGaN/GaN and more than two orders of magnitude for graphene transistors. However, the responsivity increase saturates at temperatures below 70–100 K. These results were explained by the temperature dependence of the charge carriers&#39; mobility, which plays a dominant role in the current responsivity. It is also shown that in a realistic device, the access resistance may decrease the current responsivity, and in the case of high access resistance, the subthreshold swing may also affect the current responsivity. These results showed that extremely high carriers&#39; mobility in graphene makes it very promising for high-frequency detectors.},

  abstract     = {We report the influence of multiple plasmon losses on the dynamical diffraction of high-energy electrons, in a scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) study. Using an experimental setup enabling energy-filtered momentum-resolved STEM, it is shown that the successive excitation of up to five plasmons within the imaged material results in a subsequent and significant redistribution of low-angle intensity in diffraction space. An empirical approach, based on the convolution with a Lorentzian kernel, is shown to reliably model this redistribution in dependence of the energy-loss. Our study demonstrates that both the significant impact of inelastic scattering in low-angle diffraction at elevated specimen thickness and a rather straightforward model can be applied to mimic multiple plasmon scattering, which otherwise is currently not within reach for multislice simulations due to computational complexity.},

To investigate the potential of FBAR devices working as the liquid sensors, we study the operating law of FBAR in liquid environments and explore the different loading effects of liquid on the shear mode and longitudinal mode. By analyzing the device and liquid interactions, we modify the Mason model of FBAR in the liquid environment. Subsequently, the influence of the piezoelectric film with different tilt angles and liquids on the characteristics of FBAR is discussed. We also prepared Sc 0.2 Al 0.8 N film-based FBAR to confirm the influence of different liquid environments on the resonant performances. The results show that the frequency drift of FBAR in the shear mode is related to density and viscosity of liquid, and the frequency drift of FBAR in the longitudinal mode is related to bulk modulus and density of liquid. The resonant frequency of FBAR in the shear mode is more sensitive with glycerol solution than that of FBAR in the longitudinal mode. This work can provide a research basis for the application of FBAR liquid sensors.},

However, most organic nonvolatile photomemory devices use a charge-trap-type architecture that is complex and difficult to miniaturize. This paper proposes a nonvolatile polyimide (PI) resistive photomemory device with a simple metal–PI–metal configuration; its resistance can be altered using pulsed ultraviolet (UV) irradiation and can be maintained at the altered level even after irradiation has ceased. The resistance can also be returned to the initial state by subsequent irradiation with UV light. The memory window is around 7 order of magnitude. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and UV–visible/near-infrared spectroscopy demonstrated that UV irradiation caused a high-energy-gap ( E g ) aromatic form of PI to transform into low- E g quinoid form, prompting the dominant conduction mechanism of the photomemory device to change from hopping conduction to ohmic conduction. A model characterizing the PI-based photomemory device was also developed and is discussed herein.},

Here, based on first-principles calculations, we study a 2D structure of MnAl, which, in the bulk form, is a well-known permanent magnet. We show that in 2D, MnAl can stabilize in a square lattice with single-atom thickness. The ground state is an antiferromagnet (AFM) with checkerboard type magnetic ordering and an estimated Néel temperature of 60 K. The state has large magnetic moment (∼4 μ B per Mn) and sizable anisotropy (∼0.27 meV/f.u.), analogous to bulk MnAl. In the electronic band structure, the state exhibits a single type-I AFM nodal loop at the Fermi level, which is protected by mirror symmetry in the absence of spin–orbit coupling. Spin–orbit coupling opens only a small gap at the loop, preserving the band inversion feature. Furthermore, we show that a small strain (∼1\%) can drive a magnetic phase transition from the checkerboard AFM to a stripe-type AFM state, accompanied by a significant change in the band structure. Our result offers an intriguing platform for exploring the interplay among magnetism, topology, and phase transitions in low dimensions.},

Although enormous efforts have been paid to this field, the universality of the formation of polar topologies in various superlattices and their electric field dynamics is still unknown. Herein, we employ a phase-field model to construct three types of ferroelectric/paraelectric superlattices with tetragonal, rhombohedral, and orthorhombic symmetries and investigate their static structures and dynamic responses as a function of epitaxial strain. It is found that all superlattices undergo a similar vortex–spiral–in-plane topology transition, which corresponds to peaked dielectric permittivity curves and ferroelectric-, antiferroelectric-, and paraelectric-like hysteresis loops. Such polarization behaviors are attributed to the triple-well free energy landscape. The flexibility of hysteresis loops generates high energy density and efficiency of ferroelectric/paraelectric superlattices. This study offers a systematic view of the generality of polar topologies in multilayered ferroelectrics.},

The standard solution is based on stand-alone bulk ceramics glued directly on the haptic device. Thin-film actuators with metal–insulator–metal structure have been developed to directly integrate actuators on haptic plates. The thickness of thin films is limited to 2 μ m, leading to large capacitance and, thus, too high-power consumption. To solve this issue, we developed haptic devices based on a 10 μ m-thick PZT film deposited on a 0.65 mm-thick platinized silicon substrate. These thick films are made of a PZT composite slurry associated with sol-gel sol infiltration. They are dense and exhibit a permittivity of 1000 and dielectric loss lower than 0.05. Our fabricated haptic device containing three actuators connected in series exhibits an antisymmetric Lamb wave resonant mode at 62.0 kHz, in line with finite element modeling. At the limit of touch detection (1 μ m out of plane deflection), the power consumption of the haptic device is 150 mW at 40 V. This represents a 15-fold consumption reduction with respect to the same haptic device made with 0.5 μ m-thick PZT thin films.},

  abstract     = {Rare-earth-based magnetostrictive alloys exhibit giant low-field magnetostriction due to anisotropy compensation at specific compositions and temperatures. However, the normally strong temperature dependency of magnetostriction is a common issue that limits its application temperature range. Here, we found that low-field magnetostrictive properties were optimized over a wide temperature range in a low-cost Nd 0.2 Tb x Dy 0.8− x Fe 1.93 system. A 140 K temperature window with λ ≥ 750 ppm at 2 kOe was achieved in the Nd 0.2 Tb 0.3 Dy 0.5 Fe 1.93 compound, which is about 2.7 times wider than that in the well-known Terfenol-D composition. The construction of the Nd 0.2 Tb x Dy 0.8− x Fe 1.93 spin reorientation phase diagram revealed a slightly steeper slope of the phase boundary than that of the Nd-free system. Further analysis shows that a steep phase boundary allows the optimized composition to maintain low magnetocrystalline anisotropy and, thus, large low-field magnetostriction in a wide temperature range.

  abstract     = {In this study, GaN-based side-gate heterostructure transistors (SGHTs) with two electrical operating modes were fabricated. In the first operating mode, the SGHT was utilized as a common-source voltage amplifier with low power consumption and a broad input signal range. Analysis of the main scattering mechanisms affecting the electrical transport of two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in the channel revealed that polar optical phonon scattering and polarization Coulomb field (PCF) scattering play dominant roles under different side-gate voltages. In addition, channel current modulation of 2DEG electron mobility is primarily attributed to PCF scattering. Due to PCF scattering, the channel width also modulates the threshold voltage in this mode of operation. Moreover, in the second operating mode, the SGHT functioned as a traditional GaN high electron mobility transistor, allowing for electrically modulated threshold voltage and transconductance.},

  abstract     = {This Letter reports low-temperature (700 °C) growth of heavily Si-doped GaN (n ++ GaN) by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition with a resistivity as low as 1.9 × 10 −4 Ω·cm and an atomically smooth surface. Indium adatoms added during the growth of n ++ GaN play an important role in improving both the surface morphology and free electron concentration. On the one hand, acting as surfactant, they greatly boost the adatoms surface mobility at low growth temperature and mitigate Si-induced anti-surfactant effect. On the other hand, they can effectively suppress the formation of compensating defects, thus contributing to an extremely high electron concentration of 2.8 × 10 20 cm −3 . This high-quality n ++ GaN was further applied to the realization of Ohmic contacts with an ultra-low contact resistance for AlGaN/GaN high electron mobility transistors. The carrier gas was carefully modulated for the selective area epitaxy (SAE) of n ++ GaN to facilitate the nucleation of GaN on the dielectric mask, which effectively suppressed the undesired mass transport and resulted in a uniform SAE of n ++ GaN in the recessed source/drain regions. A nearly defect-free interface between the n ++ GaN and two-dimensional electron gas channel has been also realized, and the resistance induced by the interface was only 0.03 Ω·mm. As a result, an ultra-low contact resistance of 0.07 Ω·mm has been realized. This work lays a solid foundation for further improving the performance of GaN-based RF and power devices.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we use Si/Tl 5 Al 1 /TiN for a source/drain ohmic contact to demonstrate an ultra-low contact resistance of 0.11 Ω mm (ρ c = 2.62 × 10 −7 Ω cm 2 ) on non-recessed i-InAlN/GaN heterostructures. The Ti 5 Al 1 alloy was used to suppress the out-diffusion of Al and extract N from the InAlN layer, which aided the formation of ohmic contact by improving the tunneling efficiency of electrons, as we have reported in the past work. A thin Si inter-layer combined with the Ti 5 Al 1 alloy is proposed to further reduce contact resistance. A heavy n-type InAlN layer was obtained through doping with Si atoms to improve the tunneling transport of electrons. Furthermore, the TiN inclusions penetrated into the GaN channel because the in-diffused Si promoted the decomposition of GaN at a high annealing temperature and the in-diffused Ti reacted with GaN. These TiN inclusions provided direct contact with two-dimensional electron gas, offering an additional path for the injection of electrons into the channel. The tunneling and spike mechanism worked alternately to lower the contact resistance at different annealing temperatures (dividing at 900 °C), implying that the joint effect of tunneling and the spike mechanism was initially promoted in the formation of ohmic contact. The mechanism of this Si/Ti 5 Al 1 /TiN ohmic contact was fully understood through microscopic and thermodynamic analyses. These results shed light on the mechanism for the formation of ohmic contact in a gold-free metal stack for GaN-based HEMTs.},

Bi 2 O 2 Se nanowires synthesized by chemical vapor deposition method presented a high field-effect mobility up to ∼1.34 × 10 4 cm 2 V −1 s −1 and exhibited ballistic transport in the low back-gate voltage ( V g ) regime where conductance plateaus were observed. When further increasing the electron density by increasing V g , we entered the phase coherent regime and weak antilocalization (WAL) was observed. The spin relaxation length extracted from the WAL was found to be gate tunable, ranging from ∼100 nm to ∼250 nm and reaching a stronger spin–obit coupling (SOC) than the two-dimensional counterpart (flakes). We attribute the strong SOC and the gate tunability to the presence of a surface accumulation layer, which induces a strong inversion asymmetry on the surface. Such scenario was supported by the observation of two Shubnikov–de Haas oscillation frequencies that correspond to two types of carriers, one on the surface and the other in the bulk. The high-quality Bi 2 O 2 Se nanowires with a high mobility and a strong SOC can act as a very prospective material in future spintronics.},

Here, we have systematically investigated the dielectric properties of amorphous (a-) Ge 8 Sb 2 Te 11 thin films with temperature by two complementary methods, i.e., the AC electrical measurement (0.5–186 Hz) and the impedance spectroscopy (9 kHz–3 GHz). The characterization of dielectric behavior of a-Ge 8 Sb 2 Te 11 at low frequencies approaching DC, as defined by the static dielectric constants ( ⁠ ε st ⁠ ), is achieved by the measurement at very low temperature. The resulting ε st of a-Ge 8 Sb 2 Te 11 is much larger than its optical dielectric constant ε ∞ at room temperature, which is mainly ascribed to the contribution of infrared active phonons at around tens of meV. The ε st increases linearly by 16.5\% from 5 to 300 K, due to more optical phonons activated at elevated temperatures. We also notice that ε st shows little dependence on the frequency, and the total conductivity of a-Ge 8 Sb 2 Te 11 extracted from impedance spectroscopies is frequency independent up to 10 MHz. Hence, no obvious dielectric relaxations are observed in a-Ge 8 Sb 2 Te 11 below 10 MHz close to room temperature. In addition, the bandgap calculated from temperature dependence of the electrical conductivity is larger than that measured from the optical absorption edge by 11.5\%.},

The functional mechanisms of NiO x as edge termination on leakage reduction were studied. NiO x can increase the barrier height and passivate the defects at the interface, resulting in the suppression of subthreshold leakage and elimination of current crowding effect confirmed by a thermal emission microscope. From the temperature-dependent x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy characteristics, more holes generated to deplete Ga 2 O 3 at higher temperatures were found. It leads to reduce the reverse leakage current. The small-polaron transportation in NiO x is proposed to argue the implausibility of the leakage conduction in NiO x .

The passivation of the channel layer is crucial for improving device stability. We show that amorphous gallium oxide, which possesses appropriate energy levels (lower electron affinity and higher ionization potential) for indium–tin–zinc oxide (ITZO) TFTs, can be etched selectively by tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide-containing developers that enable self-alignment passivation, such as easy contact hole formation during the drain and source lithography processes. The self-aligned passivation process led to a-ITZO TFTs with high mobility (&gt;50 cm 2 V −1 s −1 ) and low subthreshold swing (&lt;90 mV/dec). The threshold voltage shifts under NBS and PBS using a bias gate voltage of ±20 V for 1 h were −0.09 and 0.15 V, respectively. This passivation can obviate the need for the conventional CVD-derived passivation process by utilizing the DC sputtering of gallium oxide, which may reduce hydrogen issues.},

Using first-principles calculations, we systematically investigate the structural and electronic properties of hydrogen-terminated diamond (H-diamond) (111) van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures with graphite and hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) layers. The graphite/H-diamond heterostructure forms a p-type ohmic contact and the p-type Schottky barrier decreases as the number of graphite layers increases. In contrast, the h-BN/H-diamond heterostructure exhibits semiconducting properties and a tunable type-II band alignment. Moreover, the charge transfer is concentrated at the interface with a large amount of charge accumulating on the C–H bonds on the H-diamond (111) surface, indicating the formation of a highly conductive two-dimensional hole gas (2DHG) layer. In a similar vein, the promising structural and electronic properties of graphite, h-BN, and H-diamond (111) in the graphite/h-BN/H-diamond (111) vdW heterostructure are well preserved upon their contact, while such heterostructure exhibits flexible band offset and Schottky contacts.

  abstract     = {Recently, a two-dimensional (2D) Ruddlesden–Popper (RP) organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite material (MTEA) 2 MA n−1 Pb n I 3n+1 (n = 1–6) has attracted great attention, and experiments have reported that the thicker material (MTEA) 2 (MA) 4 Pb 5 I 16 (n = 5) perovskite material has excellent environmental stability and improved photovoltaic stability. However, considering that the thickness of the material and the substitution of halogen anions have influence on photoelectric properties of materials. In this paper, we study the photoelectric properties of 2D RP organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite (MTEA) 2 MAPb 2 X 7 (X = Cl, Br, I) (n = 2) based on the density functional theory. The calculated results show that as the halogen in (MTEA) 2 MAPb 2 Cl 7 varies from Cl to I, the bandgap decreases, the absorption intensity increases, and the exciton binding energies decrease, which is significantly higher than that of MAPbI 3 crystal photovoltaic materials, indicating that the material (MTEA) 2 MAPb 2 X 7 (X = Cl, Br, and I) (n = 2) is more suitable as candidates for luminescent devices. Our work provides opportunities and challenges for the application of 2D RP organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites in luminescent devices.},

  abstract     = {The design of a single-mode interband cascade laser (ICL) using a slotted waveguide is presented. This technique was explored as an inexpensive alternative to distributed feedback lasers since standard photolithography can be used in fabrication and complex techniques, such as e-beam lithography, re-growth steps, and/or metal gratings, can be avoided. The design of slotted waveguides must be carefully simulated before fabrication to ensure the efficacy of the photolithography masks with each ICL growth. Limitations and the behavior of key design parameters are discussed. Single-mode emission was achieved for certain temperature and injected current conditions, validating the operation of an Sb based slotted laser. The slotted ICLs were emitting from a single longitudinal mode at 3.5 μ m and 2 mW of power per facet output at 20 °C with threshold currents around 80 mA.},

  abstract     = {GaN-based single-photon sources have received immense attention for applications in quantum technologies. An isolated semiconductor quantum dot (QD) is an attractive and proven choice. Most experimental demonstrations involve epitaxial growth or etching of the QD embedded in a vertical nanopillar/nanowire structure. Here, we demonstrate room-temperature single-photon emission from an InGaN QD embedded in a GaN nanoneedle. The nanoneedle is tapered at the bottom and is formed by a succession of inductively coupled plasma reactive ion etching and crystallographic direction-dependent wet etching techniques. The nanofabrication process steps yield reproducible and uniform-sized QDs in the needle structures. Cross-sectional SEM images show needles are centered at the center of a hexagonal base, which confirms a good crystalline property of the QD. Micro-photoluminescence measurements on a single QD manifest a short time constant for radiative decay channels without any prominent non-radiative decay path. Second-order correlation measurements confirm the antibunching of the emitted photons. Higher spectral purity and smaller value of the second-order correlation are maintained up to a good excitation power, indicating the usefulness of the methodology for quantum technologies.},

  abstract     = {Miniaturized atomic sensors of magnetic field and inertia have great potential to be applied as geophysical instruments and in the detection of biomolecules. The distribution of the electronic spin polarization plays a key role as it defines the amount of noble gas that can achieve a state of hyperpolarization, which in turn determines the technique&#39;s accuracy and, consequently, its resolution. However, the current techniques for electronic spin polarization imaging are unsuited for the operating conditions of miniaturized atomic sensors besides only accomplishing submillimeter spatial resolution. In this study, optical magnetic resonance is applied to obtain electronic spin polarization images with a spatial resolution of 60 μ m experimentally and 10 μ m theoretically. This corresponds to an increase by one order of magnitude in resolution when compared to previous reports of electronic spin polarization imaging. By sweeping the RF frequency of the magnetic field while applying a magnetic field gradient of 0.22 μ T / mm ⁠ , it is possible to measure electronic spin polarization images for different average photon spins and pump beam positions. Spin polarization images present a high degree of correlation with pump beam images. Furthermore, this image method can be applied to suppressing the inhomogeneities in miniaturized cells, leading to a gain in signal-to-noise ratio. It also offers an opportunity to experimentally perform two-dimensional atomic polarization manipulation in the gas phase, optically transparent solids, and liquids.},

  abstract     = {Holographic acoustic lenses (HALs), also known as acoustic holograms, are used for generating unprecedented complex focused ultrasound (FU) fields. HALs store the phase profile of the desired wavefront, which is used to reconstruct the acoustic pressure field when illuminated by a single acoustic source. Nonlinear effects occur as the sound intensity increases, leading to distorted and asymmetric waveforms. Here, the k-space pseudospectral method is used to perform homogeneous three-dimensional nonlinear acoustic simulations with power law absorption. An in-depth analysis is performed to study the evolution of holographic-modulated FU fields produced by HALs as the excitation amplitude increases. It is shown that nonlinear waveform distortion significantly affects the reconstruction of the pressure pattern when compared to the linear condition. Diffraction and nonlinear effects result in an asymmetric waveform with distinct positive and negative pressure patterns at the target plane. Peak positive pressure distribution becomes more localized around the areas with the highest nonlinear distortion. The peak signal-to-distortion ratio (PSDR) at the target plane falls while the nonuniformity index (NUI) rises. As a result of harmonic generation, the heat deposition distribution becomes highly localized with a significant increase in the NUI. Nonlinear effects have also been shown to flatten the peak negative pressure distribution while having minimal effect on the PSDR or NUI. However, nonlinear effects are shown to be critical for accurately predicting cavitation zones. Findings will pave the way for HALs implementation in high-intensity applications and prompt the incorporation of nonlinear acoustics into the notion of computer-generated holography.},

Here, we demonstrate slowing down electromagnetic waves in a superconducting metamaterial composed of eight qubits coupled to a common waveguide, forming a waveguide quantum electrodynamics system. We analyze two complementary approaches, one relying on dressed states of the Autler–Townes splitting and the other based on a tailored dispersion profile using the qubits tunability. Our time-resolved experiments show reduced group velocities of down to a factor of about 1500 smaller than in vacuum. Depending on the method used, the speed of light can be controlled with an additional microwave tone or an effective qubit detuning. Our findings demonstrate high flexibility of superconducting circuits to realize custom band structures and open the door to microwave dispersion engineering in the quantum regime.},

In this paper, a thermoacoustic cooler with a bypass expansion cooling for distributed-temperature heat loads is proposed. The bypass expansion configuration is used to carry out multiple refrigeration processes to achieve distributed cooling temperatures, thus realizing the cascade processes of natural gas liquefaction and improving the liquefaction efficiency. Simulations were carried out to investigate the effect of cooling-stage numbers on relative power consumption efficiency, exergy losses of components as well as axial distributions of key parameters. A proof-of-concept porotype of a two-stage thermoacoustic cooler was built, and the feasibility of the distributed heat loads was experimentally tested. Comparisons with a conventional single-stage thermoacoustic cooler without bypass expansion indicate that the proposed bypass expansion system improves the liquefaction cooling efficiency by a factor of 3.28 at 120 K. Experiments were also carried out to investigate the effect of the bypass expansion, an important factor, by verifying the total number of bypass orifices. Results show that increasing the number of bypass orifices with a more uniform gas distribution can improve the cooling performance of the system. The findings demonstrate the promising prospects of the proposed thermoacoustic cooler in the field of natural gas liquefaction.},

However, poor electrochemical compatibility with a Li anode restrains their application.

Meanwhile, the Cl − /S 2− ratio is increased to enhance the lithium ionic conductivity. The resultant Li 6.05 PS 4.9 O 0.1 Cl 1.05 electrolyte exhibits a high conductivity of 7.49 mS cm −1 . Benefitting from the stable Li 3 OCl formed at the electrolyte/Li interface and the low electronic conductivity arising from the oxygen doping, a Li 6.05 PS 4.9 O 0.1 Cl 1.05 electrolyte shows excellent interfacial stability and lithium dendrites suppression capability.

  abstract     = {Transition-metal layered oxides (such as P2-Na 2/3 Ni 1/3 Mn 2/3 O 2 ) are suggested as one type of the most potential cathode candidates for sodium ion batteries (SIBs) owing to their high capacity and low cost; however, they suffer from the structural damage and sluggish Na + kinetics resulting from the undesirable phase transformation of P2−O2 and the Na + /vacancy ordering, respectively. Herein, a Mg/Ti co-doped P2-Na 0.67 Ni 0.28 Mg 0.05 Mn 0.62 Ti 0.05 O 2 layered oxide is demonstrated as a high-efficiency cathode material for SIBs. The cathode delivers a high reversible capacity of 135.5 mAh g −1 , good cycling stability (82.7 mAh g −1 upon 100 cycles at 0.1C), and an attractive energy density of 479.4 Wh Kg −1 . Furthermore, the phase transition from the undesirable P2−O2 to the reversible P2−OP4 demonstrated by in situ XRD and the partially suppressed Na + /vacancy ordering as well as the improved electronic and ionic conductivities all give rise to the enhancement. These results show the important role of cationic co-doping in designing and preparing high-efficiency layered oxide cathode materials for SIBs.},

  abstract     = {Quasi-solid thermocells show great potential to save power terminals from periodic charging but still face the grand challenge of low thermoelectric efficiency. Despite many efforts devoted to improve thermopower, few studies have been reported to address the trade-off between thermopower and ionic conductivity encountered by n-type quasi-solid thermocells. Herein, a directional freeze-thawing method is developed to fabricate high-performance n-type quasi-solid thermocells with hierarchically anisotropic networks, enabling the decoupling of thermopower and ionic conductivity. The n-type thermopower is up to 0.74 mV/K, and the ionic conductivity is independently improved to be about 9.3 S/m. Thus, the output power density reaches ∼200 mW/m 2 , which is the same level among the quasi-solid n-type thermocells. Meanwhile, benefiting from the crystalline domains and alignment structures of the solid network, the thermocells achieve the strength of ∼380 kPa and an elongation at break of ∼320\%. Moreover, the thermocells work stably when being pressed, bent, and stretched in practical uses. We believe this work not only demonstrates a particularly important example for fabricating high-performance n-type quasi-solid thermocells but also inspires the development of thermocell devices to achieve large-scale low-grade heat harvesting in wearable systems.},

Three kinds of LiNi x Mn y Co z O 2 cathodes with different nickel contents are charged to different cut-off voltages from 4.2 to 4.6 V (vs Li + /Li) to obtain different energy densities, and their safety is evaluated through differential scanning calorimetry. Different characteristic temperatures are proposed to describe the cathode safety comprehensively and a relationship between energy density and thermal stability is established. It is found that cathode with lower nickel content (LiNi 0.5 Mn 0.3 Co 0.2 O 2 and LiNi 0.6 Mn 0.2 Co 0.2 O 2 ) charging to high voltage exhibits better thermal stability compared to high nickel cathode (LiNi 0.8 Mn 0.1 Co 0.1 O 2 ) at a conventional voltage. Numerical simulation based on a lumped thermal model is also performed to predict the real thermal behaviors of batteries using different cathodes. The discussion of the impact of the cut-off voltage for NMC cathodes provides a new dimension to further improve the comprehensiveness of battery material safety database and a new viewpoint on the trade-off between cathode energy density and safety.},

We generated three kinds of ultraweak lasers, called as simulated biophotons, with different spectra and intensities to implement intracellular stimulation in a single nerve cell of the hippocampal areas in mouse brain slices combined with intracellular membrane potential recording and biophoton imaging techniques. We found that the simulated biophoton stimulation can lead to transsynaptic biophotonic activities and transmission in the ipsilateral and contralateral projection circuits in the hippocampus. The activity and transmission characteristics were related to the spectra and intensities of the simulated biophotons but not to the levels of membrane potentials before stimulation. These findings present specific characteristics of neural biophoton signal transmission, which may be involved in the mechanisms of processing, encoding, and storage of neural signals.},

Conventional detection methods are found to be very complex, cumbersome, and non-portable. This paper presents curcumin functionalized zinc oxide field effect transistor for selective detection of arsenic ions in water, with high sensitivity and stability. The operating voltage of the device is optimized to 2.9 V through output characteristics, which ensures low power consumption. The presence of curcumin on ZnO surface imparts high degree of selectivity toward arsenic ions, and ZnO nanorods ensures high surface to volume ratio for adsorption. The device is tested against eight metal ions commonly found in water and is found to be highly selective toward arsenic. The device exhibits a sensitivity of 102 nA/ppb at zero gate voltage, which is further amplified to 366 nA/ppb by applying 2.4 V gate bias. The application of gate bias plays a pivotal role for enhancing the device sensitivity by 266\% for 5 ppb arsenic concentration. The sensor shows a response time of 67 s and is found to be highly stable against adverse conditions. The sensor shows high resilience in the degradation of sensing performance for a duration of 40 days. Therefore, curcumin functionalized zinc oxide field effect transistor with proper gate bias shows promising results to be used as a portable, low-cost, and user-friendly arsenic ion detector system in future.},

  abstract     = {Phase change memory (PCM) is considered as a leading candidate for next generation data storage as well as emerging computing device, but the advancement has been hampered by high switching energy due to the melting process and amorphous relaxation induced large resistance drift. Polymorphic crystal-crystal transition without amorphization in metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) could be employed to solve these issues. Yet, the mechanism is still controversy. A melting-free PCM made of two dimensional (2D) MoTe 2 , which exhibits unipolar resistive switching (RS) and multi-level states with substantially reduced resistance drift via joule heating, is reported in this work. The device is first prepared based on the temperature dependence of Raman spectrum and electrical transport investigations on MoTe 2 films. Significantly improved device performances on energy efficiency, switching speed, and memory window are further achieved by electrode size scaling down, indicating the key role of localized heating. Then, device scale transmission electron microscopy images reveal that the resistive switching stems from the transition between semiconducting 2H phase and metallic 1T′ phase. An entropy induced Te vacancies model is proposed to explain the reversible phase change mechanism in the MoTe 2 based device. This study paves the way for further development of PCM based on atomically thin 2D TMDs, aiming for high density storage-class memory and high-precision neuromorphic computing.},

  abstract     = {Vertical GaN junction barrier Schottky (JBS) diodes with superior electrical characteristics and nondestructive breakdown were realized using selective-area p-type doping via Mg ion implantation and subsequent ultra-high-pressure annealing. Mg-ion implantation was performed into a 10 μ m thick Si-doped GaN drift layer grown on a free-standing n-type GaN substrate. We fabricated the JBS diodes with different n-type GaN channel widths L n = 1 and 1.5 μ m. The JBS diodes, depending on L n , exhibited on-resistance ( R ON ) between 0.57 and 0.67 mΩ cm 2 , which is a record low value for vertical GaN Schottky barrier diodes (SBDs) and high breakdown (BV) between 660 and 675 V (84.4\% of the ideal parallel plane BV). The obtained low R ON of JBS diodes can be well explained in terms of the R ON model, which includes n-type GaN channel resistance, spreading current effect, and substrate resistance. The reverse leakage current in JBS diodes was relatively low 10 3 –10 4 times lower than in GaN SBDs. In addition, the JBS diode with lower L n exhibited the leakage current significantly smaller (up to reverse bias 300 V) than in the JBS diode with large L n , which was explained in terms of the reduced electric field near the Schottky interface. Furthermore, the JBS diodes showed a very high current density of 5.5 kA/cm 2 , a low turn-on voltage of 0.74 V, and no destruction against the rapid increase in the reverse current approximately by two orders of magnitude. This work demonstrated that GaN JBS diodes can be strong candidates for low loss power switching applications.},

Aggregation-caused quenching broadly exists in amorphous solid films and single crystals, which result in high threshold. Here, we studied amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) and lasing properties of an aggregation-enhanced emission (AEE) molecule, namely, 2PB-AC, who owns high photoluminescence quantum efficiency in a solid film and a single crystal. The grown long rod-like single crystals exhibited very good ASE characteristics with a threshold of 48 μ J cm −2 and a full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of 8.4 nm. Furthermore, when forming polymer microspheres by a surface tension-induced self-assembly method, a low lasing threshold of 0.32 mJ cm −2 and a FWHM of 0.41 nm were also obtained well, and their lasing modes could be modulated by changing the diameter of the microspheres. The investigations on transient photoluminescence dynamics and femtosecond transient absorption analysis demonstrated that the high radiative decay rate and the well separation between a stimulated emission band and an excited state absorption band are the main reasons of good lasing performance, indicating that AEE molecules are promising lasing materials.},

Meanwhile, the time domain amplitude sweep demonstrates the high-power tolerance (&gt;23.2 dBm) of the HBAR ME antenna. Two-dimensional finite element method analysis reveals that the FPA-induced electric field excites additional longitudinal-wave resonance, resulting in the coupling of dual longitudinal and shear waves, which is the intrinsic mechanism of its radiation enhancement from the perspective of acoustic excitation.

  abstract     = {Recently, flexoelectric effect has attracted considerable attention owing to ubiquitous existence in all dielectrics, regardless of the symmetry. It promises intriguingly physical phenomena, such as strain gradient-induced electric polarizations, photocurrents, and interfacial transports, as well as their electromechanical coupling with external force loading, in diverse materials for multifunctional applications in electronics. In this work, we report the flexoelectric-modulation on surface potential of LaFeO 3 (LFO) thin-film heterostructures. The LFO thin film with or without the flexoelectric effect has been achieved by controlling epitaxial misfit against a substrate. Lattice structures and strain behaviors are observed by atomic-resolution high-angle annular dark-field imaging. Grown on a LaAlO 3 substrate, a giant strain gradient of ∼3 × 10 6 m −1 is generated in the LFO thin film due to the gradual relaxation of large misfit strain with increasing thickness, yielding a robust flexoelectric polarization pointing to the heterostructure surface. In contrast, the LFO is almost fully strained on a SrTiO 3 substrate due to the small lattice mismatch. The flexoelectric polarization results in an increase in surface potential in the LFO heterostructure due to the incomplete screening of positive polarization bound charges, as observed by scanning kelvin probe microscopy. Furthermore, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveals that the flexoelectric polarization can downward bend the band alignment of the LFO layer and modulate the interfacial potential barriers. These results provide the way for experimental observations of the flexoelectric effect and deliver physical insight into deep understanding of interfacial electronic structures of flexoelectric-based devices.},

The proposed design enabled parallel plate fields higher than 4.1 MV/cm with negligible change to the device ON characteristics. The effect of BCl 3 /Cl 2 -based dry etch on (100) and (010) etched vertical sidewalls is also analyzed. A remarkable anisotropy in depletion was observed for etch along (100) and (010) sidewalls. This work provides insight into the impact of etching on n-type Ga 2 O 3 and shows a promising method to realize efficient field termination for high breakdown field strength SBDs.},

Compared to bulk ceramics and crystals, ferroelectric thin films can enable advanced control of the conductivity. Here, small-polaron hopping conductivity was evidenced and examined in various pulsed-laser-deposited films of ferroelectric BaTiO 3 and reference films of SrTiO 3 . For this, AC conductivity was studied in a broad range of temperatures and frequencies for films sandwiched between the bottom and top electrodes. In the BaTiO 3 films, with increasing temperature, a significant increase in activation energy for small-polaron hopping was found and ascribed to strong electron–phonon coupling and complex lattice oscillations therein. Plain relations of the activation energy to microstructure, composition, or phase transitions were lacking, which corroborated the critical role of phonons. Additionally, a phonon-less transport was detected. It was anticipated that owing to strong electron–phonon coupling, rich phonon ensembles, and coexistence of phonon-stimulated and phonon-less processes, the small-polaron conductivity can heavily vary in ferroelectric films that necessitates further studies.},

  abstract     = {Continued advances in superconducting qubit performance require more detailed understandings of the many sources of decoherence. Within these devices, two-level systems arise due to defects, interfaces, and grain boundaries and are thought to be a major source of qubit decoherence at millikelvin temperatures. In addition to Al, Nb is a commonly used metallization layer in superconducting qubits. Consequently, a significant effort is required to develop and qualify processes that mitigate defects in Nb films. As the fabrication of complete superconducting qubits and their characterization at millikelvin temperatures is a time and resource intensive process, it is desirable to have measurement tools that can rapidly characterize the properties of films and evaluate different treatments. Here, we show that measurements of the variation of the superconducting critical temperature T c with an applied external magnetic field H (of the phase boundary T c − H ⁠ ) performed with very high-resolution show features that are directly correlated with the structure of the Nb films. In combination with x-ray diffraction measurements, we show that one can even distinguish variations in the size and crystal orientation of the grains in a Nb film by small but reproducible changes in the measured superconducting phase boundary.},

These hollow magnetic cylinders exhibit unusual dynamic magnetic properties, which were measured with a broad-band ferromagnetic resonance system (FMR). We observe three families of FMR modes, which are connected to different physical locations within the cylinder. We develop a simple analytic model to explain these results and corroborate resonant mode profiles with micromagnetic simulations. We find excellent agreement between experimental results and theoretical models. Our work indicates that global demagnetizing factors are not appropriate for understanding the spin motions in these hollow cylinders. The FMR absorption observed in these hallow cylinders is very different from those observed in nanowires or solid cylinders. The field-swept envelope of all the observed FMR resonances is very broad, approximately μ 0 H = 1 T, with a linewidth of individual modes around μ 0 Δ H = 250 mT. This can be important for electromagnetic shielding applications.},

The T C and MAE can be further enhanced up to 385 K and 313 μ eV by a tensile strain. Interestingly, the magnetic easy axis can be switched between off-plane and in-plane by compressive strain. Particularly, due to the broken inversion symmetry and strong spin–orbital coupling of Se atoms, a large Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction (DMI) of 2.40 meV is obtained. More importantly, by micromagnetic simulations, stable skyrmions with sub-10 nm radius are stabilized by the large DMI above room temperature in a wide range of strain from −2\% to 6\%. Our work demonstrates CrISe as a promising candidate for next-generation skyrmion-based information storage devices and provides guidance for the research of DMI and skyrmions in room temperature FM semiconductors.},

In this work, we fabricate high-quality ScMn 6 Sn 6 single crystals and systematically study their magnetoelectric transport properties. A large topological Hall effect is observed within the temperature range from 100 to 320 K with the magnetic field applied along the parallel direction of the kagome plane. This observation suggests that the spin textures in ScMn 6 Sn 6 have a nonzero scalar spin chirality over a wide temperature range.

However, current investigations on evaluating the performance of such films assume that the embedded particles are perfectly separated from each other. The particle agglomeration effects on the spectral characteristics of the film are dismissed. In this work, by comparing the spectral reflectivity and emissivity of a film composed of perfectly separated TiO 2 particles, three-particle aggregations, five-particle aggregations, and ten-particle aggregations, we studied the particle agglomeration impacts on the performance of a disordered radiative cooling film with a thickness of 50 μ m. The results show that the agglomeration suppresses the solar reflectivity of the particle-embedded film and harms the temperature drop and cooling power in RC applications. Therefore, particle agglomeration is intended to be industriously eliminated in the preparation of a random particle-embedded thin film for radiative cooling. The results in this paper provide a further explanation of the difference between the theoretical calculations and experimental measurements of the cooling performance of a particle-embedded RC film.},

Here, we analyze the dispersion of SPhPs in a multilayer system consisting of a silicon (Si) layer sandwiched between two silicon dioxide (SiO 2 ) nanolayers. We find that SPhPs generated in SiO 2 nanolayers couple with guided resonant modes and propagate mainly in the nonabsorbent Si layer for microscale Si thicknesses. This coupling yields an enhancement in thermal conductivity with Si thickness. In contrast, for nanoscale Si thicknesses, evanescent components of SPhPs couple inside the Si layer, resulting in a higher thermal conductivity for thinner Si layers. The transition between these two different coupling phenomena provides the minimum of the in-plane SPhP thermal conductivity at a Si thickness of approximately 1 μ m. Our finding brings deeper insight into thermal management in electronics and semiconductors.},

  abstract     = {Non-degenerate pump–probe transmission spectroscopy is used to examine the ultrafast dynamics of photo-excited carriers in hematite nanoforms at various pump fluences. Using coupled rate equations, the kinetics of self-trapped exciton (STE) formation and its interaction with free excitons resulting in exciton annihilation were studied. It is shown from this model that the majority of the excitons were trapped by polaronic trap states to form self-trapped excitons within ∼3.5 ps. The findings indicate that free excitons and STEs interact non-linearly, similar to trap-assisted bi-molecular Auger recombination to annihilate one another. It is observed that there is substantial dependence of kinetics of STE formation and exciton decay on photo-excited exciton density, and the nature of this dependence indicates the reduced screening of electron–phonon interaction. Using the screening model applied to the rate constants of STE formation and decay, we estimate the saturation exciton density to be ∼3.3 × 10 17 cm −3 and the average STE density to be ∼3.8 × 10 18 cm −3 in the hematite nanoforms. We also noticed that doping K and Ni to hematite nanoforms up to 5\% did not remarkably change the nature of the exciton dynamics.},

  abstract     = {In this Letter, lateral slanted-fin-channel β-Ga 2 O 3 metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs) are demonstrated. A 600-nm thick n-type doped channel layer is adopted to improve output characteristics. The tri-gate structure enhances gate control in the proposed β-Ga 2 O 3 MOSFETs, showing an on/off ratio as high as 10 9 . In particular, the slanted-fin-channel structure, mainly located in the gate region, reduces the peak electric field in the Ga 2 O 3 channel due to the gradual regulation of a threshold voltage. The slanted-fin-channel β-Ga 2 O 3 MOSFETs show a breakdown voltage ( V br ) of 2400 V and a power figure-of-merit of 193 MW/cm 2 , which are almost 2 and 5.5 times larger, respectively, than those of conventional straight-fin-channel devices. These results imply that the slanted-fin channel structure provides a viable way of fabricating high-performance β-Ga 2 O 3 MOSFET power devices.},

Sputtered VO 2 films used in this device exhibit 10 4 times change in resistivity between the dielectric and conductive states. The VO 2 microbolometer is coupled to a wideband dipole antenna operating at 31–55 GHz and a coplanar waveguide for probed measurement. To enhance the sensitivity, the sensor is suspended in air by micro-electro-mechanical systems process. The large thermal coefficient of resistance of VO 2 is utilized by DC biasing the device in the MIT region. Measurements for the fabricated sensor were performed, and a high responsivity was demonstrated, owing to non-linear conductivity change in the transition region. The measured sensitivity is &gt;10 2 times higher than the state-of-the-art sensors. In addition, the concept of utilizing the proposed VO 2 sensor in a mmWave imager was demonstrated by the radiation pattern measurement of a 4 × 4 (16 elements) antenna-coupled VO 2 sensor array. The results presented in this work reveal the initial step to employ VO 2 &#39;s MIT for a hyper-sensitive sensor in future mmWave sensing and imaging applications.},

Our system is modeled by using an effective medium approximation allowing the homogenization of individual metasurfaces and replacing them with anisotropic layers. Excitation or suppression of surface and hyperbolic modes can be controlled by means of different degrees of freedom offered by the metasurfaces. By leveraging this flexibility, we theoretically show that the near-field radiative heat transfer between two such metasurfaces can be effectively geometrically tuned.},

Simultaneously achieving amplitude and phase control is an effective route as it allows rebuilding the full information of the field. However, related previous studies mostly rely on anisotropic meta-atoms, which restrict the available incident polarizations. Here, a polarization-insensitive amplitude and phase control method is proposed and experimentally demonstrated in the terahertz regime, which is actualized by introducing interference effect in reflective-type meta-molecules composed of isotropic meta-atoms. Two kinds of functional meta-mirror devices, i.e., multi-order meta-gratings and multi-focal meta-lenses, are designed and characterized, where the results verify this method very well. This proposed method further enriches the routes to control amplitude and phase and may also find broad applications in realizing flexible wavefront control devices with complex functionalities.},

Thus, these mechanisms have been a candidate for novel methods of shock mitigation without relying on material dissipation. Here, we suggest the mechanical system consisting of the unit cell&#39;s composite configuration as an approach for more efficient shock attenuation. To efficiently analyze the nonlinear wave dynamics of the proposed systems, we present an extended discrete element model (DEM) resulting from a combination of an analytic beam theory with the discretization model. We numerically and experimentally demonstrate extreme dispersive waves for shock mitigation by adjusting the weighted composition ratio of the hetero geneous cylinder. Using the verified DEM, we also investigate the strong attenuation performance of incident impulse in disorder-induced systems with different nonlinear strengths. We, thus, expect that these composite-based mechanical systems could be used to design tunable modulation energy transport and efficient impact protector devices.},

  abstract     = {High Q -factor resonance holds great promise for bio-chemical sensing and enhanced light–matter interaction. However, terahertz (THz) magnetic resonances usually demonstrate low Q -factors, resulting in huge energy radiation loss particularly in high frequency bands. Here, we show that high Q -factor magnetic dipole resonance at THz frequencies can be achieved by exploiting the coherent Fano interactions with strong field enhancements in an array composed of single metallic split-ring resonators, working at Wood–Rayleigh anomalies. It can give rise to ultrahigh Q -factor beyond 10 4 in the THz regime. Experimentally, the measured Q -factor of dominant magnetic dipole resonance can achieve no less than a level of ∼261 by Lorentzian fitting to the experimental data. In addition, a high Q -factor of the fundamental-order magnetic dipole resonance is demonstrated beyond 30. High- Q magnetic dipole resonance is closely associated with ultralow-damping and negative permeability in the THz band. The measurements of magnetic dipole resonances are in good agreement with the theoretical analyses. Our scheme suggests a feasible route to suppress radiative loss for enhanced THz field-matter interaction.},

By tailoring the phase gradient of the unit cells, nonlinear acoustic metasurfaces are developed to demultiplex different frequency components and achieve anomalous wavefront control of SHG in the transmitted region. To this end, we numerically demonstrate wave steering, wave focusing, and self-bending propagation. Our results show that the proposed nonlinear metasurface provides an effective and efficient platform to achieve significant SHG and separate different harmonic components for wavefront control of individual harmonics. Overall, this study offers an outlook to harness nonlinear effects for acoustic wavefront tailoring and develops potential toward advanced technologies to manipulate acoustic waves.},

By leveraging the octet topology as a unit cell to design the tested prototypes, a broad and easy-to-tune bandgap is experimentally generated. The experimental outcomes are supported by extensive numerical analyses based on 3D solid elements. Drawing from the underlying dynamic properties of the octet cell, we numerically propose a tailorable design with enhanced filtering capabilities. We transform the geometry of the original unit cell by applying a uniaxial scaling factor that, by breaking the in-plane symmetry of the structure, yields independently tuned struts and consequently multiple tunable bandgaps within the same cell. Our findings expand the spectrum of available numerical analyses on the octet lattice, taking it a significant step closer to its physical implementation. The ability of the octet lattice to control the propagation of flexural vibrations is significant within various applications in the mechanical and civil engineering domains, and we note such frame-like designs could lead to advancements in energy harvesting and vibration protection devices (e.g., lightweight and resonance-tunable absorbers).},

  abstract     = {Plasmons associated with zero-dimensional (0D) metal nanoparticles and their synergistic interactions with excitons in two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors offer opportunities for remarkable spectral tunability not otherwise evident in the pristine parent materials. As a result, an in-depth study elucidating the nature of the plasmonic and excitonic interactions, jointly referred to as plexcitons, is critical to understanding the foundational aspects of the light–matter interactions in hybrid 0D–2D systems. In this work, our focal point is to examine the plexcitonic interactions of van der Waals (vdWs) hybrid structures composed of 2D WSe 2 and 0D Au nanoparticles (Au-NPs) in their spherical (Au-Sp) and bi-pyramidical (Au-BP) architectures. The geometry-dependent surface plasmon resonance (SPR) peaks in Au-Sp and Au-BP nanoparticles were deciphered using ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) optical absorption spectroscopy, while photoluminescence spectroscopy revealed the excitonic behavior in the vapor synthesized monolayer (1L) WSe 2 as well as the Au-Sp/WSe 2 and Au-BP/WSe 2 hybrids. Furthermore, our temperature-dependent and wavelength-dependent optoelectronic transport measurements showed a shift in the spectral response of 1L WSe 2 toward the SPR peak locations of Au-Sp and Au-BP, mediated via the plexciton interactions. Models for the plexcitonic interactions are proposed, which provide a framework to explain the photoexcited hot charge carrier injection from AuNPs to WSe 2 and their influence on carrier dynamics. Our findings demonstrate that geometry-mediated response of the AuNPs provides another degree of freedom to modulate the carrier photodynamics in WSe 2 , which can also be useful for tailoring the optoelectronic performance of the broader class of semiconducting 2D materials.},

We employ polarization dependent ultrafast differential transmission spectroscopy (DTS) at room temperature to study the spin polarization dynamics in this system. In the case of pure CsPbI 3 NCs, it is not possible to measure separately electron and hole spin relaxation rates from the polarization dependent DTS. Here, we introduce the soluble fullerene derivative PC 60 BM as an electron acceptor along with CsPbI 3 to create an imbalance between the photoexcited electrons and holes in the NCs and, thus, affecting their spin-dependent carrier distribution. CsPbI 3 :PC 60 BM blend sample shows a distinct difference in the spin dependent kinetics of the DTS spectra as compared to the NCs-only sample. With the help of a kinetic model for the spin-dependent charge carrier distributions, we separately determine the electron and hole spin relaxation times in CsPbI 3 NCs. We find that the room temperature hole spin lifetime ( τ h ∼ 5 ps) is ∼13 times longer than the electron spin lifetime ( τ e ∼ 0.4 ps). We ascribe the fast electron spin relaxation to the presence of strong spin–orbit coupling in the conduction band, which is ineffective for holes in the s -type valence band.},

  abstract     = {Anapole states—characterized by a strong suppression of far-field scattering—naturally arise in high-index nanoparticles as a result of the interference between certain multipolar moments. Recently, the first-order electric anapole, resulting from the interference between the electric and toroidal dipoles, was characterized under in-plane illumination as required in on-chip photonics. Here, we go a step further and report on the observation of higher-order (magnetic and second-order electric) anapole states in individual silicon disks under in-plane illumination. To do so, we increase the disk dimensions (radius and thickness) so that such anapoles occur at telecom wavelengths. Experiments show dips in the far-field scattering perpendicular to the disk plane at the expected wavelengths and the selected polarizations, which we interpret as a signature of high-order anapoles. Some differences between normal and in-plane excitation are discussed, in particular, the non-cancelation of the sum of the Cartesian electric and toroidal moments for in-plane incidence. Our results pave the way toward the use of different anapole states in photonic integrated circuits either on silicon or other high-index dielectric materials.},

Although micro-LED is regarded as the most promising light engine candidate for AR, its inherent Lambertian radiation characteristics and relatively broader emission spectrum result in low optical coupling efficiency and diffraction dispersion-related “rainbow” phenomenon when combined with a waveguide combiner. Here, we numerically and experimentally demonstrate resonant cavity (RC) micro-LEDs by incorporating SiO 2 /TiO 2 distributed Bragg reflectors with chip sizes of 60, 100, and 150 μ m. The device has a divergence angle of 78.7° and a narrow spectrum width of 6.8 nm, which is significantly lower than that of the controlled micro-LEDs. The reported GaN-based RC micro-LEDs have the potential to be used in the display panel for AR applications in a variety of scenarios, including AR glasses, and head up display for cars and airplanes.},

In this work, we show that the anticrossing between a cavity mode and a Bragg mode can also be realized within an empty microcavity without any birefringent materials in the cavity layer. Nondispersive bands are observed within the energy gap due to the particular refractive index distribution of the sample. The intrinsic TE-TM splitting and XY splitting of DBR mirrors induce the squeezing of the cavity modes in momentum space, so that the nondispersive bands are tilted and spin-dependent. Our results pave the way to investigate interesting physical phenomena of photonic modes close to or in the nondispersive bands without anisotropic cavity layers.},

The switch shows a low and high transmittance during phase transition from insulating VO 2 to metallic VO 2 , respectively. The multi-mode coupled circuit model is employed to calculate and tailor the operating frequency of the switch in xz sections for TM waves and yz sections for TE waves. The switch exhibits a transmittance difference of more than one order of magnitude between “on” and “off” modes when the structure is same in the x and y directions under circularly polarized light incidence. For the condition that the structure is not same in the x and y directions, thermochromic transmittance becomes polarization-dependent. By superimposing two polarization states, a dual-band as well as broadband thermochromic transmission property is obtained. The mechanisms of suppressed and enhanced transmission lie in the excitation of MPC and MP V 2, respectively. This study may have theoretical guiding significance for design and tailoring of metamaterials with wavelength-selective broadband thermochromic transmission property and potentially apply in active filters and architectural energy-efficient glass.},

In these structures, one can take advantage of the independent combs of resonances of two linearly uncoupled ring resonators for field enhancement, with the phase-matching condition being significantly relaxed compared to a single resonator. However, previous implementations of this approach have shown a limited operational bandwidth along with a significant reduction of the generation efficiency. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that a Mach–Zehnder interferometer can be used to effectively linearly uncouple two resonators and, at the same time, allows for their efficient nonlinear coupling. We demonstrate that this structure can lead to an unprecedented control over the rings&#39; interaction and can operate over more than 160 nm, covering the S-, C-, and L-telecom bands. In addition, we show that the photon pair generation efficiency is increased by a factor of four with respect to previous implementations.},

When irradiated with ultrafast pulsed lasers, the lattice temperature of gold NCs can rapidly increase, even above the melting and evaporation thresholds, which results in strong morphological, structural, and aggregation state modifications. Thereby, ultrafast pulsed laser irradiation can lead to the formation of metastable gold nanostructures with distinctive physicochemical features. In this Perspective, we discuss the implementation of femtosecond and nanosecond pulsed lasers to engineer gold NCs. We underline the importance of controlling the heating and cooling dynamics to achieve desired reshaping and restructuring of gold NCs at temperatures below and above its melting point. In addition, we demonstrate the need for advanced electron microscopy characterization techniques and single-particle studies to understand the detailed atomistic mechanisms behind the modifications following pulsed laser irradiation. Finally, we provide our views of the evolving opportunities of ultrafast laser irradiation as a unique tool for the fabrication of unprecedented nanomaterials and catalysts from metal and multimetal NCs to semiconductors.},

As an HBAR, we have used the “Al/Al 0.72 Sc 0.28 N/Mo/(100) diamond” structure utilizing a piezoelectric aluminum–scandium nitride film. We have observed that under pressure, the Q -factor of the HBAR decreases but remains at the value of 2500–3000, which is suitable for our experiments. It is demonstrated that the above system can be used for studying the behavior of various solids under high pressure, the pressure-induced phase transition in Zr, the registration of plastic deformations, and their relaxation in metals. Here, we discussed the phenomenon of an acoustic wave passing through a tungsten layer under a pressure of ∼5.5 GPa. The integrated DAC&amp;HBAR measuring system has demonstrated some practical advantages over known ultrasonic systems combined with the DAC as the possibility of applying a microwave operational frequency, the measurement of a Q -factor change under pressure, and the miniature size of a sensitive HBAR element. The application of the built-in DAC&amp;HBAR system will hopefully allow more accurate studies on materials in the GPa pressure range of a DAC.},

It is generally agreed that the NI magnets, at least those of laboratory scale, are self-protected from overheating and, therefore, from quenching, chiefly because of turn-to-turn current bypassing unique to NI. However, these NI magnets do experience unexpected quenches, e.g., when the current through the magnet suddenly drops due to the aforementioned fault-mode phenomenon. Here, we report this phenomenon of a sudden-discharging-triggered quench of an NI REBCO coil, conduction-cooled, and operated at 4.2 K. We also present our preventive approach for this phenomenon that relies on an appropriately designed resistor shunted across the coil terminals. With this shunt resistor, a quench was prevented by suppressing the quench initiating turn-to-turn heat and induced overcurrent within the NI winding, and the coil current decayed safely.},

  abstract     = {As the Abrikosov vortex lattice has recently been found in van der Waals heterostructures constructed by a two-dimensional (2D) ferromagnet and a superconductor, we propose the realization of cavity-photon–vortex coupling in a superconductive cavity to construct a new hybrid quantum system in this paper. We study the corresponding hybrid states therein, including the exceptional lines (ELs) in the parameter space. Considering that the parameters of our system are adjustable by external magnetic field and temperature, our system and the ELs are much easier to be realized in experiments. Furthermore, the numerical results show that the corresponding hybrid states can be switched by tuning the source of AC, which makes this hybrid system more advantageous to realize hybrid quantum computing in the future. Moreover, for practical use in detecting hybrid states and the vortex dynamics, the transmission amplitude of an external transverse electric wave through the cavity is also studied.},

  abstract     = {Second-order correlation [ g 2 ( τ ) ] measurement has been utilized to characterize a nanolaser with high spontaneous emission coupling factor. Pulse excitation with low repetition rate is usually preferred for nanolasers due to its heat accumulation or photobleaching induced problem; however, introducing pulse-to-pulse timing jitter issue hinders the g 2 ( τ ) measurement from functioning. Here, a jitter-calibrated method is proposed by adding an extra reference time channel so that the g 2 ( τ ) can be calculated accurately. To verify the validity of this calibration method, the lasing threshold of a CdSe nanowire excited by a pulsed laser with a repetition rate of 1 kHz is studied. The descent of g 2 ( 0 ) to 1 coincides with the kink in light-in vs light-out curve, which confirms the effectiveness of this method.},

  abstract     = {Waste heat is a free and abundant energy source, with 15\% of global total energy use existing as waste heat above 600 K. For 600–900 K temperature range, near-field thermophotovoltaics (NFTPVs) are theorized to be the most effective technology to recycle waste heat into electrical power. However, to date, experimental efficiencies have not exceeded 1.5\%. In this work, we optimize the efficiency of three modeled InAs/InAsSbP-based room-temperature NFTPV devices positioned 0.1 μ m from a 750 K p-doped Si radiator. We couple a one-dimensional fluctuational electrodynamics model for the near field optics to a two-dimensional drift-diffusion model, which we validated by reproducing measured dark current–voltage curves of two previously published InAs and InAsSbP devices. The optimized devices show four to six times higher above-bandgap energy transfer compared to the blackbody radiative limit, yielding enhanced power density, while simultaneously lowering parasitic sub-bandgap energy transfer by factors of 0.68–0.85. Substituting InAs front- and back-surface field layers with InAsSbP show 1.5- and 1.4-times higher efficiency and power output, respectively, from lowered parasitic diffusion currents. Of our three optimized designs, the best performing device has a double heterostructure with an n–i–p doping order from front to back. For radiator-thermophotovoltaic gaps of 0.01–10 μ m and radiators within 600–900 K, this device has a maximum efficiency of 14.2\% and a maximum power output of 1.55 W/cm 2 , both at 900 K. Within 600–900 K, the efficiency is always higher with near- vs far-field illumination; we calculate up to 3.7- and 107-times higher efficiency and power output, respectively, using near-field heat transfer.},

Using fluctuational electrodynamics and the drift-diffusion equations, we optimize a device made of an AlGaAs PIN LED and a GaAs PIN PV cell with matched bandgaps. We find that the LED can work as an efficient heat pump only in the near field, where radiative heat transfer is increased by wave tunneling. A key reason is that non-radiative recombination rates are reduced compared to radiative ones in this regime. At 10 nm gap distance and for 100 cm s − 1 effective surface recombination velocity, the power output can reach 2.2 W cm − 2 for a 600 K LED, which highlights the potential for low-grade energy harvesting.},

To achieve high-speed volumetric LSFM imaging without perturbing the sample, it is necessary to use some form of remote refocusing in the detection beam path. Previous work used electrically tunable lenses, tunable acoustic gradient index of refraction lenses, or the remote-refocusing approach of Botcherby et al. [Opt. Lett. 32 (14), 2007 (2007)] to achieve remote refocusing. However, these approaches generally only provide low-order defocus correction, which is not compatible with higher-NA objectives that require higher order defocus corrections or reduce the optical throughput. In order to simultaneously achieve high-speed remote refocusing and correct system aberrations, we employ a deformable mirror in the detection path that is capable of providing higher orders of defocus and aberration correction in an optical system with an NA of 0.72–0.75. We demonstrate high-speed volumetric imaging at 26.3 volumes per second and 35 frames per volume for a defocus range of −50 to 50 μ m.},

Aggressive radical surgery to achieve no residual tumor would improve survival, which is mainly affected by vascular involvement and accuracy of judging the negative margin of tumor resection. However, there is currently no intraoperative tool that can simultaneously perform microscopic analysis of the peritumoral vasculature in vivo and the surgical margin pathology of the tumor ex vivo , which leads to the randomness of one-time complete resection of the tumor, and the patient may have to undergo secondary surgery. To address this critical need, we developed a 532/266 nm dual-wavelength photoacoustic (PA) microscopy imaging (532/266-PAI) system that enables both in vivo tumor regional vascular involvement analysis and pathological margin assessment of fresh ex vivo tumor samples. A mammary tumor animal model was established to mimic the process of tumor resection, from in vivo imaging vascular involvement of tumor to intraoperative judgment of negative tumor margins. It is proved that the 532/266-PAI technology can identify the tumor vascular involvement through vascular visualization, determine the surgical plan, and then judge whether the tumor is completely removed through ultraviolet PA (UPA) tumor pathological imaging. Re-excision and secondary margin evaluation are performed when margin positive is diagnosed in the intraoperation UPA imaging. The 266/532-PAI technique has great potential for complete tumor resection in surgical navigation.},

  abstract     = {The visualization of drugs is essential for cancer treatment. Although several methods for visualizing drugs have been proposed, a versatile method that can be easily applied to various drugs has not yet been established. Therefore, we propose “activation imaging,” in which a drug is irradiated with thermal neutrons and becomes radioactive, enabling visualization using emitted x rays and/or gamma rays. Activation imaging does not require the conjugation of specific tracers with drugs. Therefore, it can be easily applied to a variety of drugs, drug carriers (e.g., metal nanoparticles), and contrast agents. In this study, neutron activation, gamma-ray spectroscopy, and imaging of drug carriers, anticancer drug, and contrast agents were performed. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and platinum nanoparticles were used as drug carriers, cisplatin was used as an anticancer drug, and gadoteridol and iohexol were used as contrast agents. As a neutron source, the RIKEN accelerator-driven compact neutron source II (RANS-II) was utilized. The imaging was performed using a hybrid Compton camera (HCC). The HCC can visualize x rays and gamma rays ranging from a few keV to nearly 1 MeV, which enables the imaging of various x rays and gamma rays emitted from the activated drugs. As a result, the gamma-ray spectra indicated the generation of radioisotopes through neutron irradiation, and AuNPs and iohexol were visualized.},

  abstract     = {This paper demonstrates a hafnium zirconium oxide (HZO)-based ferroelectric NEMS unimorph as the fundamental building block for very low-energy capacitive readout in-memory computing. The reported device consists of a 250 × 30 μ m 2 unimorph cantilever with 20-nm-thick ferroelectric HZO on 1 μ m SiO 2 . Partial ferroelectric switching in HZO achieves analog programmable control of the piezoelectric coefficient (d 31 ), which serves as the computational weight for multiply accumulate (MAC) operations. The displacement of the piezoelectric unimorph was recorded by actuating the device with different input voltages V in . The resulting displacement was measured as a function of the ferroelectric programming/poling voltage V P ⁠ . The slopes of central beam displacement (δ max ) vs V in were measured to be between 182.9 nm/V (for −8 V p ) and −90.5 nm/V (for 8 V p ), which corresponds to displacement proportionality constant β of 68 nm/V 2 for +ve V p and 47 nm/V 2 for −ve V p , demonstrating linear behavior of the multiplier unit. The resultant δ max from AC actuation is in the range of −18 to 36 nm and is a scaled product of V in and programmed d 31 (governed by the V p ). The multiplication function serves as the fundamental unit for MAC operations with the ferroelectric NEMS unimorph. The displacement from many such beams can be added by summing the capacitance changes, providing a pathway to implement a multi-input and multi-weight neuron. A scaling and fabrication analysis suggests that this device can be CMOS compatible, achieving high in-memory computational throughput.},

On the other hand, previously reported hot carrier electroluminescent silicon devices utilizing a reverse biased diode require high operating voltages. Here, we investigate hot carrier electroluminescence in silicon metal–oxide–semiconductor capacitors operating under transient voltage conditions. During each voltage transient, large energy band bending is created at the edge of the source contact, much larger than what is achievable at a steady state. As a result, electrons and holes are injected efficiently from a single source contact into the silicon channel at the corresponding voltage transient, where they subsequently undergo impact ionization and phonon-assisted interband recombination. Notably, we show low voltage operation down to 2.8 V by using a 20 nm thick high- κ gate dielectric. We show further voltage scaling is possible by reducing the gate dielectric thickness, thus presenting a low voltage platform for silicon optoelectronic integrated circuits.},

Through first-principles calculations, we found that a relatively larger Ge concentration in the Ge–Te system may lead to a worse device endurance after continuous operation due to the migration of Ge atoms. Experiments further proved that device endurance can be improved more than two orders of magnitude through decreasing Ge concentration and the element segregation is greatly weakened by the composition close to elemental. Finally, a significantly improved endurance of 2 × 10 10 was realized in Ge 10 Te 90 based OTS selectors.

Here, we propose a second-order topological phoxonic crystal (PXC) based on a two-dimensional (2D) square lattice, of which different unit cell choices can show either a topologically trivial or non-trivial band structure characterized by the 2D Zak phase. The proposed PXC supports the coexistence of photonic and phononic topological corner states, and their robustness to disorders and defects is numerically demonstrated. Our work opens a venue for achieving simultaneous confinement of photons and phonons, which is potentially useful for exploring the interaction of photonic and phononic second-order topological states and for designing novel topological optomechanical devices.},

  abstract     = {Topological Dirac semimetals (TDSMs), such as Cd 3 As 2 and Na 3 Bi, exhibit strong optical dichroism with contrasting dielectric permittivity along different crystal axes. However, such optical dichroism is often overlooked in the study of TDSM-based optoelectronic devices and whether such optical dichroism can lead to unique functionalities not found under the isotropic approximation remains an open question, thus far. Here, we show that the optical dichroism in TDSM lead to starkly different terahertz (THz) responses and device performance as compared to the isotropic case. Using finite-difference time-domain simulations of a Cd 3 As 2 -based metasurface, we demonstrate that such optical dichroism can lead to an unexpected THz wave polarization conversion even if the metasurface structure remains fourfold rotationally symmetric, a useful feature not achievable under the isotropic model of TDSM. Our findings concretely reveal the contrasting spectral response between isotropic and anisotropic media and shed important light on the capability of anisotropic TDSM in THz applications, leading not just to the more accurate device modeling but also a new route in realizing THz wave polarization conversion without the need for complex device morphology commonly employed in conventional polarization converters.},

  abstract     = {Integer quantum Hall effect allows to gauge the resistance standard up to more than one part in a billion. Combining it with the speed of light, one obtains the fine-structure constant α ≈ 1/137, a dimensionless reference number that can be extracted from a physical experiment. Most exact notion of this value and especially its possible variation on the cosmological time scales is of enormous relevance for fundamental science. In an optical experiment, the fine-structure constant can be directly obtained as purely geometrical angle by measuring the quantized rotation of light polarization in two-dimensional quantum wells. In realistic conditions, high external magnetic fields have to be applied, which strongly affects possible attainable accuracy. An elegant solution of this problem is provided by quantum anomalous Hall effect where a universal quantized value can be obtained in zero magnetic field. Here, we measure the fine-structure constant in a direct optical experiment that requires no material adjustments or technical calibrations. By investigating the Faraday rotation at the interference maxima of the dielectric substrate, the angle close to one α is obtained at liquid helium temperatures without using a dilution refrigerator. Such calibration and parameter-free experiment provides a system-of-unit-independent access to universal quantum of rotation.},

  abstract     = {Due to their feature of the conversion from electrical to mechanical energy under an applied electric field, dielectric elastomers (DEs) have been widely adopted in smart devices. However, the significant electro-actuated property of DEs is always obtained under a giant driving electric field, which raises a potential safety hazard and limits their practical application range. Moreover, the traditional strategy of regulating the flexibility of DEs via physical swelling effect would result in an undesired plasticizer leakage and an irreversible reduction in both electromechanical stability and lifetime. Herein, a typical heterogeneous multi-layered polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-based DE composite was prepared by solution blending and the layer-by-layer casting method. Through synchronously introducing the high-permittivity BaTiO 3 and the plasticizer dimethyl silicone oil in the middle layer, both the dielectric and mechanical property of the composite are effectively regulated. Not only the interlayered mechanical mismatch is eliminated but also the problem of plasticizer leakage is optimized through this reasonable structural design. The maximum electro-actuated strain obtained in the sandwiched DE composite was as large as 24.25\% under 60 V/ μ m, which is 338.52\% higher than that of pristine PDMS. Furthermore, the composite exhibits the largest driving strain (58.31\%) near its breakdown electric field of 77.82 V/ μ m. Therefore, this study provides a promising route for the preparation of advanced DE composite with an improved low-field electro-actuated property.},

Here, we employed a simulated sunlight illumination instead of high-energy lasers to realize the sunlight-assisted ferroelectric domain switching in Sn 2 P 2 S 6 single crystals. The origin is the enhancement of localized carrier concentration due to the disproportionation reaction of Sn ions, which induces an additional internal field and assists the domain switching. The migration and accumulation of the Sn ions are also verified with scanning probe technique, which can be utilized as a resistive memory prototype. It is noteworthy that this memory effect can be significantly enhanced by sunlight illumination and, thus, make it suitable for the sunlight control of ferroelectric domain switching and ionic memory devices.},

  abstract     = {Metallic hydrogen is capable of showing room temperature superconductivity, but its experimental syntheses are extremely hard. Therefore, it is desirable to reduce the synthesis pressure of metallic hydrogen by adding other chemical elements. However, for most hydrides, the metallization of hydrogen by “chemical precompression” to achieve high-temperature superconductivity still requires relatively high pressure, making experimental synthesis difficult. How to achieve high-temperature superconductivity in the lower-pressure range (≤50 GPa) is a key issue for realizing practical applications of superconducting materials. Toward this end, this work proposes a strategy for inserting ammonium ions in the fcc crystal of metals. High-throughput calculations of the periodic table reveal 12 elements that can form kinetically stable and superconducting hydrides at lower pressures, where the highest superconducting transition temperatures of AlN 2 H 8 , MgN 2 H 8 , and GaN 2 H 8 can reach up to 118, 105, and 104 K. Pressure-induced bond length changes and charge transfer reveal the physical mechanism of high-temperature superconductivity, where the H atom continuously gains electrons leading to the transition of H + ions to atomic H, facilitating metallization of hydrogen under less extreme high pressure. Our results also reveal two strong linear scalar relationships: one is the H-atom charge vs superconducting transition temperature, and the other is the first ionization energy vs the highest superconducting transition temperature. In addition, ZnN 2 H 8 , CdN 2 H 8 , and HgN 2 H 8 were found to be superconductors at ambient pressure, and the presence of interstitial electrons suggests that they are also electrides, whose relatively low work functions (3.03, 2.78, and 3.05 eV) imply that they can be used as catalysts for nitrogen reduction reactions as well.},

In this study, we developed tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) sensors with even-function resistance–field ( R – H ) responses and investigated their noise properties. The developed TMR sensors achieved a higher MR ratio (∼120\%) than those of conventional giant magnetoresistive multilayers exhibiting even-function R – H responses. The TMR sensors were realized by stabilizing the magnetization of the magnetic free layer (FL) in an anti-parallel configuration with respect to that of the reference layer. Orange-peel ferromagnetic coupling between the FL and a pinned layer through an AgSn spacer layer was used to control the strength of the unidirectional magnetic anisotropy of the FL, by which even-function R – H responses with negligible hysteresis were obtained. The sensors enabled us to study the intrinsic noise properties of TMR devices, particularly under an external AC modulation magnetic field. We found that the magnetic 1/ f noise originating from thermal magnetization fluctuation was the dominant noise of the TMR sensors at low frequencies. We observed that the application of an AC modulation field to the TMR sensors increased the noise owing to the magnetic domain fluctuation and the transfer of magnetic 1/ f noise to the modulation frequency.},

The excited spin current in the NM converts into a direct current via the inverse spin Hall effect. We show that non-zero uncompensation between magnetic spins in FiM gives a non-zero output rectified voltage for both “easy axis” and “easy plane” uniaxial anisotropies. The increase in the uncompensation parameter removes degeneracy from two normal resonance modes and changes the sensitivity to the EM wave. Namely, the sensitivity of the higher mode increases, and the lower mode decreases with increasing the uncompensation parameter. We believe that our results can be helpful for the practical development of sub-THz frequency tunable resonance detector based on the FiM.},

Surprisingly, the D value is high enough to generate skyrmions in a symmetric sandwich structure although the value is smaller than that in an antisymmetric Pt/Co/Ta trilayer. The decreased D value with the increase in the Co layer thickness indicates that the Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction is still contributed from the interfaces.

  abstract     = {The spin dynamics modulation has attracted extensive attention in the past decades. Rare-earth (RE) metals are essential participants in this context due to the large spin–orbit coupling. Here, with neodymium (Nd) capping, we achieve the enhancement on spin dynamic damping of Co 40 Fe 40 B 20 (CFB) films by three times larger than that of CFB single layer. Based on the spin pumping theory, the interfacial spin mixing conductance G eff ↑ ↓ is calculated as 7.3 × 10 15 cm −2 , which is one order larger than that of CFB/Pt. It leads to the large spin current transparency at CFB/Nd interface. By comparing of the resistivity of each layer, we found that the matched resistivity at two sides of the CFB/Nd interface plays an important role in the enhancement of G eff ↑ ↓ ⁠ . As a consequence, a high spin transparency of the CFB/Nd interface is obtained as 82\%. In addition, damping enhancement of CFB is not changed promptly by inserting 1–2 nm Cu layer, but it is suppressed when the Cu layer is thicker than 3 nm, which is related to the thickness dependence of the Cu resistivity. Our study broadens the horizon for the application of rare-earth (RE) in spintronics.},

Although planar hybrid circuits based on split ring resonators have shown strong coherent photon–magnon coupling, none of those operates at millimeter-wave frequencies. With specially designed electric-field-coupled resonators, strong coupling between resonator modes and ferromagnetic resonance modes (either in-plane or out-of-plane) was experimentally observed in two circuits working at 4.1 and 30 GHz. Their dynamics were well described by quantum models. The miniature, integrable, and physically robust circuits pave a way for planar photon–magnon hybrid systems at even higher frequencies, demonstrating the possibility to integrate magnon-based systems with millimeter-wave devices.},

  abstract     = {Energy confinement plays an important role in improving wave–matter interactions, enabling applications such as sensing, lasing, and filtering. One convenient solution for achieving large energy-confinement is based on embedded eigenstates, i.e., non-radiating eigenmodes supported by open structures. While the analysis of these modes is quite consolidated in electromagnetics and optics, their relevance in acoustics has been less explored, despite their wide application potential. In this work, we explore acoustic embedded scattering eigenstates within the radiation continuum enabled by resonant metasurface pairs. At resonance, each metasurface strongly reflects the input wave, but as their surface resonances interfere with each other through coupling with a longitudinal resonance, an embedded eigenstate emerges. Through both theoretical and numerical analysis, we show the conditions for such an exotic resonant state to emerge and its implication for acoustic systems.},

Herein, we propose that degenerate surface-line phonon modes can also emerge in solids with orthorhombic structures. Based on first-principle calculations and symmetry analysis, we propose that orthorhombic NaMgF 3 fluoroperovskite with space group Pnma (No. 62) is a material candidate with degenerate line states in both the bulk phonon mode and the (010) surface phonon mode. We discovered four closed nodal loops (two type-I and two hybrid-type) on the k y = 0 plane in the bulk phonon mode, all of which coexisted with Dirac points on the Z–U and X–U paths. Moreover, we discovered symmetry-projected doubly degenerate nodal lines along the X ¯ – U ¯ surface path in the (010) surface phonon mode. The proposed degenerate surface-line phonons in NaMgF 3 is quite clean and protected by symmetries, which will aid future experimental detection.},

We report the realization of all-crystalline GaN/Er:GaN/GaN embedded waveguide fiber structures using the hydride vapor phase epitaxy growth and re-growth technique, along with chemical–mechanical polishing processes. The Er:GaN core layer possesses an Er doping concentration of 1.7 × 10 20 atoms/cm 3 , confirmed by secondary ion mass spectrometry measurements. X-ray diffraction measurements confirm, respectively, c-, a-, and m-plane orientations for top/bottom, side, and front/back cross-sectional cladding layers of the fiber structure with good single-crystalline quality. The 1.5 μ m Er 3+ emission was detected from each surface of the fiber structures via 980 nm resonant excitation. The effect of 1.54 μ m light guiding by the fiber structure has been demonstrated.

  abstract     = {For a biased trap-filled insulator, the current transport is governed by the physics of charge injection from the metallic electrode and also the trap-limited space-charge conduction in the insulator. With a Schottky barrier at the interface of the metal-insulator junction, charge tunneling injection from a metal into the trap-filled insulator is different from an Ohmic contact. At sufficiently large amount of charge injection at high voltages, the charge transport becomes the trap-limited space-charge conduction. In this paper, we develop a consistent model to calculate the correct IV characteristics up to a breakdown field strength of 1 V/nm. Using this model, we analyze the transport characteristic of three different metal-insulator junctions (ITO/PPV, Al/h-BN, and Al/ZrO 2 ) and identify the conduction mechanisms over a wide range of the applied voltage, insulator&#39;s thickness, and properties of the traps. Our findings report the interplay between various transport mechanisms, which is useful to characterize the correct current transport for novel insulators such as organic semiconductors, 2D insulators, and metal-oxide electronics.},

Resonance photoelectron spectroscopy revealed the difference in the electronic structure of the films for each rare-earth dopant, suggesting different emission mechanisms, viz., electron–hole recombination and impact excitation. Although it is widely believed that amorphous materials are unsuitable for use as emission layers of LEDs because of their high concentrations of mid-gap states and defects, the developed rare-earth-doped AOS materials show good performance as emission layers.

We consider exciton interaction with longitudinal acoustic phonons with linear dispersion and flexural phonons with quadratic dispersion. We identify the regimes where the weak localization effect can be particularly pronounced. We also briefly address the role of free charge carriers in the exciton quantum transport and, within the self-consistent theory of localization, the weak localization effects beyond the lowest order.},

It is shown that Auger processes dominate the losses for carrier densities in the range typical for applications as lasers. The Auger loss depends crucially on how far energetically lower hole bands are detuned from the valence band edge. Values for this detuning range throughout literature from being about equal to the bandgap to being on the order of 100 meV larger than the bandgap. We find that at cryogenic temperatures of 50 K (100 K), the Auger coefficient, C , is about six (three) orders of magnitude smaller if this detuning is as in our calculations at the low end of the published values rather than at the high end where it exceeds the bandgap. At room temperature, the sensitivity is reduced to about a factor of four with C values ranging between 0.4 and 1.6 × 10 − 27 cm 6 s −1 . Here, radiative losses dominate for carrier densities up to about 10 16 / cm 3 with a loss coefficient B ≈ 10 − 11 cm 3 s −1 .

Upon Ohmic contact formation to the implanted regions, sheet resistance values of 314, 926, and 1676 Ω/sq were measured at room temperature for the Si-, Ge-, and Sn-implanted samples, respectively. Room temperature Hall measurements resulted in sheet carrier concentrations and Hall mobilities of 2.13 × 10 14 /93, 8.58 × 10 13 /78, and 5.87 × 10 13 /63 cm 2 /(V s), respectively, for these three donor species. Secondary ion mass spectroscopy showed a volumetric dopant concentration of approximately 2 × 10 19 cm −3 for the three species, resulting in carrier activation efficiencies of 64.7\%, 40.3\%, and 28.2\% for Si, Ge, and Sn, respectively. Temperature-dependent Hall effect measurements ranging from 15 to 300 K showed a nearly constant carrier concentration in the Si-implanted sample, suggesting the formation of an impurity band indicative of degenerate doping. With a bulk carrier concentration of 1.3 × 10 19 cm −3 for the Si implanted sample, a room temperature mobility of 93 cm 2 /(V s) is among the highest reported in Ga 2 O 3 with a similar carrier concentration. The unimplanted Ga 2 O 3 :N regions remained highly resistive after the surrounding areas received implant and activation anneal.

  abstract     = {AlScN is attractive as a lattice-matched epitaxial barrier layer for incorporation in GaN high electron mobility transistors due to its large dielectric constant and polarization. The transport properties of polarization-induced two-dimensional (2D) electron gas of densities of ∼ 2 × 10 13 /cm 2 formed at the AlScN–GaN interface is studied by Hall-effect measurements down to cryogenic temperatures. The 2D electron gas densities exhibit mobilities limited to ∼300 cm 2 /V s down to 10 K at AlScN/GaN heterojunctions. The insertion of a ∼2 nm AlN interlayer boosts the room temperature mobility by more than five times from ∼300 cm 2 /V s to ∼ 1573 cm 2 /V s, and the 10 K mobility by more than 20 times to ∼6980 cm 2 /V s at 10 K. These measurements provide guidelines to the limits of electron conductivities of these highly polar heterostructures.},

  abstract     = {Anomalous Hall effect, an interesting transport behavior, is of importance topic for fundamental physics and device application. Recently, the sign change of anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in some materials has being concerned. Here, we study the electrical transport, magnetic properties, and AHE of Cr 2.63 V 0.25 Te 4 single crystals. Cr 2.63 V 0.25 Te 4 shows a bad metal behavior with a resistivity kink at 178 K, corresponding to a peak on a heat capacity–temperature curve, and the strong electron correlation should be a dominant transport mechanism below 178 K. At this temperature, the magnetization shows a sharp magnetic transition. The linear Hall resistivity at a high field with a positive slope suggests a p-type conductivity for bulk Cr 2.63 V 0.25 Te 4 . The clear AHE is observed below 180 K with a larger anomalous Hall conductivity σ xy ∼ 2000 Ω −1 cm −1 at 3 K. For 3–60 K, an AHE coefficient R s is negative, and R s is positive between 100 and 180 K. The sign change of AHE may be due to Fermi level crossing the overlap of 3 d band in ferromagnetic transition-metal materials. Based on our analysis, the AHE mechanism should be the skew scattering. Our results reveal the interesting physical properties in Cr 2.63 V 0.25 Te 4 single crystals and give another system to study AHE for future Hall device design.},

  abstract     = {Despite increasing research interest in two-dimensional (2D) perovskites, the stability and spectral response range of the photodetectors based on 2D perovskites are yet far from satisfactory. In this work, a semiconductor heterojunction is constructed based on dimethyl itaconate (DI) treated (BA) 2 PbI 4 microplates and CsPb(Br x /I 1−x ) 3 nanocrystals. The DI treatment not only passivates the defects but also blocks the moisture, resulting in improved stability and suppressed defect trapping. Meanwhile, the type-II heterojunctions facilitate the separation of electron–hole pairs. As a result, the photodetector based on the DI-(BA) 2 PbI 4 /CsPb(Br x /I 1−x ) 3 exhibits a responsivity up to 209 nA/mW and a detectivity up to 5.9 × 10 8 Jones with a broad spectral response range of 400–600 nm. Furthermore, after storage in the ambient environment for 10 days, the responsivity retains about 70\%, which is significantly ameliorated compared to the photodetector based on bare (BA) 2 PbI 4 (drops more than 90\%). Therefore, this work demonstrates that surface passivation and 2D/three-dimensional heterojunctions are promising strategies to improve responsivity, broaden spectral response range, and enhance stability of photodetectors based on 2D perovskites.},

Despite the potential, further development of the UCC technology is restricted by the limited types of excitation light sources. Here, we use a white flashlight as excitation to investigate the UCC performance of storage phosphors. We demonstrate, as an example, that a Y 3 Al 2 Ga 3 O 12 :Pr 3+ phosphor exhibits long-lasting emissions in the ultraviolet and visible regions after intense illumination from the flashlight. Thermoluminescence investigations reveal that both excited-state absorption and energy-transfer upconversion are involved in the UCC process. Based on the luminescence performance of the white-light charged phosphor, a conceptual thermometry approach is introduced, which can remotely sense the local temperature by monitoring the afterglow intensity ratio. Considering the wide use of flashlight, such a white-light excitability and the associated glow emission may potentially revolutionize the way to utilize storage phosphors.},

  abstract     = {The incorporation of dilute concentrations of bismuth into traditional III–V alloys produces significant reductions in bandgap energy presenting unique opportunities in strain and bandgap engineering. However, the disparity between the ideal growth conditions for the host matrix and those required for substitutional bismuth incorporation has caused the material quality of these III–V–Bi alloys to lag behind that of conventional III–V semiconductors. InSb 1−x Bi x , while experimentally underexplored, is a promising candidate for high-quality III–V–Bi alloys due to the relatively similar ideal growth temperatures for InSb and III–Bi materials. By identifying a highly kinetically limited growth regime, we demonstrate the growth of high-quality InSb 1−x Bi x by molecular beam epitaxy. X-ray diffraction and Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS) measurements of the alloy&#39;s bismuth concentration, coupled with smooth surface morphologies as measured by atomic force microscopy, suggest unity-sticking bismuth incorporation for a range of bismuth concentrations from 0.8\% to 1.5\% as measured by RBS. In addition, the first photoluminescence was observed from InSb 1−x Bi x and demonstrated wavelength extension up to 7.6 μ m at 230 K, with a bismuth-induced bandgap reduction of ∼29 meV/\% Bi. Furthermore, we report the temperature dependence of the bandgap of InSb 1−x Bi x and observed behavior consistent with that of a traditional III–V alloy. The results presented highlight the potential of InSb 1−x Bi x as an alternative emerging candidate for accessing the longwave-infrared.},

Implementing this approach using materials that remain stable in harsh thermo-chemical environments would allow it to be broadly deployed in thermal photonics. Our prior work showed that heterostructures of rock salt MgO and perovskite BaZr 0.5 Hf 0.5 O 3 (BZHO) are stable up to 1100 °C in air, with no discernible intermixing. In this work, we design a gradient ENZ metamaterial made from three lattice-matched refractory oxides: MgO, BZHO, and NiO. The miscibility of MgO and NiO makes it possible to linearly vary the ENZ frequency of the metamaterial layers. BZHO is used as a thin, interlayer diffusion barrier. We model the emissivity of our gradient ENZ metamaterial at 25 and 1000 °C to demonstrate that the spectral bandwidth of directional emission is preserved at high temperatures despite changes in the optical properties of each material. Finally, we discuss practical fabrication challenges associated with the back reflector and offer potential solutions based on advancements in hetero-integration. Overall, this work shows a pathway toward gradient ENZ metamaterials with ultrahigh-temperature stability.},

The presence of graphene was proven using scanning tunneling microscopy, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and low energy electron diffraction. The precursors, azupyrene and pyrene, are comparatively large aromatic molecules in contrast to more commonly employed precursors like methane or ethylene. While the formation of the hexagonal graphene lattice could naively be expected when pyrene is used as a precursor, the situation is more complex for azupyrene. In this case, the non-alternant topology of azupyrene with only 5- and 7-membered rings must be altered to form the observed hexagonal graphene lattice. Such a rearrangement, converting a non-alternant topology into an alternant one, is in line with previous reports describing similar topological alterations, including the isomerization of molecular azupyrene to pyrene. The thermal synthesis route to graphene, presented here, is achievable at comparatively low temperatures and under ultra-high vacuum conditions, which may enable further investigations of the growth process in a strictly controlled and clean environment that is not accessible with traditional precursors.},

The device shows lasing operation in the cw mode up to 111 K, and cw output power up to 11.5 mW at 77 K (0.5\% wall-plug efficiency). A circular, directive beam pattern is collected, and free-running linewidths on the order of tens of kHz are measured over tens of seconds.},

  abstract     = {Polaritons can provide strong optical field enhancement allowing them to boost light–matter interaction. Here, we experimentally observe enhancement in mid-infrared second-harmonic generation (SHG) using grating-coupled surface phonon polaritons of the 6H-SiC surface. In our experiment, we measure the SHG along the polariton dispersion by changing the incidence angle of the excitation beam. We observe hybridization between the propagating surface phonon polaritons and localized plasmon resonances in the gold grating, evidenced by the modification of the polariton dispersion as we change the area ratio of grating and substrate. Design options for engineering the plasmon–phonon polariton hybridization are discussed. Overall, we find a rather low yield of polariton-enhanced SHG in this geometry compared to prism-coupling and nanostructures and discuss possible origins.},

In practice, it is challenging to sort Laguerre–Gaussian mode according to various features. Traditional fork grating and optical geometric transformations are regarded as convenient methods for sorting LG mode. However, these methods have to destroy the OAM carried by the beam during the sorting process. Here, we demonstrate a nondestructive beam sorting mechanism for LG mode carrying orbital angular momentums based on a translation operator. The numerically solved operator can sort the input beams to pre-defined positions with faithful preservation of all the beam features, which shows good agreement with the experimental results. We believe the proposed translation operator will benefit potential applications in information processing, quantum optics, and optical communications.},

In this work, we designed and grew the high-quality Bi 2 Te 0.6 S 2.4 alloy via controllable chemical vapor transport. The as-prepared Bi 2 Te 0.6 S 2.4 nanobelts were designed to work as the active layer in photodetectors. The individual Bi 2 Te 0.6 S 2.4 nanobelt based photodetector exhibits excellent photoresponse properties in a broadband range from solar-blind ultraviolet-C (254 nm) to near-infrared (1064 nm) with a good responsivity of 340 mA/W, a specific detectivity of 2.3 × 10 9 Jones, and extremely low dark current (1.1 pA). The photodetectors also exhibit a fast response speed of about 1 μ s which comes from the direct transition of carriers in Bi 2 Te 0.6 S 2.4 confirmed by the Ohmic contact between Bi 2 Te 0.6 S 2.4 and electrodes. Furthermore, it is worth noting that the Bi 2 Te 0.6 S 2.4 nanobelts have high polarization sensitivity in the broadband ranges from 266 to 1064 nm with the maximum dichroic ratio of 2.94 at 808 nm.

  abstract     = {A great deal of interest has been recently directed at exploring how the performance of photovoltaic and thermophotovoltaic systems can benefit from the use of ultra-thin layers and near-field effects. Related questions on how radiation transfer is modified if both the source and sink of the radiation are located within an optical cavity have, however, received far less attention. This question is, nevertheless, particularly relevant in the field of electroluminescence-driven thermophotonics, which could substantially benefit from the possibility to boost the energy transfer by making use of optical cavities. To gain insight into this possibility, we deploy fluctuational electrodynamics and study the fundamental resonance effects in structures where the emitter and absorber layers are separated by a vacuum nanogap and bordered by high-efficiency mirrors. We obtain the expected result that resonance effects can strongly enhance the interactions at specific wavelengths and propagation angles. Moreover, we find that even after integrating over wavelength and propagation angle, (1) the total power emitted can be tuned by adjusting the cavity thickness and the optical cavity mode structure, and (2) thinning the active layer enhances its emission in the cavity, causing a sublinear dependence between the active layer thickness and its overall emission. In plain numbers, adjusting the cavity thickness produces non-monotonous changes of over 50\% in the total emission of thin layers. These observations apply also to absorption, which can become remarkably efficient even for an extremely thin absorber layer, thanks to cavity effects.},

Among the emerging neuromorphic electronics, oxide-based three-terminal artificial synapses merit the features of scalability and compatibility with the silicon technology as well as the concurrent signal transmitting-and-learning. In this Perspective, we survey four types of three-terminal artificial synapses classified by their operation mechanisms, including the oxide electrolyte-gated transistor, ion-doped oxide electrolyte-gated transistor, ferroelectric-gated transistor, and charge trapping-gated transistor. The synaptic functions mimicked by these devices are analyzed based on the tunability of the channel conductance correlated with the charge relocation and polarization in gate dielectrics. Finally, the opportunities and challenges of implementing oxide-based three-terminal artificial synapses in physical neural networks are delineated for future prospects.},

Quasi-static tensile and shock spall experiments on the irradiated and unirradiated LT21 Al reveal considerable irradiation-induced softening (larger than 40\%) in both the tensile and spall strength. We attribute the irradiation softening to the over-aging process promoted by irradiation enhanced diffusion during the long-term service. Postmortem characterizations on shock-recovered samples indicate that the long-term low-dose-rate neutron irradiation-induced microstructures (micrometer-sized voids and second-phase particles) facilitate nucleation and growth of the dynamic damage in irradiated materials, thus playing an important role in the change in facture behaviors.},

Although the spin state of both color centers and nuclear spins coupled through hyperfine interactions is usually optically read out, an electrical readout technique is important for miniaturizing and integrating devices. In the present study, we report the electrical detection of silicon vacancy (V2) centers in 4H-SiC by photocurrent-detected magnetic resonance (PDMR) using a frequency-sweep technique. We electrically observe the spin coherence of the V2 centers and clearly resolve the hyperfine splitting of the electron spin signal for the V2 centers coupled with next-nearest-neighbor 29 Si atoms. In addition, we apply PDMR to electron–nuclear double resonance (PD-ENDOR) to detect nuclear magnetic resonance of 29 Si at room temperature and find that this method can resolve nuclear spins coupled with neighboring electron spins in the V2 centers. The realization of PD-ENDOR is expected to be a critical step toward the development of electrically driven integrated quantum devices.},

The scheme is versatile for broad cryogenic current measurements, including semiconductor spin-qubit readout, owing to the TIA&#39;s having low input impedance comparable to that of commercial room-temperature TIAs. The TIA has a broad frequency bandwidth and a low noise floor, with a trade-off between them governed by the feedback resistance R FB . A lower R FB of 50 kΩ enables high-speed current measurement with a −3 dB cutoff frequency f −3dB = 28 MHz and noise-floor NF = 8.5 × 10 −27 A 2 /Hz, while a larger R FB of 400 kΩ provides low-noise measurement with NF = 1.0 × 10 −27 A 2 /Hz and f −3dB = 4.5 MHz. Time-domain measurement of a 2-nA peak-to-peak square wave, which mimics the output of the standard spin-qubit readout technique via charge sensing, demonstrates a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 12.7, with the time resolution of 48 ns, for R FB = 200 kΩ, which compares favorably with the best-reported values for the radio frequency reflectometry technique. The time resolution can be further improved at the cost of the SNR (or vice versa) by using an even smaller (larger) R FB , with a further reduction in the noise figure possible by limiting the frequency band with a low-pass filter. Our scheme is best suited for readout electronics for cryogenic sensors that require a high time resolution and current sensitivity and, thus, provides a solution for various fundamental research and industrial applications.},

We observe that the CL signal saturates at a given surface dose, independently of the electron current density. Based on photoluminescence and photon correlations, we show that the number of photoactive color centers is proportional to the CL signal, and we estimate the maximum density of quantum emitters that can be generated by our technique.

  abstract     = {Although it is well acknowledged that regulating the adsorption behavior of oxygen-containing intermediates can prompt the reaction kinetics of lithium–oxygen batteries, its implementation still suffers from lacking a practical strategy. The amorphization strategy has great potential for custom-tuning surface engineering due to the induced atomic disorder possessing unique electronic structures and abundant defect sites. In this work, amorphous NiCo 2 O 4 nanosheets (a-NiCo 2 O 4 NSs) are reported for high-performance lithium–oxygen batteries by modulating the electron density around metal sites. The Li–O 2 batteries with a-NiCo 2 O 4 NSs deliver an overpotential as low as 0.74 V with an ultralong lifetime of over 1000 h. Theoretical calculations reveal that the enhanced binding energy of the LiO 2 intermediate is stemmed from d-band center upshifting, mediated by atomic disordering, which consequently yields low oxygen evolution-reaction and oxygen-reduction-reaction overpotentials. More importantly, the amorphization strategy can be utilized as a general approach toward other materials, such as cobalt oxide and nickel oxide.},

In this study, we tried to clarify the adaptation law of Guar gum (GG) and sodium alginate (SA) with 200 nm-Si and 1 μm-Si from the above-mentioned aspects. The rheological properties of the slurry showed that the slurry with GG due to the gelatinization had a poorer dispersion than that with SA. The tests of zeta potentials, thermogravimetric analysis, peeling-off, and nano-indentation profiles explained the performance differences of the electrodes from the mechanical properties. Because of more hydrogen bond sites, the discharge specific capacity of the nm-Si/GG electrode (1116.05 mA h g −1 ) was higher than the nm-Si/SA electrode (657.74 mA h g −1 ) after 70 cycles. On the contrary, the μ m-Si/SA electrode owing to a rigid skeleton in the SA molecule exhibited a discharge specific capacity of 1681.47 mA h g −1 after 50 cycles, while the μ m-Si/GG electrode was 486.58 mA h g −1 .

Here, we have fabricated the WO x /ZrO x dual-oxide layered device, which shows the coexistence of gradual resistive and capacitive switching arisen from the current and capacitance hysteresis curves, respectively. The expansion of hysteresis loop can be modulated by altering the oxygen content in the oxide materials. Interestingly, the presence of negative differential resistance (NDR) is dependent on the voltage sweep direction and range of applied bias, which can be reasoned by the local electric field, charge trapping/detrapping, and conduction band offset at the dual-oxide interface. This study provides the concept of the coexistence of current and capacitance hysteresis along with NDR, and it is highly potential for memristor and memcapacitor circuits to explore neuromorphic computing.},

  abstract     = {A general feature of frequency-domain photothermal (PT) experiments is that the signal phase follows the derivative of the log –log-amplitude. This is the consequence of the Kramers–Kronig (K–K) relations between real and imaginary parts of the thermal response of the system, represented by its thermal impedance. Simple expressions allow determining the phase from the amplitude, both theoretically and experimentally. They stem from the local Hilbert transform in differential form, instead of the traditional integral form which requires broadband information. These expressions are applied to the thermal impedance of a layered system. The measurements were performed in an earlier publication by photothermal radiometry (PTR) method to determine the interfacial thermal resistance between a 50 nm Ti layer and a steel or Si substrate. In this case, high frequency measurements are the most relevant, but they are also most prone to artifacts and background noise. It is concluded that the amplitude and phase results of Ti/steel samples are correctly linked to one another, but that the phase of Ti/Si samples violates the K–K relations at high frequency, probably due to a different signal generation mechanism than the PT one. The fact that PT phenomena are consistent with the K–K relations opens the possibility to check the self-consistency of the results obtained by PTR or by other related PT methods. It also reveals that the PT phase carries the same information as the signal amplitude, less a scaling factor that incorporates the thermal effusivity of a layer in the system.},

  abstract     = {In this Letter, we report a complementary resistive switch (CRS) with good thermal stability and low ON current. The device is constructed with a bilayer structure composed of sputtered amorphous carbon (a-C) and thermal annealed Cu doped a-C (a-C:Cu). The Cu atoms in a-C:Cu can agglomerate to form nanosized active electrodes by thermal annealing. The Cu species can migrate and redistribute to form conductive filaments within the a-C and a-C:Cu layer through an electrochemical redox reaction. The depletion of Cu species in the a-C:Cu or a-C layer produces complementary resistive switching behaviors. Benefiting from the high thermal stability of a-C and a-C:Cu, the device works stable at a high temperature of up to 300 °C with an endurance of 10 4 switching cycle and narrow cycle-to-cycle distribution of threshold voltages. Furthermore, the effects of the Cu content in the a-C:Cu layer and the thickness ratio of a-C:Cu/a-C on the ON state current were studied. By limiting the content of Cu in the a-C:Cu layer, a low ON state current of 5 μ A was obtained, which is among the lowest in the reported CRSs. Furthermore, a “stateful” material implication logic with the “0” and “1” states represented by a distinct combination of the resistance of each layer was implemented. The CRS is a potential and promising device for low power memory/computing applications and harsh electronics.},

By measuring current through a nearby sensor, we observed the random motion of single electrons between the dot and silicon nanowire. The statistics of single-electron motion provides us with information on temperature and voltage at the dot. Under the detailed balance assumption, we determined the temperature difference and the Seebeck voltage between the dot and silicon nanowire. The validity of our analysis was confirmed by observing the energy-barrier height dependence of the Seebeck coefficient. Furthermore, by counting the electrons leaving the dot, a minute output power on the order of sub-zeptowatt from the dot to the silicon nanowire was estimated.},

In this work, epitaxial 500 nm-thick 0.67Pb(Mg 1/3 Nb 2/3 )O 3 –0.33PbTiO 3 (PMN–33PT) films, free from secondary phases and with extremely low rocking curves (FWHM &lt; 0.05°), are grown on ScSmO 3 (SSO) and DyScO 3 (DSO) substrates buffered with SrRuO 3 (SRO). The PMN–33PT is observed to grow coherently on SSO substrates (lattice mismatch of −0.7\%), which is c -axis oriented and exhibits large tetragonality compared to bulk PMN–33PT, while on DSO substrates (lattice mismatch of −1.9\%), the PMN–33PT film is almost completely relaxed and shows reduced tetragonality. Due to the compressive epitaxial strain, the fully strained PMN–33PT film displays typical ferroelectric P–E hysteresis loops, while the relaxed sample shows relaxor-like P–E loops. Samples present large negative imprints of about −88.50 and −49.25 kV/cm for PMN–33PT/SRO/SSO and PMN–33PT/SRO/DSO, respectively, which is more than threefold higher than the coercive field. The imprint is induced by the alignment of defect dipoles with the polarization and is tuned by the epitaxial strain. It permits the stabilization of a robust positive polarization state (P r ∼ 20 μ C/cm 2 ) and low dielectric permittivity (&lt;700). In addition, the relaxed PMN–33PT film shows improved piezoelectric properties, with a 33\% enhancement in d 33,eff relative to the fully strained sample. The obtained low dielectric permittivity and the high piezoelectric coefficients at zero electric field in the studied PMN–33PT films hold great promise to maximize the FOM toward applications in piezoelectric devices.},

  abstract     = {Integration of high-performance lead zirconate titanate (PZT) piezoelectric films onto (111) Si substrates is beneficial for the development of piezoelectric micro-electro-mechanical systems (Piezo-MEMS) because of (111) Si&#39;s isotropic mechanical properties and desirable etching characteristics. These features will greatly reduce complications in micro-device fabrication and patterning of PZT/Si heterostructures. However, piezoelectric performance of a PZT film is usually dominated by its preferred crystalline orientation, with (001) being superior than (110) and (111). Such a vectorial dependence seriously restricts applications of PZT films grown on (111) Si, which are usually not (001)-textured. In this work, highly (001)-oriented PZT thick films (∼1.5 μ m) with a 53/47 Zr/Ti ratio were prepared on (111) Si substrates via a multi-layer buffering technique, i.e., through the use of a (111)Pt/Ti bi-layer and a LaNiO 3 buffer layer. The PZT films were sputter-deposited at a low temperature (350 °C) and then crystallized in a (001) texture via a rapid thermal annealing (RTA). The e 31,f transverse piezoelectric coefficient was up to ∼11.6 C/m 2 for PZT films with a RTA time of 2 minutes. Such an e 31,f value is comparable to that of PZT films grown on (100) Si. This work opens up many possibilities for Piezo-MEMS by demonstrating the desirable combination of a large piezoelectricity in (001) PZT with a good patternability of (111) Si.},

  abstract     = {Solidly mounted resonators (SMRs) with an acoustic Bragg reflector should be more suitable for high power RF filters than a self-standing structure because heat can be transferred to the supporting substrate. Thus, even though the demand for SMRs is expected to increase, the evaluation of the properties of the Bragg reflector that comprise them cannot be separated from the properties of the resonator as a whole. A method to evaluate the mechanical reflection coefficient of the Bragg reflector alone before the piezoelectric layer is grown would, therefore, be attractive, as it would be useful in optimizing the Bragg reflector. In this study, a nondestructive evaluation method of the reflector using a GHz ultrasonic pulse-echo technique is proposed. The Sc 0.40 Al 0.60 N film ultrasonic transducers with electromechanical coupling coefficient k t 2 of 15.8\% and longitudinal wave insertion loss of 7.0 dB with 77\% fractional bandwidth were employed for the measurement system. Mo/SiO 2 Bragg reflector test samples with various number of pairs were evaluated. The experimental mechanical reflectance of the Bragg reflector agreed well with theoretical results simulated by a mechanical equivalent circuit model.},

For temperatures in the range (30–45) K, the frequency f S of the EM signal to be amplified could be tuned continuously in the range (1–25) GHz by an applied B -field induced flux Φ with a one-flux-quantum Φ 0 periodicity. Consequently, we measured a significant parametric gain that is almost frequency independent, with a maximum of (8–10.4) dB reached at 40 K. For temperatures in the range (14–30) K, the magnetic field tunability of f S is gradually suppressed to a minimum of (1–5) GHz range where a parametric gain between 5 and 6 dB was measured. With an appropriate adjustment of design/fabrication parameters, our results suggest that the development of tunable MW generators/detectors as well as parametric amplifiers made of high transition temperature superconductors and operating in a wide range of temperatures (10 mK–77 K) is a reasonable and appealing possibility.},

Here, we explore the use of substrate conformal imprint lithography (SCIL) as a fast and cost-effective fabrication route. We analyze the size distribution of nominal 1.8 μ m and 120 nm diameter platelets and show the effect of the fabrication steps on the magnetic properties which we explain through changes in the dominant magnetization reversal mechanism as the size decreases. We show that SCIL allows for efficient large-scale platelet fabrication and discuss how application-specific requirements can be solved via process and material engineering.},

Here, it is confirmed that the anisotropic behaviors exist in the magnetic, electronic, and magneto-transport properties of the AgCrSe 2 single crystal. A field induced phase transition causes asymmetrical antiferromagnetic states in the μ 0 H //ab plane and the c axis, which correspond to the positive/negative magnetoresistances in two directions, respectively. Below ∼32 K, a spin flop is manifested with a magnetic field of about 4 T, according to the field dependent electoral resistance. The anisotropic behaviors are ascribed to the quasi-two-dimensional structure and also to the unstable Ag + ions and the puckered honeycomb lattice of Cr 3+ ions. This research reveals fundamental transport properties in AgCrSe 2 single crystals and can be explored further in superionic conductor engineering.},

Moreover, we observed unconventional magnetoresistance behaviors for MRG-based Hall bar devices near T comp . First-principles calculations suggest two kinds of Mn moments, which lead to two anomalous Hall channels with opposite signs and consequently correspond to the peak structure and triple loops of the anomalous Hall effect loops. The unconventional temperature dependence of longitudinal resistivity is caused by the combined effects of two types of Mn moments and the anisotropic magnetoresistance of the MRG film. Interestingly, the spontaneous Hall angle of the MRG film is calculated to be ∼2.2\%, which is one order of magnitude larger than those of other 3 d ferromagnets. Therefore, our study demonstrates MRG to be a ferrimagnet with the T comp near room temperature, which enables its potential applications in spintronic devices.},

For the film without the Pt buffer layer, the apparent critical exponent near T N increased suggesting the distribution of T N due to the inhomogeneous strain. The T N value was weakly correlated with the axial ratio c / a and the lattice volume of the Cr 2 O 3 layer V ; T N increases with decreasing c / a or increasing V . The increase in T N by the reduction in c / a (or by increasing V ) implies that the exchange coupling between the nearest neighbor Cr 3+ spins has the significant role in the strain effect.},

The progressive intermixing caused by He + irradiation at the interfaces of the multilayer allows us to tune the saturation magnetostriction value with increasing He + fluences and even to induce a reversal of the sign of the magnetostrictive effect. Additionally, the critical fluence at which the absolute value of the magnetostriction is dramatically reduced is identified. Therefore, insensitivity to strain of the magnetic stack is nearly reached, as required for many applications. All the above-mentioned effects are attributed to the combination of the negative saturation magnetostriction of sputtered Ni and Fe layers and the positive magnetostriction of the Ni x Fe 1− x alloy at the intermixed interfaces, whose contribution is gradually increased with irradiation. Importantly, the irradiation does not alter the layer polycrystalline structure, confirming that post-growth He + ion irradiation is an excellent tool to tune the magneto-elastic properties of multilayer samples. An alternative class of spintronic devices can be envisioned with a material treatment able to arbitrary change the magnetostriction with ion-induced “magnetic patterning.”},

  abstract     = {The effect of orientation on near-field radiative heat transfer between two complex-shaped superellipsoid particles of SiO 2 is presented. The particles under study are 50 nm in radius and of variable concavity. Orientation is characterized by the degree of rotational symmetry in the two-particle systems, and the radiative conductance is calculated using the discrete system Green&#39;s function approach to account for all electromagnetic interactions. The results reveal that the total conductance in some orientations can be up to twice that of other orientations when particles are at a center-of-mass separation distance of 110 nm. Orientation effects are not significantly correlated with system rotational symmetries but are strongly correlated with the minimum vacuum gap distance between particles. As such, orientation effects on near-field radiative heat transfer are a consequence of particle topology, with more extreme topologies leading to a continuation of orientation effects at larger particle center-of-mass separation distances. The concave superellipsoid particles display significant orientation effects up to a center-of-mass separation distance approximately equal to 3.9 times the particle radius, while the convex superellipsoid particles display significant orientation effects up to a center-of-mass separation distance approximately equal to 3.2 times the particle radius. In contrast to previous anisotropic, spheroidal dipole studies, these results of complex-shaped superellipsoid particles suggest that orientation effects become negligible when heat transfer is a volumetric process for all orientations. This work is essential for understanding radiative transport between particles that have non-regular geometries or that may have geometrical defects or abnormalities.},

Understanding the thermal transport behavior of PCF-graphene is of vital importance for determining the reliability of related devices based on it. In this work, the thermal transport in PCF-graphene is systematically studied using the Boltzmann transport theory combined with first-principles calculations. The results show that the room-temperature thermal conductivity of PCF-graphene with only considering three-phonon scattering is as high as 1587.3 W/m K along the zigzag direction, and decreases by 27.1\% (1157.4 W/m K) when including four-phonon scattering, indicating the four-phonon scattering plays a non-negligible role in in thermal transport. Although the thermal conductivity of PCF-graphene is not as large as that in graphene, it still exceeds most common 2D materials and makes it suitable for applications in the thermal management of microelectronics. Analyses of phonon group velocity and phonon scattering rates are conducted to reveal the high thermal conductivity of PCF. Moreover, as the temperature increases to 800 K, the reduction of thermal conductivity is close to 50\% after including four-phonon scattering. The analysis of phonon group velocity and phonon scattering rates are conducted to reveal the underlying mechanism. Our results provide insights for constructing high-thermal-conductivity materials based on 2D carbon allotropes.},

  abstract     = {It is conventionally believed that lattice thermal conductivity ( κ ) decreases with increasing atomic mass (negative atomic-mass correlation), and the high κ can only occur in crystals composed of strongly bonded light elements. By solving the fundamental thermal conductivity equation using first-principles calculations, here we reveal the anomalous κ departing from the long-held concept, that is, a positive atomic-mass correlation and high κ with heavy elements and weakly bonded interaction. We demonstrate this anomalous phenomenon by performing calculations of the cross-plane κ of the layered compounds, i.e., the h-BX family with X = N, P, and As. We find that the anomalous increase in the cross-plane κ with X going from N to As results in the cross-plane/in-plane conductivity ratio, generally expected to be much smaller than 1 in layered compounds, reaching as large as 2.6 at low temperatures. We also find that the unusually high cross-plane κ (660 W m −1 K −1 ), which is comparable to the bulk silicon with strong covalent bonding interactions, can be generated by a weak van der Waals interaction. Our analysis shows that the anomalous κ arises from one-dimensional-like phonons propagating in the cross-plane direction, which is due to the extremely large phonon anisotropy induced by the combined effect of atomic-mass difference and structural anisotropy. This discovery paves an avenue to realize thermally conductive materials that have weakly bonded structures, which can be potentially applied in the design of high-performance nanoelectronic devices.},

  abstract     = {Due to its atomic thickness and insulating nature, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is considered to be one of the most promising substrates and gate insulating materials for two-dimensional electronic devices. In this study, polarized Raman spectroscopy was employed to uncover the effects of polarized incident light on the optical properties of h-BN phonon modes. Our measured polarization-resolved Raman spectra indicate that the symmetrical nature and the broken symmetry of degenerate phonon modes from h-BN are induced by linearly and elliptically polarized light, respectively. Moreover, a helicity exchange was observed between the excitation of circularly polarized light and the resulting opposite circular polarization of scattered light from h-BN. The measured phenomena were modeled on the basis of Raman tensors and Jones calculus to eventually calculate the amplitude coefficients of two orthogonal in-plane phonon modes. Hence, our experimental study provides a holistic understanding of the vibrational modes in h-BN, which is expected to enhance the knowledge of physical mechanisms such as heat capacity and thermal and electrical conductivities of this layered material.},

  abstract     = {Micro-Raman spectroscopy has become an important tool in probing thermophysical properties in functional materials. Localized heating by the focused Raman excitation laser beam can produce both stress and local nonequilibrium phonons in the material. Here, we investigate the effects of hot optical phonons in the Raman spectra of molybdenum disulfide and distinguish them from those caused by thermally induced compressive stress, which causes a Raman frequency blue shift. We use a thermomechanical analysis to correct for this stress effect in the equivalent lattice temperature extracted from the measured Raman peak shift. When the heating Gaussian laser beam is reduced to 0.71 μ m, the corrected peak shift temperature rise is 17\% and 8\%, respectively, higher than those determined from the measured peak shift and linewidth without the stress correction, and 32\% smaller than the optical phonon temperature rise obtained from the anti-Stokes to Stokes intensity ratio. This nonequilibrium between the hot optical phonons and the lattice vanishes as the beam width increases to 1.53 μm. Much less pronounced than those reported in prior micro-Raman measurements of suspended graphene, this observed hot phonon behavior agrees with a first-principles based multitemperature model of overpopulated zone-center optical phonons compared to other optical phonons in the Brillouin zone and acoustic phonons of this prototypical transition metal dichalcogenide. The findings provide detailed insight into the energy relaxation processes in this emerging electronic and optoelectronic material and clarify an important question in micro-Raman measurements of thermal transport in this and other two-dimensional materials.},

At the same time, visibly transparent SiC- and SiO 2 -based metastructures have potential to solve the problem of daytime radiative cooling. Here, as a unique method, we design a bifunctional α-MoO 3 -integrated SiC metasurface for effectively controlling the in-plane propagation direction of α-MoO 3 PhPs. The control is enabled by a topological transition in the PhP dispersion, which is achieved by proper arrangements of the SiC meta-atoms. The proposed functionality of the designed metasurface is beneficial for the mid-infrared in-plane coupling between quantum emitters and heat management. Moreover, the α-MoO 3 – SiC metasurface functions as an efficient visibly transparent daytime radiative cooler.},

The excitonic Urbach edge, when inferred from the low energy tails of the temperature dependent luminescence spectra, is shown to be sensitive to the electron distribution and thermalization. A method to observe the Urbach focus is devised for halide perovskites where the temperature dependence of the excitonic gap is anomalous. The value of the zero-point bandgap renormalization is inferred to be about 33 meV. This small value of the bandgap renormalization rules out the formation of small polarons and points to weak electron–phonon coupling.

Continuous temperature tuning of the wavelength from 27 to 18 μ m is achieved in structures with optimized waveguides. Above 27 μ m, SE clamps at 31 μ m wavelength, where mode leaking is reduced due to the Reststrahlen effect in the GaAs substrate. The operating temperature is mainly limited by the activation of Auger recombination in quasi-equilibrium conditions, while at low temperatures, we expect that lowering initial carrier heating would enhance the gain considerably. We conclude that exploiting the Reststrahlen effect should allow one to achieve continuous wavelength tuning around 30 μ m and operating wavelengths up to 40 μ m with technologically attainable epistructure thickness.},

The core level spectra of Sc 2 p 3/2,1/2 and N 1 s were obtained by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The XPS core levels were shifted by 1.1 eV toward higher values as the [Sc]:[N] ratio varied from 1.4 at 1900 °C to ∼1.0 at 2000 °C due to the higher binding energies in stoichiometric ScN.

  abstract     = {The performance of C 60 semiconducting films is linked to the degree of crystallinity and ordering, properties that strongly depend on the substrate, and growth conditions. Substrate–molecule interactions can be specifically tailored by employing growth templates to achieve a desired thin film structure. However, the presence of a growth template after the film deposition is usually not desirable as it may change the properties of the layer of interest. The ability to remove a growth template without any disruption to the active layer would be highly beneficial. A simple method of template removal by annealing is presented here. A variety of small organic molecules (perfluoropentacene, [6]phenacene, and α -sexithiophene) were used as a growth template to obtain a high-quality well-ordered C 60 thin film. In situ grazing-incidence wide-angle x-ray scattering was employed to study the structural changes of C 60 thin films during template removal. While a slight disturbance of the thin film structure was observed during template removal caused by evaporated molecules from the growth template escaping through the C 60 layer, the disruption is only temporary. When the annealing process is concluded, only the well-ordered C 60 thin film directly on top of SiO 2 is left, which is not achievable without the use of a growth template. Improved crystallinity and grain size of such a thin film, when compared to preparation without a growth template, lead to a significant improvement of the charge carrier mobility. Importantly, template removal prevents the formation of undesired ambipolar transistor characteristics.},

  abstract     = {Traditional sound diffusers are quasi-random phase gratings attached to reflecting surfaces to introduce spatiotemporal incoherence into the backscattered acoustic field. Early designs consisted of periodically tiled diffuser grating unit cells to cover large surfaces. However, spatial periodicity leads to coherent constructive and destructive interference, which is undesirable for achieving acoustic diffusivity. This problem was partially addressed by using aperiodic tiling of unit cells based on pseudorandom sequences. While an aperiodic diffuser spacing can overcome the problems introduced by spatial periodicity, the improvements in performance come at the expense of increased thickness. In this work, we investigate spatiotemporal modulation of the surface acoustic admittance of a metasurface diffuser to improve sound diffusion. Using semi-analytical and finite element models, we demonstrate that the effects of the spatial periodicity can be mitigated without introducing an aperiodic spatial spacing, thus simultaneously minimizing diffuser thickness and improving diffusivity of the backscattered field. We develop a semi-analytical model that employs Fourier series expansion to determine the scattered sound field from a surface admittance consisting of a quadratic residue diffuser whose individual well admittances are modulated in a traveling wave fashion with modulation frequency, ω m ⁠ , amplitude, Y m ⁠ , and a wavenumber that matches the unit cell length, Λ. We observe significant improvement in diffusion due to the fact that the spatiotemporal modulation scatters sound into additional frequency-wavenumber pairs associated with harmonics of ω m and their diffraction orders. The semi-analytical model results are verified using a time-domain finite element model and compared with periodic and aperiodic diffuser designs.},

Metasurface can manipulate electromagnetic waves without using massive transceivers, which makes it possible to realize antenna arrays in a cost-effective way. Here, we propose a strategy of DOA estimations by using a time-domain-coding digital metasurface and a single receiver. Specifically, the incident wave on the metasurface is modulated by the time-domain orthogonal codes impressed on the meta-atoms, and their amplitude and phase distributions are precisely retrieved from the signals detected by the receiver antenna. The effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed strategy are verified by experiments on a two-dimensional metasurface with individually addressable meta-atoms. The strategy features low cost and high flexibility and will facilitate various wireless applications.},

  abstract     = {Reducing fluid frictional drag at the solid–liquid interface is a promising strategy for improving the hydrodynamic properties of the structure in water, though so far it has remained unattainable without robust air cavities. Herein, we report a durable generation strategy of robust air cavity on the rough microstructured surface, which could achieve stable drag reduction even after 2000th water entry test. It is worth noting that the generation strategy is almost independent of the wear of surface microstructure, as the worn microstructures still keep a rough morphology and would alter the capillary driving force and prevent the spreading of the liquid film along the structure body. Therefore, the triple contact line is pinned at the solid–liquid interface and induces the generation of a complete air cavity. Comprehensive evaluation, including the mechanical and chemical stability tests, confirm that the microstructured spheres could produce robust cavities even after harsh destruction, and they also reduce the hydrodynamic drag by more than 70.8\% at a higher Reynolds number of ∼4.9 × 10 4 . Finally, the boundary slip at the solid–liquid interface of the microstructured surface is simulated, which concludes that the decrease in the contact angle at air–liquid interface and fraction of solid–liquid contact area on the wall would enhance the slip length of fluid, thus resulting in an obvious decreasing of frictional resistance at the solid–liquid interface. We believe that the present work provides a perspective on the sustainable construction of the robust cavity which may have important potential application value in the field of drag reduction.},

  abstract     = {Photocathodes with negative electron affinity (NEA) characteristics have various advantages, such as small energy spread, high spin polarization, and ultrashort pulsing. Nitride semiconductors, such as GaN and InGaN, are promising materials for NEA photocathodes because their lifetimes are longer than those of other materials. In order to further prolong the lifetime, it is important to better understand the deterioration of NEA characteristics. The adsorption of residual gases and back-bombardment by ionized residual gases shorten the lifetime. Among the adsorbed residual gases, H 2 O has a significant influence. However, the adsorption structures produced by the reaction with H 2 O are not comprehensively studied so far. In this study, we investigated adsorption structures that deteriorated the NEA characteristics by exposing InGaN and GaAs to an H 2 O environment and discussed the differences in their lifetimes. By comparing the temperature-programmed desorption curves with and without H 2 O exposure, the generation of CsOH was confirmed. The desorption of CsOH demonstrated different photoemission behaviors between InGaN and GaAs results. InGaN recovered its NEA characteristics, whereas GaAs did not. Considering the Cs desorption spectra, it is difficult for an NEA surface on InGaN to change chemically, whereas that for GaAs changes easily. The chemical reactivity of the NEA surface is different for InGaN and GaAs, which contributes to the duration of photoemission. We have attempted to prolong the lifetime of InGaN by recovering its NEA characteristics. We found that InGaN with NEA characteristics can be reused easily without thermal treatment at high temperatures.},

Quantitative dependency of near-field heat flux exchanged by two biased metal–oxide–semiconductor structures on bias voltage is established. The distribution of carrier density and the resultant dielectric function in the semiconductor layer caused by the bias are determined. The corresponding near-field heat flux is calculated using an effective multilayer model. Significant tuning performance is demonstrated, which is due to the increase or decrease in high-frequency surface polariton states induced by the injection or extraction of major carriers.

The process involves two steps: the first step is laser marking, in which a laser is used to mark the origin of the desired domain inversion. The second step is laser induction, in which a laser-induced thermoelectric field is used to invert the domain at the marker site and drive domain growth. The induced thermoelectric field is distributed in three dimensions, which can simultaneously manipulate the domain inversion and growth length of multiple marked sites within a diameter of ∼200 μ m. The length of domain growth is synergistically controlled by the position and intensity of marking and induction, which can exceed 100 μ m. This two-step poling method greatly improves the efficiency of all-optical poling and provides a different suite of tools for tailoring ferroelectric domains.},

Here, we demonstrate a broadly tunable add-drop filter based on a double-disk cavity optomechanical system, side-coupled with a pair of tapered fiber waveguides. We investigate the dependence of the through (drop) efficiency on coupling rates between the cavity and two waveguides by varying cavity-waveguide distances. By optimizing the cavity-waveguide coupling rates, a drop efficiency of 89\% and a transmission of 1.9\% have been achieved. Furthermore, tuning of the ADF is realized by changing the air gap of the double disk using a fiber tip, which is controlled by a piezoelectric nanostage. Benefiting from the large optomechanical coupling coefficient and the mechanical compliance of the double-disk microcavity, a tuning range of 8 nm has been realized using a voltage of 7 V on the piezoelectric nanostage, which is more than one free spectral range of the cavity. As a result, both the through and drop signals can be resonant with any wavelength within the transparent window of the cavity material, which indicates that the ADF is fully reconfigurable.},

  abstract     = {The photon upconversion (UC) is the process that has been known for a long time. Especially, lanthanide-based UC materials recently have attracted huge interest of scientific community due to their narrow visible emission bands upon near-infrared (NIR) excitation. However, the excitation in the high excitation power of NIR can cause highly bright and broad emission (B-UC). Such explosive B-UC was distinct at high excitation condition with UC wavelength encompassing the entire visible range. Previously, the proposed model of B-UC origination includes heat, multi-photon absorption, and accumulated thermal energy transfer. In this article, we will show various experimental and theoretical evidence supporting the idea that B-UC arises from photophysical pathways. Here, the key experimental evidence for photophysical pathways model of B-UC is to measure B-UC in the low-temperature environment (22 K). In addition, the density functional theory was used to regenerate energy levels which would be compared to the absorption spectral bands in Er 2 O 3 . As a result, we are confident of an electron tunneling model from 2 P 3/2 of Er 3+ to oxygen vacancy level (V O ) of Er 2 O 3 . Then, V O electrons are sequentially excited to the conduction band of Er 2 O 3 by energy transfer from 4 F 9/2 of Er 3+ . Finally, the electrons return to the V O of Er 2 O 3 with concomitant B-UC.},

It is of importance to answer the question whether a large number of charge carriers can be promoted to higher energy states to enhance the quantum efficiency of photodetectors. Here, we present an experimental demonstration of an effective Auger recombination process in the photo-excited nano-graphite film. The time-resolved hot carrier thermalization was analyzed based on the energy dissipation via the Auger scattering channels. We split the Auger recombination occurrence centered at 0.40 eV energy state into scattering and recombination parts, for characterizing the scattering rate in the conduction band and the recombination rate toward the valence band. The scattering time with respect to the energy state was extracted as 8 ps · eV −1 , while the recombination time with respect to the energy state was extracted as 24 ps · eV −1 . Our study indicates a 300 fs delay between the hot carrier recombination and generation, leading to a 10 5 ps −1 · cm −3 Auger scattering efficiency. The observed duration for the Auger recombination to generate hot carriers is prolonged for 1 ps, due to the hot carriers energy relaxation bottleneck with optical-phonons in the nano-graphite. The presented analytic expression gives valuable insights into the Auger recombination dynamic to estimate its most efficient energy regime for mid-infrared photodetection.},

In addition to improved multifunctional performance, a miniature integrated system can result in a significant reduction in material costs, processing costs, and packaging costs.

  abstract     = {Differential carrier lifetime measurements were performed on c -plane InGaN/GaN single quantum well (QW) light-emitting diodes (LEDs) of different QW indium compositions as well as with and without doped barriers. Mg-doped p -type and Si-doped n -type barriers close to the QW were used to reduce the net internal electric field in the QW, thereby improving the electron–hole wavefunction overlap on the LEDs. LEDs with doped barriers show short lifetimes and low carrier densities in the active region compared to the reference LEDs. The recombination coefficients in the ABC model were estimated based on the carrier lifetime and quantum efficiency measurements. The improvement in the radiative coefficients in the LEDs with doped barriers coupled with the blueshift of the emission wavelengths indeed indicates an enhancement in wavefunction overlap and a reduction of quantum confined Stark effect as a result of the reduced internal electric field. However, doped barriers also introduce non-radiative recombination centers and thereby increase the Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) coefficient, although the increment is less for LEDs with high indium composition QWs. As a result, at high indium composition (22\%), LEDs with doped barriers outperform the reference LEDs even though the trend is reversed for LEDs with lower indium composition (13.5\%). Despite the trade-off of higher SRH coefficients, doped barriers are shown to be effective in reducing the internal electric field and increasing the recombination coefficients.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we exploit the strong light–matter coupling to hybridize two materials for bifunctionality properties. The strong coupling has been achieved between a surface plasmon and two organic emitters: a J-aggregate cyanine dye, known for its high absorption and emission properties and a photochromic material in which absorption can be optically switched on and off. The optical properties are drastically modified between the activated and deactivated forms of the photochromic material coupled to the cyanine dye. In particular, the emission of the structure can be energy shifted by several hundreds of meV providing a way to build a tunable emission system. This system also reveals its potential for modifying the fluorescence of photochromes thanks to light–matter interaction instead of functionalization using covalent bonding.},

We stabilize the platform in the frequency band from 250 mHz up to 10 Hz in the translational (X, Y) degrees of freedom and achieve a suppression factor of 100 around 1 Hz. Further suppression of ground vibrations was limited by the non-linear response of the piezo actuators of the platform and by its limited range ( ⁠ 5 μ m). In this paper, we discuss the 6D seismometer, its control scheme, and the limitations of the test bed.},

By modifying the free-space decay rate of each qubit, we study the coupling strength between the nanoparticle and the qubits. We find that as the free-space decay rate increases, the decaying Rabi oscillations featured in the qubit population dynamics change to complex non-Markovian dynamical population evolution. This is also reflected on the concurrence, which at weak or moderate light–matter coupling conditions, attains values up to 0.5, while as the coupling conditions become stronger, larger values are also transiently observed. Our findings indicate that graphene nanostructures can provide a platform for the realization of high degree of entanglement in the strong coupling regime at the nanoscale, essential for quantum technology applications.},

The bluff body used in this structure is designed to be available to rotate with respect to the free end of two cantilever beams by the connection of rotatable hinges. A series of performance comparisons are conducted experimentally in a wind tunnel between the proposed structure and the conventional galloping-based piezoelectric energy harvester, which commonly configured with a single beam. The results show that the proposed structure is capable of preventing the variation of the attack angle due to the self-rotation of the bluff body caused by the deflection of a common single beam, thus avoiding the amplitude saturation of the bluff body at a higher wind velocity range. It shows that the output voltage remains a continuous linear increase within elastic deformation range of the cantilever beam even in higher wind velocity range, which is helpful in accomplishing a broad wind range for a significant improvement of the overall performance. Overall, the proposed BNRGH provides a design guidance for a small size galloping-based energy harvester to achieve an excellent output performance, which holds great potential to promote its application in wireless node networks for self-power supply.},

In the present work, Al addition was found to be highly beneficial for improving the thermoelectric properties of Ag 2 Se. In Ag 1.95 Al 0.05 Se, a large enhancement in the charge carrier mobility (1127 cm 2 /V s) is witnessed due to the formation of Se-rich Ag 2 Se 1.02 phase with improved grain connectivity through in situ formed AgAl phase. The synergetic effect of low carrier concentration and enhanced mobility in Al doped samples resulted in a high Seebeck coefficient and high electrical conductivity, leading to a high power factor of 3039 μ W/m K 2 at 300 K. The figure-of-merit of Ag 1.95 Al 0.05 Se was found to be 1.1 at 300 K i.e., 57\% higher than for pure Ag 2 Se. The uni-leg device fabricated using Ag 1.95 Al 0.05 Se with electroplated Ni/Ag contacts showed a conversion efficiency of ∼3.2\% for a temperature difference of 93 K, i.e., comparable to the best reported value for conventional bismuth telluride.},

Here, we systematically investigate the influences of external magnetic field on electrochemical performances of oxide SEs. It reveals that the magnetic field can improve ionic conductivity of SEs and the cycle performance in Li symmetric cells. The enhanced performance is because the magnetohydrodynamics effect can promote diffusion in SEs and homogenize distribution of lithium deposition to avoid the propagation of lithium dendrite. This strategy can be extent to other types of SEs or various energy applications.},

Minimum conversion loss of the fabricated transducer was 2.5 dB at 0.8 GHz, and electromechanical coupling coefficient k t 2 was estimated to be 28.9\%. In contrast to MHz range ultrasonic fingerprint readers such as those based on piezoelectric micromachined ultrasonic transducers using a piezoelectric transducer and ScAlN, a GHz range transducer enables imaging in higher spatial resolution. Furthermore, PTO transducers have a high dielectric constant and electromechanical coupling coefficient k t 2 . A high dielectric constant realizes 50 Ω impedance matching with small electrode area. The small acoustic source is expected to improve the spatial resolution of a fingerprint reader. We achieved the fingerprint imaging by evaluating the acoustic reflectance of the medium/transducer interface. Furthermore, piezostage that allows mechanical movement in the 100 nm order was introduced to image a 12 × 12 μ m 2 area with total of 3600 data points.},

  abstract     = {Vibration energy harvesters that use resonance phenomena exhibit a high output power density for constant frequency vibrations, but they suffer from a significant drop in performance for non-steady-state vibrations, which are important for practical applications. In this work, we demonstrate that the output power under an impulsive force can be increased significantly by placing a U-shaped metal component, called a dynamic magnifier (DM), under an MEMS piezoelectric vibration energy harvester (MEMS-pVEH) with a 6 mm long cantilever using a 3 μ m thick Pb(Zr,Ti)O 3 film. Based on the results of numerical calculations using a model of pVEH with a two-degree-of-freedom (2DOF) system, the DM was designed to have the same resonant frequency as the MEMS-pVEH and a high mechanical quality factor ( ⁠ Q m ⁠ ). The waveforms of the output voltage of the fabricated 2DOF-pVEHs were measured for impulsive forces with various duration times, and the output power was calculated by integrating the waveforms over time. The output power of the MEMS-pVEH placed on the DM with a Q m of 56 showed a gradual change according to the duration of applying an impulsive force and a maximum of 19 nJ/G 2 (G: gravitational acceleration) when the duration of the impulsive force was 3.8 ms. This result was about 90 times greater than the output power of the MEMS-pVEH without a DM. While it is not easy to fabricate pVEHs with a complex 2DOF structure using only the MEMS process, we have demonstrated that the output power can be significantly improved by adding a spring structure to a simple MEMS-pVEH.},

In addition, piezoelectric coefficients | e 31, f | showed a constant value of about 6.5 C m −2 with the increase in applied positive voltages. Relatively high converse | e 31, f | values were obtained at low applied voltages due to an intrinsic piezoelectric effect.

  abstract     = {The spin–orbit torques originating from the spin Hall effect of heavy metals are of vital importance for applications in spintronics due to its low consumption of energy. Theoretical calculations have predicted that 3 d and 4 d light metals can produce a similar amount of torques to heavy metals via the strong orbital Hall effect (OHE). However, few experiments have been conducted since it is technically challenging to directly detect the orbital current from the OHE. Here, we report an effective approach to demonstrate the strong orbital torques in the light metal Cr with the aid of a conversion process from the orbital current to the spin current by introducing an Au interfacial layer in the Cr/ferromagnet structures. A rather large orbital torque efficiency and an increase with the increasing thickness of the Cr-layer are attained in the perpendicularly magnetized Cr/Au/Co/Ti multilayers. Moreover, an energy efficient magnetization switching and the domain wall motion in Cr/Au/Co/Ti multilayers induced by the OHE have also been observed. Our findings confirm the existence of the orbital Hall torques in Cr and provide an effective way to investigate the OHE.},

In this paper, we explore the use of He ion irradiation to enhance single pulse AOS of Co/Gd bilayer-based synthetic ferrimagnets. The intermixing of the constituent magnetic layers by He ion irradiation was both numerically simulated and experimentally verified. We theoretically modeled the effects of intermixing on AOS using the layered microscopic 3-temperature model and found that AOS is enhanced significantly by breaking the pristine Co/Gd interface through intermixing. Following this notion, we studied the threshold fluence of AOS as a function of He ion irradiation fluence. We found that the AOS threshold fluence can be reduced by almost 30\%. Our study reveals the control of AOS by He ion irradiation, which opens up an industrially compatible approach for local AOS engineering.},

Despite the stochastic nature of the DW roughness, the films clearly showed the roughness variation with respect to the DW chirality in balance with the DMI. The present analysis of the DW roughness offers a way to quantitatively determine the DMI-induced effective field as an essential parameter for the stability and dynamic characteristics of chiral DWs.},

In this paper, we investigate the PMA, VCMA, and TMR properties in MTJs with an Ir-doped ultrathin ferromagnetic layer and a LiF/MgO hybrid tunneling barrier. We observed a clear increase in the interfacial PMA by a factor of 2.5 when an ultrathin 0.25 nm LiF layer was inserted. A large VCMA coefficient, exceeding −300 fJ/Vm, was also achieved while maintaining the high TMR ratio and high interfacial PMA.

  abstract     = {The layered solid electrolyte Li 2 ZrCl 6 and Li metal electrodes have a very good contact stability, but the thermal transport properties of Li 2 ZrCl 6 are still unclear. Here, we systematically study the intrinsic lattice thermal conductivity ( κ p ) of Li 2 ZrCl 6 using the machine-learning potential approach based on first-principles calculations combined with the Boltzmann transport theory. The results show that the κ p of Li 2 ZrCl 6 at room temperature is 3.94 W/mK along the in-plane (IP) direction and 1.05 W/mK along the out-plane (OP) direction, which means that the κ p is significantly anisotropic. In addition, under the compressive stress in the OP direction, the κ p evolution along the IP and OP directions exhibits completely different trends, because the stress has a significant regulatory effect on the contribution of optical phonons to κ p . With the increase in stress, the κ p in the IP direction monotonically decreases, while the κ p in the OP direction increases by a factor of 2.2 under a compressive strain of 13\%. This is because the contribution of low-frequency optical phonons to κ p in the IP direction is as high as 58\% when no stress is applied, and this contribution is significantly suppressed with increasing compressive strain. However, the contribution of optical phonons in the OP direction to the κ p increases with the increase in stress. Our results reveal the thermal transport properties of Li 2 ZrCl 6 and the effect of the compressive strain on the κ p of Li 2 ZrCl 6 , thereby providing a reference for the use of Li 2 ZrCl 6 in Li-metal batteries.},

We also show that in-plane biaxial strain can precisely control the nature (indirect or direct) and value of the electronic bandgap. Moreover, the unpaired magnetically active 4 f -electrons reduce the c -direction off-centric distortion of the wurtzite structure, making possible the switching of the ferroelectric polarization.

In this Letter, an effective ohmic contact technique with an in situ SiN x layer inserted between the conventional Ti/Al/Ni/Au metal stack and the III-nitride was proposed and the inside physical mechanisms were investigated for an Al 0.65 Ga 0.35 N/GaN heterostructure. The fabricated ohmic contact has a low R c of 0.17 Ω·mm and a specific contact resistivity value ( ρ c ) of 8.45 × 10 −7 Ω·cm 2 , which is obviously improved compared with the R c of 0.32 Ω·mm and ρ c of 2.84 × 10 −6 Ω·cm 2 without in situ SiN x inserted. The strong temperature dependency of ρ c with in situ SiN x insertion shows that the dominant current transport mechanism is the thermionic field emission. Transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy analyses suggest that the enhanced ohmic contact is due to the possible formation of low-work function silicides and more TiN alloys during annealing.},

  abstract     = {In this Letter, we report the electrical performance improvement of indium oxide (In 2 O 3 ) thin film transistors (TFTs) via a low-temperature CF 4 /N 2 O plasma treatment. It is found that the fluorination via CF 4 /N 2 O plasma can reduce the excessive electrons in the In 2 O 3 channel more effectively compared to the oxidative annealing, providing the same low off-currents at a lower temperature of 200 °C, while the hydrogenation could not give rise to the off-current reduction. The fluorinated In 2 O 3 TFTs with a channel thickness of 3.5 nm, a HfO 2 dielectric thickness of 3.5 nm, and a channel length ranging from 80 nm to 1 μ m demonstrate markedly improved electrical performances, including a high field effect mobility of 72.8 cm 2 /V s, a more positive threshold voltage, a higher on/off current ratio of ∼10 6 , a smaller subthreshold swing below 200 mV/dec, and a higher stability to both negative and positive gate biases. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) confirms the fluorine incorporation in In 2 O 3 /HfO 2 heterojunction upon CF 4 /N 2 O plasma, speculatively passivating the oxygen vacancies and explaining TFT performance enhancement. This study suggests that the anion doping such as fluorine incorporation could be an effective method to improve the performance of oxide semiconductor TFTs with ultrathin channel and dielectric.},

Contrary to previous works, which indicate a phase transition of β -Ga 2 O 3 into the κ polymorph, the β -Ga 2 O 3 structure was found to remain intact throughout except for (i) anisotropic lattice distortions, which are most significant at low levels of irradiation, and (ii) the appearance of additional weak reflections above 2 dpa irradiation.

The multiple ferroelectric polarization switching modulated by the external electric field is well suited to simulate artificial neural synaptic weights. Therefore, ferroelectric diodes&#39; (FDs) synapses have great advantages in building highly reliable and energy-efficient artificial neural networks. In this paper, we demonstrate the FDs synapse, which is based on rare-earth metal-doped BaTiO 3 ferroelectric dielectric layer materials. This performs short-term and long-term synaptic plasticity behaviors by modulating synaptic weights using pulsed stimuli to polarize or flip ferroelectric films. In addition, convolutional neural networks were constructed on the MNIST dataset and the Fashion-MNIST dataset to check the feasibility of the device in simulating bio-visual recognition. The results expand the application of FDs&#39; devices in the intersection of artificial intelligence and bioscience.},

Nevertheless, magnetic membranes that can withstand strong folding and rolling distortions have rarely been reported. Here, we found that the few to tens of nanometer thick LaMnO 3 membranes with single-crystalline qualities exhibit superflexibility, demonstrated by self-folding and rolling into few-micron and sub-micron features. The combined scanning transmission electron microscope and selected area electron diffraction experiments simultaneously confirm the 180° folded single crystalline structure and the associated bending curvature and strain as large as 2 μ m −1 and 4\%. Furthermore, the scanning electron microscope revealed that as the membrane thickness decreases from 40 to 20 nm and 8 nm, the 180° folding is replaced by self-rolling into few-micron size tubes. Magnetization measurements revealed a large saturation (remnant) magnetization enhancement of 21\% (34\%) achieved in a macroscopically forced bending state under a similar bending strain of 4.9\%. This work demonstrates the superflexibility of manganite oxide membranes which promise superior potential in flexible magnetic device applications.},

In this Letter, we investigate hBN-based enhancement and regulation of NFRHT between two monolayer graphene sheets. On the one hand, we predict that adding an intermediate hBN plate can greatly compensate the exponential damping of evanescent waves due to its hyperbolic modes, thus leading to 1.5 times enhancement of the NFRHT without introducing additional thermal source compared to the graphene-graphene system. On the other hand, we find that adjusting the shift frequency of hBN can greatly change the coupling of its hyperbolic modes and graphene surface plasmon polaritons, thus enabling the remarkable thermal regulation with a ratio of 3.5. We hope that our work may facilitate nanoscale thermal management in many-body systems and benefit the comprehension of hBN-based photon tunneling.},

Prior to growing the laser structure, which contains a 35-stage In 0.53 Ga 0.47 As/In 0.52 Al 0.48 As lattice-matched active-core region, a ∼2 μ m-thick nearly fully relaxed InP buffer with strained 1.6 nm-thick InAs quantum-dot-like dislocation-filter layers was grown. A smooth terminal buffer-layer surface, with roughness as low as 0.4 nm on a 10 × 10 μ m 2 scale, was obtained, while the estimated threading-dislocation density was in the mid-range × 10 8 cm −2 . A series of measurements, on lasers grown on InP metamorphic buffer layers (MBLs) and on native InP substrates, were performed for understanding the impact of the buffer-layer&#39;s surface roughness, residual strain, and threading-dislocation density on unipolar devices such as QCLs. As-cleaved devices, grown on InP MBLs, were fabricated as 25 μ m × 3 mm deep-etched ridge guides with lateral current injection. The results are pulsed maximum output power of 1.95 W/facet and a low threshold-current density of 1.86 kA/cm 2 at 293 K. These values are comparable to those obtained from devices grown on InP: 2.09 W/facet and 2.42 kA/cm 2 . This demonstrates the relative insensitivity of the device-performance metrics on high residual threading-dislocation density, and high-performance InP-based QCLs emitting near 8 μ m can be achieved on lattice-mismatched substrates.},

The photonic synapse is the core component of the all-optical neural network module, but the existing photonic synapses based on PCMs require a modulation distance (MD) of several micrometers or even ten micrometers to achieve a large output intensity range. In this paper, we propose an ultra-compact nonvolatile photonic synapse, in which MD can be shortened to 1 μ m, breaking the record of the minimum signal MD of the silicon photonic synapse using the PCMs. At the same time, the output intensity range of our synapse is almost twice that of the existing research. Based on this photonic synapse, we analyze the relationship between the output response and incident wavelength, which can help to design an ultra-compact photonic convolutional neural network.

  abstract     = {Multipactor discharge near an rf window is a key limiting factor in high power microwave systems. In this work, we report special features of dielectric multipactor susceptibility under a Gaussian-type waveform as a function of the rf power density of the transverse rf electric field ( ⁠ P ¯ rf ⁠ ) and normal restoring field ( ⁠ E dc ⁠ ) via particle-in-cell (PIC) and multiple particle Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. The MC simulations show that, for a Gaussian waveform of a half peak width ( ⁠ Δ τ ⁠ ), larger than Δ τ / T = 0.15 with T = 1 ns the rf repetition period, the susceptibility boundary is similar to that of the conventional sinusoidal waveform-driven multipactor, i.e., two inclined lines in the plane of ( ⁠ P ¯ rf , E dc ⁠ ). However, by decreasing Δ τ ⁠ , the susceptibility boundary converts to be a closed curve at Δ τ / T = 0.11 in the plane of ( ⁠ P ¯ rf , E dc ⁠ ) and further shrinks at Δ τ / T = 0.05 ⁠ . PIC simulations with a self-consistent surface and space charge effects also show a reduced E dc with increasing P ¯ rf when P ¯ rf exceeds a critical value, resulting in a closed curve in the plane of ( ⁠ P ¯ rf , E dc ⁠ ), and the maximum time-averaged E dc (multipactor strength) also decreases significantly with further decreasing Δ τ in agreement with MC simulations. Accordingly, the fraction of the rf power density absorbed by the multipactor discharges also decreases nonlinearly with Δ τ from the order of 10 − 2 to 10 − 3 (even 10 − 4 ⁠ ), implying a significant improvement compared to the conventional sinusoidal waveform. The simulations also show that the multipactor susceptibility under a transverse Gaussian-type waveform for different frequencies follows the same scaling law in terms of the ratio of the electric field to the rf repetition rate.},

Despite innovations in adsorbent materials, fundamental understanding of the physical processes involved in the AWH cycle and how material properties impact the theoretical limits of AWH is lacking. Here, we develop a generalized thermodynamic framework to elucidate the interplay between adsorbent properties and operating conditions for optimal AWH performance. Our analysis considers the temperature dependence of adsorption, which is critical but has largely been overlooked in past work. Using metal-organic framework (MOF) as an example, we show that the peak energy efficiencies of single-stage and dual-stage AWH devices, after considering temperature-dependent adsorption, increased by 30\% and 100\%, respectively, compared with previous studies. Moreover, in contrast to common understanding, we show that the adsorption enthalpy of MOFs can also be optimized to further improve the peak energy efficiency by 40\%.

  abstract     = {The Kerr Parametric Oscillator (KPO) is a nonlinear resonator system that is often described as a synthetic two-level system. In the presence of noise, the system switches between two states via a fluctuating trajectory in phase space, instead of following a straight path. The presence of such fluctuating trajectories makes it hard to establish a precise count or even a useful definition, of the “lifetime” of the state. Addressing this issue, we compare several rate counting methods that allow to estimate a lifetime for the levels. In particular, we establish that a peak in the Allan variance of fluctuations can also be used to determine the levels&#39; lifetime. Our work provides a basis for characterizing KPO networks for simulated annealing where an accurate determination of the state lifetime is of fundamental importance.},

  abstract     = {Lithium dendrite (filaments) propagation in solid electrolytes (SEs) leading to short circuits is one of the biggest obstacles to the application of all-solid-state lithium metal batteries. Due to the lack of operando techniques that can provide high resolution, the insufficient knowledge of the lithium dendrite growth inside SEs makes it difficult to suppress the dendrite growth. To reveal the mechanism of the Li filament growth in SEs, we achieved real-time monitoring of the nanoscale Li filament growth by operando small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) in representative Li 6.5 La 3 Zr 1.5 Nb 0.5 O 12 SEs. On continuous plating, the Li filament growth is not simply an accumulation of Li, but there is a dynamic evolution due to the competition between the Li filament growth and self-healing. With the aid of simulations and experiments, this dynamic competition was demonstrated to be highly dependent on temperature variation. The enhanced self-healing ability of Li at elevated temperatures plays a positive role in suppressing the Li filament growth. The heat therapy improved the cell&#39;s cycle life, which provided insight into suppressing the Li filament growth. Operando SANS with high Li sensitivity provides a platform for investigating Li filaments in SEs.},

  abstract     = {Light-sheet microscopes must compromise among field of view, optical sectioning, resolution, and detection efficiency. High-numerical-aperture (NA) detection objective lenses provide higher resolution, but their narrow depth of field inefficiently captures the fluorescence signal generated throughout the thickness of the illumination light sheet when imaging large volumes. Here, we present ExD-SPIM (extended depth-of-field selective-plane illumination microscopy), an improved light-sheet microscopy strategy that solves this limitation by extending the depth of field (DOF) of high-NA detection objectives to match the thickness of the illumination light sheet. This extension of the DOF uses a phase mask to axially stretch the point-spread function of the objective lens while largely preserving lateral resolution. This matching of the detection DOF to the illumination-sheet thickness increases the total fluorescence collection, reduces the background, and improves the overall signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), as shown by numerical simulations, imaging of bead phantoms, and imaging living animals. In comparison to conventional light sheet imaging with low-NA detection that yields equivalent DOF, the results show that ExD-SPIM increases the SNR by more than threefold and dramatically reduces the rate of photobleaching. Compared to conventional high-NA detection, ExD-SPIM improves the signal sensitivity and volumetric coverage of whole-brain activity imaging, increasing the number of detected neurons by over a third.},

  abstract     = {Transparent conductive electrodes are essential in the application of flexible electronics. In this work, we successfully demonstrated a novel strategy for improving mechanical/electrical properties of indium tin oxide (ITO)-free flexible silver nanowire (Ag NW) thin films. To reduce the contact resistance of Ag NWs, an ethanol-mist was used to weld the cross junction of wires at room temperature. The nano-welded Ag NWs (W-Ag NWs) were then coated with an aluminum-doped ZnO (AZO) solution, which significantly reduce the roughness of the Ag NW thin film. Finally, an ultrathin SbO x thin film of 2 nm was deposited on the film surface using a water-free low-temperature atomic layer deposition technique to protect the W-Ag NW/AZO layer from water or oxygen degradation. The treated Ag NWs have a high transmittance of 87\% and a low sheet resistance of about 15 Ω/sq, which is comparable with the ITO electrode&#39;s property. After 1000 cycles of bending testing, the W-Ag NW/AZO/SbO x film practically retains its initial conductivity. Furthermore, the samples were immersed in a solution with pH values ranging from 3 to 13 for 5 min. When compared to untreated Ag NWs or those coated with AlO x thin films, W-Ag NW/AZO/SbO x had superior electrical stability. The W-Ag NW/AZO/SbO x layer was integrated as a gate electrode on low-power operating flexible Ti-ZnO thin film transistors (TFTs). The 5\% Ti-ZnO TFT has a field-effect mobility of 19.7 cm 2 V s −1 , an I on / I off ratio of 10 7 , and a subthreshold swing of 147 mV decade −1 .},

  abstract     = {A solar thermophotovoltaic (STPV) system can transform incident concentrated solar energy into electrical energy with an efficiency that could be higher than the Shockley–Queisser limit. Near-field thermophotovoltaic (NF-TPV) devices can generate larger electrical power output than traditional far-field TPV devices with the aid of photon tunneling. Moreover, multi-junction PV cells can boost the performance of TPV devices by effectively distributing the absorbed photon energy inside the PV cell. In this work, we design a multi-junction-based near-field STPV system with a practical and high-temperature stable graphite intermediate structure. To optimize the system configuration, we employ a genetic algorithm and a surrogate model based on an artificial neural network, which enables us to suggest a better design approach for the multi-junction-based NF-STPV system between the power output density and power conversion efficiency maximization scenarios. When the concentration factor of the incident solar energy is 5000 and the absorber-to-emitter area ratio is 3, we can achieve a system efficiency of 23\%. By introducing a material whose emissivity is as high as a blackbody on the solar absorber, the system efficiency can be further enhanced up to 35\%.},

Furthermore, the 1/ f noise variation of the FEFETs is much larger in the program state than that in the erase state. It is revealed that the change in the number of electrons trapped at the FE/dielectric interface and oxygen vacancy in each program operation is the main reason for the variability of the FEFET in program operation.

PZT/Pt/TiO 2 /SiO 2 /Si stacks with 2.0 μ m thick {100} oriented PZT films at the morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) showed a characteristic strength of 1137 MPa, and the film thickness served as the limiting flaw size for failure of the film/substrate stack. In contrast, for Zr/Ti ratios of 40/60 and 30/70, the characteristic stack strength increased while the Weibull modulus decreased to values typical for that of Si. This difference is believed to be due to toughening from ferroelasticity or phase switching. X-ray diffraction showed that the volume fraction of c-domains increased in Ti-rich compositions. This would allow for more switching from c to a-domains under biaxial tensile stress. Zr/Ti concentration gradients were present for all compositions, which contributed to the observation of a rhombohedral phase off the MPB. Due to the reduced tendency toward cracking, off-MPB compositions are potentially of interest in actuators, albeit with the trade-off of needing a high actuation voltage.},

Self-heating is then tracked as a function of vibration velocity to determine the upper bound for the drive levels. However, the literature is limited concerning self-heating in thin film piezoMEMS. In this work, it is shown that self-heating in piezoMEMS transducer arrays occurs due to domain wall motion and Ohmic losses. This was demonstrated via a systematic study of drive waveform dependence of self-heating in piezoMEMS arrays. In particular, the magnitude of self-heating was quantified as a function of different waveform parameters (e.g., amplitude, DC offset, and frequency). Thermal modeling of the self-heating of piezoMEMS using the measured hysteresis loss from electrical characterization as the heat source was found to be in excellent agreement with the experimental data. The self-heating model allows improved thermal design of piezoMEMS and can, furthermore, be utilized for functional heating, especially for device level poling.},

The origin of piezoelectric enhancement is investigated by considering the formation of polarization domain structures and their behaviors under strain. Although a ferroelectric tetragonal phase or a paraelectric cubic phase primarily form in homogeneous Ba 1− x Sr x TiO 3 ferroelectrics with a different content x , interestingly, an unusual ferroelectric monoclinic phase can be formed in compositionally graded ferroelectrics, giving rise to the coexistence of multiple phases. The monoclinic phase emerges as a result of the process that reduces built-in electric potential induced by a large gradient of polarization. In turn, the formation of the monoclinic phase gives rise to transient zones that make the polarization field more susceptible to external strains, thereby enhancing the piezoelectric response. We further demonstrate that the piezoelectric enhancement strongly depends on the volume fraction of the monoclinic phase in compositionally graded ferroelectrics, suggesting a route for the rational design of polarization domains and piezoelectric effects.},

Here, in situ electric-field high-energy x-ray diffraction measurements are performed to investigate the polycrystalline barium calcium titanate hardened by precipitation, a recently developed hardening technique that pins domain walls with fine intragranular precipitates. The effect of precipitates on extrinsic and intrinsic mechanisms is examined. Under a low-frequency and large-signal field, the precipitates suppress non-180° wall motion, which is the major source of loss, by 40\%. Anisotropy is observed in the field-induced lattice strain, which is dominantly contributed by an intergranular effect instead of pure piezoelectricity. At small fields, the lattice strain is barely affected by precipitates, while both lattice strain and strain from non-180° domain wall motion are suppressed and are coupled with each other at large fields, leading to an unchanged relative percentage of the extrinsic contribution.},

For high Nb doping levels, (1) superoxidation of the PZT film surface makes the PZT/Pt interface more p-type and, hence reduces electron injection over the Schottky barrier, (2) the bulk charge transport mechanism changes from electron trapping by Ti 4+ to hole migration between lead vacancies, and (3) the ionic conductivity due to migration of oxygen vacancies decreases. For ≤ 6 mol .\% Nb, electrical degradation was controlled via field-induced accumulation of oxygen vacancies near the cathode, which, in turn, leads to Schottky barrier lowering and electron trapping by Ti 4+ . In phase pure 13 mol.\% Nb doped PZT films, on the other hand, the increase in the leakage current during electrical degradation was dominated by hole migration between lead vacancies ( ⁠ 2 [ V P b ″ ] ∼ [ h • ] ) ⁠ . A much lower lifetime and drastic increase in the leakage current upon electrical degradation was observed in mixed phase PNZT films, which was attributed to (1) a more electrically conductive pyrochlore phase and (2) a high concentration of lead vacancies.},

  abstract     = {The reliability of piezoelectric thin films is crucial for piezoelectric micro-electromechanical system applications. The understanding of resistance degradation in piezoelectric thin films requires knowledge about point defects. Here, we show the resistance degradation mechanism in the lead-free alternative sodium potassium niobate (KNN) thin films and the relationship to point defects in both field-up and field-down polarities. The conduction mechanism of KNN thin films is found to be Schottky-limited. Furthermore, a reduction in Schottky barrier height accompanies the resistance degradation resulting from interfacial accumulation of additional charged defects. We use thermally stimulated depolarization current measurements and charge-based deep level transient spectroscopy to characterize the defects in KNN thin films. Our results show that oxygen vacancies accumulate at the interface in field-up polarity, and multiple defects accumulate in field-down polarity, potentially oxygen vacancies and holes trapped by potassium vacancies. We use wafer deposition variation to create samples with different film properties. Measurement results from these samples correlate resistance degradation with the defect concentration. We find the natural logarithm of leakage current to be linearly proportional to the defect concentration to the power of 0.25. The demonstrated analysis provides a precise and meaningful process assessment for optimizing KNN thin films.},

  abstract     = {Magnetorheological fluids (MRFs) are composed of magnetic particles and carrier liquid that yield stress responses to the external magnetic field, a phenomenon called the magnetorheological effect. In this work, the attenuation of magneto-induced yield stress in an MRF caused by magnetic carrier liquid was observed. Compared with that of MRFs with nonmagnetic carrier liquid, the average critical strain was correspondingly increased by 53.17\%, and the maximum dynamic and static yield stress were reduced by 12.98\% and 13.58\%, respectively. The attenuation was attributed to the magnetic carrier liquid shunting more magnetic flux density than the nonmagnetic fluid, thus decreasing the magnetization of the magnetic particles. The weakened electromagnetic interaction between particles reduced the strength of the particle chains under the magnetic field, thereby reducing the magneto-induced yield stress. A theoretical model based on the magnetism characterization in the relative permeability of carrier liquid was proposed to explain the attenuation of the electromagnetic force for particles. A physics model of magneto-mechanical coupling was simulated in COMSOL to reveal the attenuation phenomenon. Compared with that when the nonmagnetic carrier liquid with relative permeability of 1 was used, the electromagnetic force in the calculation curves was increased by 26.94 times and decreased by 99.95\% when the relative permeability was 0.1 and 10 000, respectively.

The preferential direction of motion of the Josephson vortices is due to the asymmetry-induced ratchet effect and has a dramatic impact: for a particular positive dc bias current I when the flux-flow is robust multiple pronounced Shapiro-steps are observed consistent with a coherent operation of the array. This suggests an efficient emission/detection of MW in related applications. In contrast, when we reverse the direction of I , the flux-flow is reduced and the Shapiro steps are strongly suppressed due to a highly incoherent operation that suggests an inefficient emission/detection of MW. Remarkably, by changing B slightly, the situation is reversed: Shapiro steps are now suppressed for a positive I while well pronounced for a reverse current − I . Our results suggest that a preferential vortex-flow has a very significant impact on the coherent MW operation of superconducting devices consisting of either multiple JJs or an asymmetrically biased single long JJ. This is particularly relevant in the case of flux-flow oscillators for sub-terahertz integrated-receivers, flux-driven Josephson (travelling-wave) parametric amplifiers, or on-chip superconducting MW generators, which usually operate at bias currents in the Shapiro step region.},

  abstract     = {The magnetic ground state of LaMnO 3 (LMO) thin film is still a controversial issue, even though various mechanisms, such as cation/anion non-stoichiometry, epitaxial strain, interfacial charge reconstruction, and orbital ordering, have been proposed. Here, exchange bias (EB) was introduced into a high-quality epitaxial LMO thin film via relatively low oxygen growth pressure. The EB in LMO was modulated by +2 V gating via ionic liquid method with increased EB field ( H EB ), coercivity ( H C ), blocking temperature ( T B ), and reduced ferromagnetic (FM) magnetization. However, the −2 V gating has a much weaker tunability. By investigating the change of structure, surface morphology, and Mn oxidation state in LMO thin films, the modulation of magnetic properties is attributed to the creation/annihilation of oxygen vacancy in an LMO thin film. The suppressed FM phase in LMO can be ascribed to reduced Mn valence, structure disorders, and structure transition. However, the enriched antiferromagnetic phase results from the transition of the pseudocubic structure to the distorted orthorhombic structure. This work not only highlights the importance of functional defects in perovskite oxides but also sheds light on the potential of electric-field modulation of magnetism in spintronic devices.},

In this study, a large AMR of −18\% at a very low magnetic field of 0.2 T is observed in a soft magnetic Weyl semimetal EuB 6 based on the characteristics of both high magnetization and large magnetoresistance. Furthermore, the intrinsic antisymmetric AMR and PHE are unambiguously observed and interpreted as the modification in conductivity owing to the Berry curvature in a tilted Weyl system instead of the out-of-plane magnetic field component. Our study provides a strategy for low-magnetic-field applications of large AMR and enriches the transport physics of spintronic devices.},

A Fe(1) split site is an important structural characteristic of Fe 5 GeTe 2 , which makes it very different from other Fe n GeTe 2 ( n = 3 and 4) systems. The local atomic disorder and short-range order can be induced by the split site. In this work, high-quality van der Waals ferromagnet Fe 5 GeTe 2 single crystals were grown to study low-temperature transport properties. We found a resistivity upturn below 10 K. The temperature and magnetic field dependence of the resistivity are in good agreement with a combination of the theory of disorder-enhanced three-dimensional electron–electron and single-channel Kondo effect. The Kondo effect exists only at low magnetic fields B &lt; 3 T ⁠ , while electron–electron interaction dominates the appearance for the low-temperature resistivity upturn. We believe that the enhanced three-dimensional electron–electron interaction in this system is induced by the local atomic structural disorder due to the split site of Fe(1).

  abstract     = {CrSBr monolayer is a promising ferromagnetic (FM) semiconductor with stable magnetic ground state, large bandgap, and high carrier density. However, its Curie temperature ( T C ) of about 146 K is still below room temperature. Herein, electronic and magnetic properties of a CrSBr/MoTe 2 heterostructure are explored to boost the T C via the proximity effect using first-principles calculations. The long-range FM ordering in the CrSBr layer is enhanced both through an extra spin superexchange channel (Cr–Te–Cr) afforded by the MoTe 2 substrate and the reduced degeneracy t 2 g orbitals of Cr atoms. Directly owing to the enhanced FM coupling, T C increases to 225 K. The strong p–d hybridizations increase the interorbital hopping between the t 2 g states through the Cr–Te–Cr superexchange channel. The hopping is related to the off diagonal matrix element of the velocity operator, which suggests that is necessary for not only the increased T C but also the nonzero Berry curvature. Additionally, the Fermi level ( E F ) is pushed into higher energy levels with the electron-doped CrSBr layer due to the charge transfer. The synergic effect of the E F shift from the transferred electron filling and the interorbital hopping from the Cr–Te interaction results in nonzero anomalous Hall conductivity in the heterostructure. Our work reveals that an interface is an uplifting way for engineering the magnetic and transport properties of 2D magnets, providing opportunities for fantastic spintronic devices.},

To address this challenge, we propose a clockless skyrmion logic gate that can be implemented into large-scale computing networks without skyrmions synchronization. The clockless operations are achieved in a cross-shaped skyrmion track based on the skyrmion gating method with the aid of the voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy gate. A complete set of Boolean operations and a cascaded full adder can be realized through the different combinations of inputs and interconnections of these logic gates.

Moreover, the small hysteresis voltage extracted from the C–V curves exhibits low trapped charge density in the La 2 O 3 layer.

  abstract     = {This work reports the quantification of rise in channel temperature due to self-heating in two-terminal SrSnO 3 thin film devices under electrical bias. Using pulsed current–voltage (I–V) measurements, thermal resistances of the thin films were determined by extracting the relationship between the channel temperature and the dissipated power. For a 26-nm-thick n-doped SrSnO 3 channel with an area of 200 μ m 2 , a thermal resistance of 260.1 ± 24.5 K mm/W was obtained. For a modest dissipated power of 0.5 W/mm, the channel temperature rose to ∼176 °C, a value which increases further at higher power levels. Electro-thermal simulations were performed which showed close agreement between the simulated and experimental I–V characteristics both in the absence and presence of self-heating. The work presented is critical for the development of perovskite-based high-power electronic devices.},

Here, we report the electrical transport study of a ferromagnetic kagome-lattice material Nd 3 Al, which is predicted to be a magnetic topological high symmetry line metal candidate. We observed a polarity reversal of ordinary Hall resistivity across 40 K, plainly indicating a perceptible shift in chemical potential and change of the Fermi surface, i.e., temperature-induced Lifshitz transition. More strikingly, as the shifting of Fermi level around the band (anti-)crossing points contributes to a considerable Berry curvature, the anomalous Hall conductivity ultimately stabilizes to a constant of approximately ∼427 Ω − 1 cm −1 below 40 K, accompanied by a maximum anomalous Hall angle reaching 1.4\%, conforming to the intrinsic dissipationless topological Berry-phase mechanism. The similar scaling behavior of anomalous Hall conductivity in Nd 3 Al to that of magnetic Weyl semimetal Co 3 Sn 2 S 2 further signals the possible presence of nontrivial topological bands in kagome Nd 3 Al. In view of the kagome-lattice structure and predicted topological nature, our work unveils the significant potential of the large intrinsic anomalous Hall effect in Nd 3 Al for investing the interaction between ferromagnetism and topology.},

However, the majority of bcc HEAs show limited room temperature ductility even in compression. In addition to the compressive properties of as-cast high-activation bcc HEAs collected from the literature, those of low-activation ones were investigated by phase diagram calculations and experiments. Therefore, a consistent dataset comprising 93 samples was generated. A classification and regression tree (CART) algorithm was employed to differentiate the target bcc HEAs with a compressive failure strain of more than 50\% from the others. The model generality of a finalized CART classifier was validated by training and testing F1 scores and accuracies. It was found that Pugh&#39;s ratio ( κ ) and valence electron concentration ( VEC ) are two key attributes to identify the target alloys. The crucial κ - VEC feature space displays that the targets are generally located in the region where κ is larger than 3.129 or VEC is larger than 6.296. Especially, high-activation and low-activation samples seem to have opposite characteristics, motivating the further study of a deformation mechanism for low-activation bcc HEAs.},

SRS of pure sulfuric acid has only one vibrational characteristic peak. Mixing sulfuric acid with water leads to the appearance of bisulfate, and the energy transfer between adjacent vibrational energy levels in a 17.0 mol/l aqueous sulfuric acid solution leads to generation of five different vibrational modes in a solution. The competition between these five SRS modes prevents the vibrational energy from being transferred to high-order Stokes waves, thereby locking most of the energy in the first-order Stokes SRS and outputting a very strong, broadband, and coherent Raman radiation ranging from 555 to 570 nm. This study demonstrates the possibility of producing an intense single longitudinal mode laser.},

In this study, we demonstrate the hybrid integration of a silicon nitride grating structure on a single-crystal diamond by utilizing transfer printing. This approach allows the implementation of the nanostructure in diamond using a simple pick-and-place assembly, facilitating diamond-based quantum applications without any complicated diamond nanofabrication.

Unlike the Ag PMDA filters, whose transmission dip at resonance wavelengths gradually decreased with increasing temperature, the Ta PMDA filters revealed almost the same transmission spectra even after annealing at 700 °C for 30 min. The Ta-based MIR PMDA filter exhibited similar optical properties to those of the Ag PMDA.

The method is based on the thermal analyses of the charge-current-induced temperature distribution generated by the Peltier effect at the first harmonic and by Joule heating at the second harmonic, measured with an infrared camera. This allows simultaneous estimation of the thermal diffusivity, thermal conductivity, volumetric heat capacity, and Peltier/Seebeck coefficient of conductors without attaching an external heater. The thermal analysis developed here is applicable to a system with the interfacial thermal resistance between the target conductor and reference material. Our method enables the measurements while applying an external magnetic field, opening the way for investigating the magnetic field and/or magnetization dependences of the figures of merit and associated properties for the magneto-thermoelectric effects. We demonstrate the usability of this method by estimating the figures of merit for the Peltier/Seebeck, magneto-Peltier/Seebeck, and Ettingshausen/Nernst effects in a Bi–Sb alloy as a promising material for thermoelectric applications. The multi-harmonic thermal analysis method will, thus, aid in developing highly efficient thermoelectric materials and further investigations of magneto-thermal and magneto-thermoelectric transport properties.},

  abstract     = {The monosulfides of the pyrrhotite omission series ( ⁠ Fe 1 − x S , 0 &lt; x ≤ 0.125 ⁠ ) are important remanence carriers for paleomagnetic reconstruction of the Earth&#39;s crust and extraterrestrial materials. The ferrimagnetic Fe 7 S 8 polytypes are the endmembers, and their stacking modulations of full and vacant layers generate different magnetic anisotropy properties due to the cation-vacancy configurations. In this study, intergrown long-range ordered polytypes with four- and threefold modulation, i.e., 4C and 3C pyrrhotite, were prepared in a diffusion-driven process by quenching of a natural pyrrhotite crystal with randomized vacancies. In addition, a third constituent with coherence lengths of a few nanometers, denoted 3C * , was found that exhibits spin-glass behavior at about 10 K due to local magnetic anisotropies arising from vacancy-density variations. The concomitant occurrence of this nano-scale constituent with spin disorder and the long-range ordered polytypes indicate competitive diffusion-driven processes during Fe 7 S 8 formation. Such information provides insight into the provenance and genesis of ferrimagnetic pyrrhotite in Earth and extraterrestrial systems and in a broader sense into vacancy-induced materials.},

  abstract     = {DNA electronics has reattracted great interest in recent years and showed a number of fascinating phenomena. Here, we present a theoretical study of electron transport through a two-terminal circular DNA junction under a perpendicular magnetic field. Our results indicate that this circular DNA exhibits Aharonov–Bohm-like effects and a semiconductor–insulator–semiconductor transition by tuning this magnetic field, with the transmission spectrum nearly oscillating periodically. Interestingly, Fano resonances appear around integer multiples of the magnetic flux quantum accompanied by several vortices of local currents. Moreover, the circular DNA behaves as a nanoscale switch, and this switching effect is robust and could be improved for longer molecular length and weaker molecule–electrode coupling, with the on/off ratio exceeding 10 4 for long circular DNA. These results may help for designing novel circular DNA-based molecular devices.},

  abstract     = {Electrospray devices, such as ionic liquid ion sources, often exhibit glows during operation in high vacuum facilities. The lack of electron excitation mechanisms during electrospray operation prompts the question: “What causes glow in an electrospray device?” Our optical emission spectroscopy results show that electrospray glow exhibits a broad spectral response between 350 and 800 nm with emission lines corresponding to atomic metal constituents of impinged surfaces, neutral and ionized atomic constituents of the ionic liquid propellant, and molecular line shapes that may also be dissociation products of the ionic liquid. We have previously defined secondary species emission to describe the many complex interfacial phenomena that occur when electrosprayed species impact surfaces downstream of the emitter. Our analysis of the optical emission spectra shows that these glows are only possible in the presence of secondary species emission. Therefore, the answer to the proposed question: high-velocity impacts that generate secondary species are the root cause of glow for electrosprays in high vacuum facilities.},

  abstract     = {The humidity-sensitive electrolytes necessitate the stringent conditions of lithium battery manufacturing and, thus, increase the fabrication complexity and cost. We herein report a water-tolerant solid polymer electrolyte (WT-SPE) with high Li + conductivity (2.08 × 10 −4 S cm −1 at room temperature) and electrochemically stable window (up to 4.7 V vs Li/Li + ), which utilizes moisture to initiate rapid polymerization and form dense structures to achieve a facile battery manufacturing in humid air without the need of a glovebox. Molecular dynamics simulations attribute this hydrophobic behavior to the hindered transfer of a water molecule in dense WT-SPE. A stable SEI layer composed of a polymeric framework and other organic/inorganic small molecular compounds contributes to the sustainable operation of batteries. As a result, the Li|WT-SPE|LiCoO 2 cells manufactured in the air exhibit a high initial capacity of 192 mA h g −1 at 0.1C and an excellent capacity retention for 300 cycles at 1C. The great advantage significantly simplifies the battery assembly process in air environment and can also maintain good interfacial contact between an electrolyte and electrodes thanks to in situ initiated polymerization, which shows great superiority and promise in the alternatives of traditional liquid and polymer electrolytes for low-cost and facile fabrication of batteries in ambient atmosphere.},

Scanning x-ray nanodiffraction enables imaging of local structural distortions across an extended spatial region of thin samples. Yet, localized lattice distortions remain challenging to detect and localize using nanodiffraction, due to their weak diffuse scattering. Here, we apply an unsupervised machine learning clustering algorithm to isolate the low-intensity diffuse scattering in as-grown and alkaline-treated thin epitaxially strained SrIrO 3 films. We pinpoint the defect locations, find additional strain variation in the morphology of electrochemically cycled SrIrO 3 , and interpret the defect type by analyzing the diffraction profile through clustering. Our findings demonstrate the use of a machine learning clustering algorithm for identifying and characterizing hard-to-find crystallographic defects in thin films of electrocatalysts and highlight the potential to study electrochemical reactions at defect sites in operando experiments.},

The fast and homogeneous ion transport to achieve even lithium plating is challenging but still remains elusive. Improving the single conduction of ions or electrons is not enough to achieve dendrite-free and long life Li–metal composite electrodes. Herein, we use in situ lithiation and electroplating methods to construct an effective mixed electron–ion percolation network composite anode. The mixed ion–electron conductive framework can build a stable interface that provides nucleation sites for Li plating. At the same time, the 3D percolation network composed of 3D nanosheets can facilitate the fast transport of ions and electrons, enabling uniform lithium plating inside the skeleton. As a result, the composite anodes exhibit a stable dendrite-free Li stripping/plating process with low overpotential. Furthermore, the full cell using the composite anode coupled with the LiFePO 4 cathode displays high cycle stability with a capacity retention rate of about 100\% after 500 cycles. The present strategy of the mixed ion–electron conductive skeleton could further promote the development of the next-generation lithium metal anode.},

  abstract     = {Structured illumination microscopy (SIM), with the advantages of full-field imaging and low photo-damage, is one of the most well-established fluorescence super-resolution microscopy techniques that raised great interest in biological sciences. However, conventional SIM techniques generally require at least nine images for image reconstruction, and the quality of super-resolution significantly depends on high-accuracy illumination parameter estimation, which is usually computationally intense and time-consuming. To address these issues, we propose a robust seven-frame SIM reconstruction algorithm with accelerated correlation-enabled parameter estimation. First, a modulation-assigned spatial filter is employed to remove unreliable backgrounds associated with low signal-to-noise ratios. Then, we propose a coarse-to-fine accelerated correlation algorithm to eliminate the redundant iterations of the traditional correlation-based scheme. The frame reduction is achieved by a specially designed phase-shifting strategy combined with pixel-wise fluorescence pre-calibration. We experimentally demonstrate that, compared with conventional iterative correlation-based methods, the proposed algorithm improves the computational efficiency by a factor of 4.5 while maintaining high accuracy illumination parameter estimation. Meanwhile, our method achieves high-quality super-resolution reconstruction even with a reduction in two raw images, which improves the efficiency of image acquisition and ensures the robustness toward complex experimental environments.},

It suggests that both the hole insufficiency and hole trapping are generated during the reverse gate pulse bias. With proper selection of the delay time based on the pulsed characterizations, the hole detrapping can be effectively evaluated after the hole recovery is completed. In addition, by subtracting the trapping behavior caused by the measurement condition, the actual detrapping transient under reverse gate filling voltages can be obtained with the current-transient method. Three traps have been observed with the energy levels of 0.484, 0.390, and 0.235 eV.

Furthermore, with the increase in the Mg content, the linear EO response enhances significantly. In particular, the derived effective EO coefficient r c of the Zn 0.72 Mg 0.28 O thin film is (7.6 ± 0.2) pm/V, which is over three times larger than the reported values for ZnO-based thin films and over twice larger than that of ZnO single crystals.

Here, a phase-field model is developed to simulate the tunability of Young&#39;s modulus of freestanding Ba 1− x Sr x TiO 3 membranes under mechanical bending. It is demonstrated that the bended membrane shows a uniform Young&#39;s modulus compared with unbended membrane. By increasing the bending angle, Young&#39;s modulus tunability is enhanced, which can be attributed to the vortex-like domain structures induced by the mechanical bending. These vortex-like domains with large domain wall energy inhibit the subsequent domain switching under externally applied tensile strain and reduce the eigenstrain variation, which leads to a large Young&#39;s modulus. In addition, the formation of vortex domain structure is suppressed with increasing Sr 2+ content in Ba 1− x Sr x TiO 3 membranes at the same bending degree, resulting in a decrease in Young&#39;s modulus tunability. Our work reveals that the tunability of Young&#39;s modulus of freestanding ferroelectric membranes can be achieved by mechanical bending, which provides guidance for designing flexible electronic devices.},

For a superconducting quantum processor, which operates in the microwave band, the single-qubit gates are usually realized with microwave driving. The crosstalk between microwave pulses is a non-negligible error source. In this article, we propose an error mitigation scheme to address this crosstalk issue for single-qubit gates. There are three steps in our method. First, by controlling the detuning between qubits, the microwave induced classical crosstalk error can be constrained within the computational subspace. Second, by applying the general decomposition procedure, the arbitrary single-qubit gate can be decomposed as a sequence of X and virtual Z gates. Finally, by optimizing the parameters in virtual Z gates, the error constrained in the computational space can be corrected. Using our method, no additional compensation signals are needed, arbitrary single-qubit gate time will not be prolonged, and the circuit depth containing simultaneous single-qubit gates will also not increase. The simulation results show that, in a specific regime of qubit–qubit detuning, the infidelities of simultaneous single-qubit gates can be as low as that without microwave crosstalk.},

  abstract     = {Optics and, more recently, coherent matter waves enabled inertial sensors, such as accelerometers and gyroscopes, to reach high levels of resolution and sensitivity. As these technologies rest on physical phenomena that require particular setups and working conditions, e.g., kilometers of optical fibers or ultralow temperatures, their application range is limited because of lack of portability. Here, we propose a path forward considering a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) to detect and measure acceleration by using electronic interferometry. The basic idea is not to use a SQUID as a magnetometer in acceleration measurement setups, but as an accelerometer. The operation of such an accelerometer rests on the ability of the Cooper pairs to record their wave function phase change, as the device is subjected either to a transverse acceleration or vibrations. We provide numerical evidence for the feasibility of SQUID-based accelerometers that can be used for transverse acceleration and oscillatory motion measurement.},

Modification of the spin–orbit coupling strength by altering the hybridization of Ru-4d and O-2p orbitals in SrRuO 3 leads to a clear evolution of the magnetocrystalline anisotropy from multiaxial to strongly out-of-plane, as manifested in the magneto-transport studies.

In the superionic phase, the structural model with Cu ions occupying the Wyckoff sites of 8 c and 32 f provides the best description of the structure. As the content of Cu increasing in Cu 2 − δ Se, the Cu occupancy increases on the 32 f site but decreases on the 8 c site. Fitting to the quasi-elastic neutron scattering spectra reveals two diffusion modes: the localized diffusion between the 8 c and 32 f sites and the long-range diffusion between the adjacent 8 c sites using the 32 f site as a bypass. Between 430 and 650 K, we measured that the compound with more Cu content exhibits a larger long-range diffusion coefficient. Temperature in this range does not affect the long-range diffusion process obviously. Our results suggest the two diffusion modes cooperative and, thus, provide a microscopic understanding of the ionic diffusion of the Cu ions in superionic Cu 2 − δ Se.},

However, compact and broadband terahertz (THz) components for asymmetric applications are still scarce. Here, we demonstrate broadband, ultrathin, and efficient metasurface-based asymmetric transmission and wavefront manipulation in the THz region. The metasurface consists of tri-layer metallic structures separated by two flexible polyimide dielectrics. This ultrathin structure exhibits superior asymmetric response which can act as an efficient device with a high linear polarization conversion ratio over 0.9 ranging from 0.5 to 1.1 THz. We also develop THz asymmetric applications based on the flexible metasurface for beam deflector and orbital angular momentum generation. The THz time-domain spectroscopy system and spectral imaging system are used to characterize the broadband asymmetric properties. The experimental results confirm that the beam deflection and vortex waves can be realized over broadband under one linearly polarized incidence while blocked under its orthogonal incidence. This work may provide a promising route to achieve broadband asymmetric applications in information encryption, THz wireless communication, and spectroscopy applications.},

  abstract     = {Solid-state batteries (SSBs) are an ideal next-generation energy storage system due to their safety and high energy density. However, many interfacial problems, such as high interfacial resistance and poor compatibility between electrodes and electrolytes, limit the development of SSBs. In this study, an ultrathin interfacial layer composed of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and ethylene carbonate (EC) are in situ fabricated on the surface of electrodes, integrating ceramic/polymer composite electrolyte and electrodes and reducing the interfacial impedance. Meanwhile, the excellent chemical compatibility between PEO and lithium metal effectively improves the interfacial stability. Also, the modification of the interfacial layer leads to more F - participation in the formation of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), and the relative content of LiF, Li 3 N, and other by-products increases, which facilitates the formation of dense and stable SEI, thus inhibiting the growth of dendritic lithium and improving the ionic conductivity. With the interfacial layer, a highly stable interface against Li is maintained for more than 1400 h at a current density of 0.1 mA cm −2 . A solid-state battery with LiNi 0.5 Co 0.2 Mn 0.3 O 2 (NCM523) as the cathode delivers a capacity of 153.4 mAh g −1 and a capacity retention of 92.1\% after 100 cycles.

Many studies have demonstrated that molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ), a member of TMDs, is promising as a channel material to fabricate field-effect transistors (FETs). However, the carrier mobility in MoS 2 FET is always far lower than the theoretical prediction. Although this poor performance can be attributed to the defects, it still lacks a quantitative analysis clarifying the correlation between carrier mobility and defect density. In this work, by using scanning tunneling microscopy, we directly counted the defects in MoS 2 FETs with different carrier mobility. We found that vacancies and impurities equally contribute to carrier mobility and the total defect density induces a power-law decreasing tendency to the carrier mobility of MoS 2 FET. Our current results directly prove that the reduction of point defects can exponentially improve the carrier mobility of FETs made by TMDs.},

Herein, this Letter presents an innovative therapeutic avenue for cancer treatment with highly-effective alkaline PAW prepared by air surface plasma. This anticancer alkaline formulation is comprised of a rich mixture of highly chemical RONS and exhibited a prolonged half-life compared to acidified PAW. The H 2 O 2 , NO 2 − , and ONOO − /O 2 − concentrations in the alkaline PAW can reach up to 18-, 16-, and 14-fold higher than that in acidic PAW, and the half-life of these species was extended over 8-, 10-, and 26-fold, respectively. The synergistic potent redox action between these RONS with alkaline pH was shown to be more potent than acidic PAW for cancer cell inhibition in vitro . Furthermore, the alkaline PAW injection treatment also significantly inhibited tumor growth in tumor-bearing mice. The possible reasons are that the alkaline PAW would disturb the acid extracellular milieu leading to the inhibition of tumor growth and progression; moreover, the efficient and durable RONS with alkaline pH could induce significant cell apoptosis by altering cell biomolecules and participating apoptosis-related signaling pathways. These findings offer promising applications for developing a strategy with real potential for tumor treatment in clinical applications.},

SrTiO 3 , one of the appealing photocatalysts, can meet most of the screening criteria except for its efficiency, which is restricted by its poor absorption of visible light and its prompt photogenerated carrier recombination. Recently, a two-dimensional transition metal carbide Ti 3 C 2 T x (2D MXene) has been found to serve as a co-catalyst due to its excellent metallic conductivity, hydrophilic property, large specific surface area, abundance of active sites, and low reaction barrier to hydrogen production. In this work, SrTiO 3 nanoparticles are rationally integrated with Ti 3 C 2 T x nanosheets via a simple hydrothermal process. The hydrogen production rate can achieve up to 3.43 mmol g −1 h −1 in the hybridization of SrTiO 3 -3 wt.\% Ti 3 C 2 T x , which is almost six times that of SrTiO 3 alone. This remarkable enhancement arises predominantly from the Schottky contact between SrTiO 3 and Ti 3 C 2 T x , which can effectively suppress the recombination of photogenerated carriers and accelerate their separation. In addition, such enhancement benefits from the hydrogen evolution capacity of Ti 3 C 2 T x . This work opens an excellent prospect for constructing highly active, low-cost, and stable photocatalysts with 2D MXene and finding potential applications of 2D MXene in energy conversion fields.},

However, the practical application of Zn-based batteries is restricted by their inferior energy and power densities, which is resulted from the low output voltage and poor reaction kinetics of cathode materials. To address the above issues, we propose a decoupled aqueous Zn–Mn battery with high-rate and high-voltage by using oxygen functionalized carbon nanotubes (OCNTs) substrate. The functional interface can greatly improve the wettability of the electrode, promote the ion transport capability, and facilitate the rapid deposition/dissolution of MnO 2 /Mn 2+ . Consequently, the OCNTs/MnO 2 electrode can deliver a high capacity of 9.2 mA h cm −2 and superior capacity retention of 86.6\% at an ultrahigh current density of 200 mA cm −2 . When coupled with Zn anode, the Zn//OCNTs/MnO 2 decoupled full battery exhibits a high discharge plateau (∼2.45 V) and area specific capacity (1.96 mA h cm −2 ) at a current density of 2 mA cm −2 . Moreover, the outstanding peak power density of 13.4 kW kg −1 and peak energy density of 564.4 W h kg −1 can be achieved for Zn//OCNTs/MnO 2 battery (based on the mass of active material involved in the reaction on the positive and negative electrodes during charge and discharge), far beyond currently reported aqueous electrochemical energy storage devices.

  abstract     = {Layering elastocaloric materials can effectively maximize the average elastocaloric effect along the regenerator with a temperature gradient. An explicit correlation for mapping the performance of the layering elastocaloric regenerator from design parameters was developed by simplifying elastocaloric material property and energy conservation equations. Cooling capacity and coefficient of performance are found to be theoretically inversely linear with temperature span when the nonlinear dependence of elastocaloric heat on temperature is disregarded. The optimum utilization factor, the volume fraction of materials, the number of layers, and the transformation temperature spacing are obtained by confining the materials operating in the vicinity of their transformation temperatures. Performance degradation caused by hysteresis is found to be approximately linear with the hysteretic entropy change normalized by the isothermal entropy change.},

  abstract     = {We study thermal effects on spin transport along a deformable helical molecule in the presence of chiral-induced spin–orbit coupling. The carrier–lattice interaction is modeled by the well-established Peyrard–Bishop–Holstein model within the Langevin approach to include temperature as a stochastic noise. The carrier–lattice interaction causes the occurrence of polaron states in the molecule. We demonstrate the existence of two well-differentiated spin-dependent polaron transport regimes as a function of temperature. In the low-temperature regime, the spatial separation of the two spin-dependent polaron wave-packets results in a nonzero spin current. On the contrary, the spin current becomes negligible if the temperature of the system is high enough. Finally, we characterize this transition and estimate the critical temperature at which it takes place.},

  abstract     = {The integration of piezoelectric and micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) technologies is promoting the rapid development of the MEMS industry. However, due to the lack of excellent in-plane and out-of-plane piezoelectric coefficients, good ambient temperature stability, and high mechanical durability, the reported two-dimensional piezoelectric thin films are facing severe challenges in the development of MEMS. Therefore, based on density functional theory calculations, we simulated the VIA group (the sixth main family in the periodic table of elements) functional MXenes, namely, Sc 2 CXY (Sc 2 COS, Sc 2 COSe, Sc 2 CSO, and Sc 2 CSeO). The results show that this kind of material has good dynamic, thermal, and mechanical stability. Importantly, the structure exhibits good in-plane and out-of-plane piezoelectric effects due to the inversion asymmetry, bandgap adjustability, flexibility, and different electronegativity. Among them, the piezoelectric strain value of d 33 is one to three orders of magnitude higher than that of d 22 or d 31 , which makes these materials can become a strong candidate for advanced equipment such as nano-wearable electronics, robot bionic skin, and piezoelectric products for MEMS.},

  abstract     = {Ultrafast phenomena in gold nanotriangles (AuNTs) were investigated using a transient electron energy-loss spectroscopy (TEELS) technique under irradiation from a 150-fs pulse laser with a wavelength of 780 nm. This investigation was conducted using a time-resolved transmission electron microscopy method that was developed to measure the dynamics of nanomaterials. Enhancement of the intensity and energy-width broadening of the energy loss were observed at the EEL peaks associated with surface and bulk plasmons on the AuNTs. The TEELS measurement revealed two decay processes of 7.8 ps and longer than 100 ps that compensate for relaxation times of excited surface plasmons using transient absorption spectroscopy. The results show that the bulk and surface plasmons have the same time evolution, i.e., that the excited electrons on the surface and in the bulk have the same relaxation processes in both electron–phonon and phonon–phonon interactions. The time evolution of electronic and lattice temperatures was also estimated based on the measured relaxation time using a two-temperature model, which revealed the volume expansion of the AuNTs and clarified the energy shifts of plasmons. Details of excited electrons in nanoparticles investigated via plasmon energy loss are expected to facilitate improvement in the performance for energy harvesting of photons in nanostructure-controlled materials.},

  abstract     = {In this Letter, trapping effects of a Schottky lightly Mg-doped p-GaN gate stack for low-power applications have been investigated, and further analysis focusing on AlGaN/GaN interface traps under γ -ray irradiation has been carried out. A negligible shift in the flatband voltage with γ -ray irradiation dose up to 800 krad indicates the superior radiation tolerance of the p-GaN gate structure. The difference between capacitance dispersion at the measurement frequency below and above 500 kHz is observed, which is attributed to trapping effects in different locations with varying gate voltage. Moreover, the frequency-dependent conductance method is put forward to assess the effects of different doses of γ -ray irradiation on the AlGaN/GaN interface traps. Based on that method, aside from the shallow trap states [the trap activation energy ( E T ) is about 0.334–0.338 eV] previously found in the traditional normally on high electron mobility transistor (HEMT), another type of deeper trap states at the AlGaN/GaN interface ( E T is about 0.467–0.485 eV) is detected. It is observed that the E T of shallow trap states distributes at a deeper and broader range as the irradiation dose increases. Additionally, the trap density decreased after 600 krad doses irradiation but increased after 800 krad doses irradiation for both deep and shallow E T . Transmission electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy are used to demonstrate the smooth AlGaN/GaN interface morphology, which will not be greatly damaged after 800 krad doses of γ-ray irradiation. This work can provide a further understanding of radiation tolerance and trapping effects of p-GaN gate HEMTs for low-voltage applications.},

Through the measurements of the exciton peak position as a function of excitation power, the trilayer excitons exhibited the density-dependent repulsive interaction among them, and the reduction of binding energy ∼8 meV is deduced. Moreover, the trilayer exciton has a longer lifetime than the bilayer exciton, resulting from the reduction of electron–hole wavefunction overlap.},

Here, 200-nm-thick Mn-doped BiFeO 3 thin films have been epitaxially grown on a SrRuO 3 /SrTiO 3 /Si substrate and patterned into microcantilevers as prototype device structures for piezoelectric actuation. The devices demonstrate excellent ferroelectric response with a remanent polarization of 55 μ C/cm 2 . The epitaxial BiFeO 3 MEMS exhibit very high piezoelectric response with transverse piezoelectric coefficient d 31 reaching 83 pm/V. The BiFeO 3 cantilevers show larger electromechanical performance (the ratio of curvature/electric field) than that of state-of-art piezoelectric cantilevers, including well-known PZT (Pb(Zr,Ti)O 3 ) and the hyper-active PMN–PT (Pb(Mg 1/3 Nb 2/3 )O 3 -PbTiO 3 ). In addition, the piezoelectricity in BiFeO 3 MEMS is found to depend on the ferroelectric polarization direction, which could originate from the flexoelectric effect and be exploited to further enhance the electromechanical performance of the devices. These results could potentially lead to a replacement of lead-based piezoelectrics by BiFeO 3 in many microdevices.},

Among them, 2D metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are standing out due to their advantages such as the easy synthesis in practice and less sensitivity to oxidation that are distinctly different from inorganic materials. By means of density-functional theory calculations, we systematically investigate the electronic and topological properties of a class of 2D MOFs X(C 21 H 15 N 3 ) (X = transition metal element from 3 d to 5 d ). Excitingly, we find that X(C 21 H 15 N 3 ) (X = Ti, Zr, Ag, Au) are Chern insulators with sizable band gaps (∼7.1 meV). By studying a four-band effective model, it is revealed that the Chern insulator phase in X(C 21 H 15 N 3 ) (X = Ti, Zr, Ag, Au) is caused cooperatively by the band inversion of the p orbitals of the C 21 H 15 N 3 molecule and the intrinsic ferromagnetism of X(C 21 H 15 N 3 ). Additionally, Mn(C 21 H 15 N 3 ) is a Dirac half-metal ferromagnet with a high Curie temperature up to 156 K. Our work demonstrates that 2D MOFs X(C 21 H 15 N 3 ) are good platforms for realizing the quantum anomalous Hall effect and designing spintronic devices based on half-metals with high-speed and long-distance spin transport.},

However, numerous studies also revealed the existence of boson peaks in many crystalline materials. The paradox is an unsolved knot in condensed matter physics. Here, we systematically explore the boson peaks in various disordered materials via a low-temperature specific heat perspective. A linear relationship between the boson peak temperature and the transverse sound velocity is well established, which indicates the phonon nature of the boson peak. Further analysis reveals that the boson peak is a ubiquitous hallmark of all solids that originates from the transverse mode damping, and glasses with disordered structures could enhance the phonon damping and result in the distinct boson peak phenomenon. The results have benefits for a better understanding of the structural origins of boson peaks.},

  abstract     = {The van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures employing graphene and hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) have emerged as a typical system for building emergent two-dimensional devices, such as atomically thin transistors or capacitors. Herein, we study the nonlinear thermal transport in such vdW heterostructure by non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. The results show that an obvious negative differential thermal resistance (NDTR) phenomenon can be observed under small temperature bias when the interlayer coupling becomes stronger. The vibrational spectra analysis manifests that the phonon filtering mechanism induced by interlayer coupling greatly hinders the interfacial thermal transport. To obtain the optimum conditions, the dependence of NDTR on the system length, lateral width, external temperature, and defect density is taken into account. Our findings extend the phonon filtering mechanism to thermal information processing.},

  abstract     = {Twisted moiré lattices (TMLs) are superlattices that usually comprise two identical two-dimensional lattices with a relative twist angle. Depending on the twist angle, periodic and aperiodic patterns are afforded. Recently, flat bands and localized states have been achieved in photonic and phononic TMLs with periodic patterns. However, the physics of phononic TMLs with quasicrystalline patterns still need to be determined. In this Letter, we theoretically and experimentally realize point- and loop-shaped localized states induced by the flat bands in phononic TMLs with quasicrystalline patterns. The flat bands in our phononic TML do not occur due to the hybridization of the bands near the Dirac point. They evolve from the trivial bands; trivial bands flatten in wide bandgaps due to strong interlayer couplings, yielding flat bands. As the average group velocity of flat bands can be extremely close to zero, the localized states can be bounded in the moiré points and the moiré loops of phononic TMLs with quasicrystalline patterns. Our findings provide a method for manipulating classical waves in various moiré structures with quasicrystalline patterns.},

Here, we studied the contact resistance to buried nanometer thick δ-doped Ba 1-x La x SnO 3 (BLSO) layers. We have used epitaxial 4\% (x = 0.04) BLSO as a contact material, which has additional advantages of forming Ohmic contacts to BaSnO 3 and providing thermal stability even at high temperatures. The contact resistance was measured by a modified transmission line method designed to eliminate the contribution from the resistance of the contact material. The upper bound for the contact resistance to a 12 nm thick δ-doped 1\% BLSO conductive layer was measured to be 1.25 × 10 −1 or 2.87 × 10 −7 Ω cm 2 . Our results show that it is possible to provide low resistance epitaxial edge contacts to an embedded nanometer-thick BLSO conductive layer using an ion-milling process. Our low resistance contact method can be easily extended to a two-dimensional electron gas at the oxide interfaces such as LaInO 3 /BaSnO 3 .},

We demonstrate that maintaining metallic states before encapsulation is a key process to enhance μ FE in p-type SnO thin-films. Sustaining this meta-stability involves the following two processes during fabrication: (1) postdeposition annealing (PDA) in two steps and (2) encapsulation in the middle of each PDA. This simple process not only suppresses creation of oxidized states such as adverse Sn 4+ but also facilitates the lateral growth of crystals with improved crystallinity by interfacial energy stabilization. The resultant SnO TFT reveals a record-high μ FE up to 15.8 cm 2 /Vs with a negligible hysteresis of 0.1 V. This study suggests a practical route to grant high μ FE to p-channel SnO TFTs without any dopant or complex postdeposition treatment.},

  abstract     = {AlN film bulk acoustic wave (BAW) resonators operating at above 5 GHz for next generation mobile communications present some problems, such as the very thin thickness of the piezoelectric film and electrode films. These cause degradations of the power handling capability, electromechanical coupling factor, and Q value in film BAW resonators. Polarity-inverted multilayered AlN film BAW resonators can operate in high-order mode resonance. Therefore, an n -layer polarity-inverted film BAW resonator has n -times thicker piezoelectric film thickness than a standard BAW resonator with a monolayer piezoelectric film operating at same frequency. However, fabrication methods for polarity-inverted multilayered AlN films have not been established. This paper examines the effect of Si doping on AlN films on the crystal orientation, polarity direction, and electromechanical coupling factor ( k t 2 ). Furthermore, we fabricated and evaluated two- to eight-layer polarity-inverted SiAlN/AlN film high-overtone bulk acoustic wave resonators (HBARs). The polarity of the Si x Al 1− x N films inverted around x = 0.024–0.13. The crystal orientation and k t 2 of the Si x Al 1-x N films were degraded with increasing Si concentration x . The eight-layer polarity-inverted SiAlN/AlN film HBAR resonated in the eighth mode. Moreover, the experimental longitudinal wave insertion loss exhibited a similar trend to the theoretical curve calculated by a Mason&#39;s equivalent circuit model considering the polarity inverted structure. The eight-layer polarity-inverted HBARs had approximately eight-times thicker piezoelectric film thickness than the monolayer AlN film HBAR. The insertion loss improved with increasing the number of polarity-inverted layers.},

By varying the O content, the electrical resistivity of films can be tuned in a wide range of ∼ 100 – 40 000 μ Ω cm. With increasing O content, a drastic increase in resistivity occurs at ∼ 45 at.\% of O, separating regimes with two different dominant conduction mechanisms attributed to metallic conduction through the Au–Ta alloy matrix (for ≲ 45 at.\% of O) and tunneling across insulating Ta 2 O 5 layers separating conducting islands (for ≳ 45 at.\% of O).

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional (2D) Bi 2 O 2 Se has attracted much attention as a promising candidate for electronic and optoelectronic applications. However, the transport and optical properties in Bi 2 O 2 Se nanoribbons (NRs) are not yet fully understood. In this work, by using first-principles calculations, the intrinsic carrier mobility (μ) and the optical absorption properties of Bi 2 O 2 Se NRs are investigated. In contrast to the dramatic deterioration of μ in graphene upon the formation of NRs, the magnitude of μ in Bi 2 O 2 Se NRs can reach up to 3600 cm 2 V −1 s −1 at a width ranging from 3.3 to 4.5 nm, which is about ten times higher than its sheet counterpart. Such a high intrinsic electron mobility of Bi 2 O 2 Se NRs can be attributed to the weaker edge state perturbations due to external strain inherent in Bi 2 O 2 Se NRs. Moreover, in Bi 2 O 2 Se NRs, the optical absorption at the visible (2.4–3.1 eV) and ultraviolet (4.3 eV) region reaches 5\%–10\% and 19.2\%, respectively. Furthermore, the optical absorption properties can be well tuned by the width of NRs. In addition, the relatively small stretching modulus ranging from 0.40 to 2.24 × 10 −7 J/m and the moderate critical strain ranging from 0.04 to 0.14 guarantee its moderate flexibility and ductility. Our results indicate that width modulation provides a potential approach for improving the transport and optical properties of Bi 2 O 2 Se nanostructures.},

Suppression of laser-plasma debris (responsible for damaging optics) is crucial for the lifetime prolongation of optical systems operated with the short-wavelength radiation. Here, we examine the capability of single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT)-based membranes to decrease an InSn plasma flux containing both ions and atoms. Faraday cup measurements show that 40- and 90-nm-thick SWCNT membranes reduce the total charge transition by 20 and 130 times, respectively. The ion analyzer measurements demonstrate that ions pass through the membrane mainly due to the collisionless (ballistic) mechanism. Using scanning electron microscopy, we estimate a decrease in a plasma (ions + atoms) flux to be of 18 and 140 times for 40- and 90-nm-thick SWCNT-based membranes, respectively. The average plasma flux attenuation coefficient of SWCNT membranes is calculated as k = 0.063 nm − 1 ⁠ .},

Generally, acoustic scattering is considered for static (non-moving) objects and the impinging signal is typically a plane wave. Here, we consider scattering off cylindrical objects in spinning motion around the axis of rotational symmetry. We investigate the radiation force and torque induced by various incident signals, e.g., cylindrical diverging and converging beams as well as quasi-Gaussian beams of different orders. It is assumed in this study (unless otherwise stated) that the acoustic parameters of the objects (density and compressibility) are identical to those of the surrounding medium, in order to isolate the effects purely attributed to rotation. The scenario of a spinning inhomogeneous object is also shown to play a prominent role for generating torque with single plane waves. Our findings may add to the current interest in time-varying and moving metamaterials and open vistas in manipulation of movement and position of ultra-small objects via acoustic beams.},

The photoresponse characteristics of porous PTFE/IGZO (PPI) phototransistors were tested with various thicknesses of PTFE (15–75; 15 nm steps). The PPI phototransistor with the PTFE thickness of 30 nm showed the highest photoresponse properties. Although the measured optical bandgap energy of the IGZO film was 3.87 eV, the PPI phototransistors could detect visible light due to the trap-assisted electron/hole pair generation by the sub gap states of the IGZO film induced by plasma damage during PTFE deposition. In addition, it was possible to maximize the efficiency of detecting visible light by capturing and scattering light with the porous structure of PTFE. The PPI phototransistors had a photoresponsivity of 73.45 ± 16.14 A/W, photosensitivity of (1.60 ± 0.57) × 10 6 , and detectivity of (2.62 ± 2.37) × 10 10 Jones under illumination by red light with a wavelength of 635 nm and an intensity of 10 mW/mm 2 .},

  abstract     = {We demonstrate a continuous-wave single-frequency diamond Raman laser operating at 1178 nm by using a linear resonator that is stabilized using an intracavity χ ( 2 ) element. Optimization of the single-frequency power was realized by tuning the phase matching in the χ ( 2 ) element away from the second-harmonic peak to suppress neighboring modes via sum frequency generation but avoid large losses to the intracavity primary Stokes mode. A maximum single-longitudinal-mode power of 20 W at 1178 nm with an instrument-limited linewidth of 67 MHz was obtained using a 12 GHz multi-longitudinal-mode Yb-doped fiber pump laser at 1018 nm with power of 82 W.

However, photodetectors with a low dark current and a fast response speed commonly lose their photoresponsivity. The recovery current induced by the Schottky barrier height variation cancels out the device&#39;s reverse bias current in this paper, resulting in a quasi-vertical MoSe 2 photodiode with ultralow dark current (&lt;1 pA). Simultaneously, rapid electron–hole pair separation occurs at the interface due to the large heterojunction area and the strong interlayer coupling of MoSe 2 /graphene heterojunction, resulting in a fast response time of 1.5 ms and a high photoresponsivity of 19.72 A/W. Furthermore, the Au/MoSe 2 forms a Schottky contact, which is asymmetrical to the Ohmic contact formed by the MoSe 2 /graphene, enabling the proposed device to achieve high-performance self-powered photodetection.

The decrease in Brillouin zone size and the change of high symmetry direction caused by the interlayer twisted angle lead to the emergence of the hybrid folded phonons—moiré phonons, which have noticeable impacts on phonon properties. This paper reviews the recent developments and discoveries on phonon properties in twisted two-dimensional stacking homogeneous and heterogeneous systems and focuses on the impacts of the interlayer twisted angle on phonon dispersion, such as interlayer coupling phonon modes and moiré phonons. Meanwhile, we introduced the recent research on the influence of the interlayer twisted angle on phonon transport behavior along the in-plane and out-of-plane directions. In addition, the theoretical and experimental open questions and challenges faced in the phonon characteristics of twisted two-dimensional materials are discussed, and some possible solutions are put forward.},

This work presents an OCT to H&amp;E image translation model to convert the OCT images to H&amp;E-like stained images using unpaired OCT and H&amp;E datasets. “H&amp;E like” means the stratum corneum (SC) boundary and the dermal-epidermal junction (DEJ) of the OCT and the translated images are consistent. Pre-trained segmentation models for the DEJ and the SC are exploited to enhance the performance of anatomical image translation and reduce the DEJ and SC lower boundary errors to ±2.3 and ±1.7 μ m, respectively. A pre-trained VGG16 network extracts the features of the nuclei. Pearson&#39;s correlation coefficient of the nuclei location and size consistency is 84\% ± 1\%.

A gas detection experiment considering acetonitrile (i.e., CH 3 CN) has been carried out to characterize the performance of the spectroscopy system. The directional patterns of the leaky-wave antenna are demonstrated to map the absorption characteristic peaks of the CH 3 CN, thus enabling an extension of the detection range. Thanks to the intrinsic frequency-scanning behavior of the antenna, each absorption peak can be associated with an angle, enabling, therefore, spatial discrimination to monitor gas spreading.},

The training process is based on a hybrid quantum-classical approach to improve the efficiency in building the autoencoder and reduce the experimental errors during the optimization. Using nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond, we demonstrate that the entangled states between the electron and nuclear spins can be encoded into the nucleus subspace, which has much longer coherence time. As a result, lifetime of the Bell states in this solid-spin system is extended from 2.22 ± 0.43 μs to 3.03 ± 0.56 ms, yielding a three orders of magnitude improvement.

  abstract     = {With the rise of Internet of Things, indoor organic photovoltaic (IOPV) devices as the promising power supply unit of off-grid electronics have made great progress in recent years. However, as the only acceptable end-goal, their commercial large-scale production is still a long way off although the absolute efficiency values achieve significant breakthroughs and have exceeded 30\%. One of the main obstacles to practical application is the impact of IOPV devices on human vision under indoor conditions. Because the IOPV devices usually require expansive areas deployed for larger output power under indoor cases, a semitransparent strategy is commonly adopted to reduce the effects on indoor light environments. Conventional semitransparent bulk heterojunctions (BHJs) with wide-bandgap donors and near-infrared absorbing acceptors generate a huge proportion of residual blue light, which may cause human visual fatigue and injury. Herein, we propose a fullerene derivative blending strategy to suppress the blue light hazards caused by the state-of-the-art IOPV devices and improve the overall device performance. A series of high-efficient non-fullerene BHJs were selected as model systems, and a low dosage of PC 71 BM molecules can effectively reduce the blue light hazard efficacy ( K B , v ). Furthermore, with the desirable electron transport property and strong absorbance of PC 71 BM in the wavelength range of 400–500 nm, the ternary PM6:Y6:PC 71 BM devices enjoy remarkably improved power conversion efficiencies. This work provides an effective approach to simultaneously suppress K B , v values and improve performance of IOPV devices.},

  abstract     = {A lithium–selenium (Li–Se) battery is considered as a promising next-generation energy storage system due to its ultrahigh volumetric energy density. However, the capacity attenuation due to the dissolution and shuttle effect of polyselenides is urgent to be addressed. Herein, 1,4-benzenedithiol (1,4-BDT) and benzeneselenol (PhSeH) are proposed as redox mediator additives in the electrolyte. They both change the multi-step reaction of Se and accelerate the redox kinetics, thus suppressing the shuttle effect of polyselenides and improving the cycling stability and rate performance. The Li–Se cell with 1,4-BDT exhibits steady 450 cycles at 1 C with capacity decay only 0.058\% per cycle. Differently, the Li–Se cell with PhSeH features fast kinetics, which shows 91.4\% capacity retention after 450 cycles at a high rate of 5 C. Due to the difference of molecular structures between 1,4-BDT and PhSeH, the cyclic oligomers formed in the Li–Se cell with 1,4-BDT diminish the solubility of polyselenides enhancing the cycling stability, while the chain-like diphenyl selenides generated in the Li–Se cell with PhSeH promote kinetics performance through a single-phase reaction.

LiVXO 4 F (X = B, Si), a polyanionic-based tavorite structure, is investigated as a cathode for Li-ion batteries and its capability to endure in sensitive mode operations, i.e., at temperatures of approximately 55 and −10 °C. Due to the near-freezing point at the atomic level and the absence of kinetic energy, a battery system operating at a lower temperature is theoretically expected to perform inferior. On the contrary, Vanadium boron oxyfluoride (VBF) has better electrochemical properties because of its tightly packed covalent bond, which produced structural stability at low temperature activities. This intriguing feature appears to hold promise for its use in advanced rechargeable battery systems in low-temperature areas and cold storage devices. This might pave the path for future energy storage and conversion devices to use neoteric tavorite structured electrodes.},

  abstract     = {Enhancement in the output performance of triboelectric nanogenerators by using different suitable techniques is of tremendous interest among researchers. Here, we propose an easy and cost-effective technique to improve the output performance of the rarely explored poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) based piezo-tribo hybrid nanogenerators. The space charge polarization of the PVDF based composites has been tuned here by forming a PVDF/0.5(Ba 0.7 Ca 0.3 )TiO 3 –0.5Ba(Ti 0.8 Zr 0.2 )O 3 (BCZT)/Multi-Walled Carbon Nanotube (MWCNT) based ternary composite. Along with the improved piezoelectricity of PVDF–BCZT based binary composites, the addition of a third MWCNT phase has helped in significantly improving the space charge polarization. The ac conductivity is increased to 5.29 × 10 −12 and 1.23 × 10 −11 Ω −1 cm −1 for the binary and ternary composites, respectively, from a value of 7.64 × 10 −13 Ω −1 cm −1 (at 1 kHz) for neat PVDF. This improved conducting pathway formed by the increased space charge polarization has supported the easy transportation of mobile charge carriers within the composite film and film to the electrode, which has augmented the overall output piezo-tribo hybrid energy harvesting performance of the device. An ultrahigh output power density of ∼150 μ W/cm 2 has been achieved for the said ternary system, which suppresses the value of output power density of the other similar kind of devices fabricated via a similar technique. The applicability of this device has been further demonstrated by using it in powering up small electronic devices and in different sensing and energy harvesting applications. Thus, the device, after further tuning of its dimension, may be applied as a power source in various low-power-consuming portable electronic systems and self-powered sensing devices.},

  abstract     = {The lithiation onset of amorphous silicon (a-silicon) films up to 10\% state of charge (SOC) is characterized by a Li + -uptake region around 0.5 V vs a Li reference electrode. In the literature, this is commonly attributed to surface processes such as the formation of a solid electrolyte interphase layer and/or the reduction of the surface native oxide, and more seldom to bulk processes such as reduction of oxygen contaminations inside the silicon film and to silicon lithiation. This work presents evidence that this process is associated with the lithiation of elemental silicon using electrochemical and non-electrochemical measurements and including a discussion of literature data. Cyclic voltammetry performed on pre-lithiated a-silicon and a-silicon films with different oxygen concentrations and with different film thicknesses reveals a lithiation process that is not associated with the reduction of oxygen. Elemental depth-profiling with secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) reveals a two-phase lithiation mechanism at the lithiation onset, which sharply delimits non-lithiated silicon from a Li-poor phase of constant Li content (Li 0.3 Si). The published operando neutron reflectometry data suggest that this is also the case for oxygen-free Si single crystal wafers. SIMS measurements further show that the whole a-silicon thin film is converted into the Li-poor phase. This phase remains stable in the vicinity of the current collector even at 100\% SOC, indicating that mechanical stress may play an important role.},

The devices work in an accumulation mode (AM) with two apparent threshold voltages corresponding to the formation of a buried channel and an accumulation layer, respectively. A CuO AM TFT with a channel length of 25 μ m exhibit a competitive on-off ratio ( I on /I off ) of 1.3 × 10 2 , a subthreshold swing ( SS ) of 1.04 V dec −1 , and a field-effect mobility ( μ FE ) of 1.1 × 10 −3 cm 2 V −1 s −1 at room temperature. By measuring a CuO metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) capacitor at room temperature, a high acceptor doping density ( N A ) of ∼5 × 10 17 cm −3 , a high positive effective fixed surface charge density ( Q f ) of ∼9 × 10 12 cm −2 , and a low interfacial trap charge density ( D it ) of ∼6 × 10 10 eV −1 cm −2 at the HfO 2 /CuO interface are estimated. The μ FE extracted from the accumulation regime appears lower than the Hall mobility measured for a similarly processed CuO layer on glass due to the increased hole concentration in CuO TFTs, compared to a Hall concentration of ∼10 14 cm −3 , following the MOS process. SS appears limited by the decreased channel to gate capacitance ( C cg ) related to the buried channel in AM TFTs, parasitic capacitance to ground, and potentially very high interfacial traps at the non-passivated CuO/air interface.},

  abstract     = {Synaptic plasticity divided into long-term and short-term categories is regarded as the origin of memory and learning, which also inspires the construction of neuromorphic systems. However, it is difficult to mimic the two behaviors monolithically, which is due to the lack of time-tailoring approaches for a certain synaptic device. In this Letter, indium-gallium-zinc-oxide (IGZO) nanofiber-based photoelectric transistors are proposed for realizing tunable photoelectric synaptic plasticity by the indium composition ratio. Notably, short-term plasticity to long-term plasticity transition can be realized by increasing the ratio of indium in the IGZO channel layer. The spatiotemporal dynamic logic and low energy consumption (&lt;100 fJ/spike) are obtained in devices with low indium ratio. Moreover, the symmetric spike-timing-dependent plasticity is achieved by exploiting customized light and electric pulse schemes. Photoelectric long-term plasticity, multi-level characteristics, and high recognition accuracy (93.5\%) are emulated in devices with high indium ratio. Our results indicate that such a composition ratio modulated method could enrich the applications of IGZO nanofiber neuromorphic transistors toward the photoelectric neuromorphic systems.},

Here, we report the thermal conductivity and thermal rectification of gradient-nano-grained graphene (GNGG) by molecular dynamic simulation with machine learning. It is revealed that the thermal conductivity of GNGG is mainly determined by the average grain size, while its thermal rectification factor varies linearly with the gradient of nanograins. Deep neural network-based machine learning models are developed to estimate the thermal transport properties of GNGG using microstructural signatures, such as the location, number, and orientation of 5|7 pairs. The results stress the pivotal roles of 5|7 defects in the planar thermal transports of graphene and indicate that high-performance 2D thermal rectifiers for heat flow control and energy harvesting can be achieved by bio-inspired gradient structure engineering. The findings are expected to supply a theoretical strategy for the design of bio-inspired materials and create a method to predict the potential properties of the material candidates by using machine learning, which can save the abundant expense of developing the material by using the classical method.},

In space, their long-term reliability is a significant concern due to the difficulties of repairing and replacing malfunctioning devices. In this work, PZT thin film micromirrors for compact interferometric 3D imaging systems have been exposed to operating conditions encountered on a space mission and tested according to criteria set by the European Space Agency. Thermal cycling in vacuum, sinusoidal and random mechanical vibrations, and γ -radiation with and without bias did not degrade key functional device properties of the micromirror such as angular deflection, resonance frequency, polarization, and permittivity. Apart from γ -radiation, stressing the devices enhanced their large-signal angular deflection and improved their electrical lifetime compared to pristine devices. Their dielectric and ferroelectric characteristics remained comparable to that of a lab-scale environment. Simultaneously applying a 10 V field-down bias while γ -radiating the micromirrors changed the capacitance-field and polarization-field characteristics and enhanced the electrical imprint. After stress-testing, the median time-to-failure in moderate acceleration conditions of 150 kV/cm and 175 °C ranged from 1.95 to 2.64 h, close to 2.11 h as measured for a reference group. All actuator membranes had shorter electrical lifetimes, smaller voltage acceleration factors, and smaller activation energies, ranging from 2.56 to 2.88 V −1 and 1.03 to 1.09 eV, than simple bonding pads.

  abstract     = {Oxidizing the heavy metal (HM) has been reported to be a simple and efficient method to enhance the generation efficiency of the spin–orbit torques (SOTs) in the HM/ferromagnet (FM) heterostructure, which has attracted intensive studies. However, by now all the previous studies were performed using an oxidized HM/metallic magnet heterostructure. The SOT in the oxidized HM/magnetic oxide heterostructure still remains elusive, which has not been reported yet. In this work, we report the study of the SOT generation and spin Hall effect in the oxidized platinum/magnetic oxide heterostructure. By changing the oxidation level of Pt(O) in the Pt(O)/Tm 3 Fe 5 O 12 (TmIG) bilayer, we demonstrate that the SOT efficiency drastically decreases with the increase in the oxidation level, which is completely opposite to that in the Pt(O)/metallic magnet. This result indicates that the interfacial oxidation of the FM layer in the generally studied oxidized HM/metallic magnet bilayer significantly contributes to the interfacial Rashba effect, which drastically enhances the SOT efficiency. We further demonstrate that the spin Hall conductivity of Pt is very sensitive to the electric conductivity, which drastically increases with the electric conductivity. This drastic increase is attributed to the intrinsic contribution of Pt in the dirty-metal regime, which is dominated by the carrier lifetime. Our study provides a piece of information for the basic understanding of the SOT and spin Hall effect in the oxidized HM/magnetic oxide heterostructure.},

  abstract     = {The discovery of current-induced spin–orbit torque (SOT) orthogonal reorientation, also known as orthogonal switching, of metallic Mn 2 Au and CuMnAs has opened the door for ultrafast writing of an antiferromagnet (AFM). A phenomenological theory predicts that the minimum field necessary for SOT switching—critical field—for ultrashort pulses increases inversely proportional to the pulse duration, thereby limiting the use of ultrafast stimulus as driving force for switching. We explore the possibility that by varying the working temperature, the critical field reduces enabling orthogonal switching in response to ultrashort pulses. To do so, we extend the previous theory to finite temperature and show that the critical field for orthogonal switching strongly depends on temperature. We determine how the temperature dependence of the critical field varies as a function of the pulse duration. For long pulses, the temperature dependence of the critical field is determined by the anisotropy field, and for ultrashort pulses, it is determined by the characteristic frequency of the AFM. We show that the short and long pulse duration limits for the critical field can be connected by an analytical expression.},

  abstract     = {The semiconductor nanowire (NW) array promises a high photoconductive-gain as well as an enhanced light-absorption in optoelectronic applications. However, to date, the two kinds of advantages are always consuming each other, leading to a low global income. In this work, we show a feasible route to balance the electric gain and the light absorption efficiency. It is accomplished by an inverse injection of photocarriers into NW (from the tip to the bottom of NW or in the opposite direction), which will activate the photoconductive gain in maximal degree. Experimentally, the responsivity reaches up to ∼200 A/W. The spectral response of the GaAs nanowire-array detector is proven to be bias-voltage controlled, allowing it to work at visible or shortwave-infrared enhanced modes. Also, the photoresponse carries on the wavelength information of the incident light, thus, can be used to discriminate monochromatic lights from each other. Together, these findings depict a full image of the photoresponse process in the vertical nanowire array. It might pave a way for the design and fabrication of subwavelength optoelectronic devices.},

A set of droplets of molten combustion products forms behind the reaction front and “rides” this front under the action of surface tension. When the combustion front arrives at the edge of substrate and stops, the droplets start to fly-by inertia along-track direction of the combustion propagation. Thus, the combustion front can throw hot micro-droplets toward a predetermined target to perform some specific action, e.g., distance ignition, actuating pulse, or energy transfer.},

However, its application in thin film batteries has been plagued by its low actual capacity and poor rate capability. Herein, a TiO 2 thin film with a unique amorphous-crystalline heterostructure (AC-TO) is prepared by magnetron sputtering at room temperature. The heterostructure design of AC-TO not only takes advantage of faster Li + diffusion of an amorphous phase and higher electric conductivity of a crystalline phase but also reaps the benefit of fast ion transport, fast electron transfer, and additional lithium storage at the hetero-interfaces, resulting in boosted lithium storage performance. When tested in all-solid-state thin film lithium batteries, the AC-TO based device exhibits an obviously higher reversible specific capacity (204 at 50 mA g −1 ) than the amorphous TiO 2 based device (103 mAh g −1 ) and the crystalline anatase based device (147 mAh g −1 ), as well as good rate capability (73 at 1600 mA g −1 ) and excellent cycling stability (nearly no capacity loss after 400 cycles).

Integrating the functionalities, such as amplitude, phase (spectrum and directionality), and polarization, on a single metasurface offers fascinating device responses. However, it remains a significant challenge to concurrently optimize the optical, electrical, and thermal responses of a thermal metasurface in a small footprint. In this work, we develop a center-contacted electrode line design for a thermal infrared metasurface based on a gold nanorod array, which allows local Joule heating to electrically excite the emission without undermining the localized surface plasmonic resonance. The narrowband emission of thermal metasurfaces and their robustness against temperature nonuniformity demonstrated in this work have important implications for the applications in infrared imaging, sensing, and energy harvesting.},

  abstract     = {Silicon carbide (SiC) supports surface phonons in the infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum where these modes can be thermally emitted. Additionally, the magnitude, spectrum, and direction of thermal radiation from SiC can be controlled by engineering this material at the sub-wavelength scale. For these reasons, SiC nanopillars are of high interest for thermal-radiation tuning. So far, theoretical and experimental studies of thermal emission from SiC nanopillars have been limited to long-pitch arrays with a microscale interpillar spacing. It is not clear how far-field thermal emission from SiC nanopillars is affected when the interparticle spacing reduces to the nanometer scale, where the near-field interaction between adjacent nanopillars arises and the array becomes zero order. In this Letter, we study physical mechanisms of far-field thermal radiation from zero-order arrays of silicon-carbide nanopillars with a nanoscale interpillar spacing. We show that the increased volume of thermal emitters and thermal radiation of the hybrid waveguide-surface-phonon-polariton mode from zero-order arrays increase the spectral emissivity of silicon carbide to values as large as 1 for a wide range of angles. The enhanced, dispersion-less thermal emission from a zero-order SiC array of nano-frustums with an optimized interspacing of 300 nm is experimentally demonstrated. Our study provides insight into thermal radiation from dense nanostructures and has significant implications for thermal management of electronic devices and energy harvesting applications.},

We analyzed existing force balance models and bubble growth rate models using experimental data. Our analysis revealed that the existing force balance models show severe limitations in predicting bubble dynamics, and the success of models reported by researchers is mainly due to over-parametrization and over-fitting. We show through our experimental results that the movement of the bubble in the flow direction and depletion of the upstream microlayer are strongly correlated with bubble diameter and growth rate. We discuss a non-dimensional approach based on forces acting on the bubble to predict the bubble movement in the flow direction.

  abstract     = {Silicon (Si)-based anode is promising for the next-generation high-energy lithium-ion batteries due to the high capacity. However, it suffers parasitic side reactions between electrode and electrolyte in the initial cycle, which consumes abundant active lithium and makes it one of the limiting factors for the implementation of Si-based anodes. It is of vital importance to suppress the side reactions at the electrode interphase and improve the electrochemical/chemical stability. Here, we designed an ultrathin double-shell interphase structure (∼15 nm), consisting of an inner VO 2 nanoshell and an outer C nanoshell. The inner VO 2 nanolayer avoided the direct contact between active Si and electrolyte, and, thus, hindered the side reactions between them. The carbon nanolayer stabilized the VO 2 layer mechanically and improved the electronic conductivity of the anode materials. Thus, a thin solid electrolyte interphase was formed on the as-designed Si@VO 2 @C surface, and high initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) was realized. Notably, the Si@VO 2 @C electrode exhibited a high reversible capacity of 2300 mAh g −1 at 0.1 C and high ICE of 90.2\%, which was about 18\% higher than that of a pristine Si electrode. Also, the electrode displayed stable electrochemical cycling with high capacity retention of 84.8\% for 100 cycles at 0.4 C . With 15 wt.\% addition into the graphite, the hybrid electrode Si@VO 2 @C/graphite exhibited a high reversible charge capacity of 596 mAh g −1 and satisfactory cycling performance with high capacity retention of 83.8\% at 100 mA g −1 under a high area capacity of 3.46 mAh cm −2 , showing promise for the practical application.},

Theoretical approaches in the existing studies mainly focus on establishing equivalent circuits, which provide a rapid analysis method but with relatively low precision. Therefore, we propose a field-view model to theoretically analyze the physical mechanism of TENGs, which reveals high efficiency and great accuracy. After the comprehensive study, it is determined that the dynamic behavior of TENGs in a single approaching/separating cycle could be regarded as a time series of electrostatic equilibrium problems. Thus, based on Laplace&#39;s equations and potential boundary conditions, a definite-solution-problem model is developed, which could provide explicit mathematical expressions to ultra-precisely predict the electrical characteristics of TENG.},

The thermal conductivity of the lattice is evaluated by employing the phonon Boltzmann transport theory and the first-principle second and third force constants. The Seebeck coefficients, electronic thermal conductivities, and electric conductivities of the monolayer are determined by solving the relaxation time approximation semiclassical Boltzmann transport equation. To further explore the chance for promoting ZT , we investigate the manipulating effect of the carrier concentrations.

  abstract     = {Lithium–sulfur (Li–S) battery is one of the promising energy storage systems due to its high theoretical energy density with low cost. The main challenge at present for its commercialization is the polysulfides shuttling, leading to poor cycling performance. Here, we report a facilely prepared metal-organic framework (MOF)-derived nanoporous carbon with embedded cobalt nanoparticles (NPCo/C) for alleviating the polysulfides shuttling. The NPCo/C with large surface area and abundant Co nanoparticles is simply prepared by direct carbonization of a Co-based MOF material, which is combined with graphene to construct a robust membrane as the interlayer (NPCo/C@G) to modify the pristine separator. The NPCo/C@G-modified separator gives the battery good cycling stability (707 mAh g −1 after 300 cycles at 0.5 C) and rate performance (capacity decay rate of 0.18\% in 300 cycles at 2 C). Excellent battery performance (620 mAh g −1 after 100 cycles at 0.5 C) is exhibited even under ultra-low loading of NPCo/C@G (0.08 mg cm −2 ). The superior electrochemical performance is mainly attributed to abundant exposed Co active sites in NPCo/C to immobilize polysulfides and accelerate sulfur redox kinetics as well as excellent electrical conductivity of NPCo/C@G for improved sulfur utilization. This study provides a guidance for designing functional separators for Li–S battery application in the near future.},

Proteolytic fragments of the mutant HTT (mHTT) are accumulated in neurons leading to neurodegeneration. HD has no cure, and most research efforts are focused on finding disease-modifying therapies and biomarkers of disease progression and treatment efficacy. Random lasing (RL) has been successfully used in biomedicine to differentiate normal from pathological tissues showing robust morphological and structural differences. Here, we evaluate the potential of RL in discriminating brain samples of a transgenic mouse model of HD from those of its wild-type littermates. Furthermore, we also investigate the sensibility of RL to the effects of a mHTT lowering treatment in transgenic mice therapy. The results reveal that multivariate statistical analysis of RL signals discriminates between healthy and transgenic mice and also between treated and untreated transgenic mice. These findings open up perspectives for RL as a sensing tool in HD and, possibly, in other neurodegenerative diseases whose pathogenic hallmark is the accumulation of anomalous proteins.},

In recent years, various types of acoustic logic gates have successively been demonstrated based on artificial materials. However, simultaneous realization of acoustic logic devices with the characteristics of broad bandwidth and high robustness still poses a great challenge. To overcome this, we numerically design and experimentally demonstrate a multifunctional logic gate based on valley sonic crystals (VSCs). In a designed waveguide composed of two VSCs, a pair of valley edge states can be obtained in the domain wall. Additionally, we experimentally design a multifunctional logic gate composed of four VSCs. The logic functions OR and XOR with the fractional bandwidths of 0.24 and 0.19 can be realized at two output ports, which arises from both valley conservation and linear interference mechanisms. More importantly, we experimentally demonstrate the robustness of the logic gate by introducing a V-shaped defect, and the corresponding logic functions and their bandwidths created by the valley transport of edge states are almost immune to backscattering from the V-shaped defect. Compared with the previous acoustic logic gates, the proposed logic gate has the advantages of multifunctionality, broad bandwidth, and high robustness, which may have practical applications in advanced acoustic devices for computing and information processing.},

In this paper, by employing a lateral back-to-back Schottky junction composed of diketopyrrolopyrrole-based conjugated copolymer (DPPT-TT) and Au metal, the breakdown performance of copolymer organic semiconductor (OSC) is experimentally demonstrated. The nondestructive/repeatable breakdown behavior and positive coefficient between temperature and breakdown voltage indicate that the avalanche-like breakdown mechanism plays a dominant role in determining the breakdown characteristic of OSC-based power devices. Based on the lateral back-to-back Schottky junction, a characterization method of key breakdown parameters is proposed. The extracted critical electric field ( E C ) of DPPT-TT is up to 5.0 MV/cm, which is more than one order of magnitude higher than that of single-crystal silicon. Despite the fact that copolymer OSCs are narrow bandgap semiconductors, they still deliver excellent breakdown performance, making them a promising building block for future power electronics.},

At low gate voltages, the I d - V d curve can be divided into two sections of SCL current conduction with different SCL-conductance: the lower conductance in the lower drain voltage range and the higher conductance in the higher drain voltage range. Both low and high SCL-conductance increase with the gate voltage and illumination intensity. However, as the gate voltage increases to a certain threshold, the two SCL sections unify to only one with the conductance being between them. Our findings implicate that the current conduction of an ideal vertical organic phototransistor (VOPT), whose source/organic interface contact is Ohmic and organic semiconductor is trap free, can be well modeled by the SCL conduction theory with carrier density dependent mobility, which is strongly related to the gate voltage and illumination intensity, and that the mobility of VOPTs at a certain gate voltage can be extracted by the Mott–Gurney equation.},

The decoupling of electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient is noticed after 592 K, where the electrical conductivity ( σ ) is linearly increased and the Seebeck coefficient ( S ) is exponentially increased. The highest values of σ and S are 10.9 S cm −1 and 10312 nV K −1 at 734 K, respectively, and the highest power factor ( S 2 σ ) is 116 nW m −1 K −2 at 734 K. The calculated out-plane ( A 1 g ) displacement and the decreased A 1 g phonon lifetime are revealing the reduced phonon transport.

Such conducting surface states in 3D systems host “electron baths,” which are known to facilitate catalysis. However, the analogous effects in 2D scenarios wherein conducting helical edge states leading to Fermionic accumulation have been scarcely addressed. Using first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that the conducting edge states in 2D TIs, such as LiMgAs, can be exploited to facilitate excellent catalytic response toward hydrogen evolution reactions. The Gibbs free energy in such cases was found to be as low as −0.02 eV, which is quite superior compared to other materials reported in the literature. The concept presented herein can be extended to other well-known 2D TIs and used to realize unconventional topological quantum catalysts for ultra-high performance and efficient catalytic applications.},

Furthermore, x-ray diffraction unveils the presence of two different orientations of the same phase for thin films beyond a critical thickness of about 60 nm. This orientation change with increasing thickness can be explained as an extraordinary strain compensation mechanism, changing magnitude and sign of the strain at the same time. The polarization vs electric field behavior exposes a characteristic thickness dependence, with the antiferroelectric phase stabilized for very thin films and a field induced ferroelectric hysteresis for a film of 310 nm having a maximum polarization of 26.5 μ C cm − 2 ⁠ , which is among the highest values reported for NaNbO 3 thin films grown on SrTiO 3 (100).},

The tetragonal platelets oriented along three principle directions of the pseudo-cubic cell with the typical thickness of 1–2-unit cells were visualized at the atomic scale. Special AFE-like dipoles were formed by two antiparallel-polarized tetragonal platelets with a thickness of 2-unit cells, which are separated by a thin non-polar and tilt-free transition layer. Such locally structural components vary in both volume and/or size to a certain extent as changing temperature, chemical composition, and external electric field, phenomenologically showing AFE characteristics.

However, despite extensive research, there is an obvious lack of understanding of their magnetism. The chemical design strategy for obtaining multiferroism involves the incorporation of M 3+ magnetic cations at the B-site of well-known ferroelectric compounds such as Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 (m = 3). We report here a study of the magnetism and dielectric properties of Aurivillius Bi 4 Ti 3 − 2x Nb x Fe x O 12 phases with x ≥ 1 up to 1.2, which correspond to magnetic cation fractions at the B site between 0.33 and 0.4 above the threshold for percolation. This is a three-layer system, less prone to the formation of intergrowths, which nominally contains Fe 3+ as single magnetic species. Despite that, a rich phenomenology is uncovered. Coexisting magnetic orders are present in the Aurivillius compounds, and a Morin-like transition takes place at low temperatures. The dielectric characterization does not show any associated anomaly that could indicate a polymorphic phase transition but the appearance of relaxor-like characteristics. Possible scenarios are discussed, which involve the presence of Fe 2+ , cation partitioning between nonequivalent B-sites, and the development of polar nanodomains within a ferroelectric phase at a spin reorientation transition.},

However, less is known how the phase transformation behaves with the system size. Combined with molecular dynamic simulations and a machine learning model, we systematically investigate the temperature induced ferroic phase transformation in monolayer GeSe nanoribbons, which exhibits remarkable size effect. Specifically, the transformation hysteresis is found continuously decreased with ribbon width at the investigated scales. In contrast, the transformation temperature of monolayer GeSe nanoribbons shows non-monotonic size-dependency, i.e., it is first increased and then decreased as we narrow the GeSe nanoribbons. We attribute this to a competition between the enhanced ripple deformation, which will promote phase transformation upon cooling, and the stronger edge effect that can suppress phase transformation. In addition, the two factors are well captured by the Landau model, which will deepen our understanding of phase transformation behaviors in 2D ferroic materials.},

We systematically investigated the effect of 60 Co-gamma radiation and temperature on the ferroelectric properties of Pb(Zr 0.53 Ti 0.47 )O 3 films and their flexibility as well. Pb(Zr 0.53 Ti 0.47 )O 3 films exhibit a radiation and temperature tolerance of up to 20 Mrad and 175 °C, respectively. In particular, the 20 Mrad-irradiated Pb(Zr 0.53 Ti 0.47 )O 3 film has an excellent retention even after 10 5 s with extrapolate retention time longer than 10 years and polarization fatigue up to 10 10 cycles as well as moderate flexibility and bending stability after bending 10 5 cycles. Furthermore, we identified that the degradation of macroscopic ferroelectric properties of irradiated Pb(Zr 0.53 Ti 0.47 )O 3 films originates from the ferroelectric domain pinning effect induced by the ionization effect.

The degradation process is closely related to the change of the charge carrier transport mechanism as a function of E or T . Compared with the electric breakdown strength, the relationship between η and the charge carrier transport mechanisms in the dielectric thin films was less concerning. In this work, by increasing the trigger E and T of the space charge limited current mechanism, the beginning of the η degradation process was delayed into higher E and T . Consequently, a high U e (∼56.6 J/cm 3 ) and η (∼93.9\%) were achieved simultaneously in Ba 0.3 Sr 0.7 Zr 0.18 Ti 0.82 O 3 /LaNiO 3 heterostructure thin films directly deposited on low-cost conductive silicon wafers.

Moreover, it is found that the magnon antibunching inside a YIG2 sphere can be effectively regulated by manipulating the YIG1 sphere, for instance, the coupling strength of the YIG1 sphere and qubit and the driving strengths of the system.

  abstract     = {Fabrication of perpendicularly magnetized ferromagnetic films on various buffer layers, especially on numerous newly discovered spin–orbit torque (SOT) materials to construct energy-efficient spin-orbitronic devices, is a long-standing challenge. Even for the widely used CoFeB/MgO structures, perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) can only be established on limited buffer layers through post-annealing above 300 °C. Here, we report that the PMA of CoFeB/MgO films can be established reliably on various buffer layers in the absence of post-annealing. Further results show that precise control of MgO thickness, which determines oxygen diffusion in the underneath CoFeB layer, is the key to obtain the as-deposited PMA. Interestingly, contrary to the previous understanding, post-annealing does not significantly influence the well-established as-deposited PMA but indeed enhances unsaturated PMA with a thick MgO layer by modulating oxygen distributions, rather than crystallinity or Co– and Fe–O bonding. Moreover, our results indicate that oxygen diffusion also plays a critical role in PMA degradation at high temperatures. These results provide a practical approach to build spin-orbitronic devices based on various high-efficient SOT materials.},

  abstract     = {Weyl points (WPs) have been experimentally observed in optics and air-borne acoustic crystals. Although elastic Weyl physics has been theoretically studied, there is no experimental evidence to date. In this paper, WPs in the elastic wave field are investigated and realized in a synthetic three-dimensional (3D) space by one-dimensional (1D) phononic crystals with acoustic black hole structures. The synthetic 3D space constitutes one physical dimension and two geometrical parameters. Results show that the topological edge states and interface states can be directly observed. Furthermore, some WPs are experimentally visualized in an elastic wave system and the measured data are in good agreement with numerical predictions. This opens a new pathway for manipulating 1D elastic waves in an extraordinary way.},

  abstract     = {Acoustic metamaterials and metasurfaces have been explored in the past few years to realize a wide range of extreme responses for sound waves. As one remarkable phenomenon, extreme anisotropy and hyperbolic sound propagation are particularly challenging to realize compared to electromagnetic waves because of the scalar nature of airborne acoustics. In parallel, moiré superlattices and the rapidly expanding domain of twistronics have shown that large anisotropy combined with tailored geometrical rotations can enable tantalizing emerging phenomena, such as tailored phase transitions in metamaterials. Connecting these areas of research, here, we explore the realization of acoustic hyperbolic metasurfaces and their combination to drive topological phase transitions from hyperbolic to elliptic sound propagation. The transition point occurring at a specific rotation angle between two acoustic metasurfaces supports highly directional canalization of sound, opening exciting opportunities for twisted acoustics metasurfaces for robust surface wave guiding and steering.},

Uncovering phonon–phonon (ph–ph) interactions is a critical step in understanding its transport, especially thermal transport properties. Here, we report on the phonon anharmonicity in an exfoliated b-As flake using temperature-dependent polarized Raman spectroscopy from 80 to 300 K. Polarization of A g 2 mode helps identifying the crystalline orientation of the flake. A nonlinear redshift of peak frequencies of A g 1 ⁠ , B 2 g ⁠ , and A g 2 modes is observed along the given crystalline orientation. Contributions from intrinsic ph–ph interactions are extracted: cubic-phonon decay dominates the ph–ph scattering processes at low temperature, while cubic- and quartic-phonon decays together do at high temperature. It is further confirmed by the nonlinear full-width-at-half-maxima broadening. Our findings disclose the phonon anharmonicity in b-As and give insight for better understanding and utilizing its thermodynamic properties.},

Capacitances are realized beside and below the signal line. The ground plane is slotted to significantly reduce the propagation velocity of electromagnetic waves and improve the quality factor. Compared with a conventional microstrip line, the proposed slow-wave interconnect not only realizes a slow-wave factor up to 1.96 but also achieves a quality factor higher than 20 at 0.14–0.15 THz. In addition, a one-step data processing method is proposed to directly calculate the performance metrics of interconnects by using the measured S -parameters of device-under-test and the Thru calibration kit. For millimeter-wave and THz chips, the proposed slow-wave interconnect is a promising candidate to realize on-chip passive components with increased quality factor as well as reduced footprint and loss.},

Raman spectra reveal a good quality of the 3C-SiC layer, similar to the mono-crystalline 3C-SiC spectra. A relatively low transmission loss of ∼0.16 dB/mm at 40 GHz is measured for the device with 3C-SiC layer, rather than 2.1 dB/mm for the device without 3C-SiC. In addition, a soft breakdown voltage around 1530 V at 1 μ A/mm is achieved, which is three times larger compared with that of the conventional device. The failure mechanism, related to carrier injection at the nucleation layer, is not observed in the structure with the 3C-SiC layer.

In the second step, the Co oxide is organometallized with acetylacetone and desorbs at a high temperature of 210 °C that is suitable for organometallization and desorption. The etched amount per cycle is 0.6 nm, which is the same as the saturation amount of oxidation. A smooth etched surface is obtained after 20 cycles with a root mean square roughness of 0.53 nm, which is only slightly higher than the initial value of 0.34 nm. High etching selectivity over barrier metal of titanium-nitride was obtained. The two-step temperature cycle is crucial to achieve favorable etching with smooth etched surfaces.},

  abstract     = {The fact that the thermoelectric performance is far inferior to that of p -type PbTe has inspired many strategies to develop n -type PbTe thermoelectrics. Alloying PbS in n -type PbTe effectively changes the shape of a valley to trigger a heavier conduction band for improving the Seebeck coefficient, while the resulting small orbital overlap inevitably leads to phase separation hindering electron transport. The effect of vacancies on the solubility of sulfur in n -type PbTe is ambiguous; especially, the heterostructure due to phase separation in high-content PbS-alloyed PbTe also requires sufficient modification to optimize the electroacoustic transport. This motivates the current work on the introduction of vacancies by charge-balancing doping via Sb 2 Te 3 and discovers striking new insight that the introduced vacancies can induce a new heterostructure of Pb 2 Sb 2 S 5 and suppress the aggregation of Sb and PbS in high-solubility n -type PbTe–PbS. The modification of the band structure and optimization of the electron transport give rise to a prominent enhancement in electronic performance. Furthermore, the Debye–Callaway model validates the dramatic contribution of vacancy aggregation and heterostructures to lattice thermal conductivity. As a result, the synergistic modulation of electroacoustic characteristics achieves a significant improvement in both the maximum zT and the near-room-temperature zT . Understanding such unique findings is critical for applicability to other thermoelectric materials.},

Using both picosecond transient thermoreflectance and femtosecond time-domain thermoreflectance techniques, we observed a non-monotonic dependence of thermal conductivity on pressure. This trend is not caused by the pressure-modulated phonon–phonon scattering, which was predicted to only change the thermal conductivity by 10\%–20\%, but a result of several competing effects, including defect–phonon scattering and modification of structural defects under high pressure.

However, simultaneous measurement of I–V characteristics and strain did not detect the electrical-field-induced strain expected from the large volume contraction originating from the valence transition of Sm. Mid-infrared to visible region reflectivity spectroscopy in the field-induced transition revealed no spectral change other than the temperature change attributable to Joule heat. This lack of change contrasts to the large-scale spectrum changes, such as a sharp rise in reflectivity, which appear in the metallic phase induced by pressure or element substitution.

Long-term stability is a key limitation to date in restricting their further development and commercial application. In general, interface properties between a semiconductor and an electrode highly affect device performance and stability. Herein, contact characteristics between the perovskite and electrode varying with illumination status have been first investigated. The results suggest that device&#39;s contact resistance ( R C ), obtained from a transfer length method, decreases as the incident light intensity increases. The R C under a higher irradiation intensity (1.26 mW/cm 2 ) is about one-tenth of that at a lower density (0.08 mW/cm 2 ). Simulation has been performed and shows a similar trend with experimental results. The interface physical model has been discussed based on an energy band theory. The band bending and barrier modulation at the interface under light illumination are originated from the surface states and the localized charges. This work explains the interface in determining device&#39;s fundamental properties, including stability, R C variation, and charge carrier transport process. It is significant in understanding the device working mechanism and providing a potential way for perovskite optoelectronic devices with enhanced stability and performance.},

Despite the rapid development of PVOTs and the achievement of high-quality 1D and 2D particle patterning, research efforts aimed at the fabrication of combinatorial structures made up of multiple types of particles have been scarce. Here, we have established the working principles of three different methods to tackle this pending challenge. To that end, dielectrophoresis and/or electrophoresis acting on neutral and charged particles, respectively, have been suitably exploited. Simple mixed structures combining metallic and dielectric nanoparticles of different sizes have been obtained.

  abstract     = {Here, we propose a method to fabricate large-scale optoplasmonic hybrid materials (OHMs) as a near-field illumination source for sub-diffraction imaging through a traditional optical microscope. An OHM is comprised of a metal/dielectric multilayer coated substrate and a microcylinder (MC) placed on top of the multilayer. Under the dark-field illumination of a traditional optical microscope, the photonic nanojet (PNJ) generated by the MC and the electric field produced on the substrate surface by the photonic–plasmonic interaction work as the near-field illumination source for an object placed on the substrate near the PNJ. High spatial frequencies of the object can be shifted to the passband of the optical microscope and weak scattering signals of the object can be enhanced upon the near-field illumination. Low-contrast objects, such as a 300-nm-diameter SiO 2 nanoparticle array, two 100-nm-diameter polystyrene nanoparticles spaced ∼86 nm apart, and Escherichia coli can be resolved using the optical microscope. In addition, the field of view (FOV) is rectangular, the length of the FOV depends on the length of the MC, and the width relates to the diameter of the MC. The proposed method is wide-field, label-free, direct, noninvasive, and far-field, and it presents the potential of super-resolution imaging of unlabeled biological samples using a traditional optical microscope.},

TiN nanosheets have been prepared and characterized to show broadband and ultrafast nonlinear optical response with the maximum nonlinear absorption coefficient about − 5.05 × 10 − 8 m/W at its ENZ wavelength, which is about ten times larger than that at 400 nm. With the enhanced nonlinear absorption of TiN nanosheets, a passive photonic diode fabricated with TiN-C 60 in a tandem structure shows enhanced nonreciprocal transmission of femtosecond laser pulses with a nonreciprocity factor of 9.5 dB at the ENZ wavelength. The results show the potential applications of TiN nanosheets in ultracompact, polarization-independent, and physiochemically stable nonreciprocal light propagation and may pave way for the application of broadband ENZ-based all-optical devices.},

  abstract     = {Circularly polarized light plays a key role in many applications, including spectroscopy, microscopy, and control of atomic systems. Particularly in the latter, high polarization purity is often required. Integrated technologies for atomic control are progressing rapidly, but while integrated photonics can generate fields with pure linear polarization, integrated generation of highly pure circular polarization states has not been addressed. Here, we show that waveguide microring resonators, perturbed with azimuthal gratings and thereby emitting beams carrying optical orbital angular momentum, can generate radiated fields of high circular polarization purity. We achieve this in a passive device by taking advantage of symmetries of the structure and radiated modes, and directly utilizing both transverse and longitudinal field components of the guided modes. On the axis of emission and at the maximum intensity, we measure an average polarization impurity of 1.0 × 10 − 3 in relative intensity across the resonance FWHM and observe impurities below 10 − 4 in this range. This constitutes a significant improvement over the ∼ 10 − 2 impurity demonstrated in previous works on integrated devices. Photonic structures that allow high circular polarization purity may assist in realizing high-fidelity control and measurement in atomic quantum systems.},

Pressure is a powerful tool to tune crystal structures and physical properties of materials. Here, we systematically investigate the structural stability and optical properties of 4H-SnS 2 under high pressure. The crystal structure of 4H-SnS 2 is stable up to 56 GPa without structural transition and layer sliding. Continuous lattice contraction is accompanied by gradual bandgap narrowing, which is reversible after releasing pressure. The continuous and reversible modulation of the crystal structure and bandgap on 4H-SnS 2 suggest promising optoelectronic applications in the range of visible light based on two-dimensional layered metal dichalcogenides.},

In contrast, the three-mirror VCSEL has a linewidth more than ten times narrower than traditional VCSELs. Using a three-mirror VCSEL in a continuous-wave Cs vapor-cell atomic clock testbed, we demonstrate the utility of this laser for next-generation atomic devices in general, obtaining a short-term stability of 3.6 × 10 −12 / τ 1/2 without any attention to PM-to-AM mitigation strategies.},

Due to environmental damage and limited output power of lead-based materials, lead-free ferroelectrics are highly desirable. Here, the electrical response of 0.9BiFeO 3 -0.1BaTiO 3 (BFO-BT) ferroelectric ceramics under shock-wave compression was reported, and a record-high power density of 4.21 × 10 8 W/kg was obtained, which was much higher than any existing lead-based ceramics and other available energy storage materials. By in situ high-pressure neutron diffraction, the mechanism of shock-induced depolarization of the BFO-BT ceramics was attributed to pressure-induced structural transformation, and the excellent performance was further elaborated by analyzing magnetic structure parameters under high pressures.

  abstract     = {The output performance of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) is fatally determined by the capacitive capability of triboelectric electrodes. One promising solution is embedding conductive fillers in triboelectric polymers, typically carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). Each CNT will serve as a capacitor in the PDMS matrix to store electric energy through polarization. However, the CNTs are easily cross-linked with each other, which makes the triboelectric materials conductive or semi-conductive. The output voltage will be limited due to current leaks through conducting or tunneling, and thus, suppress the energy harvesting efficiency of TENGs. Here, we propose to use an insulation layer to wrap CNTs to avoid direct-contact between CNTs and improve the overall performance of TENGs. Our results show that the leakage current has been significantly suppressed and the output performance of TENGs has been dramatically improved. This work provides a material design idea, which is expected to become a universal method to improve the output performance of TENGs.},

  abstract     = {Formation of severe adhesion on electrosurgical devices during their interaction with biofluids is an inherent problem that often causes reduced cutting efficiency and failed hemostasis. The introduction of (super-) hydrophobic surfaces is a favorable option for anti-adhesion, but the mechanisms related to their evolution with biofluids under electric fields are still not fully understood. Here, we investigated the evolution of blood plasma droplets on a superhydrophobic microstructured (SHM) surface under direct-current (DC) and alternating-current (AC) electric fields. The electrolysis of plasma droplets leads to the formation and diffusion of bubbles accompanied by a rise in temperature, while in turn, the electrolysis is suppressed as the bubbles fill the droplets, followed by a decrease in temperature. We show that under the DC electric field, the bubbles produced by papillae on the SHM surface can effectively prevent directional adsorption of plasma proteins compared to the flat surface, whereas the AC electric field induces oscillations in plasma proteins, resulting in even less adhesion. These findings provide valuable basic information for understanding the anti-adhesion mechanism of electrosurgical devices at a microscopic level.},

  abstract     = {Van der Waals heterostructures show potential in electronic and optoelectronic devices. However, most heterostructures were formed based on the combination of two kinds two-dimensional (2D) materials. It is interesting to investigate the heterostructures of three kinds of 2D materials with unique band structure for photodetection and tunneling. In this work, vertical stacked WSe 2 /black phosphorus (BP)/MoS 2 heterostructure has been made. By tuning the middle layer BP thickness from thin to thick, the device can be regarded as tunneling transistor and photodetector. Throughout thin BP (9 nm) sandwiched, tunneling transistor is realized in WSe 2 /BP/MoS 2 heterojunction with a high ∼μA level tunneling current. Temperature dependent electrical characteristics proved tunneling mechanism. Throughout thicker BP (20–30 nm) flake sandwiched, high-performance photodetector can be achieved. The large bandgap of WSe 2 and MoS 2 can further reduce the dark current to ∼10 pA level at 3.0 V drain–source bias. Moreover, the unique band alignment facilitates the photo-electrons flow and blocked photo-holes in the BP channel. The photoresponsivity can reach 1.43 A/W at near infrared light with λ = 1342 nm. Our work suggests an effective scheme to design high performance electronic and optoelectronic devices assembled by 2D materials.},

However, the chemical activity of lithium ion electrolytes during device fabrication is detrimental to the analog switching stability of the Li-EGT and limits its potential application. In this work, we developed a silica protective process for Li-EGT fabrication. By continuously depositing the lithium ion electrolyte and silica protective layer, we achieved the isolation of the electrolyte from the external environment during device fabrication. The electrical characterization shows that the analog switching stability of the fabricated Li-EGT is significantly improved. Based on the experimental data, a recognition accuracy of ∼96\% has been demonstrated in the Li-EGT array by simulations using the handwritten digit data sets. The present results give insight into the large-scale fabrication of the Li-EGT synapse for neuromorphic computing.},

We demonstrate the dependence of CR on the molecule length, the chirality-inversion ratio, and the chirality mismatch.

  abstract     = {Diverse wavefront modulations with multifunctional acoustic devices have been of great interest to physics and engineering communities. However, traditional design methods of multifunctional acoustic devices rely on a deterministic physical model and redundant iterative optimization, resulting in inflexibility and consuming of time. In this work, we present and experimentally implement a deep learning-assisted tunable acoustic metagrating for multifunctional wavefront modulation with 95.2\% accuracy and a 10 5 order of magnitude decrease in computational time compared to a classical optimization method. The presented tunable structure formed by a periodic array of 3C-shaped unit cells excites controllable Willis coupling, exhibiting corresponding asymmetrical scattering patterns. With the support of a deep learning strategy, the optimal configuration between structure parameters and Willis coupling magnitude could be efficiently confirmed, realizing various extraordinary wavefront modulations, including abnormal reflection, perfect beam splitting, and multi-channel energy distribution in arbitrary ratios. The polarizability tensor retrieval method is used to characterize the Willis coupling of different modulation structures, demonstrating the refined abstraction of the deep learning strategy on Willis coupling. Meanwhile, the numerical and experimental results are in good agreement with the desired wavefront modulation, verifying the effectiveness of the proposed method. Our work develops deep learning-assisted multifunctional wavefront modulation with the advantages of high accuracy, efficiency, flexibility, and refined abstraction of a physical mechanism, paving the way for a combination of deep learning and pragmatic multifunctional acoustic applications.},

Importantly, γ -GeSe/NbS 2 is an Ohmic contact while γ -GeSe/Bi is an n -type Schottky contact with an ultralow barrier height of 0.07 eV. For γ -GeSe/graphene contact, the electronic properties can be adjusted via the interlayer distance or via an external electric field.

Here, we show the control of the interlayer coupling in Janus WSSe/WS 2 heterostructures by changing the stacking order. Low-frequency Raman measurements revealed that heterostructures with the S/S interface show strong interlayer coupling compared to those with the S/Se interface. In the case of the S/S interface, photoluminescence (PL) from WS 2 was quenched due to charge transfer in the type-II band alignment, while, interestingly, in the case of the S/Se interface, it was enhanced. The stacking-order dependence of the interlayer coupling and photoluminescence are attributed to the direction of interfacial electric field caused by broken out-of-plane mirror symmetry in a WSSe layer. In the case of the S/S interface, the interfacial electric field promotes the charge transfer as evidenced by strong PL quenching. On the contrary, in heterostructures with the S/Se interface, the charge transfer is blocked as the electric field prevents carrier transfer and modulates the band offset. Our results clearly show that Janus TMDCs with intrinsic fields can be effectively used to manipulate the interlayer interactions and optical properties in heterostructures.},

Contact resistance and resistivity were improved by factors up to 2 × 10 6 and 2 × 10 4 ⁠ , respectively, in devices based on exfoliated flakes of two topological semimetals, ZrSiSe and BaMnSb 2 . Using this method, carrier mobility in ZrSiSe was improved by a factor of 3800, resulting in observation of record-high mobility for exfoliated ZrSiSe. Quantum oscillations in annealed ZrSiSe appeared at magnetic fields as low as 5 T, and magnetoresistance increased by a factor of 10 4 . We argue that a thermal process underlies this improvement. Finally, Raman spectroscopy and analysis of quantum oscillations in ZrSiSe indicate that the phonon modes and Fermi surface area are unchanged by current annealing.},

  abstract     = {An A-site disordered high entropy perovskite (Pb 1/6 Ba 1/6 Sr 1/6 Ca 1/6 Na 1/6 Bi 1/6 )TiO 3 (PBSCNBi) ceramic was prepared by a solid-state reaction method. XRD and scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive x ray confirmed a single-phase tetragonal solid solution. Dielectric and hysteresis loop measurements showed relaxor ferroelectricity at room temperature; Curie Weiss fitting gives a Burns temperature (T b ) of 123 °C, and Vogel–Fulcher fitting gives a freezing temperature (T f ) of −67.24 °C, which confirms the room-temperature relaxor ferroelectricity of PBSCNBi. This is attributed to local chemical inhomogeneities in the high entropy ceramics. PBSCNBi also has a low thermal conductivity (1.15 W m −1 K −1 at room temperature) compared to all of its constituent simple perovskites (e.g., BaTiO 3 , PbTiO 3 , SrTiO 3 CaTiO 3 , and Na 1/2 Bi 1/2 TiO 3 in the range of 25–100 °C), which is attributed to the enhanced phonon scattering by both polar nanoregions and the mass contrast effect in the multi-element perovskite. This work demonstrates the great potential of making A-site high entropy ceramics with relaxor ferroelectric properties.},

  abstract     = {Multilayer superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) have exhibited several advantages, such as increased detection efficiency, reduced polarization sensitivity, and scaling up to large arrays. However, monolithic fabrication of such multilayer devices is challenging. In this work, a hybrid integration method has been introduced by etching SNSPDs into the membrane microchips, followed by the pick and place transferring process. This method has been verified by stacking two SNSPDs orthogonally. Both detectors show near saturated detection efficiencies and low timing jitters. Furthermore, thermal coupling effects have been observed between the two SNSPDs. The photon detection pulses from either detector can trigger the other one almost deterministically with a latency of several nanoseconds. This method offers a flexible way to fabricate multilayer SNSPDs or integrate them with other heterogeneous devices.},

However, the in-plane electric current itself is not enough to switch the magnetization. In addition to the electric current, an in-plane external magnetic field is required for magnetization switching. This limits the usage of such devices in spintronic applications. Here, we work on the current-driven perpendicular magnetization switching in the Pt/Ta(wedge)/CoFeB/MgO multilayer. The structural symmetry is broken in both z -axis and in-plane due to the wedge Ta layer, which results in a field-like spin–orbit torque. The β z value extracted from the slope of the offset field vs current density increases with Ta layer thickness (&lt;1.0 nm) and then decreases up to &lt;1.3 nm. Thanks to both in-plane and z -axis asymmetries that enable the current-driven magnetization switching without the need for a magnetic field.

Up to now, the main focus of the theoretically predicted TMX 3 monolayers has been on the Chern insulator states, which can realize the quantum anomalous Hall effect. Here, using first-principles calculations, we theoretically demonstrate that the stable OsCl 3 monolayer has a ferromagnetic ground state and a spin-polarized Dirac point without spin–orbit coupling (SOC), which disappears in the band structure of a Janus OsBr 1.5 Cl 1.5 monolayer. We find that OsCl 3 exhibits in-plane magnetization when SOC is included. By manipulating the magnetization direction along the C 2 symmetry axis of the OsCl 3 structure, a gapless half-Dirac semimetal state with SOC can be achieved, which is different from the gapped Chern insulator state. Both semimetal states of OsCl 3 monolayer without and with SOC exhibit a linear half-Dirac point (twofold degenerate) with high Fermi velocities. The achievement of the 2D semimetal state with SOC is expected to be found in other TMX 3 monolayers, and we confirm it in a TiCl 3 monolayer. This provides a different perspective to study the band structure with SOC of the 2D TMX 3 family.},

Their spectral weight can be tuned by the choice of amplitude and frequency of the input signals.

Specifically, we observe that when the in-plane bias field is along the current ( I ∥ H bias ), switching is dominated by the Rashba field, while the Dresselhaus field dominates magnetization reversal when the bias field is perpendicular to the current ( I ⊥ H bias ).

However, the intriguing magnetic ground state of Fe 5− x GeTe 2 is quite complicated and remains controversial. In this work, we investigate the magnetic ordering transitions in Fe 5− x GeTe 2 nanoflakes through magneto-transport measurements. The anomalous Hall resistance increases with rising temperature, reaching its maximum at 100 K. Meanwhile, a clear butterfly-shaped magnetoresistance hysteresis was observed with opposite dependence on the switching field around this critical temperature. All experimental results point to the scenario that Fe 5− x GeTe 2 transitions from the paramagnetic to ferromagnetic state at 265 K and then evolves to a ferrimagnetic state at 100 K. Our work promotes the understanding of magnetism in Fe 5− x GeTe 2 and motivates further efforts to develop room-temperature spintronic devices based on Fe 5− x GeTe 2 .},

Here, we demonstrate that the Ta/Pt/Co/Pt multilayers grown on R-, T-, and mixed-phase BFO exhibit perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. We find that the magnetic switching behavior of the multilayer is sensitive to the phase of the BFO layer. The Ta/Pt/Co/Pt layers grown on top of the pure R- or T-phase BFO show one-step anomalous Hall effect (AHE) switching. However, the layers grown on the mixed-phase BFO show steplike AHE switching.

  abstract     = {Efficient heat dissipation in micro/nano electronics requires long-distance propagation of heat carriers operated above room temperature. However, thermal phonons—the primary heat carriers in dielectric nanomaterials—dissipate the thermal energy after just a few hundred nanometers. Theory predicts that the mean free path of surface phonon-polaritons (SPhPs) can be hundreds of micrometers, which may improve the overall dissipation of heat in nanomaterials. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate such long-distance heat transport by SPhPs. Using the 3 ω technique, we measure the in-plane thermal conductivity of SiN nanomembranes for different heater-sensor distances, membrane thicknesses, and temperatures. We find that thin nanomembranes support heat transport by SPhPs, as evidenced by an increase in the thermal conductivity with temperature. Remarkably, the thermal conductivity measured 200 μ m away from the heater is consistently higher than that measured 100 μ m closer. This result suggests that heat conduction by SPhPs is quasi-ballistically over at least hundreds of micrometers. Our findings pave the way for coherent heat manipulations above room temperature over macroscopic distances, which impacts the applications in thermal management and polaritonics.},

We show that between 800 and 950 K, the in-plane and cross-plane thermal conductivity has an average decrease of 38\% and 19\%, respectively, when four-phonon scatterings are considered. This large suppression of phonon transport stems mainly from the strong redistribution scattering process.

Thanks to its outstanding LPE characteristics, the appliance also exhibits an impressive performance in UV image sensing, even in environment reliability testing. Given these remarkable features of the sensor, this work not only proposes a strategy to improve the performance of UV detectors, but also provides a practical solution for UV image sensing applications.},

  abstract     = {We report two-photon excited ultrafast carrier trapping and recombination in n-type β -Ga 2 O 3 crystals by using femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. The broadband absorption spectra arising from the defect are polarization dependent, especially, two absorption peaks can be observed by subtracting the absorption transients under two probe polarizations. We attribute these observed defect-related absorption features to optical transitions from the valence band to different charge states of a native defect (such as gallium vacancies). A model for carrier capture by multilevel of a single defect is proposed to interpret the data, wherein holes are captured more efficiently than electrons by the defects, and the absorption cross sections for the defects are at least ten times larger than that for free carriers. Our results reveal the potential applications of β -Ga 2 O 3 in ultrafast and broadband optoelectronic devices.},

The sequence of structural phase transitions at pressures was determined as I 4 1 / a → C 2/ c → P 2 1 / c by the Crystal structure AnaLYsis by Particle Swarm Optimization (CALYPSO) method. A pressure-induced conduction transition from mixed ionic–electronic to pure electronic conduction was observed. Below 25.6 GPa, O 2− ions play a major role in the electrical transport process. The microscopic transport mechanism was analyzed with grain boundary energies and migration energy barriers. Above 26.9 GPa, the grain boundary response was weakened significantly after a pressure cycle, and the grain boundary conductivity increased by about three times due to pressure. These results provide guidelines for the optimization and application of scheelite ABO 4 -based oxygen ionic conductors in solid oxide fuel cells.},

However, realizing high-performance photodetectors based on 2D NGSs with high photoresponsivity, low noise, and fast response speed remains a challenge. Here, we present the design, preparation, and characterization of an In 2(1− x ) Sb 2 x Se 3 SWIR photodetector. Trivalent antimony (Sb 3+ ) substitutional doping not only induced the β′-β phase transition at room temperature but also made the alloy a good candidate for the p-type semiconductor. Moreover, the individual In 1.75 Sb 0.25 Se 3 nanoflake realized an excellent photoresponse in a broadband range from visible (405 nm) to SWIR (1550 nm) light with a photoresponsivity of 134 A W −1 and a detectivity of 1.82 × 10 7 Jones. These performances were superior to the reported In 2 Se 3 , Sb 2 Se 3 , and other In or Sb selenide photodetectors, which indicated that the β-In 2(1− x ) Sb 2 x Se 3 alloy may provide a potential building block for short-wave infrared photodetectors.},

Among various functionalities, the amplitude control of the harmonic waves is usually achieved by varying the fundamental frequency and the pumping power. However, these kinds of methods lack the ability to control the energy distributions of the nonlinear waves at different diffraction orders. Here, we report the continuous intensity control of the harmonic waves from the plasmonic metasurfaces through interference paths. The metasurfaces consist of geometric phase controlled gold meta-atoms with threefold rotational symmetry. By controlling the relative phase of two neighboring metasurface paths, the intensity of the diffracted second harmonic waves can be artificially modulated. Our findings suggest that the conventional interference technique represents a powerful route for controlling the radiation of the nonlinear waves from sub-wavelength meta-atoms and may have great applications in developing ultra-compact nonlinear optical sources.},

Ar plasma treatment is found to introduce a large number of oxygen vacancies, which effectively adjusts the electronic and chemical characteristics of the p-type NiO films to afford improved response to toxic triethylamine. The effects of the thickness of the sensing layer on sensor properties are also studied, which reveals that the NiO film with a thickness of 40 nm has the greatest gas sensing performance. After Ar plasma treatment, the response of the NiO thin films is significantly enhanced to enable an excellent limit of detection of 27.4 ppb, which is much lower than the threshold limit of 1 ppm proposed by American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists.

As with the undoped AlN film, the formation of an oxide overlayer on the air-exposed ScAlN film can modulate its surface structure and the electrical properties. In this study, we investigate the effects of surface oxidation on a ScAlN film by characterizing the film microstructure and the elemental chemical states. We found that amorphous phase and small crystallites co-exist in the oxide overlayer, which is remarkably different from the columnar (0002) crystalline texture in the bulk ScAlN film. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy core-level analyses confirm the formation of Al–O and Sc–O bonds. Moreover, the valence band maximum of the oxide overlayer shifts toward a higher binding energy, indicating a high energy barrier at the ScAlN/metal interface. Our results suggest that ScAlN surface oxidation is a chemical reaction-driven and self-limited process.},

Different from isostructural perovskite-type interfaces, the spinel/perovskite heterointerface of γ -Al 2 O 3 /SrTiO 3 (GAO/STO) enables us to control interfacial states with sub-unit-cell precision. Herein, we present the epitaxial growth of fractionally doped GAO/STO heterointerfaces, where GAO is precisely doped on the scale of 1/4-unit-cell (0.2 nm) by ferromagnetic Fe 3 O 4 and nonmagnetic ZnO atomic layers. Notably, the conduction of the engineered interfaces depends critically on the position of the dopant, where a coexistence of electron and hole conduction is measured at even sublayer-doped GAO/STO interfaces. First-principles density functional theory calculations indicate that electron conductivity is from the interfacial TiO 2 layers of the STO substrate, while the hole conductivity is from the Zn-doped GAO film. The presence of hole conduction can be explained from the alternating structural feature of a doped layer without oxygen vacancies. This work sheds additional insight on the emergence of 2DHG at oxide interfaces and provides opportunities for atomically engineered oxide interfaces with non-isostructural layers.},

Epitaxial TGO films were grown by plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy on (−201) oriented n-type β - Ga 2 O 3 substrates. Fabricated vertical Schottky devices exhibited peak responsivities as high as 3.5 × 10 4 A/W at −5 V applied bias under 250 nm illumination with sharp cutoff shorter than 280 nm and fast rise/fall time in milliseconds order. Hyperspectral imaging cathodoluminescence (CL) spectra were examined to find the mid-bandgap defects, the source of this high gain. Irrespective of different tin mole fractions, the TGO epilayer exhibited extra CL peaks at the green band (∼2.20 eV) not seen in β - Ga 2 O 3 along with enhancement of the blue emission-band (∼2.64 eV) and suppression of the UV emission-band. Based on hybrid functional calculations of the optical emission expected for defects involving Sn in β - Ga 2 O 3 ⁠ , V Ga –Sn complexes are proposed as potential defect origins of the observed green and blue emission-bands. Such complexes behave as acceptors that can efficiently trap photogenerated holes and are predicted to be predominantly responsible for the ultra-high photoconductive gain in the Sn-alloyed Ga 2 O 3 devices by means of thermionic emission and electron tunneling. Regenerating the V Ga –Sn defect complexes by optimizing the growth techniques, we have demonstrated a planar Schottky UV-C photodetector of the highest peak responsivity.},

In situ photoisomerizations of the single crystal trapped in the system were performed thrice revealing a reversible change in the trapping force. The trapping stiffness for the colored crystal was one-third of that for the decolorized crystal in the axial direction, whereas almost no difference was observed in the transverse direction. Furthermore, based on the intermittent motion and asymmetry of the positional distribution of the trapped crystals, we inferred that the motion includes transitions through multiple stable sites, and the ease of the transition is related to the isomerization state of the crystals. Such switching of optical trapping indicates the possibility of revealing the physical properties of trapped materials through trapping schemes, and the nonlinearity in the trapping is also expected to be applied to advanced computing with physical phenomena.},

Hence, a wire-shaped photoelectrochemical type ultraviolet photodetector based on photoanode of TiO 2 nanotube arrays (TNAs) fabricated by electrochemical anodization is demonstrated in this work. The TNAs can provide direct pathways for carriers and large internal surface area. The assembled UV detector presented a high photocurrent density of 110 μ A cm −2 , a high ON/OFF ratio of 467, and a fast rise and decay response time of 13 and 19 ms for the optimal thickness of the photoanode of TNAs. Moreover, the detectors also exhibited visible-blind characteristics and an excellent linear response even under weak irradiation (20–100 μ W cm −2 ). The results are beneficial to realizing omnidirectional and wearable optoelectronic devices.},

  abstract     = {Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are remarkable electrochemical energy storage systems, which play a critical role in modern society. Demanding new applications have been pushing for further battery advancements, such as developments of all-solid-state and sodium-ion batteries. However, both the LIBs and these new technologies still face challenges that limit their full realization. These include irreversible electrochemical reactions, electrode structure degradations, and surface/interface side reactions. Solving them requires comprehensive characterizations of battery systems over multiple length and time scales. Among the advanced probing techniques, neutron-based ones have unique advantages in exploring battery material structures, ionic diffusions, electrochemical reactions, and cell failure mechanisms, information that will aid the development of next-generation high-performance battery systems. In this Perspective, we briefly review the principles and characteristics of various neutron techniques and their recent applications in battery system studies. Operando neutron characterizations of batteries on spatiotemporal scales and prospects of their future designs and applications are discussed.},

Moreover, we assess its potential in terms of the number of available independent pixels at full resolution compared to different quantum imaging approaches. Finally, we demonstrate scanning quantum microscopy of onion epithelial cells, paving the way toward scalable quantum microscopy for bio-physical applications.

  abstract     = {Wide-bandgap semiconductors are more advantageous for betavoltaic batteries due to their high conversion efficiency and strong radiation resistance. However, there has been little comprehensive analysis of how wide-bandgap semiconductors lead to efficiency improvements. In this work, we proposed a simulation model to predict the output performance of betavoltaic batteries based on 4H-SiC, hexagonal-GaN, and diamond, in which the Monte Carlo code and COMSOL Multiphysics software were combined. The energy deposition of a 63 Ni source in semiconductors and the electrical characteristics of p–n junctions were investigated and compared. Our simulation results showed that the mass density and atomic number of semiconductor materials will cause the difference in energy deposition distribution, further leading to the different electron–hole pair generation rates. Then, the internal efficiency of batteries is co-determined by the energy band structure, depletion region width, built-in potential barrier, and minority carrier lifetime. The batteries based on wide-bandgap semiconductors can achieve the larger open-circuit voltage, further leading to higher efficiency. Additionally, to optimize the energy converter structure, the output parameters were calculated with a variation of doping concentrations and thicknesses of each region. Under the irradiation of a 63 Ni source, the diamond-based battery with a p–n junction structure has the highest internal efficiency of 31.3\%, while the GaN-based battery has the lowest one (16.8\%), which can be attributed to the larger carrier recombination rate.},

The presence of CFO in the PVDF matrix enhances the ferroelectric β phase fraction of PVDF from 59\% to 75\% and also provides magnetic tunability to the PENG device. With the application of a 2.1 kG field, there is 2.33 times increment in instantaneous output power of the PENG, which is attributed to a decrease in the resistance of the nanocomposite film due to the alignment of the magnetic moment of CFO nanoparticles leading to a reduction in the scattering of mobile charges.

However, image degradations are difficult to estimate due to a lack of knowledge of the point spread function and noise sources, resulting in poor generalization capability of the trained super-resolution model. In this work, a high-order residual cascade neural network was developed to reconstruct high-resolution vascular images, which is a neural approximating approach used to remove image degradations of photoacoustic angiography. To handle overfitting in training super-resolution model with a limited dataset, we proposed a BicycleGAN based image synthesis method in data preparation, achieving a strong regularization by forging realistic photoacoustic vascular images that act to essentially increase the training dataset. The quantitative analysis of the reconstructed results shows that the high-order residual cascade neural network surpassed the other residual super-resolution neural networks. Most importantly, we demonstrated that the generalized model could be achieved despite the limited training dataset, promising to be a methodology for few-shot super-resolution photoacoustic angiography.},

  abstract     = {Tunneling-injection structures are incorporated in semiconductor lasers in order to overcome the fundamental dynamical limitation due to hot carrier injection by providing a carrier transport path from a cold carrier reservoir. The tunneling process itself depends on band alignment between quantum-dot levels and the injector quantum well, especially as in these devices LO-phonon scattering is dominant. Quantum dots with their first excited state near the quantum well bottom profit the most from tunnel coupling. As inhomogeneous broadening is omnipresent in quantum dot structures, this implies that individual members of the ensemble couple differently to the injector quantum well. Quantum dots with higher energy profit less, as the phonon couples to higher, less occupied states. Likewise, if the energy difference between ground state and quantum well exceeds the LO-phonon energy, scattering becomes increasingly inefficient. Therefore, within 20–30 meV, we find quantum dots that benefit substantially different from the tunnel coupling. Furthermore, in quantum dots with increasing confinement depth, excited states become successively confined. Here, scattering gets more efficient again, as subsequent excited states reach the phonon resonance with the quantum well bottom. Our results provide guidelines for the optimization of tunnel-injection lasers. Theoretical results for electronic state calculations in connection with carrier–phonon and carrier–carrier scattering are compared to the experimental results of the temporal gain recovery after a short pulse perturbation.},

  abstract     = {Since the discovery of Dirac semimetal graphene, two-dimensional (2D) Weyl semimetals (WSMs) have been widely used in low-energy photon detection, polarization imaging, and other systems due to their rich physical characteristics, such as unique nonlinear optical structure, topological nontrivial electronic structure, thickness-tunable bandgap, high electric conductivity, and so on. However, it is difficult to detect the photocurrent signal at room temperature because of its large intrinsic background current. Fortunately, the fabrication of a van der Waals (vdW) heterojunction based on WSM can effectively suppress the background current, greatly extend the detection range, improve the light absorption efficiency, and increase the response speed. Herein, the 2D type-II WSM 1T′-WTe 2 /bulk GaAs vdW vertical Schottky diode is investigated. Benefiting from the lateral built-in electric field of 260 meV and zero-bandgap structure of 52 nm 1T′-WTe 2 , it delivers a rectifying ratio over 10 3 and can respond to the wavelength range of 400–1100 nm. Particularly, when the light power density is 0.02 mW/cm 2 , the maximum photoresponsivity (R) and specific detectivity (D * ) under 808 nm are 298 mA/W and 1.70 × 10 12 Jones, respectively. Meanwhile, the I light /I dark ratio and response time are 10 3 and 520/540 μ s, respectively. Moreover, an abnormal negative response behavior can be observed with thin WTe 2 (11 nm) under 1064 nm illumination because of the open surface bandgap. It is suggested that such 2D WTe 2 /GaAs mixed-dimensional vdW structure can be extended to other WSM/3D semiconductor junctions and used in fast response and wide broadband spectrum photodetectors&#39; arrays.},

Accurate setting of the cavity length, and thereby the resonance wavelength, is accomplished by using doping-selective electrochemical etching of AlGaN sacrificial layers for substrate removal combined with deposition of dielectric spacer layers. By matching the resonance wavelength to the quantum-wells photoluminescence peak, a threshold power density of 0.4 MW/cm 2 was achieved, and this was possible only for smooth etched surfaces with a root mean square roughness below 2 nm.

Combining phase-field simulations and entropy analysis, we establish the correlations between local electrocaloric responses and domains for ferroelectric crystals and investigate the local electrocaloric responses in different domain structures. The results reveal that both initial 180° and 90° domain walls (referring to stable domain walls before electric excitation) exhibit large positive electrocaloric responses due to the increased polarization under the applied electric field, where the responses of the initial 180° domain walls are more significant. The final 180° domain walls (referring to stable domain walls after electric excitation) show large negative electrocaloric responses, since the polarization changes from nonzero to zero under the applied electric field. Good agreement between simulations and experimental measurements is observed. In addition, as the domain wall density increases, the macroscopic average electrocaloric response can be enhanced multiplicatively, suggesting that increasing domain wall density is an alternative pathway to enhance electrocaloric response in ferroelectrics.},

  abstract     = {The development of the next generation of flexible electronics for biomedical applications requires the implementation of flexible active elements, potentially microcontrollers. The further step in this direction includes the development of devices for data processing directly on-chip, in particular, devices for neuromorphic computing. One of the key elements put forward within this paradigm is the memristor—the device emulating the plasticity of biological synapses. Due to the internal temporal dynamics of conductance, second-order memristors exhibit the most natural emulation of a biological synapse. Among different types of second-order memristors, ferroelectric memristors show the best cell-to-cell and cycle-to-cycle reproducibility. Here, we demonstrate a flexible ferroelectric second-order memristor on a mica substrate based on the 5-nm-thick polycrystalline Hf 0.5 Zr 0.5 O 2 film. The conductance (synaptic weight) modulation with R OFF / R ON ratio ∼ 20 is achieved via the gradual switching of the ferroelectric domains affecting the potential barrier in the structure. The devices demonstrate high reproducibility and various synaptic functionalities, including paired-pulse potentiation and paired-pulse depression. Functional properties persist both during static bending and after more than 100 bending cycles with a radius down to 1 cm.},

  abstract     = {Although superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) are a promising technology for quantum optics, metrology, and astronomy, they currently lack a readout architecture that is scalable to the megapixel regime and beyond. In this work, we have designed and demonstrated such an architecture for SNSPDs, called the thermally coupled imager (TCI). The TCI uses a combination of time-of-flight delay lines and thermal coupling to create a scalable architecture that can scale to large array sizes, allows neighboring detectors to operate independently, and requires only four microwave readout lines to operate no matter the size of the array. We give an overview of how the architecture functions and demonstrate a proof-of-concept 32 × 32 imaging array. The array was able to image a free-space focused spot at 373 nm, count at 9.6 Mcps, and resolve photon location with greater than 99.83\% distinguishability.},

  abstract     = {Non-reciprocity in the critical current has been observed in a variety of superconducting systems and has been called the superconducting diode effect. The origin underlying the effect depends on the symmetry breaking mechanisms at play. We investigate superconducting micro-bridges of NbN and also NbN/magnetic insulator (MI) hybrids. We observe a large diode efficiency of ≈ 30\% when an out-of-plane magnetic field as small as 25 mT is applied. In both NbN and NbN/MI hybrid, we find that the diode effect vanishes when the magnetic field is parallel to the sample plane. Our observations are consistent with the critical current being determined by the vortex surface barrier. Unequal barriers on the two edges of the superconductor strip result in the diode effect. Furthermore, the rectification is observed up to 10 K, which makes the device potential for diode based applications over a larger temperature range than before.},

  abstract     = {We demonstrate using micromagnetic simulations that a nanomagnet array excited by surface acoustic waves (SAWs) can work as a reservoir. An input nanomagnet is excited with focused SAW and coupled to several nanomagnets, seven of which serve as output nanomagnets. To evaluate memory effect and computing capability, we study the short-term memory (STM) and parity check (PC) capacities, respectively. The SAW (4 GHz carrier frequency) amplitude is modulated to provide a sequence of sine and square waves of 100 MHz frequency. The responses of the selected output nanomagnets are processed by reading the envelope of their magnetization states, which is used to train the output weights using the regression method. For classification, a random sequence of 100 square and sine wave samples is used, of which 80\% are used for training, and the rest are used for testing. We achieve 100\% training and 100\% testing accuracy. The average STM and PC are calculated to be ∼4.69 and ∼5.39 bits, respectively, which is indicative of the proposed acoustically driven nanomagnet oscillator array being well suited for physical reservoir computing applications. The energy dissipation is ∼2.5 times lower than a CMOS-based echo-state network. Furthermore, the reservoir is able to accurately predict Mackey-Glass time series up to several time steps ahead. Finally, the ability to use high frequency SAW makes the nanomagnet reservoir scalable to small dimensions, and the ability to modulate the envelope at a lower frequency (100 MHz) adds flexibility to encode different signals beyond the sine/square waves classification and Mackey-Glass predication tasks demonstrated here.},

The introduction of phononic crystals enables the direct observation of this phenomenon from a different point, giving rise to a broader application prospect. In this paper, we aim at realizing the Klein tunneling for elastic plate waves. To this end, we combine two kinds of Y-shaped phononic crystals with different Dirac point energies to structure a sandwich-like plate, which supports the propagation of Lamb waves while artificially introducing a potential barrier. Under such a configuration, perfect wave transmission regardless of the barrier in a wide frequency range can be realized, which also enables the numerical prediction and experimental observation of the Klein tunneling phenomenon in Lamb waves. The results of this work provide a direction and reference for the design and applications of phononic crystal devices, such as the chip-scale elastic waveguides.},

Further analysis of x-ray diffraction and x-ray photoelectron spectra results confirmed that there were more oxygen vacancies formed in cubic phase SMO than monoclinic phase SMO, thereby offering more active sites for fast ion transport. Furthermore, both cubic phase and monoclinic phase SMOs are dominated by proton conduction, while cubic phase SMO is further coupled with oxygen ion conduction, which leads to higher ionic conductivity of cubic phase SMO. In this study, the ionic conductivities of SMOs with different crystal structures are compared and reasons for the differences are disclosed, which provides guidance for further applications of SMO.},

Defect calculations point to cation and oxygen vacancies as the dominant intrinsic point defects limiting extrinsic doping. While acceptor behaving Al and Sc vacancies prevent n -type doping, oxygen vacancies permit the Fermi energy to reach ∼0.3 eV above the valence band maximum, rendering AlScO 3 p -type dopable. Furthermore, we find that both Mg and Zn could serve as extrinsic p -type dopants. Specifically, Mg is predicted to have achievable net acceptor concentrations of ∼10 17 cm −3 with ionization energy of bound small hole polarons of ∼0.49 eV and free ones below 0.1 eV. These values place AlScO 3 among the UWBG oxides with lowest bound small hole polaron ionization energies, which, as we find, is likely due to large ionic dielectric constant that correlates well with low hole polaron ionization energies across various UWBG oxides.},

By doping 5\%Al 3+ (atomic concentration), the light yield of β -Ga 2 O 3 is increased from 4394 to 6816 ph/MeV.

[Proc. R. Soc. A 478 (2263), 20220026 (2022)] considered the case of void metaclusters, thus permitting the modification of the so-called giant monopole resonance in elastodynamics. Here, we consider one of the original resonant configurations of metamaterial science in Liu et al. [Science 289 , 1734 (2000)]; this structure consists of coated cylinders of circular cross section and gives rise to a strong dipole resonance for sufficiently soft coatings. We consider the nature of the interaction of two such identical resonators in close proximity, which we term the co-dipole metacluster. We show that, contrary to the giant monopole case, the frequency at which the resonance occurs is unchanged as compared to a single resonator. The amplitude of the resonance itself is enhanced significantly, however, by up to 5.7 times the enhancement observed when considering two non-interacting resonators. Furthermore, although the nature of the resonance remains dominated by a dipole response, both the enhancement and the far-field scattered response are now significantly affected by the incidence angle, in contrast to the single resonator.},

  abstract     = {Active acoustic metamaterials are one path to acoustic properties difficult to realize with passive structures, especially for broadband applications. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a 2D metamaterial composed of coupled sensor-driver unit cells with effective bulk modulus ( ⁠ κ eff ⁠ ) precisely tunable through adjustments of the amplitude and phase of the transfer function between pairs of sensors and drivers present in each cell. This work adopts the concepts of our previous theoretical study on polarized sources to realize acoustic metamaterials in which the active unit cells are strongly interacting with each other. To demonstrate the capability of our active metamaterial to produce on-demand negative, fractional, and large κ eff ⁠ , we matched the scattered field from an incident pulse measured in a 2D waveguide with the sound scattered by equivalent continuous materials obtained in numerical simulations. Our approach benefits from being highly scalable, as the unit cells are independently controlled and any number of them can be arranged to form arbitrary geometries without added computational complexity.},

Despite the theoretically predicated nontrivial π Berry phase in Rashba systems, its experimental detection among all Rashba oxide interfaces remains elusive. Here, we report a nontrivial Berry phase at the interface between γ-Al 2 O 3 and SrTiO 3 as evidenced by the quantum oscillations. Analysis of transport properties under the high magnetic field up to 32 T reveals the weak anti-localization (WAL) effect and Shubnikov–de Haas (SdH) oscillations. Both the WAL effect and the nontrivial π Berry phase extracted from the SdH oscillations manifest the significance of the Rashba spin–orbit coupling in γ-Al 2 O 3 /SrTiO 3 . Physical quantities concerning the Fermi surface, such as effective mass, scattering time, etc., are experimentally accessed as well.

A three-level optically end-pumped model in a hot rubidium vapor cell is demonstrated, which takes into account the hyperfine structure of the ground state, various collisional processes, and the nonlinear absorption of the pump light along the cell length. By developing a constrained optimization model, we calculate the optimal detuning of the pump light that maximizes the average excited state atom concentration in the cell. Experimentally, a 1529 nm probe light at higher levels, which is attenuated to the weak-probe limit, is introduced to accurately characterize the excited state atom concentration. Coupling with the experimental results, the variation of the pump light optimal detuning with the temperature and the pump light intensity at the unsaturated pumping is analyzed. At the optimal detuning point, the theoretical decay function of the pump light percentage along the vapor cell length almost coincides regardless of the temperature and the pump light intensity changes. Moreover, the theoretical fitted pump light decay function at optimal detuning is predicted. The fitted pump light percentage exiting the vapor cell is 4.75\%. A fast implementation method to achieve the maximal average excited state atom concentration in the experiment is demonstrated.},

In this work, we analyze in detail the laser ablation dynamics of single-pulse ablation in the sub-millisecond time regime to elucidate the origins of the resulting well-defined ablation craters using a combination of time-resolved emission imaging, diffuse reflection/scattering imaging, and optical emission spectroscopy. These multimodal in situ diagnostics revealed three main contributors to achieve well-defined ablation features: (1) rapid ejection of particles with ∼100 m/s speed, (2) ablation of the graphite in the gaseous form, and (3) absence of bulk liquid motion, which is typically observed in laser processing of metals. Plasma plume formation was sustained throughout the duration of the laser pulse (500 μ s).

Unlike the tunneling-driven current–voltage characteristics of ferroelectric tunnel junctions which utilize ultrathin insulating (fully depleted) ferroelectric films, the semiconducting nature of our YHO films, i.e., the presence of free charge carriers introduced by Y doping, results in radically different current–voltage characteristics. Current–voltage measurements indicate a polarization-modulated transition from Schottky-barrier-controlled charge transport to Ohmic conduction in the YHO devices, which results in a large on/off ratio of up to 540. Moreover, voltage pulse train measurements reveal a broad range of accessible resistance states, which indicates the memristive behavior of the devices. Our results represent an important step toward the development of future nonvolatile memory and brain-inspired neuromorphic computing applications based on ultrathin semiconducting ferroelectric films.},

In this work, we demonstrate conclusive transport evidence on topological properties of an α -Sn film grown on a CdTe substrate by molecular beam epitaxy. A Berry phase determined from Shubnikov–de Haas oscillations is 0.98π. A two-dimensional (2D) Fermi surface is clearly demonstrated by angle-dependent oscillations. We believe the nontrivial topology originates from the 2D Dirac fermions of the topological surface states. In addition, both anisotropic magneto-resistance and planar Hall effect have negative amplitudes at higher fields, which we attribute to the spin-flip backscattering in the topological surface states. We also show that these topological surface states have a long relaxation time of ∼95 fs, making α -Sn a potential candidate for high-efficiency spintronics.},

  abstract     = {The study of surface transport in ultrathin films of few quintuple layers thick topological insulators (TIs) and its evolution with disorder is important for TI based device engineering. Here, we demonstrate the absence of Anderson localization in surface states of Bi 2 Se 3 films on varying the disorder from the weak to moderate regime. On increasing the disorder, bulk of topological insulator transforms from diffusive to hopping transport while surface remains in quantum diffusive regime. The weak antilocalization (WAL) of surface states suppresses in thinner films, which could occur due to disorder or inter surface hybridization. Our analysis rules out the role of disorder in WAL suppression and shows that films crossover from decoupled surface states to a single coupled surface bulk channel and finally to hybridized surface states on reducing the film thickness. The dephasing mechanism of surface transport strongly depends on the nature of bulk transport. It is dominated by 2D electron–electron scattering for diffusive bulk transport while it is dominated by direct surface bulk charge puddle coupling and surface to hopping transport coupling for bulk in the variable range hopping regime. The surface to hopping transport coupling weakens with intersurface hybridization.},

In this work, the microstructure, ferroelectric, dielectric, and pyroelectric properties were studied systematically in (Bi 0.5 Na 0.5 )TiO 3 –0.1\%MnCO 3 (BNT–Mn) lead-free ceramics. It is observed that the pyroelectric coefficient p reaches 2.90 × 10 −4 C m −2 K −1 at room temperature in the samples. Due to the low dielectric constant (291) and dielectric loss (0.010), the figures of merit (FoMs) F i , F v , and F D are as high as 1.03 × 10 −10 m/V, 4.05 × 10 −2 m 2 /C, and 1.86 × 10 −5 Pa −1/2 , measured at 1 kHz. With the increase in temperature, the p and FoMs change slightly, showing good temperature stability. More importantly, a relatively high depolarization temperature of 205 °C is achieved, which should help deliver reliable operation in practice. In general, all performances reveal that BNT–Mn ceramics are expected to pave the way for uncooled infrared detector applications.},

  abstract     = {Potassium sodium niobate [(K,Na)NbO 3 , KNN] films are promising lead-free piezoelectric materials for microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) devices. We previously developed technologies for forming high-quality KNN films by sputtering, which showed excellent piezoelectric properties comparable to lead zirconate titanate (PZT) films. In the present study, we addressed several challenges with the aim of introducing KNN films into commercialized MEMS devices. First, we optimized the dielectric and piezoelectric properties to realize a suitable performance for actuator and sensor devices. The sensor-type KNN films had a low dielectric constant (248) and a self-poling function, which are greatly beneficial for sensor device performance and the fabrication process. The actuator-type KNN films had a very high e 31 value of −13.5 C/m 2 , which is almost comparable to the top level of PZT films. Next, we found that the DC stress lifetime of KNN films strongly depended on the material used for the adhesion layer of the top electrode. When we used a Pt/RuO 2 top electrode, the actuator-type KNN films had a long lifetime (&gt;130 000 s, 300 kV/cm and 200 °C), which is long enough to be used for commercialized MEMS devices. Furthermore, we realized 8-in. KNN wafers with good thickness uniformity across the wafer (±3.5\%) by introducing a mass-production-ready sputtering tool: the EB-2500 produced by Canon Anelva. In the near future, these promising results will open the way to replace PZT with KNN in the piezoMEMS industry.},

In this category, Co 2 MnGa, a room temperature ferromagnetic Heusler alloy, has garnered special interest as a promising material for topologically driven spintronic applications. However, until now, the structural-order dependence of spin current generation efficiency through the spin Hall effect has not been fully explored in this material. In this paper, we study the evolution of magnetic and transport properties of Co 2 MnGa thin films from the chemically disordered B 2 to ordered L 2 1 phase. We also report on the change in spin generation efficiency across these different phases, using heterostructures of Co 2 MnGa and ferrimagnet Co x Tb 1− x with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. We measured large spin Hall angles in both the B 2 and L 2 1 phases, and within our experimental limits, we did not observe the advantage brought by the MWSM ordering in generating a strong spin Hall angle over the disordered phases, which suggests more complicated mechanisms over the intrinsic, Weyl-band structure-determined spin Hall effect in these material stacks.},

In this work, we propose a spin torque nano-oscillator based on ferrimagnetic skyrmions, where the current-induced force can be easily balanced by the controllable Magnus force due to the ferrimagnetic nature, resulting in a stable motion around the edge of the area with applied current. The direction of such a motion is switchable by tuning the ferrimagnet across the compensation point. The oscillation frequency is found to rely on the magnetization and can exceed 1.5 GHz around the angular momentum compensation point. In contrast to previous proposals based on ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic skyrmions, our ferrimagnetic nano-oscillator does not require a shaped magnetic working layer, thus suggesting that the ferrimagnet could be a potential platform for building oscillator arrays and studying interaction between them.},

  abstract     = {Vacancy defects are universally regarded to be the main defect that limits the photoelectric conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells. In perovskite, iodine vacancy dominates the defect proportion due to its low formation energy. However, the defect property of iodine vacancy (V I ) is still in dispute. Ideally, the V I defect is considered to be a shallow level defect near conduction band minimum, meaning that it does not act as a Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) nonradiative recombination center. Herein, we find a direct correlation between compressive strain and V I defect behavior. The compressive strain along the lattice vector b/c direction will drive the V I defect from shallow level to deep level defect, which is related to the formation of Pb-dimer. In addition, the influence of extra electrons is also considered during the structural evolution of V I , which is often observed in the experiments. Therefore, we find that the elimination of compressive strain and extra electrons can be of great significance for improving the photoelectric performance of perovskite solar cells. Our work reveals the defect properties of V I from shallow level one to the SRH recombination center and the inherent physics mechanism of defect evolution under external factors, which provides a strategy to control device defects and eliminate recombination losses.},

Moreover, we fabricated the BN/GaN heterostructure-based Schottky diode that demonstrates rectifying characteristics, lower turn-on voltage, and an improved breakdown capability (∼234 V) as compared to GaN (∼168 V), owing to the higher breakdown electrical field of BN.

In this work, we study the structural properties of near-surface InAs quantum wells and find that surface morphology is closely connected to low-temperature transport, where electron mobility is highly sensitive to the growth temperature of the underlying graded buffer layer. By introducing an In 0.81 Al 0.19 As capping layer, we show that we change the surface Fermi level pinning of the In 0.81 Al 0.19 As thin film as compared to the In 0.81 Ga 0.19 As, giving rise to a tuning of the Fermi level in the InAs layer. Experimental measurements show a strong agreement with Schrödinger–Poisson calculations of the electron density, suggesting the conduction band energy of the In 0.81 Ga 0.19 As and In 0.81 Al 0.19 As surface is pinned to 40 and 309 meV above the Fermi level, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Electron traps in AlGaN/GaN high electron mobility transistors were studied by combining theoretical and experimental methods. Energy levels about E C -0.9 eV due to irradiation are identified by deep-level transient spectroscopy (DLTS). Two electron traps, H1 (E C -0.63 eV) and H 2 (E C -0.9 eV), were observed in the DLTS spectra. H1 was produced in device or material manufacturing, and H2 was caused by displacement damage. First, we reported that the signal peak of H2 can contribute from three defects labeled H2-1, H2-2, and H2-3 with energies E C -0.77 eV, E C -0.9 eV, and E C -0.98 eV, respectively. According to defect migration temperature and first principles calculation results, it is found that different configurations of di-nitrogen vacancy structures are the source of E C -0.77 eV and E C -0.9 eV signals. The defect of E C -0.98 eV is more stable at high temperatures, which may be related to gallium vacancy.},

  abstract     = {Materials with in-plane electrical anisotropy have great potential for designing artificial synaptic devices. However, natural materials with strong intrinsic in-plane electrical anisotropy are rare. We introduce a simple strategy to produce extremely large electrical anisotropy via grating gating of a semiconductor two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) of AlGaN/GaN. We show that periodically modulated electric potential in the 2DEG induces in-plane electrical anisotropy, which is significantly enhanced in a magnetic field, leading to an ultra large electrical anisotropy. This is induced by a giant positive magnetoresistance and a giant negative magnetoresistance under two orthogonally oriented in-plane current flows, respectively. This giant electrical anisotropy is in situ tunable by tailoring both the grating gate voltage and the magnetic field. Our semiconductor device with controllable giant electrical anisotropy will stimulate new device applications, such as multi-terminal memtransistors and bionic synapses.},

By adjusting the geometric parameters of the metasurface, the EP based UR phenomenon can be observed at 2360 nm, and the simulation results are in good agreement with the theoretical work. Unlike other isotropic non-Hermitian platforms, the proposed UR phenomenon has a strong dependence on the incident polarization state, which guarantees its great application potential in the fields of near-field imaging and optical encryption, etc.},

Here we present straightforward procedures to align the optical setup for STM-luminescence and STM-based tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) performed with a reflection geometry in an ultrahigh vacuum chamber. Observing real-space images of the metal tip apex through a spectrograph set to the zeroth-order diffraction enables “ in situ ” optimization of the detection path and introduction of the excitation light of TERS to the nanogap. The best spatial overlap with the nanogap can be achieved by monitoring plasmon-enhanced, low-frequency inelastic scattering of the metal. This protocol allows us to overcome such difficulties in STM-based spectroscopy and facilitates physicochemical study of single adsorbates on nontransparent substrates.},

  abstract     = {We report on the ultrafast modulation of a graphene loaded artificial metasurface realized on a SiO 2 /Si substrate by near-IR laser pump, detected via terahertz probe at the resonant frequency of ∼0.8 THz. The results have been acquired by setting the Fermi energy of graphene at the Dirac point via electrostatic gating and illuminating the sample with 40 fs pump pulses at different fluences, ranging from 0.9 to 0.018 mJ/cm 2 . The sub-ps conductivity rising time was attributed to the combined effect of the ultrafast generation of hot carriers in graphene and electron–hole generation in silicon. In correspondence of the resonance, it was possible to clearly distinguish a partial recovery time of ∼2 ps mainly due to carrier-phonon relaxation in graphene, superimposed to the &gt; 1 ns recovery time of silicon. The resonant metasurface yielded ∼6 dB modulation depth in E-field amplitude at 0.8 THz for the range of fluences considered. These measurements set an upper limit for the reconfiguration speed achievable by graphene-based terahertz devices. At the same time, this work represents a great progress toward the realization of an ultrafast THz optoelectronic platform for a plethora of applications, ranging from the investigation of the ultrastrong light-matter regime to the next generation wireless communications.},

Multiple linear and nonlinear soliton formation mechanisms in an all-fiber laser with partial polarization maintaining fiber are experimentally observed and validated for switchable and tunable dual-comb pulse emissions. Linear polarization mode dispersion is first exploited to emit polarization-multiplexed pulses with the upper limit of repetition rate difference at kHz level. By further tailoring linear birefringence, birefringence filter effect and nonlinear polarization evolution are well leveraged to emit hybrid mode-locked pulses with the lower limit at 10-Hz level. The lower limit of ∼12 Hz and nearly two order-of-magnitude tunable range of repetition rate difference are highlighted. Moreover, overlapping spectra and the passive mutual coherence between pulses in the free-running state are clarified, indicating the potential of the simplification of amplification system and single-cavity dual-comb source.},

Typically, as the sun and outer space are the natural thermodynamic resources for renewable energy harvesting, passive solar heating and radiative cooling have been widely explored through a precise spectral design to effectively exploit solar energy and thermal radiation. In this Perspective, based on the previous works and principal development of passive solar heating and radiative cooling, the corresponding ideal spectral design under different temperature conditions is proposed and highlighted. As demonstrations, we present several examples of different optical spectral designs for realizing passive solar heating and radiative cooling to fit various scenarios.

The conical configuration increases the separation distance between individual tubes within the assembly that reduces interference between individual plasma jets and enables the jets to converge at the output, facilitating more uniform treatment as opposed to plasma jet arrays operated in parallel. Electrical and optical diagnostics of the plasma discharges and measurements of H 2 O 2 and NO 2 − production in de-ionized water are used to characterize the potential suitability of the device for biomedical applications. Particularly, it was found that the efficiency in H 2 O 2 (an important bacterial disinfection agent) production by the conical assembly of six plasma jets was more than nine-fold higher compared to its single plasma jet counterpart and that this could be achieved at a biocompatible temperature of below 300 K. Therefore, the device may find use in biomedical applications, particularly where larger area treatments are required such as for certain wounds and cancer tumors that can span areas of tens of cm 2 .},

The PL results of the GeV centers are in agreement with those found in the literature, while the MgV center is newly discovered and a not yet broadly investigated color center, but the room temperature PL results are in agreement with the first report. The temperature dependence of the MgV centers above room temperature is unusual: by increasing the temperature, its PL shifts to higher energies, contrary to what is observed for the GeV centers and other known centers in the literature. The zero phonon line width of both centers broadens by increasing the temperature in both investigated centers. The origin of the blue shift observed in the MgV centers as a confinement effect is discarded, because sample is bulk and its origin should lay on the influence of the temperature on the local static structure and the overlapping of the electronic wave functions. Our results show the ability of MgV to be used in future for thermometry.

The complicated interactions between quantum dots and gate electrodes cause the manual tuning process to no longer be efficient. Fortunately, machine learning techniques can automate and speed up the tuning of simple quantum dot systems. In this Letter, we extend the techniques to tune multi-dot devices. We propose an automated approach that combines machine learning, virtual gates, and a local-to-global method to realize the consecutive tuning of quantum dot arrays by dividing them into subsystems. After optimizing voltage configurations and establishing virtual gates to control each subsystem independently, a quantum dot array can be efficiently tuned to the few-electron regime with appropriate interdot tunnel coupling strength. Our experimental results show that this approach can consecutively tune quantum dot arrays into an appropriate voltage range without human intervention and possesses broad application prospects in large-scale quantum dot devices.},

In a triple quantum dot system, we demonstrate a nanosecond control of the inter-dot tunnel rate permitting to reach the two extreme regimes, large GHz tunnel coupling, and sub-Hz isolation between adjacent dots. We use this development to isolate a subpart of the array in a metastable configuration while performing charge displacement and readout in the rest of the system.

When the thickness of 63 NiO is 4 μ m and the doping concentration of Si is 1 × 10 15 cm −3 , the short-circuit current density, open-circuit voltage, fill factor, and maximum output power density of the nuclear battery are 1.22 μ A · cm −2 , 3.17 V, 0.95, 3.67 μ W · cm −2 . In addition, the output performance of 63 Ni/NiO-Si heterojunction betavoltaic nuclear cell was calculated in this study. Under the condition that the activity of the radioactive source and the thickness of NiO( 63 NiO) are the same in the two structures, the proposed structure ( 63 NiO-Si) has greatly improved the output performance of the nuclear battery by reducing the energy lost from radioactive source self-absorption.},

  abstract     = {Combining photonic excitation and acoustic detection, photoacoustic imaging (PAI) presents one of the most promising noninvasive biomedical diagnostic modalities, but this technique still lacks efficient nano-sized contrast agents absorbing light in the region of relative tissue transparency (630–900 nm). Here, we explore the use of titanium nitride (TiN) nanoparticles (NPs) fabricated by methods of pulsed laser ablation in liquids as a contrast agent in PAI. When prepared in acetone, the NPs are spherical, have an average size of 25 nm, and exhibit a broad plasmonic absorption peak around 700 nm. We show that solutions of these NPs render possible a strong nonlinear photoacoustic response and the generation of photoacoustic images with 67 μ m resolution within the biological transparency window. The observed effect is explained by a plasmonically enhanced two-photon absorption process in TiN NPs. Combined with earlier demonstrated capability of generating photothermal therapeutic effect, relative chemical purity, and excellent biocompatibility, laser-synthesized TiN NPs promise attractive applications in biomedical theranostics involving imaging modalities based on photoacoustics microscopy or tomography.},

To date, studies on the superconducting transport in these channels have relied on an aggressive surface treatment required to strip the oxidized nanowire surface prior to deposition of a superconductor in a process that will inevitably cause some damage to the surface. In this report, we describe the growth and characterization of bismuth nanowires with in situ deposited superconducting contacts, which avoid the requirement to treat the nanowire surface for oxide removal. The described shadow deposition method may avoid damage to the bismuth nanowire surface, supplying a higher-quality platform for exploring the topological quantum transport in bismuth nanowire based Josephson junctions.},

In this study, swift heavy ion (SHI) irradiation was applied to introduce defects in monolayer WSe 2 in a controlled manner. Temperature-dependent photoluminescence and transient absorption spectroscopy are employed to investigate the excitonic performances in defective WSe 2 . It is observed that the trion emission rises up alongside exciton emission for WSe 2 irradiated with elevated ion fluences. Defects introduced by SHI irradiation can strongly localize carriers and weaken the exciton–phonon coupling and further affect the optical signatures of the excitons. Photoexcited electron–hole pairs were suppressed to form excitons due to the weaken phonon scattering, and the population of exciton was reduced for the irradiated WSe 2 . These results reveal that SHI irradiation is an effective technique to explore defect dependence of exciton formation and evolution dynamics in TMDCs, which have important implications for various optoelectronic applications.},

The anisotropy is absent at the minimal electron density near a charge neutrality point. The anisotropy increases with the increase in n and reaches about 10\% when the Fermi level is within the first subband H1. There is a sharp increase in the anisotropy (up to 60\%) when the Fermi level reaches the second subband E2. We conclude that the first effect is due to the small intra-subband anisotropic interface roughness scattering, and the second one is due to the strongly anisotropic inter-subband roughness scattering, but the microscopical reason for such a strong change in the anisotropy remains unknown.},

Since thinner ferroelectric films are required for low voltage operation, the impact of film thickness on the switching kinetics of FE–HfO 2 needs to be studied in detail. In this paper, metal/ferroelectric/metal capacitors are fabricated with several thicknesses of HfZrO 2 (HZO) films and characterized to study the switching kinetics based on the nucleation limited switching (NLS) model. Thinner HZO capacitors show slower polarization switching and asymmetry in program and erase operation, although low-frequency polarization charge density is nearly the same for all thicknesses. Slow switching is due to the large variability of the activation field of FE domains and grain boundaries among small FE grains. The asymmetry is caused by the asymmetric interface property at the top and bottom interfaces. High-resolution TEM and electron diffraction mapping methods provide physical evidence for the above discussions.},

  abstract     = {Traditional piezoelectric adaptive lenses (ALENS) are fabricated by piezoceramics with transparent liquids as the filling media. However, it is challenging to achieve high focal sensitivity and long-time robustness because of the low piezoelectricity of ceramics as well as the evaporation and leakage of the liquids. To overcome the above-mentioned issues, we design a piezoelectric lens based on a radial extension-arching mode by using polydimethylsiloxane films and Pb(In 1/2 Nb 1/2 )O 3 –Pb(Mg 1/3 Nb 2/3 )O 3 –PbTiO 3 (PIMNT) relaxor ferroelectric single crystals to replace the transparent liquids and Pb(Zr, Ti)O 3 (PZT) ceramics, respectively. Due to the ultrahigh piezoelectric properties ( d 33 ∼ 1500 pC N −1 and d 31 ∼ 730 pC N −1 ) of the PIMNT crystals and the optimized radial extension-arching structure, an ultrahigh focal sensitivity (8.5 cm V −1 and a fast response time (∼10 2 μ s) is achieved, outperforming conventional ALENS based on piezoceramic actuators (∼10 3 μ s and ∼10 −1 cm V −1 ) and dielectric elastomer actuators (∼10 5 μ s and ∼10 −2 cm V −1 ). The largest output displacement of our designed ALENS is up to 53.6 μ m at 4.2 kHz under 80 V pp , and its focus is in the range of 57.44 cm to ∞. Furthermore, its performance remains unchanged after 4 × 10 7 vibration cycles, indicating its long-time robustness. This work sheds light on the design of advanced adaptive optical systems, where an ultrahigh focal sensitivity and a fast response are required.},

The value of W dis represents the useful energy, which can be converted to electrical energy while most work about high-energy-density dielectrics is focused on enhancing W re . In this work, we investigated the relationship between W dis and W re in (Pb 1 − 3 x /2 La x )[(Zr 0.45 Sn 0.55 ) 0.99 Ti 0.01 ]O 3 antiferroelectrics. Tuning the phase transition properties could improve the fast discharge capability by reducing the difference between W dis and W re and accelerating the energy release rate. At 300 kV/cm, the composition with x = 0 has the highest W re of 6.7 J/cm 3 but a lower W dis of only 4 J/cm 3 and longer discharge time duration, indicating a “high-energy-density” (highest W re ) quasi-static performance but “low-energy-density” (lower W dis ) and slow discharge performance during fast discharge. A highest W dis of 5.9 J/cm 3 and power density were achieved in composition with x = 0.2 though with lower W re . The various fast energy release performance was explained by their different domain mobility and phase switching behavior. Thus, purely pursing high W re is with limitation and suppressing the difference between W dis and W re is with great significance. This work will give an approach for the development of energy storage dielectrics by connecting their fast discharge performance with polarization mechanism.},

Strikingly, the sign reversal of topological Hall resistivity ( ⁠ ρ x y T ⁠ ) is found before and after the SRT temperature T SR ∼260 K. Above the T SR , a positive ρ x y T is observed, e.g., ∼0.52 μ Ω cm at 320 K. By reducing temperature to 275 K, the ρ x y T value decreases to ∼0.42 μ Ω cm. It is interesting that, however, the negative ρ x y T value is found below the T SR , e.g., ∼−0.66 μ Ω cm at 175 K.

In this Letter, we perform first-principles simulation to understand the bonding nature and structure stability of the possible in-plane heterostructure built by graphene and biphenylene. We found that the graphene–biphenylene in-plane heterostructure only exhibits along the armchair direction, which is connected together by strong covalent bonds and energetically stable. Then, the non-equilibrium molecular dynamics calculations are used to explore the interfacial thermal properties of the graphene/biphenylene heterostructure. It is found that the graphene/biphenylene in-plane heterostructure possesses an excellent interfacial thermal conductance of 2.84 × 10 9 W·K −1 ·m −2 at room temperature. Importantly, the interfacial thermal conductance presents different temperature dependence under opposite heat flux direction. This anomalous temperature dependence results in increased thermal rectification ratio with temperature about 40\% at 350 K. This work provides comprehensive insight into the graphene–biphenylene heterostructure and suggests a route for designing a thermal rectifier with high efficiency.},

  abstract     = {A high-sensitivity thermistor La 0.7 Na 0.3− x K x MnO 3 ( x = 0.2) film with a perovskite structure was fabricated and studied. The results show that the film displayed excellent adaptation and clear interfaces with the SrTiO 3 substrate. Under the combination of Jahn–Teller effect and double exchange mechanism, the temperature coefficient of resistivity ( TCR ) of the La 0.7 Na 0.1 K 0.2 MnO 3 film reached 10.86\% K −1 at 296.98 K. Compared with the conventional VO 2 and nickel–manganite-based film materials, the La 0.7 Na 0.1 K 0.2 MnO 3 film with high TCR values at room temperature exhibited tunable metal–insulation transition temperature and more sensitive thermal properties. Consequently, the La 0.7 Na 0.1 K 0.2 MnO 3 film can substantially improve the detection sensitivity of uncooled infrared bolometers as thermistor materials.},

  abstract     = {Unsuspended phononic integrated circuits have been proposed for on-chip acoustic information processing. Limited by the operation mechanism of a conventional interdigital transducer, the excitation of the quasi-Love mode in GaN-on-sapphire is inefficient, and thus, a high-efficiency Rayleigh-to-Love mode converter is of great significance for future integrated phononic devices. Here, we propose a high-efficiency and robust phononic mode converter based on an adiabatic conversion mechanism. Utilizing the anisotropic elastic property of the substrate, the adiabatic mode converter is realized by a simple tapered phononic waveguide. A conversion efficiency exceeding 96\% with a 3 dB bandwidth of 1.44 GHz can be realized for phononic waveguides working at GHz frequency band, and excellent tolerance to the fabrication errors is also numerically validated. The device that we proposed can be useful in both classical and quantum phononic information processing, and the adiabatic mechanism could be generalized to other phononic device designs.},

Broadening of both transverse acoustic (TA) and longitudinal acoustic (LA) modes of the bulk Si 1− x Ge x alloy was directly observed using inelastic x-ray scattering (IXS) with increasing momentum (from Γ to X points in the Brillouin zone), which cannot be observed in pure Si or pure Ge. The IXS spectral linewidth of the TA mode indicated Ge dependence, which suggests the overlapping of a low-energy local vibration mode (LVM) caused by Ge clusters surrounded by Si atoms around the X point. Although the behavior of the IXS spectral linewidth of the LA mode showed almost no dependence on Ge fraction, the IXS spectra of the LA mode indicated broadening after crossing with a low-energy LVM with increasing momentum. The results obtained by molecular dynamics showed almost the same behavior of the acoustic phonon spectral linewidth. These results suggest that a change in the acoustic phonon spectral linewidth between the Γ and X points indicates a reduction in the acoustic phonon lifetime caused by the appearance of a localized mode originated from a random atom position in the alloy structure, leading to suppression of the thermal transport in the SiGe alloy.},

However, these NWs contain, similar to the initial GaN films, high density of structural defects such as threading dislocations (TDs). In this work, different strategies to reduce the density of defects along the NWs have been compared based on two different wet etching approaches followed by a rapid thermal annealing (RTA) at 750 °C. The addition of a 30 nm SiN x coating is also explored. The defects and strain/stress along the NWs have been studied by high resolution transmission electron microscopy, diffraction contrast imaging in two-beam conditions and 4D STEM, as well as strain maps calculated from scanning precession electron diffraction measurements. RTA reduced the density of TDs at the middle of GaN NWs with bare surfaces by approximately 25\%. The reduction increased to approximately 70\% by RTA of GaN NWs with surfaces coated by amorphous SiN x , which is attributed to enhancement of dislocation movements by stresses induced from differential thermal expansion of GaN and SiN x . These results suggest a process route that, if optimized and combined with reduction of NW diameter, could establish etching as an efficient fabrication method for high crystal quality GaN NWs.},

  abstract     = {Gradual switching between multiple resistance levels is desirable for analog in-memory computing using resistive random-access memory (RRAM). However, the filamentary switching of HfO x -based conventional RRAM often yields only two stable memory states instead of gradual switching between multiple resistance states. Here, we demonstrate that a thermal barrier of Ge 2 Sb 2 Te 5 (GST) between HfO x and the bottom electrode (TiN) enables wider and weaker filaments, by promoting heat spreading laterally inside the HfO x . Scanning thermal microscopy suggests that HfO x + GST devices have a wider heating region than control devices with only HfO x , indicating the formation of a wider filament. Such wider filaments can have multiple stable conduction paths, resulting in a memory device with more gradual and linear switching. The thermally enhanced HfO x + GST devices also have higher on/off ratio (&gt;10 3 ) than control devices (&lt;10 2 ) and a median set voltage lower by approximately 1 V (∼35\%), with a corresponding reduction of the switching power. Our HfO x + GST RRAM shows 2× gradual switching range using fast (∼ns) identical pulse trains with amplitude less than 2 V.},

  abstract     = {During TiO 2 atomic layer deposition (ALD) using TiCl 4 and H 2 O at ∼150 °C, nucleation proceeds rapidly on hydroxylated SiO 2 but is inherently delayed on passivated surfaces such as H-terminated silicon (Si-H) and trimethylsilyl-passivated SiO 2 (SiO 2 -TMS) formed using dimethylamino-trimethylsilane (DMA-TMS) as a small molecule inhibitor. In this work, we explore details of TiO 2 nucleation on both Si-H and SiO 2 -TMS and show that the mechanisms leading to unwanted nuclei depend strongly on the passivation mechanism. Initial growth is observed as a function of ALD cycles using scanning electron microscopy to obtain average particle size, density, and overall surface coverage fraction. Also, average film thickness vs cycle is estimated using ellipsometry or Rutherford backscattering spectrometry. Data are compared to an analytical model that considers that either nucleation sites are present on the starting non-growth surface or sites are generated during the ALD process. On the Si-H surface, data and modeling indicate that nucleation occurs predominantly from a fixed number of nucleation sites present on the starting growth surface that start to immediately grow. However, on TMS-passivated SiO 2 , nucleation sites are predominantly generated during the growth process so that the density of nucleation sites increases as growth proceeds. Results indicate that nucleation sites are created when adsorbed ALD reactants become kinetically trapped on the SiO 2 -TMS surface. This demonstrates that mechanisms associated with unwanted nucleation during area-selective deposition (ASD) can depend on details of the surface passivation scheme, thereby providing insight to help to improve ASD strategies for advanced applications.},

Although contrast reversals can appear in ptychographic phase images as the projected potentials of the sample increase, we show here how these can be easily overcome by a small amount of defocus. The amount of defocus is small enough that it not only can exist naturally when focusing using the annular dark field (ADF) signal but can also be adjusted post acquisition. The ptychographic images of strongly scattering materials are clearer at finite doses than other STEM techniques and can better reveal light atomic columns within heavy lattices. In addition, data for ptychography can now be collected simultaneously with the fastest of ADF scans. This combination of sensitivity and interpretability presents an ideal workflow for materials science.},

However, the temperature-dependent photoluminescence of VPQDs is still unexplored. Herein, both the steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence of VPQDs have been investigated at 263–353 K. With increasing temperature, the photoluminescence of VPQDs has been demonstrated to have decreasing intensity, blue shifts, and broaden bandwidth with excellent temperature reversibility. The non-radiative heat escape was found to cause the intensity to decrease. The blue shift was deduced to be due to the interplay between the electron–phonon renormalization and the thermal expansion. The enhanced exciton–phonon coupling was found to be the main cause of broaden bandwidth. The photoluminescence lifetime of VPQDs was measured to be stable at different temperatures. The non-radiation recombination processes have been demonstrated to play a crucial role in the photoluminescence by linking static and dynamic processes to calculate the radiative rate and non-radiative rate variation with temperature. The activation energy of VPQDs was deduced to be 90.25 meV, which is suitable for temperature sensing. The linear correlation of photoluminescence intensity and peak position to temperature gives more accurate dual mode sensing for a wide-range of ratiometric temperature sensors.},

This 2DEG also shows photoconductance, which could be related to defects that act as deep center trapping and releasing carriers by interaction with light. This phenomenon has raised an interest for the identification of deep energy levels in the LaAlO 3 /SrTiO 3 heterostructure. We have studied the defect state properties using electrical characterization such as capacitance–voltage (C–V), current–voltage (I–V) measurements, and deep-level transient Fourier spectroscopy (DLTFS). From C–V and I–V analyses, a hysteresis was observed indicating an effect of mobile charges in the LaAlO 3 . Using DLTFS, we identify three defect states located at around 0.17 eV below conduction band and at 0.23 and 0.26 eV above the valence band. These defect states were attributed to defects in SrTiO 3 such as strontium vacancies or titanium vacancies. We identify a fourth defect state having an energy of about 0.69 eV below the conduction band that could be related to oxygen vacancies in LaAlO 3 or in SrTiO 3 . In addition, the observation of an effect of the electric field with DLTFS indicated that oxygen vacancies might be involved in Fowler–Nordheim or trap-assisted tunneling through the LaAlO 3 layer.},

  abstract     = {Rare-earth ions (REIs) doped into solid-state crystal hosts offer an attractive platform for realizing quantum interconnects that can function as quantum memories and quantum repeaters. The 4f valence electrons of REIs are shielded by 5s and 5p electrons and undergo highly coherent transitions even when embedded in host crystals. In particular, Er 3+ has an optical transition in the telecom band that is suitable for low-loss communication. Recently, REIs in thin film systems have gained interest due to potential advantages in providing a flexible host crystal environment, enabling scalable on-chip integration with other quantum devices. Here, we investigate the structural and optical properties of Er-doped anatase TiO 2 thin films on LaAlO 3 (001) substrates. By choosing a system with minimal lattice mismatch and adjusting Er-dopant concentration, we achieve optical inhomogeneous linewidths of 5 GHz at 4.5 K. We show that 9 nm-thick buffer and capping layers can reduce the linewidth by more than 40\%, suggesting a pathway to further narrowing linewidths in this system. We also identify that Er 3+ ions mainly incorporate into substitutional Ti 4+ sites with non-polar D 2d symmetry, which makes Er dopants insensitive to the first order to local electric fields from impurities and is desirable for coherence properties of Er 3+ spins.},

  abstract     = {Recently, magnetically intercalated layered transition metal dichalcogenide Fe 1/3 NbS 2 has attracted considerable attention due to its promise for spintronics applications, especially for the demonstration of reversible resistance switching by electrical stimulation below the antiferromagnetic transition temperature. Magneto-transport properties and their correlation to the underlying magnetic configurations are yet to be clarified in Fe 1/3 NbS 2 . Herein, we investigate the magneto-transport behavior of antiferromagnet Fe 1/3 NbS 2 , demonstrating a complex behavior of the magnetoresistance and unconventional Hall effect. The resistance of this compound displayed metallic behavior and an abrupt decrease at T N . Of particular interest, the positive magnetoresistance is enhanced and it reaches a maximum in the vicinity of Néel temperature as a function of the out-of-plane magnetic field, which is in contrast to most of the antiferromagnets. Meanwhile, the Hall signal showed an unusual nonlinear field-dependence in the same temperature range. Moreover, the magnetoresistance exhibits a significant anisotropy, up to 14\% near the Néel temperature. We attributed these unconventional magneto-transport behaviors to the field induced formation of a complex spin texture in Fe 1/3 NbS 2 . Our work motivates further efforts on antiferromagnetic spintronic devices based on this intercalated layered transition metal dichalcogenide.},

  abstract     = {Traditional optical elements, such as waveplates and polarization beam splitters, are essential for quantum state tomography (QST). Yet, their bulky size and heavy weight are prejudicial for miniaturizing quantum information systems. Here, we introduce nondiffractive silicon metasurfaces with high transmission efficiency to replace the traditional optical elements for QST of polarization-entangled states. Two identical silicon metasurfaces are employed, and each metasurface comprises four independent districts on a micrometer scale. The unit cell of each district consists of two silicon nanopillars with different geometrical sizes and orientation angles, and the interference of the scattered waves from the nanopillars leads to a single output beam from the district with a specific polarization state with a transmission efficiency above 92\%. When the two-photon polarization-entangled state shines on different districts of two metasurfaces, each photon of the photon pair interacts with the local nanopillars within the district, and the two-photon state is projected onto 16 polarization bases for state reconstruction. We experimentally demonstrate the reconstruction of four input Bell states with high fidelities. This approach significantly reduces the number of conventional optical components in the QST process and is inspiring for advancing quantum information technology.},

In this Letter, we propose an alternative type of seismic metamaterial providing an ultra-low-frequency bandgap induced by inertial amplification. A unique kind of inertially amplified metamaterial is first conceived and designed. Its bandgap characteristics for flexural waves are then numerically and experimentally demonstrated. Finally, the embedded inertial amplification mechanism is introduced on a soil substrate to design a seismic metamaterial capable of strongly attenuating seismic surface waves around a frequency of 4 Hz. This work provides a promising alternative way to conceive seismic metamaterials to steer and control surface waves.},

  abstract     = {In this work, the impact of plasma treatment on Si wafers with native oxide on top was systematically investigated using spectroscopic ellipsometry. A general applicable three-layer optical model structure for ellipsometry data fitting was developed and employed on samples treated with the N 2 , O 2 , and N 2 /O 2 mixture plasma. Oxide-growth, amorphization of crystalline Si, and the formation of a transition layer between the SiO 2 and the amorphous Si were detected. The estimated thicknesses of produced layers were confirmed by complementary methods, which allow precise ultra-thin layers thicknesses detection, namely, angle-resolved x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The depth-resolved chemical composition and the direct thickness measurements of the produced amorphous structure revealed pronounced elemental gradients and the absence of sharp interfaces. Nitrogen gas used in the plasma process was found to be implanted mainly at the interface of the SiO 2 /transition layer in the form of Si 3 N 4 . However, it was verified that it is feasible to employ one general ellipsometry model consisting of SiO 2 /transition layer/amorphous Si on crystalline Si for all plasma species due to comparably low Si 3 N 4 concentrations as well as its refractive index n and absorption k similarity to SiO 2 . Spectroscopic ellipsometry is nondestructive and can be efficiently applied to analyze whole wafers without any sample preparation. It can be concluded that the present approach to ellipsometry model development and verification is well suited for plasma-activated direct wafer bonding processes.},

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and ellipsometry were used to establish the optimal process regime at 120 °C and to demonstrate how HfO 2 layer composition and growth rate per cycle depend on post-plasma purge time; the optimum is achieved at 6 s. Increasing the post-plasma purge time decreases the carbon and nitrogen impurity concentration in the HfO 2 layer. Measurements of the admittance of metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) structures over the surface of a sample show that the electro-physical properties are uniform. We discuss the method of measuring the admittance of MIS structures that allows us to minimize the contribution of slow states with trapped charge on shape and shift of the C–V curve. The results demonstrate that the densities of fixed charge, slow states, and fast interfacial traps at the HfO 2 /MCT interface are greater than that for Al 2 O 3 /MCT (also formed by PEALD). The interface trap density is estimated from a normalized parallel conductance map, and the HfO 2 film adheres well.},

While both systems exhibit the MIT, the film grown by remote epitaxy on graphene demonstrates improved transport properties. Electrical transport measurements show that the on/off ratio is enhanced by a factor of ∼7.5 and the switching temperature window is narrower for VO 2 thin films grown on graphene.

However, integrating monolayer TMDCs into high-quality planar microcavities to achieve the required strong coupling between the cavity photons and the TMDC excitons (bound electron–hole pairs) has proven challenging. Previous approaches to integration had to compromise between various adverse effects on the strength of light–matter interactions in the monolayer, the cavity photon lifetime, and the lateral size of the microcavity. Here, we demonstrate a scalable approach to fabricate high-quality planar microcavities with an integrated monolayer WS 2 layer-by-layer by using polymethyl methacrylate/silicon oxide (PMMA/SiO x ) as a cavity spacer. Because the exciton oscillator strength is well protected against the required processing steps by the PMMA layer, the microcavities investigated in this work, which have quality factors of above 10 3 , can operate in the strong light–matter coupling regime at room temperature. This is an important step toward fabricating wafer-scale and patterned microcavities for engineering the exciton-polariton potential landscape, which is essential for enabling many proposed technologies.},

By adding the pupil plane as the intermediate plane and decreasing the sampling interval, the FOV can be enlarged to nearly two times of the diffraction angle limit without any physical change. Due to the added spherical wave phase, the influence of aliasing is eliminated because the adjacent orders are projected to different viewpoints. The nonuniform image intensity caused by the sinc function modulation is compensated by image pre-processing. Optical experiments verify that the proposed method can present a uniform holographic near-eye display with a large FOV and adjustable viewpoint position.},

Ultrabroadband pump/Stokes pulses are generated employing the filamentation of high-power femtosecond pulses and can excite the Raman shift up to ∼3000 cm −1 . This configuration can avoid the need of a long hollow-core fiber and an additional supercontinuum compressor to obtain ultrabroadband pulses. The quasi-common-path second harmonic bandwidth compression system is utilized to generate narrow-band and sideband-free picosecond pulses, which are employed as the probe pulses in the CARS process. The accuracy and the precision of the fitting results from 1000 consecutive single-shot spectra at a target temperature of 1706 K are 0.66\% and 4.47\%, respectively. The results demonstrate that the simplified two-beam system has the potential for dynamic and accurate temperature measurement in practical applications.},

The waveguide detector equips a pair of quasi-Yagi antenna probes that are used to couple the terahertz energy to the HEMT channel. The gate is configured as an asymmetric edge-coupled coplanar waveguide transmission line. This terahertz electric field is asymmetrically distributed in the channel along the edges of the transmission lines. The responsivity and noise for direct and heterodyne detections are characterized and analyzed at different local oscillator (LO) powers. The noise-equivalent power in direct detection is below 189 pW/ Hz 1 / 2 ⁠ . Operated in a heterodyne mode with a LO power of −3 dBm, the detector offers a conversion loss less than 55 dB in a frequency band of 320–340 GHz. The channel in a form of transmission line performs the broad IF bandwidth, which is increased to gigahertz range (3 GHz), and reduces the output impedance to 377 Ω which is about 20 times lower than previously reported. The transmission-line impedance could be optimized together with the distribution of the terahertz electric field in the gated channel to reduce the conversion loss.},

Secondary species emission (SSE) is a term that encompasses many concurrent impact and emission phenomena that occur when electrosprayed primary species strike a surface, resulting in a diverse population of secondary electrons, ions, clusters, and droplets. This Letter examines the spatial dependency of SSE behavior across an [EMI]Im electrospray beam using microscopy of the target surface and experimental quantification of SSE yields as a function of the plume angle. Microscopy of the beam target confirms our prediction of shock-induced desorption when operating at elevated beam voltages. SSE yield measurements show that, upon impact with a surface, incident primary species that consist of entirely positive charge will produce both positive and negative SSE. Furthermore, the results show that the SSE yields for an ionic liquid electrospray have strong spatial and energy dependencies. These findings have significant implications for understanding and predicting ionic liquid electrospray thruster lifetime and performance and focused ion beam applications.},

The effects of the metal rod on the electric field distribution and the field enhancement factor are evaluated by numerical simulation and the conformal mapping method, and they indicate that the field emission regime is not reached. The breakdown voltages in the Townsend discharge regime are determined based on the voltage–current characteristics, which are obtained from two-dimensional fluid simulations. It is found that the breakdown characteristics can be significantly modulated by the floating metal rod, and the breakdown curve (breakdown voltage vs the net gap distance) is no longer U-shaped, which deviates from the conventional Paschen&#39;s law. The underlying physical mechanisms are related to the electric field enhancement, curved breakdown path, and nonuniform ion flux caused by the electric shielding effect. The results provide insights into breakdown characteristics in microscale discharges, which may promote conventional investigation of simplified clean gaps toward more complex conditions (e.g., with floating microparticles) in miniaturized plasma devices.},

  abstract     = {COVID-19 is still pandemic in the world although it has lasted for more than two years, in situ real-time disinfection of curved surfaces in public places is extremely urgent. A flexible plasma film based on surface dielectric barrier discharge is proposed in this study. In situ disinfection effect and the influence of curvature on the performance are studied. The results showed that the film could in situ inactivate a variety of pathogens. Specifically, 10 min plasma treatment results in a log reduction of 3.10, 3.42, and 3.03 for Escherichia coli , Staphylococcus aureus , and vesicular stomatitis virus, respectively. The discharge power and disinfection effect of the film are independent of the curvature, which proves that it can be used for in situ disinfection of curved surfaces. It is speculated that the combined effects of a strong electric field and radical etching physical damage as well as the chemical damage of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species to the protein are the main reasons for the inactivation of pathogens. The inhibition of the film to Omicron type SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus is 99.3\%, and the killing rate to natural bacteria is 94.3\%. The film can run for at least 10 h without significant reduction in disinfection effect. In addition, large-scale and digitalization increase the practical potential of a disinfection film. In conclusion, this film is expected to realize in situ real-time disinfection of curved surfaces such as the buttons of the elevator or instrument and door handles, which is of great significance in blocking the spread of COVID-19.},

With this technique, a single layer of photoresist is employed, and the gradient exposure process is used to define the profile of airbridges. In order to properly obtain the bridge profile, we design exposure dosage based on residual photoresist thickness and laser power calibrations. Compared with other airbridge fabrication techniques, the gradient exposure fabrication technique provides the ability to produce lossless superconducting airbridges with flexible size and, thus, is more suitable for large-scale superconducting quantum circuits.

Strategies, such as grain size engineering, chemical bonding engineering, steric impediment effect, and interface passivation, are employed to suppress the iodine migration but unfortunately are unable to completely eliminate it. Here, the influence of the dipole moment of A-site ions on iodine migration has been comprehensively investigated for perovskite films based on different A-site cations via a transient ion drift (TID) method. TID results demonstrate that the decrease in the strength of the dipole moment of A-site ions can lead to a decrease in the activation energy ( E A ) of iodine ions. Therefore, this work suggests that increasing the strength of dipole moment of A-site ions can be utilized as an effective strategy for suppressing iodine migration in perovskite films providing critical insight for enhancing the long-term stability for PSCs.},

Herein, an interfacial passivation strategy is developed employing cesium fluoride (CsF) to modify the surface of a perovskite film. Theoretical calculations suggest that the Cs + and F − ions have a targeted passivation effect to decrease the defect density of the perovskite. Meanwhile, Cs + -formamidine + (FA + ) and F − –I − ion exchange can occur on the perovskite surface, which leads to the decline of the Fermi level of perovskite and reinforces the built-in potential of PSCs. Additionally, experiment results also confirm the reduction in the interfacial defects and the enhancement of the built-in potential. Consequently, the open-circuit voltage ( V oc ) of PSCs is increased from 1.07 to 1.12 V, contributing to the promotion of the PCE. Furthermore, the stability of PSCs is obviously improved as well owing to the suppressed phase transition of α-phase perovskite. Our findings provide guidelines for surface modification of perovskite crystals to enhance the performance and stability of PSCs.},

As a result, the grain size improves resulting in better structural and optical properties. In contrast, Urbach energy values showed higher electronic disorder near the band edges even upon caffeine doping implying Sn 4+ doping in an ambient environment.

  abstract     = {The integration of narrow-band and spectral detection capabilities on pixel-level detectors is widely expected for compact infrared gas detection. This imposes great challenges on the detector performance, as the device response must precisely match with the gas absorption spectrum while also collecting enough signals in a limited spectral range to maintain high detection sensitivity. In this paper, a pixel-level narrow-band high quantum efficiency metal microcavity quantum well infrared photodetector (MC-QWIP) working around 10.6 μ m is designed and fabricated. The device shows good narrow-band characteristics (200–550 nm) and high peak responsivity (at least eight times stronger than the reference device with 45° edge facet). The results of experiments and numerical simulations show that several different resonance modes with peak wavelengths close to the intrinsic detection wavelength can be obtained by changing the width of the microcavity. The response bandwidth of the device can be controlled by changing resonance modes, while the resonant wavelength can be fine-tuned by the width of the microcavity. This indicates that the MC-QWIP device has good prospects in narrow-band gas detection and narrow-band differential detection.},

  abstract     = {Atomic picture and electronic transport property are taken into account to investigate the nonvolatile resistive switching mechanism of a memristor at the thinnest limit, just based on one monolayer hexagonal boron nitride ( h -BN). It is demonstrated that the intrinsic van der Waals gaps between electrodes and monolayer h -BN ensure the high resistance state (HRS). However, the absorption/desorption of a metallic-electrode atom on the one side of the h -BN can hardly switch the device to hold the experimentally observed ON/OFF current ratio. It is proposed that the electrode atom should penetrate the h -BN sheet via boron vacancy ( ⁠ V B ⁠ ) to form a full conductive atomic filament for an effective low resistance state. The current signal of this V B pinning Au conductive filament can reach up to three orders of magnitude higher than that of the HRS. The energy barrier for one Au atom to pass through V B is also reasonably as low as 0.832 eV. Molecular dynamics simulation further manifests the nonvolatility of this atomic conductive filament at the limit that could even maintain stability at 500 K. This work offers a key working picture in memristors at their thinnest limit, which provides a valuable reference to the development of emerging memory/computing devices at the ultrathin scale.},

Arrays with packing density ranging from 20 to 50 bundles μ m −1 are created via tangential flow interfacial self-assembly, and the transconductance and saturated on-state current density of FETs with either (i) strong ionic gel gates or (ii) weak 15 nm SiO 2 back gates are measured vs the degree of bundling. Both transconductance and on-state current significantly increase as median bundle height increases from 2 to 4 nm, but only when the strongly coupled ionic gel gate is used. Such devices tested at −0.6 V drain voltage achieve transconductance as high as 50 μ S per bundle and 2 mS μ m −1 and on-state current as high as 1.7 mA μ m −1 . At low drain voltages, the off-current also increases with bundling, but on/off ratios of ∼10 5 are still possible if the largest (95th percentile) bundles in an array are limited to ∼5 nm in size. Radio frequency devices with strong, wraparound dielectric gates may benefit from increased device performance by using moderately bundled as opposed to individualized CNTs in arrays.},

Five devices with different Ta electrode thicknesses (0, 2, 5, 10, and 20-nm) are fabricated. For devices with 2, 5, and 10-nm electrode thicknesses, CRS behavior can be obtained through an evolution process, while devices with 0 and 20-nm Ta electrode thicknesses always maintain stable bipolar resistive switching behavior. By analyzing the evolution process and current conduction mechanisms, the influence of non-inert electrode thickness on the performance of CRS is studied, and different oxidation degrees of a non-inert electrode are used to explain the different resistive switching performance in these devices. Aside from that, the model is verified by applying an asymmetric voltage sweeping method. This paper further clarifies the physical mechanism of CRS behavior in non-inert electrode resistive random access memory and provides a way to optimize the performance of CRS behavior.},

At the same time, the SnO 2 -based PSCs show improved stability. Herein, the defects at the device interface are reduced and the efficiency of the planar PSCs is enhanced by improving the interface contact between the ETL and the perovskite (PSK) layer. As an essential amino acid, tyrosine (Tyr) is introduced into SnO 2 to fill the oxygen vacancies in SnO 2 films and improve the nucleation of PSK. From our analysis, it was found that the interface contact between the SnO 2 ETL and the PSK layer was increased and the defects at the interface were reduced. In addition, it was demonstrated that the introduction of Tyr could effectively suppress the charge recombination and improve the electron extraction efficiency. As a result, a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.17\% was obtained from Tyr modified PSCs, owing to the enhanced PSK film quality and carrier extraction efficiency. On top of that, the Tyr-modified device still maintained 87\% of the initial recorded PCE, which was stored in the ambient air (25 °C, 25\%  ±  5\% RH) for 864 h without encapsulation.},

On top of that, low-voltage flexible OTFTs with a solution-processed 2,7-dioctyl benzothieno[3,2-b] benzothiophene channel layer were demonstrated. The AlO x dielectric film was deposited by employing the reactive magnetron sputtering technique from a metal Al target by using a gas mixture of Ar and O 2 at room temperature. At the same time, the surface morphology of the semiconductor film was optimized by controlling the solid solubility of polystyrene and polymethyl methacrylate in the semiconductor solution, which is important for improving the device performance. In this way, the prepared flexible OTFTs showed a low operating voltage of 3 V, a high switch ratio of 4.2 × 10 7 , a high mobility is 2.39 cm 2 /V s, and a steep subthreshold swing close to the theoretical limit of 68 mV/decade. It is, thus, expected that this method will be applicable to the development of high-performance OTFTs.},

In this manuscript, a facile method is developed to construct Fe-SAs on onion-like nitrogen-doped nanocarbons supported by graphene (ONCG). In contrast to the symmetrical planar Fe–N 4 moieties, the Fe-SAs coordinated with N atoms are located above the plane of the curved graphene and exhibited antenna-like structures. The ONCG with non-planar Fe–N 4 moieties possesses greatly increased dielectric loss property compared to their counterparts with symmetrical planar Fe-SAs. In-depth theoretical calculations reveal that the unique geometric structure of the non-planar Fe-SAs improves both conduction and polarization losses significantly, which is attributed to the increased dielectric property. The increased dielectric property endows Fe-SAs@ONCG with an excellent electromagnetic wave absorption at a low filler ratio of 10 wt.\%. Our results describe an efficient way for the development of non-planar SAs for dielectric applications.},

Most studies focus on the trigonal-prismatic (H-phase) MA 2 Z 4 nanosheets, while the stable octahedral (T-phase) MA 2 Z 4 ones are rarely explored. Here, based on first-principles calculations, we have identified a stable low-symmetry T-phase (T l -phase) geometry for the MSi 2 Z 4 (M = Mo, W; Z = P, As) materials. Such T l -MSi 2 Z 4 nanosheets are stabilized by the trimerization of metal atoms, which is distinct from the well-known T′-phase MoS 2 system that favors the metal dimerization instead. The investigated T l -MSi 2 Z 4 nanosheets are all direct-gap semiconductors with moderate gap sizes around 1 eV and hence exhibit a strong absorption capacity to visible lights. High hole mobilities of 10 4 –10 5 cm 2 /V s appear in the T l -MSi 2 Z 4 nanosheets that are dozens to hundreds of times larger than the electron mobilities. Moreover, superior photovoltaic performances are present in these T l -MSi 2 Z 4 materials, whose power-conversion efficiencies are estimated up to 26.1\%–31.8\% in a few micrometer thickness. In particular, the photovoltaic efficiency of the T l -MoSi 2 P 4 system can surpass the Shockley–Queisser limit and reaches 36.9\%–39.5\% under the concentration of 100–1000 suns illumination. Our study demonstrates that peculiar distorted T-phase geometries can exist in the layered MA 2 Z 4 family, which exhibit promising electronic, transport, and photovoltaic behaviors for nanoelectronics, nano-devices, and green-energy applications.},

  abstract     = {Spin–orbit torque (SOT) has been extensively applied to magnetization manipulation in low power consumption logic and memory devices. However, it is believed that materials with strong spin–orbit coupling (SOC) are indispensable for magnetic torque generation. Recently, theoretical studies have indicated that the oxides of light materials with weak SOC can provide a sizable orbital torque (OT), inducing magnetization switching. Here, we experimentally report the extreme enhancement of torque efficiency and spin Hall angle through the natural oxidation of Cu with weak SOC in the perpendicularly magnetized Pt/Co/Cu–CuO x multilayers. The values of torque efficiency and spin Hall angle increase by approximately five times by tuning the surface oxidation at room temperature. The comparative analysis of the effective field reveals that the significant enhancement mainly originates from the collaborative drive of the OT at the Cu/CuO x interface and the SOT from the Pt layer. This finding provides a powerful way to engineer the high-efficient spintronic devices through combining OT and SOT to improve the torque efficiency.},

Subsequently, the exchange stiffness constant is estimated based on the strength of the magnetic field for chirality transitions, as proposed by an analytical theory pertaining to chirality transitions, and confirmed based on micromagnetic prediction. Using the magneto-optical Kerr effect with high sensitivity on surface atomic layers, the present scheme is applicable to ultrathin magnetic films down to a few atomic layers, whose sensitivity is well below the lowest sensitivity limit of conventional measurement schemes. Hence, the present scheme is useful for extending the experimental range to investigate the exchange stiffness of few-atomic-layer-thick magnetic films.},

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional vanadium diselenide (VSe 2 ) has attracted extensive interest due to its room-temperature ferromagnetism with many potential applications. However, the intrinsic ferromagnetic (FM) ordering is confined to monolayers, which hinders their practical use because of fabrication difficulty. In this work, the effect of strain on magnetic properties of few-layer 1T-VSe 2 is studied based on first-principles calculations. Spin-polarized density functional theory calculations indicate that the monolayer is intrinsic FM, while the bilayer, trilayer, and quadlayer 1T-VSe 2 are intralayer FM but interlayer anti-ferromagnetic (AFM). The results predict that few-layer 1T-VSe 2 can undergo a prominent magnetic transition from AFM to FM and an enhancement of magnetic moment by introducing in-plane tensile strain above 2\%. A universal model is proposed to explain the enhanced FM that the structural deformation leads to symmetry breaking of the interlayer orbital hybridization, thus inducing FM of the whole system through an intralayer super-exchange effect. It is further verified on broader materials, including manganese and vanadium chalcogenides. This study provides a feasible route for achieving and modulating FM in two-dimensional materials, which have great significance in practical spintronic devices.},

However, easy-plane AFMs such as NiO, which are easier to prepare experimentally, are considered to be bad candidates for spin pumping because the Néel vector oscillation is linearly polarized, placing a major restriction on the material choice for practical applications. Through a case study of NiO, we show that an applied magnetic field below the spin–flop transition can substantially modify the polarization of the resonance eigenmodes, which enables coherent sub-terahertz spin pumping as strong as that in easy-axis AFMs. In addition, we find that an applied magnetic field can significantly reduce the threshold of Néel vector auto-oscillation triggered by spin-transfer torques. These prominent field-assisted effects can greatly facilitate spintronic device engineering in the sub-terahertz frequency regime.},

  abstract     = {β-Ga 2 O 3 is an emerging ultra-wide bandgap semiconductor, holding a tremendous potential for power-switching devices for next-generation high power electronics. The performance of such devices strongly relies on the precise control of electrical properties of β-Ga 2 O 3 , which can be achieved by implantation of dopant ions. However, a detailed understanding of the impact of ion implantation on the structure of β-Ga 2 O 3 remains elusive. Here, using aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy, we investigate the nature of structural damage in ion-implanted β-Ga 2 O 3 and its recovery upon heat treatment with the atomic-scale spatial resolution. We reveal that upon Sn ion implantation, Ga 2 O 3 films undergo a phase transformation from the monoclinic β-phase to the defective cubic spinel γ -phase, which contains high-density antiphase boundaries. Using the planar defect models proposed for the γ -Al 2 O 3 , which has the same space group as β-Ga 2 O 3 , and atomic-resolution microscopy images, we identify that the observed antiphase boundaries are the {100}1/4 ⟨110⟩ type in cubic structure. We show that post-implantation annealing at 1100 °C under the N 2 atmosphere effectively recovers the β-phase; however, nano-sized voids retained within the β-phase structure and a γ -phase surface layer are identified as remanent damage. Our results offer an atomic-scale insight into the structural evolution of β-Ga 2 O 3 under ion implantation and high-temperature annealing, which is key to the optimization of semiconductor processing conditions for relevant device design and the theoretical understanding of defect formation and phase stability.},

Since the architecture of DT synthesized planar- and recess-HEMT periodically along the gate width, SOD alleviated the peak electric field (E-field) around the gate region and the peak transconductance ( G m-max ) of 248 mS/mm with the associated transconductance plateau of ∼4.0 V at V ds = 28 V was obtained, which is evidently flatter than that of HEMT without the SOD structure. Attributed to the improved G m linearity at high E-field, the DT-SOD HEMT exhibits the predicted linearity figure of merit of 5–13 dB when biased at class AB operation, which is ∼10 dB higher than that of DT-HEMT. Moreover, the fabricated device yields a nearly constant f T / f max of 47/118 GHz over a wide gate voltage, and load-pull measurements at 30 GHz reveal that these devices deliver output power density ( P out ) of 7.8 W/mm with the associated 1-dB compression point ( P 1 dB ) of 28.5 dBm at V ds = 28 V.

The results showed that the device&#39;s saturation drain current decreased, the threshold voltage drifted positively, and the maximum transconductance decreased after irradiation. Interestingly, the forward gate leakage current was almost unchanged, and the reverse gate leakage current was reduced by two orders of magnitude. We found that this experimental phenomenon can be well explained by the Poole–Frenkel emission model. Proton irradiation led to deeper defect energy levels and higher defect concentrations of the device. Deeper defect energy levels made it more difficult for electrons to be excited from the trap state into the conduction band. Thus, the reverse gate leakage current decreased. Higher defect concentrations led to degradation of the output and transfer curves of the device. The deep level transient spectroscopy characterization defect further proved the correctness of this model. The reduction in the reverse gate leakage current had a positive impact on AlGaN/GaN HEMT devices in high power or high frequency applications.},

The Sb surfactant effect modifies the growth facet structure from a pyramidal-shaped growth front terminated by {1–1–0} planes to a flat (111)B growth plane, that is even further improved by the presence of Si co-dopants. Additional benefits are seen by the substantial change in microstructure, from a heavily defected layer stacking in Sb-free GaAs NWs to a twinned phase-pure zinc blende structure in Sb-mediated GaAs(Sb) NWs.

In this study, we introduce the concept of a variable effective electrolyte thickness (t eff ) precisely tuned by gate voltage-driven ions into the drain current equation of a conventional transistor. In order to understand the switching characteristics of a nonvolatile analog redox transistor that serves as an artificial synapse for neuromorphic systems, we developed a physics-based model in MATLAB. The simulated synaptic update curves obtained using identical gate pulses were in good agreement with the fabricated Cu-ion-actuated CuO x /HfO x /WO x redox transistor. We then analyzed the impact of geometrical and material-related parameters on the synaptic behavior, taking into account the ion speed and the degree of allowable electric field through the electrolyte. In addition, we performed Monte Carlo simulation to create a non-uniformly changed t eff circumstance. With this, we reproduced the fluctuated update of the channel current every gate pulse, which is occasionally observed experimentally when mobile ions are easily moved randomly. Our simulation results revealed that the redox transistor immune to the unevenly changed t eff can be achieved by lowering the ion velocity.},

  abstract     = {High-pressure hydrogen annealing (HPHA) treatment is an effective hydrogen doping method to improve electrical characteristics and stability of InGaZnO (IGZO) thin film transistors (TFTs). The HPHA effects on IGZO TFTs under various pressure conditions were investigated using analytical techniques. Drive current, field effect mobility, subthreshold swing, and bias stress stability of IGZO TFTs were significantly improved as the HPHA pressure was increased up to 20 atm. To analyze the performance enhancement, secondary ion mass spectroscopy, capacitance–voltage analysis, and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis techniques were performed. As a result, it was confirmed that doped hydrogen is combined with interface trap sites and oxygen vacancy related bulk defect sites, leading to improved subthreshold swing and bias stress stability. Furthermore, bulk trap passivation also contributes to high carrier density, thereby increasing driving current and field effect mobility. With increasing HPHA pressure condition, these effects of trap passivation and increase in the carrier density are more effective due to the heavily injected hydrogen.},

  abstract     = {The development of future valley based electronics or valleytronics requires a high degree of valley polarization (VP) in large area monolayer (1L)-MoS 2 . Though it is possible to synthesize 1L-MoS 2 films with large area coverage, VP property of as-grown films is found to be very poor. Here, we investigate the role of physisorbed air molecules and strain on the luminescence and the VP characteristics of large area monolayer MoS 2 grown on various substrates by a microcavity based chemical vapor deposition (CVD) technique. The study shows that the removal of adsorbates from sulfur vacancy ( V S ) sites not only suppresses the broad sub-bandgap luminescence feature that typically dominates low temperature photoluminescence (PL) spectra of these films but also significantly enhances VP. Post-growth transfer of the 1L-MoS 2 film from sapphire to a SiO 2 /Si substrate by a polystyrene assisted process is found to be highly effective in improving the polarization characteristic (∼80\%) of K-valleys through relaxation of the biaxial tensile strain and the removal of physisorbed air molecules from the V S sites. The process is also found to provide long lasting protection for MoS 2 films from air. The finding, thus, creates much needed opportunity to use CVD grown large area 1L-MoS 2 for realization of valleytronics of the future.},

The improved RF performance results from the enhanced gate control capability and the suppressed short-channel effects, as evidenced by the improved pinch-off characteristics, the improved transconductance, and the suppressed output conductance. It suggests that the tri-gate multi-fin architecture is a promising strategy to break the scaling limitation of the gate-channel aspect ratio toward high-performance β-Ga 2 O 3 RF MOSFETs.},

Here, we report a ⟨100⟩ semi-insulating gallium arsenide nano-hole array under above-the-bandgap excitation, which boosts terahertz emission power up to 5.75 folds of bare gallium arsenide with a 32 mW pump. The nano-structured array lifts the absorption of the optical pump and localizes the photocarriers near the surface of gallium arsenide, benefiting the transient photocurrents and thus the THz power. Interestingly, the enhancement is poorly related to the terahertz frequency, and the power difference of the emitted THz wave under the TE and TM pumps is greatly smoothed. In addition, the THz emission enhancement of the nanoscale hole arrays favors a low-power pump. The demonstration shown here provides a potential route for advancing the weak THz power of surface emission, which will promote the application of the surface emitting THz source in the practical THz systems employing compact femtosecond lasers.},

To realize reversible topological non-reciprocity in chiral metamaterials, researchers usually rely on reversing angular momentum bias of the circulation flow, time reversing the spatiotemporal modulation, and so on. Here, we demonstrate that switching Poisson&#39;s ratio from positive to negative can reverse the topological non-reciprocity by mechanically stretching and compressing a chiral acoustic metamaterial. We find that the positive–negative switch of Poisson&#39;s ratio is associated with the topological phase transition of the acoustic lattice, which is manifested as the reversed propagation of topological edge modes. The reversed topological non-reciprocity of metamaterials is attributed to the transmission switch of the three-port chiral unit. Finally, we propose a design of topological wave splitters, in which transmission directions are adjusted by the Poisson&#39;s ratio of the device. Our results indicate that the Poisson&#39;s ratio of metamaterials can introduce peculiar topological properties and bring potential applications for wave isolators, modulators, and circulators.},

  abstract     = {Acoustic metasurfaces are two-dimensional materials that impart non-trivial amplitude and phase shifts on incident acoustic waves at a predetermined frequency. While acoustic metasurfaces enable extraordinary wavefront engineering capabilities, they are not developed well enough to independently control the amplitude and phase of reflected and transmitted acoustic waves simultaneously, which are governed by their geometry. We aim to solve the inverse design problem of finding a geometry to achieve a specified set of acoustic properties. The geometry is modeled by discretizing the continuous space into a finite number of elements, where each element can either be filled with air or solid material. Full wave simulations are performed to obtain the acoustic properties for a given geometry. It is computationally infeasible to simulate all geometries. To address this challenge, we develop an experimental design-based algorithm to efficiently perform the simulations. The algorithm starts with a few geometries and adaptively adds geometries to the set, such that they fill the entire space of the desired acoustic properties using a small fraction of the possible geometries. We find that the geometry needs to have at least 7 × 7 elements to obtain any given acoustic property with a tolerance of 5.4\% of its maximum range. This is achieved by simulating 24 000 geometries using the proposed algorithm, which is only 4.2 × 10 − 9\% of the 563 × 10 12 possible geometries. The method provides a general solution to the inverse design problem that can be extended to control more acoustic properties.},

Field-effect transistor devices show a p-type behavior for InSe on SiO 2 , while for InSe on BN, the majority carriers are electrons. Moreover, due to the weakened electron–phonon interaction the electron mobility of InSe on BN is more than two magnitudes greater than its hole mobility on SiO 2 .

The research on freezing mechanisms on wicked surfaces, such as those found in heat pipes, is limited. Surface characteristics, including surface topography, have been found to impact freezing. This work investigates freezing mechanisms on wicks during condensation freezing. Experiments were conducted in an environmental chamber at 22 °C and 60\% relative humidity on three types of surfaces (i.e., plain copper, sintered heat pipe wicks, and grooved heat pipe wicks). The plain copper surface tended to freeze via ice bridging—consistent with other literature—before the grooved and sintered wicks at an average freezing time of 4.6 min with an average droplet diameter of 141.9 ± 58.1 μ m at freezing. The grooved surface also froze via ice bridging but required, on average, almost double the length of time the plain copper surface took to freeze, 8.3 min with an average droplet diameter of 60.5 ± 27.9 μ m at freezing. Bridges could not form between grooves, so initial freezing for each groove was stochastic. The sintered wick&#39;s surface could not propagate solely by ice bridging due to its topography, but also employed stochastic freezing and cascade freezing, which prompted more varied freezing times and an average of 10.9 min with an average droplet diameter of 97.4 ± 32.9 μ m at freezing. The topography of the wicked surfaces influenced the location of droplet nucleation and, therefore, the ability for the droplet-to-droplet interaction during the freezing process.},

Here, we demonstrate that the coherent control of the longitudinal laser modes enables control over the transverse modes of a quantum cascade laser. Modulating the laser in a frequency range 60 ± 3 MHz above the free-running laser beatnote and applying modulation powers above 25 dBm provides reliable fundamental transverse mode operation, observable as single-lobe, Gaussian-like characteristic in the recorded far-field.

For a 1.4 mm long and a 50 μ m wide ridge bar optically pumped by a high-power pulsed laser, we observed an emission peak at 568 nm with a narrow spectral width of less than 2 nm at room temperature. The measured pumping threshold is less than 1.5 MW/cm 2 , and the polarization ratio of the emission is over 90\%. This demonstration paves the way for the future development of electrically injected InGaN semiconductor yellow laser diodes.},

  abstract     = {Semiconducting two-dimensional materials and their heterostructures gained a lot of interest for applications as well as fundamental studies due to their rich optical properties. Assembly in van der Waals heterostacks can significantly alter the intrinsic optical properties as well as the wavelength-dependent absorption and emission efficiencies, making a direct comparison of, e.g., photoluminescence intensities difficult. Here, we determine the dielectric function for the prototypical MoSe 2 /WSe 2 heterobilayer and their individual layers. Apart from a redshift of 18–44 meV of the energetically lowest interband transitions, we find that for larger energies, the dielectric function can only be described by treating the van der Waals heterobilayer as a new artificial homobilayer crystal rather than a stack of individual layers. The determined dielectric functions are applied to calculate the Michelson contrast of the individual layers and the bilayer in dependence of the oxide thickness of often used Si/SiO 2 substrates. Our results highlight the need to consider the altered dielectric functions impacting the Michelson interference in the interpretation of intensities in optical measurements such as Raman scattering or photoluminescence.},

  abstract     = {The recent decade has witnessed the advent of near-field radiative heat transfer (NFRHT) in a wide range of applications, including thermal photovoltaics and thermal diodes. However, the design process for these thermal devices has remained complex, often relying on the intuition and expertise of the designer. To address these challenges, a machine learning (ML) strategy based on the combination of an artificial neural network (ANN) and a genetic algorithm (GA) is presented. The ANN is trained to model representative scenarios, viz., NFRHT between metamaterials and NFRHT and thermal rectification between nanoparticles. The influence of different problem complexities, i.e., the number of input variables of function to be fitted, on effectiveness of the trained ANN is investigated. Test results show that ANNs can obtain the radiative heat flow and rectification ratio accurately and rapidly. Subsequently, physical parameters for the largest radiative heat flow and rectification ratio are determined by the utilization of GA on the trained ANN, and underlying mechanisms of deterministic optimum are discussed. Our work shows that data-driven ML methods are a powerful tool, which offers unprecedented opportunities for future NFRHT research.},

MOS total-ionizing-dose (TID) response is affected strongly by size scaling and the migration from planar to three-dimensional architectures. Radiation-induced charge trapping in isolation oxides and/or charge transport from surrounding materials are critical to the TID response of nanoscale MOS devices. As transistor dimensions and operating voltages have decreased, single-event effects due to cosmic rays and high-energy protons in space and neutrons in terrestrial environments have become increasingly significant to the radiation response of MOS devices. However, nanoscale MOS transistors are essentially immune to ion-induced gate rupture at normal operating voltages. Single-particle interactions will become even more important for future, ultimately scaled MOS devices used in classical and quantum computing applications.},

In contrast to conventional layered oxide cathodes (LiTMO 2 , TM denotes transition metal), invoking oxygen redox by increasing the chemical ratio of Li/O in oxide cathode can further boost the development of new types of high-capacity cathodes which theoretically enable the realization of LIBs of above 400 Wh/kg and are even attainable for 600 Wh/kg, meeting the future demands of various application scenarios for high energy density, such as electrical aircraft. However, the revolution of high-capacity cathodes is far from the realistic elevation of cell-level energy density and their practical applications in LIBs, which involves the considerations of other indispensable metrics in terms of both materials and technologies. Therefore, in this perspective, an in-depth discussion from fundamentals to applications of oxygen-based cathode materials is provided. First, we briefly summarized the representative investigations on oxygen redox mechanisms. Moreover, intrinsic properties of materials based on oxygen redox are multidimensionally evaluated. Furthermore, cell-level gravimetric energy density, potentials for practical applications, and possible design strategies are critically analyzed.},

  abstract     = {Shock initiation criteria are essential to the shock initiation process and applications in modern pyrotechnics. The most commonly used shock initiation criteria are Walker and James criterion, which can very well describe the threshold data of the impactor with sufficient size. However, the criteria were also found not to provide a good fit to the data of thin, curve, or small flyers. By comparing the wave structure of the shock process with the stable detonation wave structure, a shock initiation criterion is developed based on the concept of the chemical reactions during the impact, focusing more on the properties of the explosives. Furthermore, a desktop micro-flyer initiating system was designed for the initiation of the thin metal flyer. The obtained data and classical historical data were analyzed with the proposed criterion, producing an excellent fit, with R 2 values greater than 0.96. Compared to the existing criteria, the proposed criterion can weaken the influence of the interfacial properties of the impact and collapse the threshold velocity data with different impactor types to a single curve. The shock sensitivities of various explosives are also discussed based on the criterion. A denser impactor or the incorporation of impurities may contribute to the generation of the hot spot during the impact, leading to an increase in the sensitivity. The proposed criterion provides insight into the development of the shock initiation criteria and may help to understand the mechanism of shock initiations.},

The spectral radiance of the emitted light from a small portion of the microstructure (a “microenvironment”) containing a small number of TATB particles with an estimated mass of 150 ng was measured every 0.8 ns from 1 ns to 200 μ s and was analyzed to give radiance and time-dependent graybody temperatures. By fabricating an array with 186 PBX charges, we could obtain ≥15 shots at each of 12 velocities between 1.8 and 4.7 km/s. We found that every microenvironment generated a unique radiance fingerprint. Some of these microenvironments were much more reactive than average. The radiance has two peaks around 20 ns and 5 μ s, associated with shock ignition and deflagration growth. In our interpretation, the shock creates an ensemble of hot spots of various sizes and temperatures. Of those hot spots that ignite, only a small portion, at about 2200 K, was large enough and hot enough to survive long enough (&gt;100 ns) to ignite individual TATB particles, leading to deflagration. Integrating various time intervals of the radiance can quantify the strength of the shock–PBX interaction, and the decay and growth of the hot spot ensemble and the deflagration.},

They not only serve as the electron donors to create the desired NV − center and provide charge stability against photo-ionisation but also are the main source of decoherence. Therefore, precise and quick determination of N s 0 concentration is a key advantage to a multitude of NV-related research in terms of material improvement as well as applications. Here, we present a method to determine the N s 0 concentration based on absorption spectroscopy in the UV-Visible range and fitting the 270 nm absorption band. UV-Visible spectroscopy has experimental simplicity and widespread availability that bear advantages over established methods. It allows a rapid determination of N s 0 densities, even for large numbers of samples. Our method shows further advantages in determining low concentrations as well as the ability to measure locally, which is highly relevant for diamonds with largely varying N s 0 concentrations in a single crystal. A cross-check with electron paramagnetic resonance shows high reliability of our method and yields the absorption cross section of the 270 nm absorption band σ = 1.96 ± 0.15 cm −1 ppm −1 (in common logarithm) or σ e = 4.51 ± 0.35 cm −1 ppm −1 (in natural logarithm), which serves as a reference to determine N s 0 concentrations and makes our method applicable for others without the need for a known N s 0 -reference sample and calibration. We provide a rapid, practical, and replicable pathway that is independent of the machine used and can be widely implemented as a standard characterization method for the determination of N s 0 concentrations.},

  abstract     = {A merged-element transmon (MET) device based on silicon (Si) fins is proposed, and the first steps to form such a “FinMET” are demonstrated. This new application of fin technology capitalizes on the anisotropic etch of Si(111) relative to Si(110) to define atomically flat, high aspect ratio Si tunnel barriers with epitaxial superconductor contacts on parallel sidewall surfaces. This process circumvents the challenges associated with the growth of low-loss insulating barriers on lattice matched superconductors. By implementing low-loss, intrinsic float-zone Si as the barrier material rather than commonly used, potentially lossy AlO x , the FinMET is expected to overcome problems with standard transmons by (1) reducing dielectric losses; (2) minimizing the formation of two-level system spectral features; (3) exhibiting greater control over barrier thickness and qubit frequency spread, especially when combined with commercial fin fabrication and atomic-layer or digital etching; (4) potentially reducing the footprint by several orders of magnitude; and (5) allowing scalable fabrication. Here, as a first step to making such a device, the fabrication of Si fin capacitors on Si(110) substrates with shadow-deposited Al electrodes is demonstrated. These fin capacitors are then fabricated into lumped element resonator circuits and probed using low-temperature microwave measurements. Further thinning of silicon junctions toward the tunneling regime will enable the scalable fabrication of FinMET devices based on existing silicon technology while simultaneously avoiding lossy amorphous dielectrics for the tunnel barriers.},

  abstract     = {Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) capable of efficiently harvesting various mechanical energies from the environment are an effective way to solve the energy supply problem of wearable electronic devices. A series of flexible and lightweight TENGs with different surface morphologies of “dots”–“lines”–“honeycombs” hierarchical micro-structures are developed using low-cost and easily accessible background paper as a substrate. Polydimethylsiloxane films with dots–lines–honeycombs hierarchical micro-structures are prepared by the spin coating to obtain larger contact areas and, thus, enhance the triboelectric effect. Under the same test conditions, the honeycombs TENG (H-TENG) with complex surface morphology has the largest output performance with an open-circuit voltage of 55 V and a short-circuit current of 2.7 μ A, which is 2.1 and 2.5 times that of the flat TENG, respectively. By combining with nylon gloves, the H-TENG can harvest the mechanical energy during hand movement and realize sensing of hand movement patterns through the difference of electrical signals. In addition, this device can power the liquid crystal display screen through a rectifier circuit and capacitor. This simple and efficient TENG device shows great potential in the wearable field.},

The method combines traditional feedback based wavefront shaping together with a switch function, controlled by two different signals. A simple, in transmission imaging system is used with two detectors: one monitors the speckle signature and the other tracks the fully hidden signal (e.g., fluorescent beads). The algorithm initially finds the optimal incident wavefront to maximize light transmission to generate a focus in the scattering medium. This modulation process redirects the scattered input signal, inducing instantaneous changes in both monitored signals, which, in turn, locates the hidden objects. Once the response from the hidden target becomes distinct, the algorithm switches to use this signal as the feedback. We provide experimental demonstrations as a proof of concept of our approach. Potential applications of our method include extracting information from biological samples and developing noninvasive diagnosis methods.},

  abstract     = {The rate and precision at which samples can be scanned by Raman spectroscopy strongly depend on laser and material parameters. In this article, we describe the trade-off between parameters that increased laser intensities to improve resolution and reduce integration times, and its effect on thermally induced shift and asymmetric broadening of the line profile, especially in the case of resonant Raman. We present an analytical approximation to describe this phenomenon for all volumetrically absorbing materials and a wide range of laser parameters. This allows the determination of an optimal scan rate for the sample material and the required optical resolution, or vice versa, the determination and accurate correction for thermally induced shifts and asymmetries. This study provides an analytical quantification of this often-neglected line asymmetry and allows us to correct for its impact on the signal with few material properties and laser parameters. It may, in particular, allow us to discriminate this effect against other sources of peak asymmetry due to intrinsic properties. We obtain this analytical expression by condensing a parametrized finite element method model into a heuristic probability density function of temperature that describes the full parameter space. This function can be applied to any thermally undistorted line shape by convolution to determine a corrected line profile. This profile then provides a parameter-dependent optimized fitting function for an optimal determination of Raman signal parameters.},

It is well known that the operation of core/shell quantum dot-based light-emitting diodes largely relies on charge transport. However, the charge transport mechanism in quantum dot films is still under debate and inconclusive. Herein, the temperature-dependent charge transport properties of light-emitting core/shell colloidal quantum dot thin films are characterized and analyzed across a wide temperature range, and the charge transport mechanism is studied. The results reveal that Poole–Frenkel emission conduction is applicable in the high-temperature range. With the decrease in the temperature, the measured current can be described by the Efros–Shklovskii variable-range hopping model. It is worth noting that, in both cases, trap states and disorders in the quantum dot film play a very important role in charge transport. These findings are of great importance for optimizing quantum dot light-emitting diodes and understanding the effects of charge transport on the device performance.},

Here, based on first-principles calculations, we demonstrate the intrinsic valley-polarized quantum anomalous Hall effect in a monolayer ferrovalley material: Janus VSiGeN 4 , of which the edge states are chiral-spin-valley locking. Furthermore, a small tensile or compressive strain can drive phase transition in the material from the valley-polarized quantum anomalous Hall state to the half-valley-metal state. With the increase in the strain, the material turns into a ferrovalley semiconductor with the valley anomalous Hall effect. The origin of the phase transition is the sequent band inversion of the V d orbital at the K valleys. Moreover, we find that phase transition causes the sign reversal of the Berry curvature and induces different polarized light absorption in different valley states. Our work provides an ideal material platform for practical applications and experimental exploration of the interplay among topology, spintronics, and valleytronics.},

Here, we report that a two-dimensional phosphorous nitride monolayer simultaneously possesses auxetic behavior and undergoes a topological phase transition under tensile strain. The monolayer has a normal-auxeticity mechanical phase transition when a tensile strain above 0.055 is applied along the P–P zigzag direction. The negative Poisson ratio can even approach as abnormally high as −0.60. Furthermore, the material is an intrinsic Dirac material, but a phase transition from the semi-Dirac material to Dirac material is observed at nearly the same critical tensile strain as that in auxetic phase transition. An electronic orbital analysis reveals that the simultaneity of the normal-auxeticity phase transition and topological phase transition originates from the variation of orbital hybridization around the Fermi level.},

Phys. 110 , 2810 (1999)] and therewith developed a general and robust procedure to calculate dielectric constants of slab systems from electric displacement and electric field, which is free from material-specific adjustable parameters. We have applied the procedure to a prototypical substrate, Al 2 O 3 , thereby computing high-frequency and static dielectric constants of a finite slab as a function of the number of crystalline unit-cell layers. We find that two and four layers are sufficient for the high-frequency and static dielectric constants of (0001) Al 2 O 3 slabs to recover 90\% of the respective bulk values computed by a Berry-phase method. This method allows one to estimate the thickness dependence of dielectric constants for various materials used in emerging two-dimensional nanophotonics, while providing an analytic formula that can be incorporated into photonics simulations.},

Moreover, it is possible to form stable self-assembled heterostructures of ferroelectric CuInP 2 S 6 (CIPS) and non-ferroelectric (i.e., lacking Cu) In 4/3 P 2 S 6 (IPS) phases, by controlling the targeted composition and kinetics of synthesis.

We show that it is possible to isolate the different phononic modes of the two phases by spatially correlating them with their distinct ferroelectric behavior.

The predicted out-of-plane piezoelectric strain coefficient d 31 is −1.58 pm/V, which is higher than that of most 2D materials (compare absolute values of d 31 ). The large out-of-plane piezoelectricity is robust against electronic correlation and biaxial strain, confirming reliability of large d 31 . The calculated results show that tensile strain is conducive to high Curie temperature, large magnetic anisotropy energy, and large d 31 . Finally, by comparing d 31 of CrYX (Y = S; X = Cl, Br, I) and CrYX (Y = O; X = F, Cl, Br), we conclude that the size of d 31 is positively related to electronegativity difference of X and Y atoms.

  abstract     = {Generating large topologically protected surface currents using conventional III–V infrared materials such as InAsSb/InGaSbAs quantum wells (QWs) and superlattices (SLs) has been important. In such materials, topological states can be formed at the edge by hybridizing ordinary electronic band structures. However, achieving large surface currents out of these materials is still difficult due to low emission currents and high carrier defects. In this work, we present two hybridized topological structures: one for the 6.22 Å metamorphic QWs and the other for the 6.10 Å pseudomorphic SLs. Both structures are tailored for the same hybridization gap (Δ) of ∼60 meV and optimized for the minimum crystal defects. While the QW grown on metamorphic buffers generates a significant amount of mismatch-related crystal defects, the SL grown on lattice-matched buffers produces an excellent crystalline-quality. Quasiparticle interference mapping and calculations on a SL sample show good agreement of the band structure.},

  abstract     = {Low-voltage, solution-processed oxide thin-film transistors (TFTs) have shown great potential in next-generation low-power, printable electronics. However, it is now still quite challenging to obtain low-voltage oxide TFTs with both high mobility and stability, especially for solution-processed ones. In this work, La-doped InZnO (IZO:La) channel for high performance and stable TFTs is developed using a simple solution process. The effects of La composition in IZO:La on the film and TFT performance are systematically investigated. It is confirmed that the incorporation of appropriate La could control the carrier concentration, improve the surface morphology, and passivate the oxygen-related defects, leading to a reduced trap density both at dielectric/channel interface and within the channel layer. As a result, the optimized TFTs with 1\% La dopants exhibit the best overall performance, including a low operating voltage of 1 V, a high mobility of 14.5 cm 2 /V s, a low subthreshold swing of 109 mV/dec, a turn-on voltage close to 0 V, and negligible changes of performance under both positive and negative bias stresses. This work might support the development of all-solution-processed oxide TFT backplanes for battery-powered active-matrix displays.},

  abstract     = {We present characterization results of integrated vacuum gaps in semiconductors and report the highest breakdown field of dielectric layers ever recorded within microfabricated semiconductor devices. Difficulties associated with the characterization of vacuum gaps in the presence of high electric fields could be overcome by using cylindrical capacitors with silicon electrodes that were manufactured with standard semiconductor technology. With this approach, breakdown fields of up to 6 × 10 9 V/m were achieved. The vacuum gaps of 175(5) nm were significantly smaller than the mean free path of electrons within the gap such that a breakdown due to avalanche discharge was avoided. As the voltage was increased, initially a field emission current was observed that followed a Fowler–Nordheim tunneling behavior. The tunneling current started to increase at voltages about four times greater as compared to equivalent dielectric layers of silicon oxide. At higher voltages, a mechanical breakdown occurred, where the pillars that formed the central electrode of the capacitor snapped due to electrostatic forces. We provide characteristics of thin vacuum layers, which could be useful for device design in micro- and nanoelectromechanical systems as well as semiconductor devices.},

  abstract     = {Beta-phase gallium oxide ( ⁠ β -Ga 2 O 3 ) is a promising semiconductor for high frequency, high temperature, and high voltage applications. In addition to the β -phase, numerous other polymorphs exist and understanding the competition between phases is critical to control practical devices. The phase formation sequence of Ga 2 O 3 , starting from amorphous thin films, was determined using lateral-gradient laser spike annealing at peak temperatures of 500–1400 °C on 400 μ s to 10 ms timescales, with transformations characterized by optical microscopy, x-ray diffraction, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The resulting phase processing map showed the γ -phase, a defect-spinel structure, first nucleating under all annealing times for temperatures from 650 to 800 °C. The cross-sectional TEM at the onset of the γ -phase formation showed nucleation near the film center with no evidence of heterogeneous nucleation at the interfaces. For temperatures above 850 °C, the thermodynamically stable β -phase was observed. For anneals of 1–4 ms and temperatures below 1200 °C, small randomly oriented grains were observed. Large grains were observed for anneals below 1 ms and above 1200 °C, with anneals above 4 ms and 1200 °C resulting in textured films. The formation of the γ -phase prior to β -phase, coupled with the observed grain structure, suggests that the γ -phase is kinetically preferred during thermal annealing of amorphous films, with β -phase subsequently forming by nucleation at higher temperatures. The low surface energy of the γ -phase implied by these results suggests an explanation for the widely observed γ -phase inclusions in β -phase Ga 2 O 3 films grown by a variety of synthesis methods.},

  abstract     = {GaN-based high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) have exhibited great application prospects in power and radio frequency devices, thanks to the superior properties of GaN. Despite the significant commercialization progress, the reliability of GaN-based HEMTs remains a challenge. This work experimentally investigates the time-dependent degradation of Mg-doped GaN/AlN superlattice HEMTs under both OFF-state and SEMI-ON-state bias conditions and proposes that GaN/AlN superlattices as a barrier can solve the V th instability issues of GaN HEMTs under OFF-state and SEMI-ON-state bias conditions. On the one hand, in the SEMI-ON-state, the hot electron effect leads to the degradation of I g , g m,max , and I d,sat to varying degrees. However, the as-prepared GaN-based HEMTs exhibit excellent V th stability (almost no change) under hot electron injection, on the account of the excellent two-dimensional electron gas confinement in the GaN/AlN superlattice structure. On the other hand, in the OFF-state, positive V th shift (about 0.12 V) is induced by the hole emission in the GaN/AlN superlattice structure under reverse bias stress. In addition, the stress-induced destruction of MgO gate dielectric gives rise to the gate leakage, which increases by 2 orders of magnitude and triggers an irreversible degradation (about 10\%) of the g m,max . These results are expected to provide a solution to the V th instability of GaN HEMTs.},

  abstract     = {The traditional strategy for transparent conducting oxides (TCOs) follows the path of chemical design by increasing carrier concentrations in insulators through deliberate doping to coordinate the exclusive properties of electrical conductivity with optical transparency. Despite the success of n-type TCOs, the developed p-type TCOs based on chemical design exhibit much lower performance than the n-type counterparts primarily constrained by the hole doping trouble. Recently, the correlated metal of a V 2 O 3 thin film has been reported as high-performance p-type TCOs with high hole concentration (&gt;10 22 cm −3 ). In this paper, we propose an alternative approach of compressive strain in V 2 O 3 thin films toward further increasing the carrier concentration and, consequently, enhancing the performance of p-type TCOs. The compressive strain of the V 2 O 3 thin film is realized by the lattice mismatch between V 2 O 3 and Al 2 O 3 . Interestingly, carrier concentrations in strained V 2 O 3 thin films can be increased by several times exceeding 10 23 cm −3 , which directly correlates with the increase (decrease) in a 1 g ( ⁠ e g π ⁠ ) orbital occupation as verified by the Raman spectrum. Meanwhile, the screened plasma energy of a strained V 2 O 3 thin film shifts to ∼1.6 eV, which is less than 1.75 eV to assure the opening of the transparency window in the visible region. As a result, strained V 2 O 3 thin films exhibit enhanced performance as p-type TCOs with relatively high figure of merit. These results indicate that the structural modification can open up an effective approach for increasing the carrier concentration and enhancing the performance of p-type TCOs.},

We conducted ab initio molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the transition of KBS from a crystalline to amorphous phase. Initiated by the Bi–Se bond breaking at the boundaries of atom blocks, the simulated phase transition proceeds through the conversion between BiSe x octahedral and pyramid structures. Remarkable discrepancies in electronic structures and absorption spectra between the two phases are further illustrated by density functional theory simulations, which reproduce the experimental observations. The optical and electrical contrasts between the two phases are found to originate from the band edge states localized at various atom blocks that uniquely appear in the crystalline phase. These states provide pseudo one-dimensional transport channels with resonant bonding that may further intensify the electrical contrast. The distinct phase change properties compared with traditional phase change materials can be attributed to the hierarchical KBS crystal structure comprised of loosely bound atom blocks. The above findings pave an avenue toward the design of phase change materials beyond the traditional scope of the Ge–Sb–Te triangle map.},

  abstract     = {By varying the degree of correlation in stealthy hyperuniform (SHU) materials, the continuous evolution from uncorrelated disorder to periodic media is possible and allows us, as such, to study the fate of the bimodal distribution, the characteristic of a diffusive transport. Considering the wave transport through a SHU distribution of a given number of scatterers and at a given frequency, the transition from a diffusive to a transparent medium is clearly observed only below the Bragg frequency. This transition is characterized by a threshold value of the stealthiness at the vicinity of which the material abruptly changes from diffusive to transparent. In contrast, no such clear transition is observed at or above the Bragg frequency and, surprisingly, a seemingly bimodal distribution of the transmission eigenvalues still characterizes the SHU materials, even when strongly correlated.},

  abstract     = {A class of active nonreciprocal metamaterial (ANMM) is presented which consists of an acoustic duct with periodically placed active diaphragms that are controlled by a spatiotemporal modulation strategy. The acoustic nonreciprocities can be realized by modulating a system&#39;s properties spatiotemporally. Such an approach has been extensively employed by many investigators to break the reciprocity in acoustic and elastic metamaterials. However, our proposed ANMM distinguishes itself from the above-mentioned methods by introducing actively tunable space-time modulated feedback gain of the controllers. The controller is implemented in an analog manner to enable fast response at high modulation frequencies. By discretizing a 1D acoustic duct into multiple acoustic unit cavities, we introduced a time-varying gain with a phase difference between adjacent acoustic cavities. Directional band gaps of the modulated system are numerically analyzed as the asymmetric acoustic wave propagation can be realized by converting the acoustical energy from the fundamental mode to higher order modes. In addition, nonreciprocal behavior of the proposed ANMM was experimentally demonstrated using a waveguide with periodically placed condenser microphones (sensors) and speakers (actuators).},

Despite the large number of studies on the electron emission of the scandate tungsten cathode, there is a lack of understanding of the performance of scandium oxide incorporated in other refractory metal matrix. In this work, by applying first-principles calculations, we study the role that Sc 2 O 3 nanocluster plays in enhancing the electron emission of the Hf cathode (labeled as Sc 2 O 3 @Hf). We find that Sc 2 O 3 @Hf is both thermally and mechanically stable, exhibits complex surface structures, and possesses inverse relationship between surface energy and work function. Moreover, the work function of the Hf (0001) surface can be reduced to 3.50 eV due to the change in the vacuum level when Sc 2 O 3 nanocluster is doped, while the work function of the Hf (10 1 ¯ 2) surface can be reduced to 3.39, 3.39, and 3.03 eV when doped with Sc 2 O 3 , Y 2 O 3 , and CeO 2 clusters, respectively.},

The complete regime map of rebounding states is proposed, which can be divided into no-coalesce, jug-like, pancake-like, and pendulum-like rebounding-coalescing behaviors. Subsequently, the increase in the contact time in pendulum-like rebounding-coalescing behaviors is captured and described by a linear model well. Finally, a theoretical prediction based on momentum conservation for the averaged maximal spreading radius of the coalesced droplet is provided. Our approach provides insight into a mechanism of the rebounding-coalescing behaviors, which is helpful for the improvement in related applications.},

As a commonly used insulating substrate, the (111) cut of MgO shows alternating planes of Mg 2+ and O 2− that form a hexagonal unit cell at the surface, which is useful for thin films with similar crystal symmetries. We present a method to prepare such a surface by first introducing ( 3 × 3 ) R 30 ° reconstructed MgO (111) surface via face-to-face annealing in an O 2 environment. We then dissolve the top layers in acid to achieve an unreconstructed and also passivated surface. The structure, stoichiometry, and stability of the resulting surfaces are characterized.

Additionally, benefiting from the anisotropic crystal structure of Bi 2 Se 2.15 S 0.85 , the devices also display good polarization detection performance in a wide spectral range from 266 nm to 1064 nm with a dichroic ratio of 1.81 at 360 nm.},

However, Bi 2 O 2 Se photodetectors suffer limited sensitivity at a near-infrared region due to the relatively weak light absorption at this band. Here, it is demonstrated that coupling with plasmonic nanostructures can effectively improve the performance of Bi 2 O 2 Se photodetectors at a broad spectral range of 532–1550 nm. By virtue of plasmon-induced hot-electron injection and the improved light absorption, the WO 3 − x /Bi 2 O 2 Se hybrid photodetector exhibits a high responsivity of ∼1.7 × 10 6 A/W at 700 nm, and ∼48 A/W at a communication O-band of 1310 nm, which is nearly one order of magnitude higher than that of an intrinsic Bi 2 O 2 Se device. Moreover, profited by ultrafast hot electron transfer and the avoided defect trapping, the device maintains a high-speed photoresponse (rise time ∼326 ns, decay time ∼47 μ s). Our results show that 2D materials coupled with plasmonic nanostructures is a promising architecture for developing state-of-the-art broadband photodetection.},

  abstract     = {Exploring and understanding magnetism in two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) magnetic materials present a promising route for developing high-speed and low-power spintronics devices. Studying their magnetic properties at the nanoscale is challenging due to their low magnetic moment compared to bulk materials and the requirements of highly sensitive magnetic microscopy tools that work over a wide range of experimental conditions (e.g., temperature, magnetic field, and sample geometry). This Perspective reviews the applications of nitrogen-vacancy center (NV) based magnetometry to study magnetism in 2D vdW magnets. The topics discussed include the basics, advantages, challenges, and the usage of NV magnetometry.},

  abstract     = {Since the first reports on the observation of magnetic order in atomically thin crystals of FePS 3 , CrI 3 , and CrGeTe 3 in 2016 and 2017, there has been a greatly renewed interest in the magnetism of van der Waals (vdW) layered magnets. Due to their dimensionality and structure, ultrathin vdW magnets offer tantalizing prospects for electrostatic control of magnetism for energy-efficient spintronic logic and memory devices. Recent demonstrations revealed unusually high susceptibility of some vdW magnets to electrostatic fields and shed light on a path to room temperature devices, a long-standing goal in spintronics research. In this Perspective, we discuss the potential of different classes of vdW magnets for electrostatic control of magnetism by comparing their properties with those of non-vdW magnets such as dilute magnetic III–V semiconductors and perovskite manganites that have been intensively studied in the past two decades.},

In this Letter, based on theoretical calculations and effective model analysis, we predicted the quadratic phonon states in the hexagonal compound Li 2 NaN. Particularly, two quadratic nodal lines are found, which are distributed along the same straight Γ–A path, protected by the C 6 v point group symmetry. The detailed band surface distribution and effective Hamiltonian construction are elucidated, demonstrating the quadratic order dispersion. These two quadratic nodal lines were further categorized into type-I and type-III, and their surface spectral properties were calculated, in which clear drumhead surface states are observed for both quadratic nodal lines, and they stretched throughout the entire Brillouin zone. Furthermore, the surface states were well separated from the bulk band projection, which is extremely beneficial for experimental detection. Notably, phononic quadratic nodal line states have been rarely studied and, more importantly, a type-III line has even not been reported thus far. Therefore, our work can pave the way for related studies for both quadratic nodal lines and type-III states, and the presented material can serve as an ideal candidate to promote further experimental investigation.},

We show that varying the interlayer spacing and, hence, the interlayer coupling strength results in dramatic modifications of the local optical conductivity at the domain walls (DWs) in TBG, which leads to significant changes in the polariton interference profile near DWs. Moreover, our simulation reveals that the two-dimensional near-field interference pattern generated by polariton propagation in hBN/TBG heterostructures can be dramatically changed by interlayer spacing and the superlattice period. Our study demonstrates that combining interlayer spacing modification with moiré superlattices is a valuable route to control light at the nanoscale and design nanophotonic devices with tunable functionalities.},

  abstract     = {In dielectric science, the electrical breakdown strength of a polymeric material significantly decreases with elevated temperatures, which restricts the development of advanced electrical and electronic applications toward miniaturization. In the present study, to clarify the temperature-dependent DC breakdown mechanisms of epoxy resin (EP)/TiO 2 nanocomposites, the effects of nanoparticle incorporation and temperature on charge transport and molecular chain dynamics were studied. The results indicate that space charge accumulation and electric field distortion are reduced by nanoparticle incorporation to enhance the deep trap level, while space charge accumulation, electric field distortion, and molecular displacement are all accelerated as temperature increases. To further investigate the influence of carrier traps and molecular chain dynamics on temperature-dependent breakdown, a DC breakdown simulation model that involves bipolar charge transport, molecular chain dynamics, and breakdown criterion equations is established. The calculated breakdown strengths of EP/TiO 2 nanocomposites show great accordance with the experimental results, which indicates that temperature-dependent DC breakdown mechanisms are dominated by the synergetic effects of carrier traps and segment chain dynamics. Through the analysis of the breakdown model, a transition of the dominant mechanism (from segment chain to backbone dynamics) near the glass-transition temperature for DC breakdown of EP/TiO 2 nanocomposites is discovered.},

Understanding electronic excitations in a spin-polarized band structure is essential for the further use of this material in spin-based devices and to optimize the spin-dependent electronic structure in related compounds. In this Letter, we report electronic Raman scattering of NiFeMnSn with spectral signatures at a higher wavenumber than expected from the calculated phonon modes of the system. Temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy demonstrates a non-monotonic behavior of the Raman shift with temperature across T c . The orbital resolved electronic density of states and electronic band structure for both spin channels of the system, as obtained from the first principles density functional theory calculations, suggest that the observed Raman signatures originate from the Fe d orbital and its splitting due to the crystal field near the Fermi level. Furthermore, a strong magnetic field dependence of the spectral profile is observed. The study not only exhibits electronic Raman scattering in a Heusler alloy compound, which was unexplored to date, but also establishes Raman scattering as a promising probe to study the orbital-resolved partial density of states in the band structure near the Fermi level of a Heusler alloy.},

  abstract     = {Since magnonics takes advantage of not only the amplitude of spin waves but also their phase, tunable phase shifters are key elements for the implementation of magnonic circuits. Therefore, one of the major challenges in nano-magnonics is to find a physical mechanism to manipulate the spin-wave phase practically in simple and miniature devices. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate that intrinsic magnetic nonlinearities allow the implementation of efficient microscopic tunable phase shifters, where the phase is controlled by wave intensity. In the proposed devices, we achieve the tunability of the phase shift of more than 360° by a microwave power of few milliwatts over a propagation distance of about 10 μ m. We show that the figure of merit of the demonstrated phase shifters is close to that of macroscopic devices based on alternative technologies. Our results also indicate that the ability to control the phase shift is primarily limited by nonlinear spin-wave damping and can be significantly improved by suppressing this effect. Our findings are important for the further development of integrated nano-magnonics for beyond-Moore computing.},

Spintronic terahertz emitters offer conceptual advantages since the spin orientation in the magnetic layer can be easily controlled either by the externally applied magnetic field or by the internal magnetic field distribution determined by the specific shape of the magnetic elements. Here, we report a switchable terahertz source based on micropatterned magnetic heterostructures driven by femtosecond laser pulses. We show that the precise tunability of the polarization state is facilitated by the underlying magnetization texture of the magnetic layer that is dictated by the shape of the microstructure. These results also reveal the underlying physical mechanisms of a nonuniform magnetization state on the generation of ultrafast spin currents in the magnetic heterostructures. Our findings indicate that the emission of the linearly polarized THz waves can be switched on and off by saturating the sample using a biasing magnetic field, opening fascinating perspectives for integrated on-chip THz devices with wide-ranging potential applications.},

Reported III-nitride TJs grown by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) resulted in backward diodes with rectifying behavior in forward bias, even with Mg and Si doping in 10 20 cm −3 . This behavior limits applications in several device structures. We report a TJ structure based on p + In 0.15 Ga 0.85 N/n + In 0.05 Ga 0.95 N, where the n-side of the junction is co-doped with Si and Mg and with electron and hole concentrations in the mid-10 19 cm −3 for both the n and p dopants. Co-doping creates deep levels within the bandgap that enhances tunneling under forward biased conditions. The TJ structure was investigated on both GaN substrates and InGaN templates to study the impact of strain on the TJ I–V characteristics. The resulting TJ I–V and resistivities reported indicate the potential for this TJ approach in several device structures based on III-nitrides.

  abstract     = {The relentless scaling of semiconductor devices pushes the doping level far above the equilibrium solubility, yet the doped material must be sufficiently stable for subsequent device fabrication and operation. For example, in epitaxial silicon doped above the solubility of phosphorus, most phosphorus dopants are compensated by vacancies, and some of the phosphorus-vacancy clusters can become mobile around 700 °C to further cluster with isolated phosphorus ions. For efficient and stable doping, we use microwave annealing to selectively activate metastable phosphorus-vacancy clusters by interacting with their dipole moments, while keeping lattice heating below 700 °C. In a 30-nm-thick Si nanosheet doped with 3 × 10 21 cm −3 phosphorus, a microwave power of 12 kW at 2.45 GHz for 6 min resulted in a free-electron concentration of 4 × 10 20 cm −3 and a junction more abrupt than 4 decades/nm. The doping profile is stable with less than 4\% variation upon thermal annealing around 700 °C for 5 min. Thus, microwave annealing can result in not only efficient activation and abrupt profile in epitaxial silicon but also thermal stability. In comparison, conventional rapid thermal annealing can generate a junction as abrupt as microwave annealing but 25\% higher sheet resistance and six times higher instability at 700 °C.},

A critical-point model is used to render a spectroscopic model dielectric function tensor and to determine direct electronic band-to-band transition parameters, including the direction dependent two lowest-photon energy band-to-band transitions associated with the anisotropic bandgap.

Our density functional theory calculations indicate a transition from indirect to direct characteristics between α -Ga 2 O 3 and α -Al 2 O 3 , respectively, and we identify a switch in band order where the lowest band-to-band transition occurs with polarization perpendicular to c in α -Ga 2 O 3 whereas for α -Al 2 O 3 the lowest transition occurs with polarization parallel to c . We estimate that the change in band order occurs at approximately 40\% Al content. Additionally, the characteristic of the lowest energy critical point transition for polarization parallel to c changes from M 1 type in α -Ga 2 O 3 to M 0 type van Hove singularity in α -Al 2 O 3 .},

Stable state bifurcation can be tunable under different nonlinearity of the creases and free-stress dihedral angles.

  abstract     = {Germanene has attracted much attention because the material was predicted to host Dirac fermions. However, the synthesis of germanene is still in its infancy; moreover, the predicted tiny bandgap induced by the spin–orbit coupling is far from practical applications for nanoelectronic devices. Herein, quasi-freestanding germanene with linear dispersion relation of the band structure is well grown on a WSe 2 /Au(100) substrate. Band structure calculations reveal that the interaction of germanene with the substrate destroys the sublattice symmetry. The energy-dependent contribution of σ orbitals responsible for band crossing at the Fermi level around the Γ point induces asymmetric density of states at the Dirac point. Upon annealing in ultra-high vacuum, we observe a bandgap opening in germanene of about ∼0.17 eV, which is attributed to a sublattice symmetry breaking in germanene and the emergence of a net electric field. This work provides an effective method to tune or tailor the electronic properties of germanene, paving the way to germanene-based field-effect applications.},

We have previously shown that a Moire interface between n-type monolayer MoS 2 and metal contacts enhances the stability of physisorptive interface sites, thereby enabling weaker Fermi level pinning and allowing easier variation of the Schottky barrier height at these interfaces. We extend these calculations to p-type and ambipolar WSe 2 contacts in this work. The analysis shows that the Moire interfaces again have a weaker Fermi level pinning, while most metals have chemisorptive sites with stronger pinning. We find that the most stable site of Pd is a Moire site with an unusually low p-type Schottky barrier height (p-SBH), while Au has a metastable low p-SBH. In and Al retain their low n-type SBHs, which together with Pd enable ambipolar contacts by the choice of contact metals, indicating that WSe 2 can be used for high-performance ambipolar devices with the rational design of contact metals.},

In this work, the structural and electronic properties of monolayer MoS 2 /4H-SiC(Si-face) heterojunctions are systematically investigated through density functional theory calculation and experimental analysis. The calculated results show that the monolayer MoS 2 /4H-SiC heterostructure is a van der Waals heterojunction because of low formation energy and shows a type-II band alignment with a valence band offset of 1.43 eV. Then the type-II band alignment of the MoS 2 /4H-SiC heterostructure is verified by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. However, there is a deviation of 0.44 eV in the valence band offset between the calculated results and the experimental data, which may be caused by the underestimation of the bandgap by the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof method and the introduction of impurities at the interface. Our experimental results reveal the type of band alignment and the combination of the MoS 2 /4H-SiC heterostructure interface, which is an effective way to understand and design photocatalysts and electronic devices.},

The up-converter exhibits an ultra-broad response covering from the terahertz to mid-infrared region (3–165 THz) due to free carrier absorption and inter-valence-band absorption in p-type based photodetectors. The peak responsivity in the terahertz and mid-infrared region is measured to be 7.2 A/W at 9.2 THz and 3.5 A/W at 28.8 THz, respectively, which is improved by an order of magnitude compared to the previous homojunction interfacial work function internal photoemission-based up-converter (0.5 A/W) in the THz region. The up-converter also demonstrates an improved upconversion efficiency of 1.5\%. The noise equivalent power (NEP) of the imaging system consisting of the HEIWIP-LED up-converter and Si CCD is studied. The optimized NEP can achieve ∼10 pW/Hz 1/2 in both terahertz and mid-infrared regions.

General, yet concise expressions are derived to evaluate the current noise power spectral density and detectivity for ICIPs even with complicated structures. Also, simple expressions for the signal current due to absorption of photons and the corresponding photon noise are derived, consistent with the previous results derived from alternative methods. Furthermore, a formula is derived to correctly evaluate the detectivity for conventional photodetectors under a reverse bias.

The abnormal PL behavior is elucidated by a detailed structure analysis on the dislocation cores. For a small tilt angle, the strain fields introduced by the defective cores are sparsely distributed without mutual coupling, and the chemical stoichiometry along the GBs preserves very well. These two key structural features of the small-tilt-angle GBs allow excitons to diffuse transparently across the GB, leading to a neglectable influence on the optical and electronic properties, as verified by our first-principle simulations.

Here, we propose a photothermal sensor to detect contaminated water based on a Nb 2 CTx MXene integrated few-mode fiber coupler (FMFC) and the photothermal effect of STS. Nb 2 CTx MXene exhibits strong absorption ability for biomolecules, which can enhance the interaction between STS and light by depositing it on the surface of the FMFC, thereby improving the detection performance of the proposed sensor. Under irradiation of a 405 nm laser, the photon energy is absorbed by STS and converted into heat energy, changing the transmission characteristics of the few-mode fiber. The results show that the sensitivity reaches 210.66 nm/(mg/ml) in the linear range of 0.02–0.1 mg/ml, with a detection limit of 94.93 ng/ml. In practical applications, the photothermal effect is stimulated by natural light to improve the suitability of the device application. Furthermore, this photothermal sensor eliminates complicated sample processing, making it potentially applicable for real-time food safety, environmental pollutant detection, and disease diagnosis.},

  abstract     = {Due to their large bandgaps, multiferroic oxides, the promising candidates for overcoming the disadvantages of metal-halide perovskites as light absorbers, have so far very limited use in solar cell applications. Previous investigations demonstrate that high pressure represents an efficient tool for tuning the bandgap of multiferroic Mn 3 TeO 6 (MTO). However, the underlying mechanism of the giant bandgap reduction discovered in MTO remains unclear, which critically prevents the design of next-generation light absorbers. In this study, we performed in situ x-ray diffraction analyses on the structure evolution of MTO upon compression and decompression, discovering a sequence of irreversible phase transitions R 3 ¯ → C2/c → P2 1 /n . The experimental results, supported by electronic structure calculations, show the shortening of Mn–O–Mn bonding, and, to a lower extent, the decrease in connectivity of octahedra across the phase transition, explain the giant bandgap reduction of MTO. These findings will facilitate the design and synthesis of next-generation light absorbers in solar cells.},

In this paper, first-principles calculations and Boltzmann transport theory are used to study the thermoelectric performance of two-dimensional ( PbX ) 2 ( X = S , Se , Te ) monolayers, and it is found that the thermoelectric performance can be enhanced significantly by applying a biaxial tensile strain. The room-temperature ZT values of the p-type ( PbS ) 2 , ( PbSe ) 2 ⁠ , and ( PbTe ) 2 in zigzag (armchair) directions are boosted as high as 1.97 (1.35), 2.26 (1.31), and 2.45 (1.59), respectively. The results show that it is mainly attributed to the significantly reduced phonon thermal conductivity. Moreover, the sharply reduced phonon thermal conductivity is mainly due to the enhancement of the phonon scattering rate caused by strong phonon anharmonicity. In addition, the excellent ZT value of the p-type ( PbX ) 2 ( X = S , Se , Te ) monolayer exhibits their potential application in the thermoelectric field, and the external strain has a good prospect in enhancing the thermoelectric performance.},

It is potentially applicable to three-dimensional (3D) cell culture systems and may outperform existing methods such as atomic force microscopy and shear rheology in terms of being contactless and having higher spatial resolution and penetration. However, applying clinical SWEI to 3D cell culture systems requires the developments of high-frequency SWEI systems operating at &gt;20 MHz that are compatible with the scale of cell culture systems, and C-scan 3D SWEI well suited to such observations. In this study, we implemented a computed tomography (CT) technique for SWEI (called SWCT) by leveraging the scanning scheme used in first-generation x-ray CT systems, that is, translation and rotation of a 20-MHz push probe and a 40-MHz imaging probe to obtain time-of-flight projections for multiple viewing directions. Compared with conventional B-scan SWEI, the proposed reconstruction method allows high-resolution, robust, 3D C-scan imaging of the shear-wave speed distribution. Three phantoms with different inclusions (half circle, thin strip, and cylinder) were imaged using 3D SWCT to a depth of 13 mm. The estimated shear-wave speed for the strip phantom using SWCT was 1.23 ± 0.20 m/s (mean ± standard deviation) in the background and 2.27 ± 0.11 m/s for the inclusion, which suggests the feasibility of SWCT for improving elasticity measurements of cell culture systems.},

The magnetoelectric (ME) heterostructure consisting of piezoelectric (AlN) and ferromagnetic magnetic shape memory alloy [FSMA (Ni–Mn–In)] was fabricated over stainless steel (SS) substrate for resistive random access memory application. The Cu/AlN/FSMA/SS metal–insulator–metal based memory cell displays bipolar resistive switching (RS) behavior. The formation of Cu metallic filament at a particular SET voltage leads the memory cell in a low resistance state (LRS) from its pristine high resistance state (HRS). The LRS and HRS are explained well by Ohmic and space charge limited conduction mechanisms, respectively. The fabricated memory cell displays excellent endurance and data retention capability with a high OFF/ON ratio of ∼1.2 × 10 3 . Furthermore, the multifunctionality of the ME heterostructure-based RAM was investigated by tuning the SET voltage with ambiance temperature and external magnetic field remotely. A significant change in the SET voltage could be ascribed to the temperature and magnetic field-induced strain transferred to the AlN piezoelectric layer from the magnetostrictive FSMA (Ni–Mn–In) bottom electrode. The residual Lorentz force explains the remotely tuned LRS and HRS in the transverse magnetic field for multi-bit data storage applications. Moreover, the RS characteristics remain stable even after 800 bending cycles as well as with bending angle (0°–180°). Hence, the present ME heterostructure integrated with flexible SS substrate can be a better choice for highly flexible, low-cost, and multifunctional futuristic RAM applications.},

Here, a WSe 2 /MoS 2 heterojunction structure transistor with a back gate and two top gates is proposed. The back gate controls the carrier transport of the entire heterojunction channel, and the top gates independently control the carrier transports of MoS 2 or WSe 2 channels. The rectification direction of the heterojunction device could be reversed, and the rectification ratio could be modulated from 10 −4 to 10 4 by changing the back-gate voltage. In addition, an evident negative-differential transconductance phenomenon with a current peak and a current valley are observed in the back-gate transfer characteristic curve, which results from the different control ability of the same gate voltage to the Fermi levels in MoS 2 and WSe 2 . The current peak can be obviously modulated and eliminated by the MoS 2 top gate, while the WSe 2 top gate can control the position of the current valley from −8 to +12 V, which clearly supports the heterostructure energy band model. Moreover, the diversity of output states under multi-gate modulation makes applications in logic circuits possible.

Based on the obtained results and the known data on the Bi(111) electronic band structure, Cs-induced modifications of the band structure were shown to control the changes in the Bi(111) film conductance. Adsorbed Cs atoms donate electrons to Bi(111), causing the shifting of the system Fermi level upward along the energy scale. Due to the peculiarities of the Bi(111) band structure, the density of states at the Fermi level, which is directly related to the carrier density, varies non-monotonically with shifting of the Fermi level. Conductance changes in the same way with Cs coverage, namely, decreases almost twice at 0.011 ML of Cs, restores to the initial value at 0.025 ML of Cs, and grows gradually up to 0.167 ML; the maximal coverage when adsorbed Cs remains an assembly of the individual adatoms. Thus, Cs adsorption shows up as an effective tool to tune the electronic and transport properties of the Bi(111) films. The results also prove an effective surface characteristic of the electron transport in the Bi films.},

Compared with piezoelectricity, flexoelectricity has some advantages in size dependence, material range, and temperature range, although its electro-mechanical efficiency is low. Flexoelectric enhancement is to be achieved principally by reducing dimensions and enlarging flexoelectric coefficients. In this work, we propose a mechanical approach to enhance flexoelectricity by adjusting a pre-strain gradient with bending moments. Based on theoretical analysis, the relationship between the pre-strain gradient and enhanced polarization is deduced. Performing a four-point bending approach, experimental verification is achieved by measuring polarized charges of non-poled polyvinylidene fluoride films. The measured electric polarization has been increased by 2.8 times by adjustment of pre-strain gradients. This demonstrates the feasibility of enhancing flexoelectricity by mechanical means.},

  abstract     = {Hafnia-based ferroelectric thin-film transistors (FeTFTs) are regarded as promising candidates for future nonvolatile memory devices owing to their low power consumption, high operational speed, and complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor compatibility. However, the scalability of hafnia-based materials and the feasibility of three-dimensional (3D) device fabrication should be confirmed for ultrahigh-density memory applications. In this work, we demonstrate that FeTFTs can be scaled down to a 10-nm dimension using the vertical structure with a hafnia-based ferroelectric gate insulating layer and an oxide semiconductor channel. We show that such vertical FeTFTs can be operated with an effective device size of 0.005 μ m 2 , a fast operation speed of &lt;100 ns, and a high endurance of 10 8 cycles. Additionally, the string-level NAND operation is demonstrated using the vertical FeTFT array. Finally, device simulation confirms the possibility of ultrahigh-density 3D ferroelectric NAND with 200 gate stacks. These results demonstrate the ultrahigh scalability of FeTFTs as a promising candidate for next-generation 3D nonvolatile memory.},

  abstract     = {The emergence of two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) intrinsic magnets offers exciting opportunities to explore high-performance vdW magnetic tunnel junctions (vdW MTJs) and miniaturization of devices beyond Moore&#39;s law for future energy efficient nano-electronic devices. In this work, using first principles calculations, we investigate the spin-dependent transport of vdW MTJs formed by two vdW ferromagnetic (FM) CrSe 2 electrodes and an interlayer antiferromagnetic bilayer NiCl 2 barrier (CrSe 2 /NiCl 2 /CrSe 2 vdW MTJ). We find that in contrast to the large resistance-area (RA) products higher than several kilohms square micrometer in crystalline MgO based MTJs with high tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) ratios, the large TMR ratio of about 5200\% and the low RA products ranging from 0.11 to 6 Ω μ m 2 are simultaneously achieved in the CrSe 2 /NiCl 2 /CrSe 2 vdW MTJ at zero bias due to the spin-dependent tunnel transport associated with the FM CrSe 2 electrode and the significant spin filtering effect associated with the half-metallic bilayer NiCl 2 barrier. Moreover, the TMR ratio of the CrSe 2 /NiCl 2 /CrSe 2 vdW MTJ increases first with increasing bias voltage and then decreases with the further increase in the bias voltage after reaching the highest value, and the optimized bias voltage can significantly promote the TMR ratio up to 12 000\%. Our results pave the way to develop high-performance vdW MTJs with both large TMR ratios and low RA products for future spintronic applications.},

Based on the density functional theory and the Monte Carlo method, we investigate the electron-mediated electronic structures and magnetic properties in a FeCl 2 /Ca 2 N heterostructure. It is found that a Ca 2 N monolayer devotes about 0.46 electrons/f.u. to a FeCl 2 monolayer due to the low work function. This provides a high electron doping density of 4.28 × 10 14 cm −2 and avoids the disorder effect of the traditional doping methods simultaneously such as the intercalation, adsorption, and substitution. Moreover, the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy and Curie temperature of the FeCl 2 /Ca 2 N heterostructure enhance 66\% and 100\% compared with the FeCl 2 monolayer, respectively. Our findings provide a practical and effective avenue to modulate the magnetic properties of two-dimensional magnetic materials.},

It is found that the rectangular notch at the edge can have a pinning effect on the skyrmion and enrich the dynamics of the skyrmion. Based on the racetrack with modified edges and the notch, we design a racetrack that realizes the skyrmionic logic AND, OR, and NOT gates as well as the diode in the same magnetic racetrack. It is found that the driving current density could be much smaller than those used in previous designs of skyrmion-based logic gates. By slightly altering the shape of the racetrack, we also design the NAND and NOR gates. Finally, we study the feasibility of our design at finite temperatures.

  abstract     = {Steadily, continuously, and precisely adjusting infrared emissivity of materials is of great importance for various applications, such as thermal camouflage. Herein, a method is proposed to fine-tune the emissivity of multilayer graphene (MLG) by ion intercalation with assistance of pulse voltage. The dynamic ion intercalation process in MLG-based emissivity modulators is investigated by a home-made electrical-optical synchronizing test system, which consists of a potentiostat and a thermal camera. It is observed that the apparent temperature of MLG is closely correlated with pulse duration and residual charges. Based on a second-order RC model, the ion transportation and charge transfer in the modulator are likely affected by three factors (i.e., internal resistance, electric field, and concentration gradient), which changes the doping level of MLG. Hence, the emissivity of MLG can be finely adjusted by regulating the duration of the voltage pulse. This also leads to a wavelength dependence of emissivity modulation, which is confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The observations offer a promising venue for precise and continuous adjustment of MLG&#39;s emissivity, which is of great significance for many practical applications, such as simulating complex and subtle thermal images.},

Although elastic, thermal, and electronic properties of biphenylene have been reported, phonon modes and the origin of anisotropy in biphenylene are still unclear. In this work, combining the first-principles calculations and theoretical analysis, we investigate the properties of optical and acoustic phonons in monolayer biphenylene. There are nine Raman-active and five infrared-active modes which can be excited by the Raman or infrared laser. Interestingly, a Raman-active single phonon mode ( ⁠ A g 3 ⁠ ) is observed, and its frequency is up to 49.67 THz at the Brillouin zone-center point. This provides promising potential for biphenylene monolayer in the application of phonon lasers, quantum nonlinear elements, and quantum mechanical resonators. Meantime, the Grüneisen constant of an A g 3 mode is up to 2.07 at the zone-center point, suggesting that its Raman spectroscopy can be used to identify the lattice strain and temperature of biphenylene. To explore the origin of anisotropy in biphenylene, we calculate the covalency and cophonicity and find that the inconsistent speed of motion and different intensities of hybridization between these inequivalent carbon atoms should take responsibility for the direction dependent thermal and elastic properties in biphenylene.},

  abstract     = {It is known that the intrinsic thermal conductivity of a monolayer graphene highly depends on its in-plane dimensions which are at nanoscale. However, it remains not very clear how the thermal conductivity is quantitatively affected as the considered in-plane size undergoes a cross-scale variation, especially when temperature influence is involved. In this study, based on the ballistic-diffusion approximation theory, we propose a cross-scale model that can be used to calculate the thermal conductivity of monolayer graphene with prescribed length and width at selected temperatures by considering the temperature-dependent diffusive thermal conductivity (fitted from equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations). Then, the effects of the length, width, and temperature on the thermal conductivity of square-shaped and rectangular-shaped graphene are investigated separately. It shows that as the graphene length increases from the nanoscale to microscale, the thermal transport in square graphene will experience these three phonon thermal transport regimes in sequence (ballistic, quasi ballistic, and diffusive), corresponding to a rapid rise of the thermal conductivity, then a slower increase, and, eventually, a near-constant value, respectively. As the rectangular graphene gradually becomes square, the difference in the thermal conductivity in length and width directions will vanish due to the weakening of the boundary scattering. In addition, the thermal conductivity significantly drops with temperature increases because of the strong Umklapp scattering caused by high temperature.},

The principle of the PR is based on rotation of the polarization axis of a shear wave due to the gradual change in orientation of the axis of anisotropy along the direction of wave propagation of a printed layered structure. The component of the shear modulus parallel to the infilled lines within each layer is significantly higher than that in the perpendicular direction. As the PR was printing, a small angle between neighboring layers was introduced, resulting in a 3D helicoidal pattern of distribution of the axes of anisotropy. The polarization of the propagating shear wave follows this pattern leading to the rotation of the polarization axis by a desirable angle. The total rotation angle can be tuned by the number of printed layers. The fabricated 90 ° rotators demonstrate high performance that can be improved by changing the infill fraction settings.},

Line-of-sight quadrupole mass spectrometry of the direct SiO-flux ( ⁠ Φ SiO ⁠ ) from the source at different temperatures ( T SiO ) confirmed SiO molecules to sublime with an activation energy of 3.3 eV. The T SiO -dependent Φ SiO was measured in vacuum before and after subjecting the source material to an O 2 -background of 10 − 5 mbar (typical oxide MBE regime). The absence of a significant Φ SiO difference indicates negligible source oxidation in molecular O 2 . Mounted in an oxygen plasma-assisted MBE, Si-doped β-Ga 2 O 3 layers were grown using this source. The Φ SiO at the substrate was evaluated [from 2.9 × 10 9 cm −2 s −1 ( T SiO = 700 °C) to 5.5 × 10 13 cm −2 s −1 ( T SiO = 1000 °C)] and Si-concentration in the β-Ga 2 O 3 layers measured by secondary ion mass spectrometry highlighting unprecedented control of continuous Si-doping for oxide MBE, i.e., N Si from 4 × 10 17 cm −3 ( T SiO = 700 °C) up to 1.7 × 10 20 cm −3 ( T SiO = 900 °C). For a homoepitaxial β-Ga 2 O 3 layer, a Hall charge carrier concentration of 3 × 10 19 cm −3 in line with the provided Φ SiO (T SiO = 800 °C) is demonstrated. No SiO-incorporation difference was found between β-Ga 2 O 3 (010) layers homoepitaxially grown at 750 °C and β-Ga 2 O 3 (−201) heteroepitaxial layers grown at 550 °C on c-plane sapphire. However, the presence of activated oxygen (plasma) resulted in partial source oxidation and related decrease in doping concentration (particularly at T SiO &lt; 800 °C), which has been tentatively explained with a simple model. Degassing the source at 1100 °C reverted this oxidation. Concepts to reduce source oxidation during MBE-growth are referenced.},

Despite the significant difference in dislocation density, ferroelectricity is observed in all three samples. The presence of high densities of dislocations, however, results in enhanced asymmetric P–E loops and overestimated remnant polarization values. Further measurements show that the leakage current and breakdown strength can be improved with decreasing dislocation density. Detailed studies suggest that trapping/detrapping assisted transport is the main leakage mechanism in epitaxial ferroelectric ScAlN films. This work sheds light on the essential material quality considerations for tuning the ferroelectric property of ScAlN toward integration with mainstream semiconductor platforms, e.g., Si, and paves the way for next-generation electronics, optoelectronics, and piezoelectronics.},

We compare experimental values against the numerical predictions to decipher the effect of boundary scattering and defects in thin-films. We used time domain thermoreflectance to perform the experiments, density functional theory and the Boltzmann transport equation for thermal conductivity calculations, and the diffuse mismatch model for thermal boundary conductance predictions. The experimental thermal conductivities were approximately three times smaller than those calculated for perfect Ga 2 O 3 crystals of similar size. When considering the presence of grain boundaries, gallium and oxygen vacancies, and stacking faults in the calculations, the crystals that present around 1\% of gallium vacancies and a density of stacking faults of 10 6 faults/cm were the ones whose thermal conductivities were closer to the experimental results. Our analysis suggests the level of different types of defects present in the Ga 2 O 3 crystal that could be used to improve the quality of MBE-grown samples by reducing these defects and, thereby, produce materials with higher thermal conductivities.},

  abstract     = {Ultra-small micro-LEDs are essential for next-generation display technology. However, micro-LEDs below 5 μ m have been seldom reported. In this work, we demonstrate InGaN-based blue and green micro-LEDs from 1 to 20 μ m by using laser direct writing lithography. The 1-μm blue micro-LEDs show a peak external quantum efficiency of 13.02\%, which is 9.57\% for green ones. By characterizing the size-dependent external quantum efficiency and simply assuming that this variety is dominantly determined by the dry-etching induced dead zone, we deduce that the dead zone sizes of carrier injection at the edge of chips are 0.18 and 0.15 μ m in blue and green ones, respectively. A time-resolved photoluminescence measurement also shows that carrier lifetime reduction at the edge of blue ones is more serious than that of green ones, reflecting the easier carrier lateral diffusion in the former than the latter. These results exhibit the ability of laser direct writing lithography on micro-LED fabrication and also provide a reference for predicting the limit of their chip size scaling-down.},

The average EHP creation energy is typically about three times the energy gap. In 1960, Shockley derived a simple equation for the average EHP creation energy with a single free parameter that fits experimental values for a wide range of materials, but the underlying assumptions, as stated, have been widely criticized as lacking justification. Modified expressions derived by improved approximations have been proposed but do not fare better. Here, we revisit the foundations of Shockley&#39;s equation and provide a robust justification for the kinetic-energy component as a model averaging procedure and then apply a similar procedure to the phonon component of the equation. The phonon result retains Shockley&#39;s form, but the interpretation and justification are now on par with those of the kinetic-energy term. The single-parameter fit to the data remains unchanged, i.e., the present analysis accounts for the exceptional applicability of Shockley&#39;s equation.},

Yet, there is a lack of sound knowledge of the carrier dynamics in the (Al x Ga 1−x ) 2 O 3 alloys due to their structural complexity. Herein, we focus on the ordered β-(Al x Ga 1−x ) 2 O 3 alloys, predict their carrier mobility, and determine the intrinsic electron mobility limit based on solving linearized Boltzmann transport equations from first principles. The predicted electron mobility for ordered β-(Al 0.25 Ga 0.75 ) 2 O 3 and β-(Al 0.5 Ga 0.5 ) 2 O 3 alloys at 300 K, respectively, is 103.6 and 80.60 cm 2 /V s, demonstrating excellent agreement with literature experiments. Such low electron mobility is limited by the intrinsically strong polar optical phonon (POP) scattering process. As the Al content further increases, the alloy&#39;s electron mobility further reduces mainly due to the enlarged Pauling ionicity, Fröhlich coupling constant, and POP scattering. This work provides physical insight into the carrier dynamics in ordered β-(Al x Ga 1−x ) 2 O 3 alloys and seeks to improve the electron mobility for potential applications in high-power electronics.},

  abstract     = {Silicon is a long-standing photosensitive material because of its unique photoelectronic properties and mature manufacturing technology. However, silicon photodetectors are generally limited by weak photoresponse in the near-infrared region. In this work, pressure is used as an effective means of tuning the photoresponse of silicon, specifically in the near-infrared region. Silicon has two different types of photoresponse under pressure. In the pressure range from 1 atm to 10 GPa, huge pressure-enhanced photocurrent is observed under illumination by a xenon lamp and near-infrared light (1064 nm). At 10 GPa, the photocurrent density ( J ph ), responsivity ( R ), and external quantum efficiency are increased 40-fold from those at 1.2 GPa. Interestingly, above 10 GPa, a unique pressure-induced positive–negative photoresponse switch is found along with the phase transformation from the semiconductive phase (Si I) to the metallic phase ( β -tin). Further experiments show that the photothermal effect is the main factor for negative photoresponse. All these pressure-induced properties give silicon more possibilities in the further design of visible and infrared photodetectors.},

  abstract     = {Amorphous materials have been used in a range of electronic and photonic applications, and the need for quantitative analytical techniques on their local structural information is growing. We present a comprehensive analysis of the atomic and electronic structures of an amorphous material, amorphous carbon (a-C), with scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)-derived techniques, four-dimensional STEM (4D-STEM), and STEM-electron energy loss spectroscopy (STEM-EELS). Each diffraction pattern of an a-C layer stack acquired via 4D-STEM is transformed into a reduced density function (RDF) and a radial variance profile (RVP) to retrieve the information on the atomic structures. Importantly, a machine-learning approach (preferably cluster analysis) separates distinct features in the EELS and RDF datasets; it also describes the spatial distributions of these features in the scanned regions. Consequently, we showed that the differences in the sp 2 / sp 3 ratio and the involvement of additional elements led to changes in the bond length. Furthermore, we identified the dominant types of medium-range ordering structures (diamond-like or graphite-like nano-crystals) by correlations among the EELS, RDF, and RVP data. The information obtained via STEM-EELS and 4D-STEM can be strongly correlated, leading to the comprehensive characterization of the a-C layer stack for a nanometer-scale area. This process can be used to investigate any amorphous material, thereby yielding comprehensive information regarding the origins of notable properties.},

  abstract     = {Nonvolatile resistive switching is one of the key phenomena for emerging applications in optoelectronics and neuromorphic computing. In most of the cases, an electric field is applied to a two terminal dielectric material device and leads to the formation of a low resistance filament due to ion migration. However, the stochastic nature of the ion migration can be an impediment for the device robustness and controllability, with uncontrolled variations of high and low resistance states or threshold voltages. Here, we report an optically induced resistive switching based on a CdS/V 3 O 5 heterostructure which can overcome this issue. V 3 O 5 is known to have a second order insulator to metal transition around T c ≈ 415 K, with an electrically induced threshold switching at room temperature. Upon illumination, the direct transfer of the photoinduced carriers from the CdS into V 3 O 5 produces a nonvolatile resistive switching at room temperature. The initial high resistance can be recovered by reaching the high temperature metallic phase, i.e., temperatures above T c . Interestingly, this resistive switching becomes volatile around the T c . By locally manipulating the volatile and nonvolatile resistive switching using electric field and light, this system is a promising platform for hardware based neuromorphic computing implementations.},

  abstract     = {Changing the microstructure properties of a space–time metamaterial while a wave is propagating through it, in general, requires addition or removal of energy, which can be of an exponential form depending on the type of modulation. This limits the realization and application of space–time metamaterials. We resolve this issue by introducing a mechanism of conserving energy at temporal metasurfaces in a non-linear setting. The idea is first demonstrated by considering a wave-packet propagating in a discrete medium of a one-dimensional (1D) chain of springs and masses, where using our energy conserving mechanism, we show that the spring stiffness can be incremented at several time interfaces and the energy will still be conserved. We then consider an interesting application of time-reversed imaging in 1D and two-dimensional (2D) spring–mass systems with a wave packet traveling in the homogenized regime. Our numerical simulations show that, in 1D, when the wave packet hits the time-interface, two sets of waves are generated, one traveling forward in time and the other traveling backward. The time-reversed waves re-converge at the location of the source, and we observe its regeneration. In 2D, we use more complicated initial shapes and, even then, we observe regeneration of the original image or source. Thus, we achieve time-reversed imaging with conservation of energy in a non-linear system. The energy conserving mechanism can be easily extended to continuum media. Some possible ideas and concerns in experimental realization of space–time media are highlighted in conclusion and in the supplementary material.},

This model has been further extended to active systems via breaking the symmetry between two coupling coefficients, leading to odd or non-reciprocal Willis material models [Quan et al. , Nat. Commun. 12 (1), 2615 (2021)]. In this work, through a 2D homogenous non-reciprocal acoustic Willis material (NRAWM), we demonstrate that the bulk local mode, referred to as skin effect in non-Hermitian systems, can survive on boundary of NRAWMs under proper conditions. The direction of the localization is closely related to the intrinsic direction embedded in the NRAWMs, and the localization is robust and topologically protected. To validate the prediction, a 2D discrete lattice made of non-local active acoustic scatterers is proposed and then homogenized as a NRAWM based on the retrieval method. The far-field radiation patterns of the local modes for both the 2D discrete lattice and the homogenized 2D NRAWM are evaluated, and they are in good agreement with each other. This work paves the way to design and explore the rich wave phenomena in non-Hermitian acoustic systems.},

At the NDC regions, the device features responsivity peaks under laser illumination reaching 0.45 A/W at room temperature at λ = 5.27 μ m.

The process of photo-detection in such van der Waals hybrids is usually dictated by the formation of excitons followed by the transfer of charge and energy from the TMDC layer to graphene, but they have not been explored simultaneously in the same device before. In this work, we have investigated optically excited Gr–WS 2 (tungsten disulfide) heterostructures using both standard electrical transport and Johnson noise thermometry. At large negative gate voltages, the experimentally observed photoresponse cannot be explained from conventional photogating but was found to host an increase in electron temperature as large as ∼ 4 K. Time dependence of the transport and the noise reveals that the change in temperature and photoresistance can originate from distinct microscopic processes. The findings can be exploited for the development of Gr–TMDC based ultra-fast bolometers.},

Furthermore, an electric field can efficiently separate the light excited electron–hole pairs, enhance photocarriers diffusion, and finally increase the crystal expansion, i.e., photo-electro-striction. For each crystal under 30 V/mm and in light with 450 nm wavelength and 840 mW/cm 2 , the photo-electro-striction is over four times of the pure electrostriction and is larger than the sum of photostriction and electrostriction. Most importantly, MAPbI 3 single crystal shows a large photostriction of ∼0.35\% and the photo-electro-striction of ∼0.64\%. This work proves a very large photo-electro-striction as a result of the strong coupling among photocarriers, electric fields, and crystal lattices, which is important to develop semiconductor devices.},

  abstract     = {We study a disorder-induced transformation of the resonant optical reflection from a nearly periodic system of quasi-2D excitons in the InGaN quantum wells arranged as a resonant Bragg structure (RBS). We show that there is a critical deviation from the exact periodicity when the reflection by a single super-radiant exciton–polariton mode is transformed into a multimode spectrum. This critical disorder appears to be inversely proportional to the number of periods in the RBS. Using a numerical model which describes the experimentally observed optical spectra, we found the critical standard deviation from exact periodicity to be 1.76\%, 1.0\%, and 0.45\% for InGaN-based RBS with 60, 100, and 200 periods, respectively.},

For conventional applications like photography, the intensity information with three color bands (RGB) is sufficient. However, for advanced sensing applications, such as autonomous vehicles, biomedical imaging, and robotics, extracting more information from the incident light could help machines to make better decisions. It is expected that, in the future, more cameras will be built for machines than for people, which will be further accelerated by the rapid progress in machine learning and artificial intelligence. We envision that these applications will substantially benefit from multimodal measurement of light fields by advanced imaging sensors.

However, conventional Raman spectroscopy lacks spatial resolution and, hence, can hardly disclose spatial-dependent inhomogeneous properties of interest. Herein, we demonstrate spatial mapping of low-frequency Raman modes in tBLG via micro-Raman spectroscopy (mRS) imaging. In our constructed tBLG, the shear (C) and out-of-plane breathing (ZO′) modes are directly mapped out, and, more importantly, a regional-dependent, highly localized awakening of the combination C+ZO′ mode is clearly visualized. Through a set of mRS-based analyses, including correlation of Raman G- and 2D-mode frequencies, G-band splitting, and polarization-dependent Raman intensity distributions, we reveal that its turning on/off correlates with the mechanical strain distributions in a sensitive fashion. The spatial mapping of this unique combination mode offers an indicator for scrutinizing the elusive strain in the tBLG system or the like.},

In this study, a synergetic strategy is applied to improve the ionic conductivity of NZSPO, i.e., by combining bulk doping and grain-boundary engineering. Hf 4+ is selected as the substitution for Zr 4+ to stabilize the highly conducting rhombohedral phase. La 2 O 3 is added as a sintering aid to promote the ion transport along the grain boundaries with Na 3 La(PO 4 ) 2 formed therein. The optimized Na 3 Zr 1.8 Hf 0.2 Si 2 PO 12 -Na 3 La(PO 4 ) 2 (NZHSPO-NLPO) ceramic electrolytes show a high relative density of 98.8\% and the superior ionic conductivity of 1.66 × 10 −3 S cm −1 at 30 °C. The Na symmetric batteries display the stable plating/stripping cycling over 500 h at 0.1 mA cm −2 and 0.05 mAh cm −2 . With ionic liquid as a wetting agent at cathode sides and PEO as an intermediate layer at anode sides, the NZHSPO-NLPO-based Na batteries with Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 cathodes exhibit the discharge capacity of 109.9 mAh g −1 and capacity retention of 92.7\% at 0.1 and 30 °C for 50 cycles.

Therefore, considering the process compatibility, low-temperature processing and large-area fabrication technologies have received widespread attention as those are ideal for upscaling of single and tandem devices. Herein, we demonstrated an effective atomic layer deposition (ALD) process by using H 2 O 2 as an oxygen source and the deposition temperatures can be lowered up to 50 °C due to the high activity of H 2 O 2 . The low temperature deposition enables conformal coverage of the substrate and results in a pinhole-free film with high optical transmittance, excellent electron extraction properties, and large area uniformity. Notably, a high PCE of 20.70\% is achieved for single junction PSCs based on ALD-SnO 2 (50 °C). When the ALD-SnO 2 applied to p-i-n structure perovskite/silicon heterojunction tandem solar cell, an efficiency of 26.67\% was obtained. The results demonstrate the potential of the low-temperature ALD processed metal oxide for large-scale manufacturing of optoelectronic devices with competitive performances.},

  abstract     = {A bulk acoustic wave (BAW) driven magnetoelectric (ME) antenna has narrow operating bandwidth due to its high Q factor, and an effective mechanism for bandwidth enhancement is yet to be explored. This article presents a bandwidth-enhanced magnetoelectric (BWE-ME) antenna made of a Mo/AlN/FeGa sandwich stack, which is composed of three different resonant regions. These resonant regions in the discrete device can be equated as a parallel connection of dual high-overtone bulk acoustic resonators (HBARs) and single film bulk acoustic resonators (FBARs) with tiny frequency shift among the three resonators resulting in bandwidth broadening of the BWE-ME antenna. The resonant mode and return loss curves (S11) are simulated in a two-dimensional finite element method and fitted with the Mason equivalent circuit model. The frequency domain analysis shows that the magnetic flux density bandwidth generated by the multi-resonant mode interaction is 18 MHz, which matches the bandwidth of the measured reference gain S21 curve of the BWE-ME antenna, and the far-field radiated power characterization also shows the corresponding effective bandwidth distributed. The fabricated microelectromechanical systems antenna achieves a fractional bandwidth of 2.7\% while maintaining the advantage of small size (0.49 mm 2 ). Discrete composite BAW resonators that effectively combine the multi-resonant regions of HBARs and FBARs have the potential to realize compact and broadband BAW-ME antennas in the future.},

In this work, the self-passivation of an In 2 O 3 nanofiber FET is achieved by the consequent thermal treatment, water treatment, and deep ultraviolet (DUV) irradiation, and the FET is named as a TWD (thermal treatment-water treatment-DUV irradiation)-device. For comparison, the devices treated by thermal treatment and by thermal + water treatment were also fabricated and abbreviated as a T-device and a TW (thermal treatment-water treatment)-device, respectively. From the transfer characteristics of the T-, TW-, and TWD-devices, the electrical performance is first degraded by water treatment and then recovered after DUV irradiation. The positive bias stress test confirms the stability enhancement after TWD treatment, indicating the achievement of the self-passivated FET based on In 2 O 3 nanofibers. The excellent electrical stability is owing to the structural relaxation and the removal of trap sites such as oxygen vacancy and hydroxide. Integrated with the high-k ZrO 2 dielectric, the TWD-In 2 O 3 /ZrO 2 FET exhibits further improved electrical performance, including a mobility of 3.35 cm 2 /V s and a high on/off current ratio of 10 7 .},

Here, we studied spectroscopy and ferroelectricity of PMN-0.28PT under high pressure. The appearance of a new Raman band and the sudden redshift of UV-vis absorption edge imply a structural phase transition at about 8 GPa. More importantly, the ferroelectricity of the sample is suppressed above a pressure of 5 GPa, and there is no ferroelectricity under further compression. We suggest that the disappearance of ferroelectricity may be related to the polar nanoregions being suppressed by pressure.

  abstract     = {In addition to striving to assemble more and more qubits in a single monolithic quantum device, taking a modular design strategy may mitigate numerous engineering challenges for achieving large-scalable quantum processors with superconducting qubits. Nevertheless, a major challenge in the modular quantum device is how to realize high-fidelity entanglement operations on qubits housed in different modules while preserving the desired isolation between modules. In this work, we propose a conceptual design of a modular quantum device, where nearby modules are spatially separated by centimeters. In principle, each module can contain tens of superconducting qubits and can be separately fabricated, characterized, packaged, and replaced. By introducing a bridge module between nearby qubit modules and taking the coupling scheme utilizing a tunable bus, tunable coupling of qubits that are housed in nearby qubit modules could be realized. Given physically reasonable assumptions, we expect that sub-100-ns two-qubit gates for qubits housed in nearby modules, which are spatially separated by more than two centimeters could be obtained. In this way, the inter-module gate operations are promising to be implemented with gate performance comparable with that of intra-module gate operations. Moreover, with the help of through-silicon vias technologies, this long-range coupling scheme may also allow one to implement inter-module couplers in a multi-chip stacked processor. Thus, the tunable longer-range coupling scheme and the proposed modular architecture may provide a promising foundation for solving challenges toward large-scale quantum information processing with superconducting qubits.},

  abstract     = {Voltage-induced strain is regarded as an energy-efficient choice of tuning spin-dynamics. However, studies on the strain-mediated switching of magnetization in a perpendicular-magnetic-anisotropy layer are few because of the uncertainties that arise from the magnetization oscillation at high strain. In this work, we demonstrate theoretically how to deterministically switch the perpendicular magnetization in an ultrathin magnetic nanodisk by combining biaxial in-plane strain with the Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction (DMI). The magnetization-switching process is carefully investigated under different strains and DMI strengths. The underlying switching mechanism is attributed to the remnant magnetization component, which deviates away from the film plane during the strain-pulse-impulsion period and which is also highly dependent on the DMI. Based on simulation results, a theoretical route for obtaining deterministic switching regarding strain and DMI is established. In this route, the minimum duration of the strain pulse can be shortened to a critical time of 2.5 ns as the strain increases to 7000 ppm at a DMI value of 0.6 mJ/m 2 . Moreover, nonvolatile and reversible switching between the spin-up and spin-down states of perpendicular magnetization is realized using pulses of biaxial in-plane isotropic strain. This switching occurs via an intermediate skyrmion and shows potential in overcoming the edge-roughness-related pinning that occurs in spin–orbit-torque current-induced switching. This study provides a robust insight into strain-induced current-free magnetization switching, providing a guide for experimental research into the strain-mediated voltage control of memory applications.},

Here, we employed Raman spectrum, in situ x-ray diffraction, and first-principles calculations for detailed research. The volume thermal expansion coefficient of MnPS 3 was reported. Through the symmetric phonon scattering model, it is confirmed that cubic phonon processes play a major role in P 2 , P 3 , P 4 , and P 5 peaks, while quartic phonon processes play an indispensable role in most peaks. The covalent bond was found to be more susceptible to anharmonic phonon scattering than ionic bonds, which is reflected in the wavenumber redshift. Moreover, asymmetric phonon scattering channels also play a meaningful role. Different cubic phonon scattering channels greatly influence the fitting results, and various quartic phonon scattering channels are diverse in highly nonlinear linewidth broadening.},

Manipulation of OAM spectra is crucial for many impressive applications from classical to quantum realms, in particular, nonlinear manipulation of OAM spectra. Here, we realized the nonlinear manipulation of OAM spectra by using the simultaneous second- and third-harmonic generation in a single nonlinear crystal of quasi-periodically poled potassium titanyl phosphate, for fundamental waves with a variety of OAM spectra, especially for customized OAM spectra of the second and third harmonics. The experimental results confirmed the theoretical predictions. Our approach not only provides a way to manipulate OAM spectra at shorter wavelengths that are hard to be directly generated but also may find applications toward multiplexing in classical optics and high-dimensional information processing in quantum optics.},

To practically build these technologies will require monolithic integration of microchips, resonators, and readout systems. While it is widely seen that mounting microchip substrates into a system can greatly impact the performance of high-Q resonators, a systematic study has remained elusive, owing to the variety of physical processes and factors that influence the dissipation. Here, we analytically analyze a mechanism by which substrates couple to resonators manufactured on them and experimentally demonstrate that this coupling can increase the mechanical dissipation of nanomechanical resonators when resonance frequencies of resonator and substrate coincide. More generally, we then show that a similar coupling mechanism can exist between two adjacent resonators. Since the substrate–mode coupling mechanism strongly depends on both the resonator position on the substrate and the mounting of the substrate, this work provides key design guidelines for high-precision nanomechanical technologies.},

  abstract     = {Alloy scattering in random AlGaN alloys drastically reduces the electron mobility and, therefore, the power-electronics figure of merit. As a result, Al compositions greater than 75\% are required to obtain even a twofold increase in the Baliga figure of merit compared to GaN. However, beyond approximately 80\% Al composition, donors in AlGaN undergo the DX transition, which makes impurity doping increasingly more difficult. Moreover, the contact resistance increases exponentially with the increase in Al content, and integration with dielectrics becomes difficult due to the upward shift of the conduction band. Atomically thin superlattices of AlN and GaN, also known as digital alloys, are known to grow experimentally under appropriate growth conditions. These chemically ordered nanostructures could offer significantly enhanced figure of merit compared to their random alloy counterparts due to the absence of alloy scattering, as well as better integration with contact metals and dielectrics. In this work, we investigate the electronic structure and phonon-limited electron mobility of atomically thin AlN/GaN digital-alloy superlattices using first-principles calculations based on density-functional and many-body perturbation theory. The bandgap of the atomically thin superlattices reaches 4.8 eV, and the in-plane (out-of-plane) mobility is 369 (452) cm 2 V −1 s −1 . Using the modified Baliga figure of merit that accounts for the dopant ionization energy, we demonstrate that atomically thin AlN/GaN superlattices with a monolayer sublattice periodicity have the highest modified Baliga figure of merit among several technologically relevant ultra-wide bandgap materials, including random AlGaN, β -Ga 2 O 3 , cBN, and diamond.},

The Ta/PbS QDs/AlO x N y /Pt device with a Ta anion reservoir and a PbS QD film anion reservoir in the same direction exhibits excellent optimization of parameters, which is ideal for low-power devices. A model is constructed to elaborate the resistive switching process. Moreover, modulation of PbS QD film thickness on RS has been studied.

  abstract     = {Polycrystalline oxide materials exhibit semiconductor properties due to grain boundary (GB) and grain characteristics, which enrich the variety of applications. However, how to regulate the energy band structure of grains and the potential barriers at GBs through defect engineering is crucial to achieve a high performance electronic device. Herein, it is found that Fe 3+ ions can change the grain energy band structure of CaCu 3 Ti 4 O 12 (CCTO) materials, which enhances the linearization of the resistance–temperature curve (ln ρ –1000/ T ) in the high temperature region. First principles calculation indicates that Fe 3+ doping narrows the forbidden band and induces new impurity energy levels in the forbidden band, which matches the conclusion that the resistivity–temperature dependence of grains shifts toward the low-temperature region as derived from impedance spectroscopy. This shift results in no monotonic variation in grain resistivity within the application temperature region, thus enhancing the linearity of the ln ρ –1000/ T curve of CCTO materials in the high temperature region. In addition, Fe 3+ ions can modulate the activation energy of CCTO materials in a wide range by changing the activation energy of GBs, which broadens the temperature range of CCTO. The significance of this work lies not only in achieving linearization of CCTO materials for high temperature thermistor application, but more importantly, the method presented here provides an avenue for the study of polycrystalline semiconductor materials.},

  abstract     = {This Letter describes the development and implementation of an ultraviolet and broadband ultrafast-laser-absorption-imaging (UV-ULAI) diagnostic for one dimensional (1D) imaging of temperature and CN via its B 2 Σ + ← X 2 Σ + absorption bands near 385 nm. The diagnostic was demonstrated by acquiring single-shot measurements of 1D temperature and CN profiles in HMX flames at a repetition rate of 25 Hz. Ultrashort pulses (55 fs) at 800 nm were generated using a Ti:Sapphire oscillator and then amplification and wavelength conversion to the ultraviolet were carried out using an optical parametric amplifier and frequency doubling crystals. The broadband pulses were spectrally resolved using a 1200 l/mm grating and imaged on an EMCCD camera to obtain CN absorbance spectra with a resolution of ≈ 0.065 nm and a bandwidth of ≈ 4 nm (i.e., 260 cm –1 ). Simulated absorbance spectra of CN were fit to the measured absorbance spectra using non-linear curve fitting to determine the gas properties. The spatial evolution of gas temperature and CN concentration near the burning surface of an HMX flame was measured with a spatial resolution of ≈ 10 μ m. 1D profiles of temperature and CN concentration were obtained with a 1- σ spatial precision of 49.3 K and 4 ppm. This work demonstrates the ability of UV-ULAI to acquire high-precision, spatially resolved absorption measurements with unprecedented temporal and spatial resolution. Furthermore, this work lays the foundation for ultraviolet imaging of numerous atomic and molecular species with ultrafast time resolution.},

  abstract     = {Thermal droop, i.e., the loss of emission efficiency over a certain temperature range, is an important performance bottleneck for the successful commercial application of deep-ultraviolet light emitting diodes. In this study, we examined the mechanism of two thermal droop processes of 255 nm AlGaN quantum well light emitting diodes under temperature stresses in order to obtain steady optical output in a broad temperature range. We discovered that the increase in leakage current in the low forward bias region is accompanied by a decrease in apparent carrier concentration of quantum wells near the p side during the thermal droop process at high temperature (&gt;300 K), indicating that the activation of thermal defects enhances the trap assisted tunneling effect and causes the optical power to decrease more significantly at low current. Compared with normal temperature, the low emission power at low temperatures is attributed to the minority trap H 1 , which has an activation energy of 0.527 eV at 190 K, according to deep level transient spectrum analysis. At low temperatures above 175 K, the optical power increases as the temperature rises due to enhanced hole injection. By analyzing the droop characteristics, we concluded that the activation of thermal defects is the most probable cause of high temperature thermal droop in 255 nm AlGaN quantum well light emitting diodes, whereas hole trap H 1 , which is linked to gallium vacancy complexes related defects, is most likely the source of low temperature thermal droop.},

  abstract     = {The unique optoelectronic properties of single layer graphene (SLG) are ideal for the development of photonic devices across a broad range of frequencies from x rays to microwaves. In the terahertz (THz) frequency range (0.1–10 THz), this has led to the development of optical modulators, nonlinear sources, and photodetectors with state-of-the-art performances. A key challenge is the integration of SLG-based active elements with pre-existing technological platforms in a scalable way, while maintaining performance level unperturbed. Here, we report room temperature THz detectors made of large-area SLG, grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and integrated in antenna-coupled field effect transistors. We selectively activate the photo-thermoelectric detection dynamics, and we employ different dielectric configurations of SLG on Al 2 O 3 with and without large-area CVD hexagonal boron nitride capping to investigate their effect on SLG thermoelectric properties underpinning photodetection. With these scalable architectures, response times ∼5 ns and noise equivalent powers (NEPs) ∼1 nW Hz −1/2 are achieved under zero-bias operation. This shows the feasibility of scalable, large-area, layered material heterostructures for THz detection.},

This extraction requires supplemental measurements of external quantum efficiency (EQE), but these do not have the same spatial resolution. Previously, assumptions have been made to overcome this limitation. In this work, we evaluate these assumptions for InGaAs solar cells with significant spatial variation in the luminescence spectrum shape due to small regions with elevated concentrations of radiative defects. Although appropriate for small variations in the spectral shape, we find that with more significant variation, these assumptions can result in nonphysical EQEs and too-low voltages. Combining multiple methods can help to alleviate this, or a minimum voltage map can be extracted, which will be similar to the actual voltage when EQE is high.},

During the first stretching-and-relaxation cycle, two characteristic behaviors were observed: strain-induced anisotropy and an irreversible reduction of the dielectric constants in the measured frequency range. To understand the origin of this result, we tried to reproduce the strain dependence of the dielectric function with a modified effective medium theory that accounts for the orientational distribution of the CB aggregates. From the dependence of the fitting parameters on the deformation condition, it was found that the reduction of the dielectric constants in the terahertz frequency range is mainly caused by the breakdown of the CB-based conductive network due to a dissociation of CB agglomerates. This finding indicates that polarization-resolved terahertz spectroscopy is a promising technique for the assessment of changes in the internal structure of CB fillers on the nanometer scale.},

Li 1.5 Al 0.5 Ge 1.5 (PO 4 ) 3 (LAGP) with satisfied ionic conductivity (∼10 −4 S cm −1 ) at room temperature, high stability in the ambient atmosphere, and a facile sintering nature shows a promising potential for applications in solid-state lithium batteries. However, the current synthesis methods like solid-state strategy and liquid phase route all require harsh conditions, such as long thermal treatments, expensive raw materials, and complex operation. In this study, we propose a co-precipitation method for synthesizing the LAGP solid electrolyte with low-cost and nontoxic GeO 2 as the germanium source. Process optimization in the pH value and water bath temperature was employed as a strategy to eliminate the remnants of GeO 2 , and the pure LAGP phase is acquired. Moreover, the co-precipitation method can also reduce the sintering temperature of LAGP to 750 °C so that uniform nano-LAGP grains (∼150 nm) can be obtained. During the subsequent processing, denser LAGP pellets are fabricated and exhibit a high ionic conductivity of 5.87 × 10 −4 S cm −1 at 30 °C; the Li/Li symmetrical batteries periodically cycle at room temperature for above 310 h with a constant current density of 0.05 mA cm −2 .},

However, it is difficult to enable CF x cathode materials to achieve simultaneously high-capacity and excellent rate-capability. Moreover, the high-temperature direct F 2 fluorination method for the commercial CF x material preparation is hazardous, eco-unfriendly, and costly. Herein, we developed an efficient, safe, and cost-effective synthesis approach, in which plasma fluorinated multi-walled carbon nanotubes (PFCNTs) were synthesized by using CF 4 plasma as a fluorine source under a low fluorination temperature (300 °C) within excessively short time (110 min). The plasma not only induced ionization of CF 4 gas through the electron impact reaction but also promoted the diffusion of fluorine-containing ions in multi-walled carbon nanotubes. The PFCNT possessed un-fluorinated graphitic inner layers, electrochemically active semi-ionic C–F bonds, and few inactive C–F 2 and conductive sp2 C=C bonds, endowing it excellent electronic and electrochemical properties. PFCNTs exhibited a high specific capacity of 819.3 mAh/g with an energy density of 2050 Wh/kg. Furthermore, a Li/PFCNT coin cell delivered a capacity of 527.4 mAh/g and a maximum power density of 58 206 W/kg at an ultrahigh current density of 30 A/g.

The addition of NaNbO 3 increases tetragonal ( P4bm ) phase content and relaxor disorders and leads to a downshift of transition temperature, as verified by Rietveld refinement, dielectric analysis, and in situ Raman spectra. Superior temperature stability of recoverable energy storage density ( W Rec , change rate: δ ≤ 14\%) and efficiency ( η = 0.79–0.98) is found in x = 0.15 composition in a wide temperature range of 243 – 373 K, in contrast to a significant variation for x = 0 ( δ ≤ 85\%, η = 0.08–0.88) and 0.05 ( δ ≤ 36\%, η = 0.60–0.96) compositions. The dielectric relaxation speed is faster in x = 0.15, as characterized by on – off-electric field dielectric curves. This work demonstrates that the weak-dipolar-interaction system retards dipolar coalescence under cryogenic temperature and, thus, maintains high energy storage efficiency, which predicts their suitability in energy storage applications at an extreme condition.},

Herein, we expect to solve its intrinsic weakness through a synergy strategy that combines metal alloying, cavity structure, and carbon compositing. Si/TiSi 2 /G@void@C (STGvC) composites were designed and synthesized by induction melting and mechanical ball milling methods, adopting silicon waste produced in the photovoltaic industry and titanium-bearing blast furnace slag produced in the steel industry as raw materials. Meanwhile, the synthesis employs NaCl as a pore-forming agent, and polyvinyl pyrrolidon and waste graphite as carbon sources. As a result, the optimized STGvC sample with adding appropriate amount of NaCl harvests favorable cycling performance. It still records a discharge capacity of 886.6 mAh g −1 after 300 cycles during the circulating process at 1600 mA g −1 .

Observing some highly scattering thick tissue samples with single photon microscopy is a great challenge. To solve the problem, we developed a label free deep penetration single photon microscopic imaging technique with an ultralong anti-diffracting (UAD) beam. The penetrating ability of the UAD beam was verified by passing through turbid media and performed with autofluorescence of chloroplasts in fresh Epipremnum aureum leaves. Benefiting from the anti-diffracting properties and the elongated focal depth of the UAD beam, single photon UAD microscopy has deeper penetration depth and better anti-scattering ability and is one of the ideal methods to observe the deep structure of biological samples.},

  abstract     = {The oscillatory dynamics of nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) is at the heart of many emerging applications in nanotechnology. For common NEMS, such as beams and strings, the oscillatory dynamics is formulated using a dissipationless wave equation derived from elasticity. Under a harmonic ansatz, the wave equation gives an undamped free vibration equation; solving this equation with the proper boundary conditions provides the undamped eigenfunctions with the familiar standing wave patterns. Any harmonically driven solution is expressible in terms of these undamped eigenfunctions. Here, we show that this formalism becomes inconvenient as dissipation increases. To this end, we experimentally map out the position- and frequency-dependent oscillatory motion of a NEMS string resonator driven linearly by a non-symmetric force at one end at different dissipation limits. At low dissipation (high Q factor), we observe sharp resonances with standing wave patterns that closely match the eigenfunctions of an undamped string. With a slight increase in dissipation, the standing wave patterns become lost, and waves begin to propagate along the nanostructure. At large dissipation (low Q factor), these propagating waves become strongly attenuated and display little, if any, resemblance to the undamped string eigenfunctions. A more efficient and intuitive description of the oscillatory dynamics of a NEMS resonator can be obtained by superposition of waves propagating along the nanostructure.},

  abstract     = {Phononic crystals (PCs) can modulate an incident acoustic wave to provide subwavelength microparticles with stable and flexible manipulation. However, fixed artificial structures of the PCs usually result in a steady acoustic field profile, thus limiting the dynamic manipulation of microparticles. This study proposes the construction of a phononic crystal plate (PCP) using a pair of periodic oppositely arranged gratings on a plate. Under the PCP&#39;s resonance frequency, a pair of nonleaky A 0 mode traveling Lamb waves that intrinsically exist in a thin plate were excited and propagated. The pair of waves formed a highly localized standing Lamb wave field between the pair of periodic gratings. By adjusting the phase of the incident acoustic wave, the positions of pressure nodes of the PCP-induced standing Lamb wave were changed in a quantitatively tunable manner. Thus, polystyrene microparticles trapped and aligned at the pressure nodes via the acoustic radiation force could be moved to achieve the translation motion with a resolution of 2.2 μ m, approximately 1/160 wavelength in water. The proposed methodology will lead to the fabrication of a disposable and easily operated tool for dynamically manipulating microparticles in subwavelength regions by engineering acoustic fields using acoustic metamaterials in microfluidic devices for cell sorting and drug delivery.},

  abstract     = {A nanoscale photodetector is a crucial part of intelligent imaging and wireless communication devices. Building van der Waals (vdWs) heterostructures based on two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides is thought to be a smart approach for achieving nanoscale photodetectors. However, the pinning effect induced by surface states, defects, and metal-induced gap states during the fabrication process of vdWs heterostructures and contacting electrodes leads to a large Schottky barrier and consequently limits the photoresponse of vdWs heterostructures. In this study, a photodetector based on the WSe 2 /MoS 2 heterostructure with graphene (Gr)/indium tin oxide (ITO) hybrid electrodes has been fabricated. The vdWs contacts established between the exfoliated graphene layers and WSe 2 /MoS 2 heterostructure are able to get rid of lattice damages caused by atom bombardment during the deposition of metal electrodes. In addition, the reduced Schottky barrier at graphene/heterostructure interfaces facilitates the transport of carriers. Experimental results show that the photodetector based on WSe 2 /MoS 2 heterostructures with Gr/ITO hybrid electrodes exhibits a high responsivity of up to 1236.5 A W −1 , a detectivity of up to 1.23 × 10 13 Jones, and a fast response of 270/130 μ s to light from the ultraviolet to near-infrared range.},

In this paper, we present a bimorph electrothermal micro-gripper that composed of several metal ultrathin films with high surface-to-volume ratios, allowing rapid heating and cooling processes. Patterns of these films are exquisitely designed so that the micro-gripper naturally forms an embedded circuit to optimize the current distribution. The micro-gripper can be precisely actuated under voltages below 2 V, while dramatically responding to pulse voltages up to 100 Hz. By interacting with a silica particle 96 times heavier than its weight, potential applications of the micro-gripper in robotics, organic tissue engineering, and interventional surgery can be shown. The advantage to be compatible with other semiconductor components ensures that the functions of the micro-gripper can be further expanded.},

The nearly lattice-matched N-polar Sc 0.21 Al 0.79 N/GaN heterostructure shows a highly uniform coercive field (∼4.6 MV/cm at 10 kHz) and remnant polarization (∼90 μ C/cm 2 ) across the whole wafer.

Both the coercive field and remnant polarization exhibit negligible degradation over 10 5 switching cycles, which is among the best reported for ferroelectric III-nitrides. This work offers a viable path for fully epitaxial heterogeneous integration of ferroelectricity into N-polar III-nitride heterostructures, which, together with the recent demonstration of fully epitaxial ferroelectric metal-polar ScAlN, will find important applications in next-generation high-power and high-frequency electronics, memory electronics, acoustic resonators and filters, optoelectronics, and integrated quantum photonics.},

Through electrical test and scanning electron microscope analysis, we study the electrochemical dynamics of metal nanoparticles in switching medium with different mesoscopic structures and directly reveal the microscopic origin of the abrupt-to-progressive transformation in fibroin-based transient memristors. The device exhibits abrupt resistive switching behaviors when the mobility and redox rate are high and displays progressive resistive switching behaviors under the low mobility and low redox rate condition. These findings reveal the microscopic origins of abrupt-to-progressive conversion and provide general guidance for designing high-performance memory devices and artificial synapses.},

In this study, we perform ab initio calculation of the hyperfine splitting parameter for Sr-substituted Mn 2+ in SrTiO 3 in various geometries in order to assign experimentally reported EPR peaks to exact dopant structures. Additionally, we calculate the hyperfine parameters for Mn 4+ and Mn 2+∕4+ with adjacent oxygen vacancy, which remain to be assigned peaks in experimental EPR spectra. Calculation of Ti-substituted Mn is largely hindered by the highly correlated electronic structure; however, it is shown that reasonable hyperfine values for Ti-site defects can be obtained by tuning functional parameters. Overall, this study demonstrates that calculating the hyperfine splitting for a transition metal dopant in a complex oxide is feasible and can provide a fingerprint for different geometries in equivalently defected systems.},

  abstract     = {Non-Hermitian systems have gained a great deal of interest in various wave problems due their ability of exhibiting unprecedented phenomena such as invisibility, cloaking, enhanced sensing, or the skin effect. The latter manifests itself by the localization of all bulk modes in a specific frequency range at a given boundary, with an unconventional bulk-boundary correspondence. In this work, we propose to realize the skin effect for flexural waves in a non-Hermitian piezoelectric phononic beam with feedback control between a sensor and an actuator in each unit cell. By implementing a non-Hermitian parameter, effective gain and loss can be achieved in the phononic beam characterized by complex eigen frequencies, and non-reciprocal pass bands are obtained. We highlight that the split point separating the gain and loss areas can occur not only at the edges of the Brillouin zones but also inside the same Brillouin zone. We further analyze the influence of the geometric and non-Hermitian parameters on the complex dispersions and the split point. The topology of the complex bands is characterized by the winding number, which supports the skin effect together with the non-reciprocity. The localization degree of the skin mode manifested by the enhanced beam&#39;s vibration energy at one boundary is related to the strength of the non-reciprocity, and the skin mode can be always excited regardless of the source position. Our results provide a potential platform to introduce non-Hermiticity into phononic or metamaterial systems with novel functions for elastic waves such as topological insulators, vibration attenuation or amplification, and energy harvesting.},

Van der Waals superlattices are structures physically assembled through weak van der Waals interactions by design and may host properties beyond the traditional superlattices limited by lattice matching and processing compatibility, offering a different type of interface. In this work, natural van der Waals (SnS) 1.17 (NbS 2 ) n superlattices are synthesized, and their thermal conductivities are measured by time-domain thermoreflectance as a function of interface density. Our results show that heat conduction of (SnS) 1.17 (NbS 2 ) n superlattices is dominated by interface scattering when the coherent length of phonons is larger than the superlattice period, indicating that incoherent phonon transport dominates through-plane heat conduction in van der Waals superlattices even when the period is atomically thin and abrupt, in contrast to conventional superlattices. Our findings provide valuable insights into the understanding of the thermal behavior of van der Waals superlattices and devise approaches for effective thermal management of superlattices depending on the distinct types of interfaces.},

In addition, a 2D hole gas with a high mobility of up to 4.6 × 10 5 cm 2 /V s is achieved in the Hall-bar shaped field effect transistor, showing a low percolation density of 8.7 × 10 10 cm −2 , a light hole effective mass of 0.071 m 0 , and a high effective g-factor of 11.3.

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional (2D) transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have the potential to drive future innovation in the electronics industry. However, the controllability of charge concentration remains challenging due to the atomically thin channel, which perturbs the charge transport characteristics of nanodevices. Here, we demonstrate a strategy that uses the transition metal suboxide layer to modulate the photoelectrical characteristics of TMD channels. The carrier concentration in an n -type MoS 2 channel is reduced from 2.05 × 10 12 to 6.15 × 10 10 cm −3 , while it increases from 1.71 × 10 10 to 2.76 × 10 12 cm −3 for p -type WSe 2 channels. Remarkably, the channel mobility remains unchanged or even slightly improves when the carrier concentration is appropriately tuned. Also, the homogenous channel is modulated into a photovoltaic homojunction with a tenfold enhancement of photoelectrical detectivity and response speed. The controllable strategy provides a simple design principle to realize high-performance 2D semiconductor-based optoelectronic and logic devices.},

In this study, we focused on diamond surface etching by hydrogen plasma and revealed the dependence of the diamond crystal orientation using scanning probe microscopy and electron backscatter diffraction. Crystal grains with a low etching rate were distributed around the {100} and {111} planes, and those with a high etching rate were distributed on the {110} plane. Furthermore, we found that the etching rate increased as the intermediate orientation grains tilted toward the {110} plane. Because the surface carbon atoms that compose the {110} plane have two of their three back bonds on the surface exposed to hydrogen plasma, we expected that the {110} orientation would have a high etching rate. Even for grains with intermediate orientations, the etching tendency corresponded to the location of the back bonds. Our research provides important systematic data on the crystal orientation in diamond electronics.},

Due to the complex nature of electron correlations, the underlying physics behind the MIT in VO 2 has yet to be fully grasped. In this work, we utilize the fine resolution of the scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscope to investigate the MIT in an epitaxial VO 2 thin film on the (100) R TiO 2 substrate with mid-infrared light. Bidirectional tweed-like metal–insulator phase coexistence patterns are observed and understood under the Landau free energy paradigm. More interestingly, delayed metallic nucleation is observed near the surface cracks due to local strain relief. This research proposes ideas in investigating the temperature–pressure phase diagram and tuning the interplay between local strain and MIT in oxide thin films.},

Contrary to previous studies that report reduced actuation amplitudes under load in the individual constituents of the material—nanoporous gold and polypyrrole, we find the strain amplitudes of the hybrid increase with increasing load and even while being deformed by plastic deformation. In this contribution, we discuss the phenomenon by taking into account the variations of the effective Young&#39;s modulus of the material that occur simultaneously with the actuation.},

An un-amplified intrinsic responsivity of 3.90 V/W is demonstrated at 91.5 GHz, which is close to the peak of the spectral absorption at 97.8 GHz. Numerical full-wave electromagnetic simulations match well to experiments and clarify the underlying absorption mechanism, while thermal simulations permit optimization of the responsivity.

  abstract     = {Realizing and manipulating strong light–matter coupling in 2D monolayer semiconductors are of the utmost importance in the development of photonic devices. Hollow nanostructures of noble metals are particularly interesting because of their stronger local electromagnetic field compared with solid nanoparticles, which facilitate the strong coupling of single metal nanostructures. Here, the tunable single nanocavity plasmon–exciton coupling was demonstrated at room temperature in hybrid systems consisting of Ag@Au hollow nanocubes (HNCs) and monolayer WS 2 underneath, where a large vacuum Rabi splitting of 131.3 meV was observed. Mode splitting can be clearly observed from the dark-field scattering spectrum of the single hybrid nanocavity, which is ascribed to the strong coupling between the nanocavity mode and the excitonic mode. Then, we used the finite difference time domain method to simulate these hybrid systems. By changing the thickness of the shell of the Ag@Au HNC, we can tune the surface plasmon resonance peak position of HNCs to match the exciton energy of the monolayer WS 2 . The strong couplings were realized via the calculated scattering spectra. The calculated results were consistent with the experimental results. Furthermore, the mode volume of different nanostructures was discussed, and the mode volume of HNCs is smaller than other solid ones at the same plasmonic resonance wavelength, which also indicates that its ability to restrict an electromagnetic field is stronger. This study provides an ideal platform for the strong coupling of a single nanocavity at room temperature and has broad application prospects in the field of single-photon devices.},

Therefore, it is urgent to improve the properties of GeSe based broadband photodetectors. Herein, a GeSe/MoTe 2 van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure was designed. The GeSe/MoTe 2 vdW heterostructure possesses broadband photodetection over ultraviolet, visible, and near infrared. The device has competitive responsivity (R) and detectivity (D * ) over a broadband even at 1050 nm, which are 28.4 A/W and 5.6 × 10 9 Jones, respectively. Excitingly, the response speed for 365 nm is as fast as 3 μ s, which is much faster than most other GeSe devices. Overall, our results suggest that the GeSe/MoTe 2 heterostructure can provide an effective strategy to achieve broadband photodetectors with both high responsivity and fast response.},

Here, ultrafast spin polarization in semi-insulating GaAs is studied by optical-pump terahertz-probe experiments at room temperature. We used circularly and linearly polarized femtosecond laser pulses to inject nonequilibrium carriers in GaAs and observed that both the transmitted and reflected terahertz signals exhibited different dynamical evolutions under the excitations of linearly and circularly polarized laser pulses, which are ascribed to the generation and relaxation of spin-polarized electrons.

An incident weak signal field with a few hundreds of kHz difference from the LO field is mixed with the LO field in the Rydberg system to generate an intermediate frequency signal, which is read out by Rydberg electromagnetically induced transparency (Rydberg-EIT) spectroscopy. Not like resonant EIT-Autler–Townes spectra, we realize the electric field measurement of the signal frequency from 2 to 5 GHz using a single Rydberg state. The detectable field strength is down to 2.25 μ V/cm with sensitivity of the electrometry 712 nV cm −1 Hz −1/2 , and a linear dynamic range is over 65 dB. The detectable field strength is comparable with a resonant microwave-dressed Rydberg heterodyne receiver using the same system, which is 0.96 μ V/cm with sensitivity of 304 nV cm –1 Hz −1/2 . We also show the system has an inherent polarization selectivity feature. Our method can provide high sensitivity of electric field measurement and be extended to arbitrary frequency measurements.},

The magnetic noise originated from the random movement of electrons in conductors, which is related to the conductivity, was detected by recording the spin relaxation of NV centers. The results indicate that the conductivity increases with the size of devices at the scale of electron mean free path. By further imaging the magnetic noise of the metallic structure with discontinuous thickness, we demonstrated that the spatial distribution of conductance at nanoscale can be revealed with high density NV center arrays. The results can help to understand the electron transport in nanomaterials. This technique can be used to optimize the design of nanoscale electrical devices.},

  abstract     = {Exploration of earth-abundant, low cost, and versatile catalysts with Pt-like performance for electrochemical water splitting holds practical significance for clean energy shortage and environmental pollution. However, manipulating the electronic structure and relevant physical properties of the catalysts is crucial in promoting their hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance but still a formidable challenge. In this work, we report a self-supported dual-metal doped on CoP 3 nanowire arrays (NAs) and grown on carbon fiber cloth (Ni,Mn-CoP 3 NAs) for alkaline HER. The optimized catalyst exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity, giving a low overpotential of 24 mV at 10 mA cm −2 with a small Tafel slope of 41 mV dec −1 and can sustain for 24 h, which is superior to the commercial Pt/C catalysts at a large current density. On the basis of systematic experiments and density functional theory calculations, the synergistic regulation of dual-metal doping can re-form the electronic structure so as to enhance the electrical conductivity, improve the intrinsic HER activity, and increase the electrochemical surface area of CoP 3 . This work points out avenues in the reasonable design and development of dual-metal doped transition-metal phosphides as highly active, durable, and economically viable catalysts for various catalytic reactions.},

  abstract     = {In this Letter, we propose an enhanced vibro-impact energy harvester using acoustic black holes (ABHs) for scavenging low-frequency vibration energy. The energy harvester involves two beams: a relatively rigid piezoelectric generating beam with ABH profile and a flexible driving beam with a tip mass mounted at the end. The tip mass and the generating beam collide repeatedly under low-frequency excitations. Experimental studies are conducted to investigate the output performance of the energy harvester by comparing the output power and voltage of generating beams with different tailored ends. Finite element analysis is also carried out to evaluate the influence of electrode number of the piezoelectric sheet attached to the ABH beam on the output performance of the energy harvester. It is shown that the impacts between the tip mass and generating beam are capable of transferring vibration energy from the low-frequency band to high-frequency band, where ABH gets a desirable energy focalization effect to improve the output performance of the energy harvester. The energy harvester achieves the best output performance when its electrode is divided into two parts with the excellent power of 0.7 mW at the low frequency range from 5 to 13 Hz.},

We present a bendable electrode that is straightforwardly grown on stainless-steel foil via a binder-free sputtering route. The inherent merits of good conductive pathways among MoS 2 nanolayers and enriched pseudocapacitive and dielectric activity from AlN nanoflowers enable synergism of the intermixed porous structure. This unique surface morphology facilitates sulfur and nitrogen edges to make insertion/de-insertion of Li-ions more feasible to store electrochemical energy. The MoS 2 -AlN@SS hybrid working electrode achieves a gravimetric capacitance of 372.35 F/g at a 5 mV/s scan rate with a wide potential window of 2 V in a 1 M Li 2 SO 4 electrolytic aqueous solution. The composite thin film of better adhesion with the current collector exhibits a remarkably high specific power of 28.05 W h/kg at a specific power of 0.26 kW/kg, simultaneously an advanced cycling lifespan of 93\% over 5000 charge–discharge cycles. The capacity of the hybrid electrode is almost unperturbed under bending from 0° to 175°, while only ∼5\% degradation in capacitance was noticed at a flexing angle of 175°. These distinctive features of this electrode material elucidate the practical applicability and recommend it as a promising candidate in wearable bendable supercapacitors.},

Since the silver electrode has a strong specific electrochemical signal response to chloride ions, we choose silver as the electrode material. The microelectrode was prepared by a one-step localized electrochemical deposition method without the use of mold. Then the electrode was successively functionalized with chitosan, catechol, and aptamer. Many nano- and micro-scale protrusion tips on the electrode surface generated a local high electric field and drove the leakage of intracellular chloride ions when bacteria were captured by APT; thus, a reduced signal of the silver electrode related to chloride ions was recorded. A pseudocapacitor structure composed of chitosan, catechol, Ru 3+ , and Fc was constructed on an electrode surface to further amplify the signal. The electrochemical sensor based on this electrode showed excellent performance for template bacteria Staphylococcus aureus detection in terms of the detection limit (1 CFU mL −1 ), linear response range (1–10 5 CFU mL −1 ), and specificity. This work provides another way to design an electrochemical biosensor using the nanoeffect of the electrode rather than the conventional current response based on the electrical properties of the bacterial surface.},

Two distinguished resistance hysteresis loops are observed at a high temperature of ∼290 K and a low temperature of ∼60 K, respectively. In addition, two hysteretic transitions exhibit different behaviors under the external perturbations, in which the high temperature hysteretic transition is sensitive to TiS 3 microribbons thickness, while the low temperature hysteretic transition is probably related to the CDW state and is robust against external perturbations. Our findings will offer a new frontier of exploration of the hysteretic transitions in the quasi-1D transition metal trichalcogenides.},

  abstract     = {Further development of graphene field-effect transistors (GFETs) for high-frequency electronics requires accurate evaluation and study of the mobility of charge carriers in a specific device. Here, we demonstrate that the mobility in the GFETs can be directly characterized and studied using the geometrical magnetoresistance (gMR) effect. The method is free from limitations of other approaches since it does not require an assumption of the constant mobility and the knowledge of the gate capacitance. Studies of a few sets of GFETs in the wide range of transverse magnetic fields indicate that the gMR effect dominates up to approximately 0.55 T. In higher fields, the physical magnetoresistance effect starts to contribute. The advantages of the gMR approach allowed us to interpret the measured dependencies of mobility on the gate voltage, i.e., carrier concentration, and identify the corresponding scattering mechanisms. In particular, the range of the fairly constant mobility is associated with the dominating Coulomb scattering. The decrease in mobility at higher carrier concentrations is associated with the contribution of the phonon scattering. Analysis shows that the gMR mobility is typically 2–3 times higher than that found via the commonly used drain resistance model. The latter underestimates the mobility since it does not take the interfacial capacitance into account.},

A forward-current stress is applied at 75 A/cm 2 (0.7 mA) for 200 h. The device performance degrades with increasing stress time except until 25 h. During the initial 25 h of aging, the light output power and the external quantum efficiency (EQE) increase due to the improved crystal quality caused by aggregation of point defects in the active region, which are supported by the ideality factor and the S-parameter. The high-resolution emission-microscope images reveal that the generation of point defects at mesa sidewalls rather than the active region is crucial in performance degradation. We highlight, in particular, that the aging test generates sidewall point defects even though the sidewalls were properly passivated by a thick SiO 2 layer. The mechanisms of defect aggregation and generation due to aging are consistently described by the ideality factor, the S-parameter, and the EQE.},

Further analysis reveals that the emergence of superconductivity in RuC depends critically on the existence of flatband optical phonons as well as the appearance of multiple electron-pockets and phonon mode softening induced by doping. Moreover, we find that Li-intercalated RuC (LiRuC) is a thermal dynamically stable, superconducting material with a high T c of 9.8 K, benefitting from the strong electron–phonon coupling. Many other superconductors with flat phonon bands are also predicted via elemental substitution in LiRuC.

  abstract     = {Originally introduced in electronic manufacturing to replace the SiO 2 insulating layer, metal oxides are now extensively used in a multitude of electronic devices. Understanding charge transport mechanisms in metal oxides is of paramount importance for device optimization; however, a detailed and self-consistent discussion of electron conduction at all applied electric fields is lacking in the literature. In this work, we investigated the conduction mechanisms in three model systems, Al 2 O 3 , HfO 2 , and Al-doped HfO 2 metal–insulator–metal capacitors, determining the path that the electrons travel within the metal oxide. Traps properties are extracted from experimental current–voltage characteristics using the Ginestra ® simulation software. Furthermore, the analysis allowed to visualize the location of traps most involved in the conduction and the dominant transport mechanisms at each applied electric field. Despite the different oxide properties, a similar trend was recognized at low electric fields, the electron transport through the oxide is negligible, and the dominant contribution to the measured current is ascribed to the charge/discharge of traps located near the metal/oxide interfaces, leading to displacement currents. At high electric fields, the transport of electrons occurs through the defect rich oxides in the two following ways: if a large density of traps is energetically located near the electrodes Fermi level (as in HfO 2 ), the electrons tunnel from trap to trap until they reach the anode; otherwise, when traps are closer to the conduction band (as in Al 2 O 3 and AlHfO), the electrons tunnel from the cathode into one trap and then into the oxide conduction band, interacting only with traps near the cathode.},

By fabricating laminated HZO films rather than the traditional solid-solution HZO, a remanent polarization of P r = 11 μ C/cm 2 and endurance exceeding 10 6 are obtained. Films grown on thermally reactive InAs semiconductor substrates showed capacitance–voltage modulation and hysteresis, which varied depending on interfacial oxide construction. Additionally, a trade-off between higher polarization and lower gate leakage was found when comparing different laminate structures and deposition temperatures. Scaling the thickness of the laminated oxides revealed that films remain ferroelectric at 6.5 nm with an increased breakdown field for thinner devices.},

  abstract     = {Spin–orbit torque (SOT) characterization techniques generally require the Hall cross that generally demands lithography resources and time. It is highly desirable to characterize SOT efficiencies with minimal sample processing time. Here, we demonstrate a lithography-free technique to determine the spin–orbit torque efficiency in a perpendicular magnetic anisotropy ferromagnetic heterostructure. By utilizing a customized four-point probe in a rhombus geometry, harmonic Hall measurement was performed on continuous films of a Pt/Co/Ti structure to characterize the spin–orbit torque efficiency. A correction factor, which is due to the non-uniform current distribution across the continuous film, was experimentally evaluated by taking the ratio of the measured damping-like field of the continuous film to that of a fabricated Hall device. Additionally, this correction factor is analytically derived and experimentally shown to be determined by the configuration of the probes and is independent of the structure material. Our measurement reveals that by performing a single calibration process for the particular set of probes, the same correction factor was validated on a second ferromagnetic heterostructure, Ti/Pt/Co/Ta; hence, it can be applied to other SOT films&#39; stack measurements. Our four-probe harmonic Hall technique provides an alternative and swift way for SOT investigations by eliminating multiple lithography processes necessary in conventional approaches.},

In this study, we investigate the stiffness and damping of spin waves in a cobalt-boron (Co 100− x B x ) alloy using an optical pump-probe technique. Coherent spin waves in Co 100− x B x were excited by an optical spin–orbit torque from Pt. The dynamics of the spin wave were monitored on a picosecond timescale using the magneto-optical Kerr effect. From the oscillation period and relaxation of the spin wave, the stiffness and damping of the spin waves were determined. As the boron concentration increases from 0\% to 35\%, the spin wave stiffness decreases from 4.3 to 1.0 meV nm 2 , and the damping constant of the spin wave increases from 0.02 to 0.11. Such a large change suggests that B alloying has a significant impact on the spin-wave properties.},

However, a moving skyrmionium may still deform because of the local skyrmion Hall effect resulting from the two skyrmions with opposite Q . In this study, we propose a skyrmionium motion with negligible deformation in a synthetic antiferromagnetic (AFM) medium, composed of a free ferromagnetic (FM) layer with a skyrmionium and a pinned FM layer with uniform magnetization. The suppression of the skyrmionium deformation is due to the enhanced coupling between the inner and outer skyrmion under interlayer AFM coupling. This study paves the way for the development of devices with high stability, high processing speed, and small sizes.},

  abstract     = {Terahertz (THz) emission from magnetic films has recently become an important characterization tool of spintronic properties, particularly since no patterning is required. One such property of interest is the spin-current attenuation length. When separating a magnetic film from a spin-to-charge converter with a light metal, the emitted intensity reduces almost exponentially with the thickness of the spacer. However, the extracted characteristic length is more than an order of magnitude smaller than the spin diffusion length measured in equilibrium. In this work, we experimentally and theoretically demonstrate that most of the observed decay in the THz emission is of optical (THz) origin. We are able to estimate a spin current attenuation length for Cu of ∼50 nm in much closer agreement with spin diffusion length measurements. We conclude that THz emission remains a powerful characterization technique, but due to the high number of intricate conversion mechanisms, and most importantly, due to the high sensitivity to changes in the optical properties, extracting absolute numbers for spintronic phenomena remains extremely challenging.},

For a set of nine 40 nm thick layers, the Mn and Sb fluxes are varied to produce material with different elemental compositions. It is found that the layers grown under a relative Mn to Sb flux ratio of Φ Mn / Φ Sb = 1.24 ± 0.02 are closest to the stoichiometric composition for which the Néel temperature ( ⁠ T N ⁠ ) attains its maximum values. Mn-related structural defects are believed to be the driving contribution to changes in the vertical lattice parameter.

We show that for sufficiently large thicknesses, the magnetic characteristics ( ⁠ T N ≃ 62 K ⁠ , Curie–Weiss temperature Θ CW = − 100 K) of the stoichiometric layers do correspond to the parameters reported for bulk samples. On the other hand, we observe a reduction of T N as a function of the CuMnSb thickness for our thinnest layers.

  abstract     = {Thermal transport in nuclear fuels used for nuclear energy applications is directly tied to performance and reliability. Uranium dioxide (UO 2 ), one of the most important nuclear fuels, can accumulate excess oxygen atoms as interstitial defects, which significantly impacts thermal transport properties. In this study, thermal conductivities and inelastic neutron scattering (INS) measurements on UO 2+ x were performed at low temperatures (2–300 K). The thermal conductivity of UO 2+ x ( x = 0, 0.03, 0.04, and 0.11) is significantly suppressed compared to UO 2 except near the Néel temperature T N = 30.8 K, where it is independent of x . INS measurements demonstrate that the heat capacities and phonon group velocities of UO 2 and UO 2.08 are similar, and the suppressed thermal conductivity results from smaller phonon lifetimes. These perceptions advance our understanding of thermal transport properties in advanced nuclear fuels and guide safe and economic utilization of nuclear energy.},

The HTC values are extracted using the 3 ω method based on AC self-heating of a suspended sample with better accuracy than steady-state measurements in some studies. The dominance of air conduction in the measured HTCs is confirmed by comparing measurements with varied sample orientations. The two-layer model, developed for nanotubes, is still found to be accurate when the nanoporous film is simply treated as a solid film in the HTC evaluation along with the radiative mean beam length as the characteristic length of the nanoporous film. This finding indicates the potential of increasing HTC by introducing ultra-fine nanoporous patterns, as guided by the two-layer model.},

  abstract     = {Using bright-field x-ray topography based on anomalous transmission (AT), we have demonstrated the first large-area total-thickness imaging of dislocations in β-Ga 2 O 3 at the substrate scale. The dislocation images were acquired from the entire 10 mm × 15 mm × 680 μ m (001)-oriented substrate prepared by edge-defined film-fed growth (EFG) by stitching together hundreds of topographic images, each recorded with the forward-diffracted beam in the Laue geometry for g = 020, 0–20, 022, and 400, under the conditions in which AT occurred. Dislocations distributed over the entire crystal volume were imaged as long as their Burgers vectors ( b ) were not orthogonal to the g -vectors. The results of the g · b analysis of the dislocation contrasts clearly revealed three major dislocation types that were numerically dominant in the EFG crystal: (i) b -axis screw-type dislocations with b ∥ ξ ∥[010] ( ξ is the unit vector of line direction), (ii) b -axis edge-type dislocations with b ∥[001] and ξ ∥[010], and (iii) curved mixed-type dislocations lying on the (001) planes with b ∥[010]. Based on their b - and ξ -vectors, types (i) and (ii) were attributed to dislocations that propagated during EFG pulling up along the [010] direction, while type (iii) was attributed to dislocations generated through glide in the [010](001) slip system under stress. The extent to which AT can manifest itself is explained by using the effective absorption coefficient calculated for the above g -vectors based on dynamical x-ray diffraction theory.},

  abstract     = {GaN electronics have hinged on invasive isolation such as mesa etching and ion implantation to define device geometry, which, however, suffer from damages, hence potential leakage paths. In this study, we propose a new paradigm of polarization isolation utilizing intrinsic electronic properties, realizing in situ isolation during device epitaxy without the need of post-growth processing. Specifically, adjacent III- and N-polar AlGaN/GaN heterojunctions were grown simultaneously on the patterned AlN nucleation layer on c -plane sapphire substrates. The two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) was formed at III-polar regions but completely depleted in N-polar regions, thereby isolating the 2DEG channels with a large 3.5 eV barrier. Structures of polarization-isolated high electron mobility transistors (PI-HEMTs) exhibit significantly reduced isolation leakage currents by up to nearly two orders of magnitude at 50 V voltage bias compared to the state-of-the-art results. Aside from that, a high isolation breakdown voltage of 2628 V is demonstrated for the PI-HEMT structure with 3 μ m isolation spacing, which is two-times higher than a conventional mesa-isolation HEMT. Moreover, the PI-HEMT device shows a low off-state leakage current of 2 × 10 −8 mA/mm with a high I on /I off ratio of 10 9 and a nearly ideal subthreshold slope of 61 mV/dec. This work demonstrates that polarization isolation is a promising alternative toward the plasma-damage-free isolation for GaN electronics.},

A Schottky barrier detector (SBD) and a metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) capacitor detector fabricated using two sister samples derived from the same 50 μ m 4H–SiC parent wafer exhibited widely different energy resolutions of 0.4\% and 0.9\% for 5486 keV alpha particles. An equivalent noise charge model analysis ruled out the effect of the detector capacitance and the leakage current on the resolution of the detectors. Deep level transient spectroscopic studies revealed the presence of two trapping centers in each detector within the temperature scan range 240–800 K. The Z 1/2 center, a potential electron trap, was detected in both the detectors in equal concentration, which suggested that the observed difference in the energy resolution is due to the presence of the other defect, the EH 6/7 center, in the SBD. The capture cross section of the EH 6/7 center was calculated to be three orders of magnitude higher than the second defect [a carbon antisite vacancy (CAV) center] observed in the MOS detector with an activation energy of 1.10 eV, which accounted for the enhanced electronic trapping in the SBD leading to its poor energy resolution. It has been proposed that the EH 6/7 centers in the SBD have likely been reconfigured to CAV pairs during the thermal growth of the silicon dioxide layer in the MOS detector. The proposed formation mechanism of CAV, a stable qubit state for quantum information processing, addresses the outstanding questions related to the role of defect dynamics in their formation.},

  abstract     = {Tuning the optical and electrical properties of semiconductors by designed doping is the basis of most energy-related semiconductor optoelectronic devices. In this Letter, we report the dopant compensation effect of P-type doped MAPb 1− x Cu x I 3 alloyed perovskite crystals. MAPb 1− x Cu x I 3 single crystals were prepared by the inverse temperature crystallization method using cupric chloride (CuCl 2 ) as the doping source. By XRD, XPS, STEM, and photoluminescence (PL) spectra analyses, we demonstrate that the doped cupric (Cu 2+ ) ions can partially substitute lead (Pb 2+ ) ions and form Cu–Pb based crystal semiconductor alloys of MAPb 1− x Cu x I 3 with tunable bandgap by controlling the Pb/Cu ratio. More detailed XPS analysis of the doped crystal shows that the Cu 2+ ions in MAPb 1− x Cu x I 3 are partially reduced by I − ions, and the coexistence of two valence states of Cu species (Cu 2+ and Cu + ) was observed in the doped crystals. Hall results of MAPb 1− x Cu x I 3 semiconductors show that the presence of reduced Cu + ions impels the change of conductive type from weak N-type to P-type obviously, while the resistivity of doped MAPb 1− x Cu x I 3 increases significantly from 10 4 to 10 7 Ω cm. The defect-related optical fingerprints of cupric doped crystals were investigated in detail by temperature-dependent PL spectroscopy. The pristine MAPbI 3 perovskite crystal exhibits intrinsic donor bound exciton (D 0 X) luminescence at low temperature (10 K), while the doped MAPb 1− x Cu x I 3 perovskites exhibit donor-acceptor or bound exciton (A 0 X) peaks related to a Cu + dopant in sequence with the increase in the Cu ion content. These results indicate that the doping of Cu 2+/+ ions into the MAPb 1− x Cu x I 3 crystal not only changes the semiconductor bandgap but also causes the dopant compensation.},

  abstract     = {Rapid crystallization behavior of amorphous Te x Se 1 − x thin films limits the use of these alloys as coatings and in optoelectronic devices. Understanding the short- and medium-range ordering of the amorphous structure and the fundamental physics governing the crystallization of the films is crucial. Although the lack of long range crystalline order restricts the characterization of the amorphous films, electron microscopy offers a way to extract information about the nanoscale ordering. In this paper, the local ordering of amorphous Te x Se 1 − x thin films with x = 0.22 , 0.61 , 0.70 , 0.90 , and 1 grown by thermal evaporation is investigated using radial distribution function (RDF) and fluctuation electron microscopy (FEM) analysis. RDF results show that the nearest-neighbor distances of selenium (Se) and tellurium (Te) in their crystalline structure are preserved, and their bond lengths increase with the addition of Te. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations predict structures with interatomic distances similar to those measured experimentally. Additionally, fluctuations in atomic coordination are analyzed. Medium range order (MRO) analysis obtained from FEM and DFT calculations suggests that there are at least two populations within the chain network structure, which are close to the Se–Se and Te–Te intrachain distances. For the binary alloy with x &gt; 0.61, Te x Se 1 − x ⁠ , Te–Te like populations increase and Te fragments might form, suggesting that the glass forming ability decreases rapidly.},

  abstract     = {The direct synthesis of graphene with high-quality on semiconducting germanium (Ge) substrates has been developed recently, which has provided a promising way to integrate graphene with semiconductors for the application of electronic devices. However, the defects such as grain boundaries (GBs) introduced during the growth process have a significant influence on the crystalline quality of graphene and the performance of related electronic devices. Therefore, the investigation of the formation of GBs in graphene grown on a Ge substrate is essential for optimizing the crystalline quality of graphene. Herein, the formation mechanism and microstructure of GBs in graphene grown on Ge (110), Ge (001), and Ge (111) substrates via a chemical vapor deposition method are revealed. Ex situ atomic force microscopy is utilized to monitor the evolution of graphene domains. It is found that a single crystalline graphene film without GBs is formed on Ge (110), while polycrystalline graphene films with GBs are grown on Ge (001) and Ge (111) substrates, as suggested by transmission electron microscopy and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements. Our work may motivate the future exploration in improving the crystalline quality of graphene grown on a semiconducting substrate and the performance of associated electronic devices.},

  abstract     = {Dispersion-tunable photonic topological waveguides have recently attracted much attention, due to their promising applications on topological devices with tunable operational frequencies. Since dispersions of topological waveguides traverse the whole bandgaps of bulk structures, tuning the dispersions (especially the bandwidths) requires changing the whole bulk of corresponding photonic topological insulators. A previously reported material-modification approach provided a parallel tuning on such numerous lattices; however, the increased material loss deteriorated transmissions of the topological waveguide. Here, a parallel tuning approach on structures is theoretically proposed and demonstrated, which spawns dispersion-tunable photonic topological waveguides without increasing material loss. Based on the bilayer honeycomb model, a topological valley waveguide by utilizing bilayer designer plasmonic structures is constructed, accomplished with dispersion tunings by altering interlayer distance. Experimental results validate the theoretical model and display a 61\%-relative-tuning range of frequency, with a tunable relative bandwidth up to 16\%. This approach may promise applications in tunable topological lasers, robust delay lines, and intelligent photonic devices.},

For OAM beams propagating in free space, however, the atmospheric turbulence may cause mode distortions and hinder their utilization in practice. In this work, we propose a kind of diffractive deep neural network (D 2 NN) to compensate the distorted OAM beams. Different from those D 2 NNs reported before, the network reported here is dissipative, rather than unitary. In our system, the common features of various wavefront distortions are extracted and compensated, while the random distortions are filtered out by a diaphragm, which is achieved by constructing an improved loss function. The results show that multiple OAM beams with different degrees of distortions can be compensated simultaneously, and good agreement between simulations and experiments is obtained. The D 2 NN based OAM beam compensating reported here will greatly improve the robustness and efficiency of free space optical communication.},

  abstract     = {Photonic topological insulators have recently received widespread attention mainly due to their ability to provide directions in the development of photonic integration platforms. The proposal for a topological bulk cavity with a single-mode expands upon previous research works on topological cavities; thus, interest in topological edge states and corner states is beginning to shift into analysis on bulk properties and their applications. However, there remains a gap in research on a multi-mode cavity of the topological photonic crystals (PCs). In this Letter, a cavity of the topological PCs is proposed involving pair-partitioned bulk localized states (BLSs) from a two-dimensional inner and outer nested square lattice (2D IONSL), which can enable a multi-mode cavity for the topological PCs. First, the topological characteristics are described in terms of a Zak phase, and band inversions are achieved by changing the size of scatterers in the inner and outer circles that reside within the unit cell. Afterwards, analogous to the tight-binding model for electronic systems, the Hamiltonian and topological phase transition conditions of 2D IONSL PCs are derived. Furthermore, it is proposed that the demonstrated optical field reflection and confinement mechanism induced by topological band inversions due to the opposite parities of wavefunctions may lead to the phenomenon of pair-partitioned BLSs. This research increases the research works of bulk topological effects, creating a route for photonic integration platforms for near-infrared.},

High specificity terahertz photonic sensors are essential in many fields, including medical research, clinical diagnosis, security inspection, and probing molecular vibrations in all forms of matter. Widespread photonic sensing technology detects small frequency shifts due to the targeted specimen, thus requiring ultra-high quality ( Q ) factor resonance. However, the existing terahertz waveguide resonating structures are prone to defects, possess limited Q -factor, and lack the feature of chip-scale CMOS integration. Here, inspired by the topologically protected edge state of light, we demonstrate a silicon valley photonic crystal based ultrasensitive, robust on-chip terahertz topological insulator sensor that consists of a topological waveguide critically coupled to a topological cavity with an ultra-high quality ( Q ) factor of Q = 0.14 × 10 6 ⁠ . Topologically protected cavity resonance exhibits strong resilience against disorder and multiple sharp bends. Leveraging on the extremely narrow linewidth (2.3 MHz) of topological cavity resonance, the terahertz sensor shows a record-high figure of merit of 4000 RIU mm − 1 ⁠ . In addition to the spectral shift, the intensity modulation of cavity resonance offers an additional sensor metric through active tuning of critical coupling in the waveguide-cavity system. We envision that the ultra-high Q photonic terahertz topological sensor could have chip-scale biomedical applications such as differentiation between normal and cancerous tissues by monitoring the water content.},

The dusty-plasma products, accumulated in a powder form, consist of micro- and nanoparticles of basalt&#39;s components, including oxides of Si, Na, Fe, P, K, Mg, and Ti. The experimental conditions for the DC sustainability of basalt&#39;s dusty-plasma column are analyzed by various theoretical estimates. A possible relevance of these laboratory observations is attributed to atmospheric fire-pillar-like effects, associated, for instance, with volcanic-, ball-lighting, and lunar dusty-plasma phenomena. A potential application, utilizing this effect of DC-sustained dusty-plasma columns, is proposed for the direct extraction of mineral powders from rocks.},

  abstract     = {Detecting and imaging nuclear spins are of fundamental importance for spin-based quantum information processing in diamond. It is often realized by means of dynamical decoupling (DD) strategies, where a high-efficiency method for DD spectral analysis is required. Previously, a deep-learning-based algorithm is developed and applied on a cryogenic nitrogen-vacancy center experiment. Here, we improve the method by using a traversal periodic-signal identification approach before the deep-learning processing. With this improvement, low-resolution DD spectra with overlapped peaks could be well separated. This enables the deep-learning procedure being generally used in room-temperature experiments, where the measured spectra are often broadened with temperature. We apply this improved method in experiment, and its produced results match well with expectation. This method promises a wide range of applications in other spin-based systems.},

Using automatic adaptive meshing, the 3D conduction band edge profile of an ultra-thin body and buried oxide fully-depleted silicon-on-insulator field-effect transistor is calculated under steady-state and isothermal conditions. This profile is shown to display potential wells consistent with the experimental observation of side-gate-activated corner quantum dots. The electronic structure of these dots is investigated as a function of applied gate bias within the effective mass theory. Crucially, convergence at 100 mK is shown to be a robust feature of QTCAD&#39;s non-linear Poisson solver; convergence is consistently achieved without user intervention for 10 out of 10 random gate bias configurations.},

In this study, we employ four different binders (PVDF, PAN, SBR/CMC, and PAA/CMC) to improve their electrochemical performance. It is found that PAN demonstrates the best performance from 559.5 mAh/g (first) to 458.5 mAh/g (100th) at 0.2 C in the voltage window of 1.0 − 3.0 V. This can be ascribed to its high adhesion strength, good electrical conductivity, low swelling properties, high polarity, and good mechanical stability. The findings highlight the importance of a binder material to guide good cycling stabilities for conversion-type or high-volume change cathodes.},

As a series resistance layer and a thermal enhanced layer, the TaO x interface layer between the resistance switching (RS) layer and the top electrode (TE) can greatly affect the RS characteristics. These effects can be attributed to properties of the interface layer such as thermal and electrical conductivities, suggesting that properties of the interface layer should be carefully and systematically considered if excellent RS characteristics are desirable. Based on the electrical testing and current conduction mechanism analyses, the major factors affecting the bipolar gradual RS behavior can be concluded as the property of the interface layer between the RS layer and TE, the Joule heating caused by current, and the distribution of the electric field on the interface layer.},

Transient photovoltage/photocurrent decay curves, impedance spectroscopy, and photoluminescence mapping show that after the bottom layer of ZrO 2 is modified by SnO 2 , the charge extraction process is accelerated while recombination is retarded. This modification helps to increase the power conversion efficiency from 4.70 (±0.85)\% to 10.15 (±0.35)\%, along with the optimized efficiency at 13.37\% (AM1.5G, 100 mW/cm 2 ) for the low-temperature devices.

An FeFET with an indium tin oxide (ITO) channel and a ferroelectric 14\% Ce-HfO 2 gate insulator was fabricated as a switching FET via chemical solution deposition, followed by stacking a sputtered Al 2 O 3 film as a variable capacitor. The fabricated FeFETs exhibited a high on-current of ∼0.15 A/mm, a large on/off current ratio of 10 7 , a field-effect mobility of 15.6 cm 2 /V s, and a memory window of ∼5 V. The high on-current, i.e., low on-resistance (84 Ω), and the large on/off current ratio allow the ITO channel to act as a wiring that connects and disconnects two capacitors with different electrode areas; therefore, the proposed variable capacitor can achieve wide and steep modulation by ferroelectric gating.

  abstract     = {For deterministic magnetization switching by spin–orbit torque (SOT) in a perpendicular magnetic anisotropy system, an additional in-plane direction magnetic field is essential to break the lateral symmetry. Realizing chirality in a magnetic ordering system can be one approach for achieving asymmetry in the lateral direction for field-free magnetization switching. However, systematic analysis of the influence of the chiral spin system on deterministic switching is still scarce. We investigate the field-free SOT-induced magnetization switching by using a chiral spin configuration experimentally and theoretically with micromagnetic simulations. We designed a system in which only part of the ferromagnetic layer overlaps with the heavy metal layer in the Pt/Co/MgO structure. Therefore, a spin current exerts only on a local area of the ferromagnetic layer, which results in a Néel-type chiral spin configuration. The induced chiral spin configuration can be stabilized (or destabilized) depending on the sign of the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction and the direction of the current. The stabilized spin configuration plays a crucial role in the deterministic switching in the zero field. We expect our findings to widen the perspective on chirality-based all-electrical SOT device applications.},

We demonstrate reversible laser tuning of the threshold current, the frequency, and the peak power and find that the SHNO frequency can be tuned by up to 350 MHz, which is over three times more than the current tuning alone. Increasing the temperature also results in increased signal jitter, an increased threshold current, and a reduced maximum current for auto-oscillations. Our results open up for optical control of single SHNOs in larger SHNO networks without the need for additional voltage gates.},

  abstract     = {We characterize heat dissipation of supported molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ) monolayers grown by chemical vapor deposition by means of ambient-condition scanning thermal microscopy (SThM). We find that the thermal boundary conductance of the MoS 2 monolayers in contact with 300 nm of SiO 2 is around 4.6 ± 2 MW m −2 K −1 . This value is in the low range of the values determined for exfoliated flakes with other techniques such as Raman thermometry, which span an order of magnitude (0.44–50 MW m −2 K −1 ), and underlines the dispersion of measurements. The sensitivity to the in-plane thermal conductivity of supported MoS 2 is very low, highlighting that the thermal boundary conductance is the key driver of heat dissipation for the MoS 2 monolayer when it is not suspended. In addition, this work also demonstrates that SThM calibration using different thicknesses of SiO 2 , initially aimed at being used with bulk materials can be extended to 2D materials.},

In this Letter, κ of SrTiO 3 was investigated up to ∼20 GPa using high-pressure time domain thermoreflectance together with Raman spectroscopy and first-principles calculations. Our theoretical predictions effectively explain the measured results. In both cubic and tetragonal phases, κ increased with compression, and optical phonons are the dominant heat carriers. The phonon group velocity and relaxation time make prominent contributions to κ with compression in the cubic phase, while the reduction in the anharmonicity of phonon modes and the phonon scattering channels dominates the increase in κ in the tetragonal phase. Especially, during the transition from cubic to tetragonal phases, there is a significant drop in κ , which originally results from the TiO 6 octahedral distortion induced by the soft-phonon-mode, which markedly reduces the phonon group velocity. Our results not only help reveal the pressure effect on κ of complex oxides but also pave their way for applications on high-temperature superconductors and spin devices.},

  abstract     = {Owing to the intrinsically wide bandgap and high uniformity, amorphous Ga 2 O 3 (a-Ga 2 O 3 ) has been illustrating a great industrial potential for large-area deep ultraviolet (UV) photosensor arrays. However, a seemingly irreconcilable contradiction between high responsivity and long persistent photoconductivity has hampered the growing pace of such devices. In this work, three-terminal InGaZnO (IGZO)/a-Ga 2 O 3 dual-active-layer (DAL) transistors were developed to realize the ability of a-Ga 2 O 3 as the active layer both in switching and sensing. Benefitting from the introduction of ultrathin IGZO electron reservoir and defect control of a-Ga 2 O 3 , the DAL device demonstrates more stable and superior gate-control capability with promising performance including high on/off ratio and field-effect mobility of ∼10 8 and 8.3 cm 2 /V⋅s, respectively, as well as a small sub-threshold swing (SS) of 0.36 V/dec. Under 254 nm UV illumination, the DAL device manifests a light-to-dark ratio of ∼10 8 , a responsivity of 4.8 × 10 3 A W −1 , a detectivity of 8 × 10 15 Jones, and a UV/visible rejection ratio (R 254 /R 400 ) of 64. The simultaneous achievement of deep UV photo-detection and transistor&#39;s switching performance in a-Ga 2 O 3 material offers excellent potential for the construction of large-area active-matrix UV photosensor arrays with the simple and low-cost fabrication process.},

An Al atom preferentially occupies an octahedron (O h ) atomic site in comparison with a tetrahedron (T d ) atomic site. However, a sizable number of T d atomic sites, i.e., 20\% for Al composition of 5\%, remain occupied by Al atoms, which is found to increase sharply with Al composition. The O h atomic sites are not fully occupied by Al atoms even for the Al composition of 90\%. The lattice parameters (bandgap) of the β-(Al x Ga 1−x ) 2 O 3 alloy decrease (increase) linearly with Al composition, but a change in slope of the variation of both lattice parameters and bandgap is observed at around Al composition of 50\%. The lattice is found to be distorted for Al compositions more than 50\% as indicated by a large change in the bond angles. The lattice distortion is determined to be the origin for the observed change in slope of the variation of both lattice parameters and bandgap for a monoclinic β-(Al x Ga 1−x ) 2 O 3 alloy system.

This pinning of the Fermi level activates deep carrier traps that can act as sensitizers of the Cr 3+ emission. In agreement with this model, in semi-insulating samples, where the Fermi level lies deep in the bandgap, the Cr 3+ emission is present already in as-grown samples, and no enhancement of its intensity is observed upon proton irradiation. The boost of the Cr 3+ emission yield by irradiation, observed in conductive samples, is reversed by thermal annealing in argon at temperatures above 550 °C for 30 s.

Herein, we propose a facile and cost-effective strategy to synthesize a ZrO 2 /doped-N carbon (ZrO 2 /NC) catalyst with high N and Zr contents (8.78 and 4.4 atom\%, respectively). The ZrO 2 /NC catalyst exhibits comparable electrocatalytic activity with a half-wave potential of 0.815 V and better durability in the ORR compared to the commercial Pt/C catalyst. The ORR proceeds via a 4e − transfer pathway under alkaline conditions in the presence of this catalyst. The excellent catalytic performance is attributed to the high densities of the active sites, namely, pyridinic-N, graphitic-N, and Zr. The high Brunner–Emmett–Teller surface area (787.4 m 2 /g) and an amorphous-crystal morphology of the ZrO 2 /NC catalyst favored the rapid mass transfer and exposed the active sites of the electrolyte and reactants. The strategy presented herein can be used for the large-scale production of metal–air batteries.},

We examine the electromagnetic properties of both individual and arrayed “diabolo nanodisks,” which are found to exhibit |E| 2 /|E 0 | 2 enhancements in the range ∼10 2 –10 4 , in the high index medium, depending on geometrical considerations. In addition to supporting a localized electric field “hot-spot” similar to those predicted in diabolo nanostructured photonic crystal cavities and waveguide designs, we identify an anti-diabolo effect leading to a broadband “cold-spot” for the orthogonal polarization. These findings offer the prospect of enhancing or manipulating light–matter interactions at the nanoscale within an all-dielectric (metal free) platform for potential applications ranging from non-linear optics to quantum light sources, nano-sensing, nanoparticle-manipulation, and active/tunable metasurfaces.},

We design a slit-type unit cell as a practical implementation of the proposed mechanism and analytically prove its potential to obtain the desired leakage and loss factors simultaneously by properly adjusting the structural parameters. We benchmark our designed metamaterial with a conventional Helmholtz resonator-based design to demonstrate its advantage of sound absorption. Good agreement is observed between the theoretical predictions and experimental measurements.

Combining the in situ reflection high-energy electron diffraction, scanning tunneling microscopy, x-ray photoemission spectroscopy, and ex situ x-ray diffraction, we found that the first layer of CrTe x films formed in a CrTe 2 crystalline phase as a buffer layer for further growth. Afterward, the chromium atoms began to intercalate into the layers of CrTe 2 , and the Cr 3 Te 4 phase dominated the following growth over the second layer. Subsequent superconducting quantum interference device measurements verified the ferromagnetism in the chromium telluride film down to one layer limit. Our results provide important information on the structural phase transition during the growth of CrTe x films, which would be an ideal platform for studying ferromagnetism in 2D systems, and the growth of high-quality CrTe x films on Si substrates would benefit the further applications of 2D ferromagnetic films.},

By performing (1) three-dimensional electrostatic calculations, (2) WKB quantum calculations of the current, and (3) one-dimensional solutions of the Schrödinger equation along the perpendicular line from the surface to the tip apex, we provide a theoretical understanding and prediction of the experimental U ( n ) curve. Unlike commonly assumed, the triangular potential well is not found to be a good approximation for the high- n states. We show that although the spectroscopy mode assures a constant electric field at the tip apex, this leads only for the intermediate resonance states (approximately 2 &lt; n &lt; 6 ⁠ ) to reside in a linear potential between the tip and the surface. Whereas the low lying ( n &lt;6) states all lie approximately in the same quantum well, at higher tip-sample distances d and bias voltages V ( d ), the quantum well is no longer triangular but attains a curvature, which is d dependent. Each high- n state resides in its own well that can be well-approximated by a polynomial of second order. Hence, the range of U n to be analyzed in terms of spectroscopic positions needs to be chosen with great care when deducing surface work functions.},

The uniform CH 3 NH 3 PbBr 3 QDs thin film is fabricated by a electrodepositing QDs solution and exhibits favorable long-term stability at ambient. By inserting an Al 2 O 3 film, the dark current of the QDs film photodetectors is significantly suppressed as a result of the blocking effect, accompanied by the enhanced ON/OFF ratio. Furthermore, the optimal photodetector is utilized as a photoelectric synapse. Through modulating the light pulse stimuli, some underlying synaptic functions, including paired-pulse facilitation, axon-multi-synapses network function, and the transformation from short-term plasticity to long-term plasticity, are flexibly emulated on a single photoelectric synapse. These remarkable results are promising for building hardware units with neuromorphic architecture to mimic the human brain functionalities.},

One of the challenges in controlling the optical emission from two-dimensional materials is to achieve narrow angular spread using simple photonic geometry. In this article, we study how the photoluminescence of a monolayer WS 2 can be controlled when coupled to a film coupled microsphere dielectric antenna. Specifically, by employing Fourier plane microscopy and spectroscopic techniques, we quantify the wavevector distribution in the momentum space. As a result, we show the beaming of the WS 2 photoluminescence with angular divergence as low as θ 1 / 2 = 4.6°. Furthermore, the experimental measurements have been supported by three-dimensional numerical simulations. We envisage that the discussed results can be generalized to a variety of two-dimensional materials and can be harnessed for on-chip nonlinear and quantum technology.},

  abstract     = {This work presents an alternative experimental approach to directly measure propagation losses of surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) in a single silver nanowire (AgNW). The methodology synergistically combines several techniques, including single nanowire optical shaping, accurate triggering of SPPs by upconversion nanocrystals (NCs), and precise deposition of sub-micrometer-size droplets with emitters. Indeed, a femtoliter volume of colloidal NCs deposited at one end of the nanowire and excited with a laser through an objective provides a stable source of polaritons, which propagate in the nanowire. The intensity of radiation released by the SPPs scattered out at the opposite AgNW end is a direct measure of propagation losses. This is enabled through a method of precise laser cutting of the nanowire, where the length of the nanowire can be gradually reduced by an optically controlled melting process. At the same time, both the length and diameter of the nanowire are constantly monitored using optical imaging of the complex interaction between the nanowire and polarized Gaussian beam. The optical cutting technique, implemented in this experiment, shows great potential for advanced and inexpensive shaping of the metallic nanostructures for nanophotonic applications.},

The bilayer InAs structure includes p + -doped and undoped InAs layers, inducing a strong built-in electric field that enables terahertz generation without requiring any external bias voltage. A large-area plasmonic nanoantenna array is used to enhance and confine optical generation inside the photoconductive region with the highest built-in electric field, leading to the generation of a strong ultrafast photocurrent and broadband terahertz radiation. Thanks to a higher terahertz transmission through the silicon substrate and a shorter carrier lifetime in the InAs layers grown on silicon, higher signal-to-noise ratios are achieved at high terahertz frequencies compared with previously demonstrated bias-free terahertz emitters realized on GaAs. In addition to compatibility with silicon integrated optoelectronic platforms, the presented bias-free photoconductive emitter provides more than a 6 THz radiation bandwidth with more than 100 dB dynamic range when used in a terahertz time-domain spectroscopy system.},

The optical chirality was investigated with a helicity-resolved single-particle spectroscopy technique, including the dark-field scattering and photoluminescence spectra. The single-particle spectra can effectively indicate the chiral phonon in bilayer graphene. That is due to the interaction between achiral local surface plasmon resonance and chiral phonons, which influences the plasmon damping at the interface. We propose a plasmon–phonon coupled spectroscopy method for phonon chirality detection. This method provides an advantage for developing high spatial resolution detection of chiral phonon in low-dimensional materials due to the localization of plasmonic near-field.},

However, the atomically thin thickness induced low absorption cross sections impede their further applications as efficient absorbers and emitters. Herein, we report the emission enhancement and exciton species modulation in monolayer (ML) WS 2 via the decoration of CdTe quantum dots (QDs). The ML WS 2 was synthesized by thermal evaporation and showed evident neutral (A o ) and charged (A − ) exciton emissions with variable A − -to-A o ratios under different excitation powers and temperatures. The A − emission played an important role at low temperature (80 K) and high excitation power (5 mW). After the decoration of the CdTe QDs, the photoluminescence (PL) intensity of the ML WS 2 enhanced greatly. Moreover, the A o emission was dominant in WS 2 + CdTe even under high excitation power and low temperature. The transfer of numerous holes from CdTe to WS 2 induced the nonradiative recombination probability reduction, and p-type doping was critical to the observed PL enhancement and exciton species modulation in WS 2 + CdTe. Our results provide a flexible strategy to improve the PL properties of atomically thin WS 2 and further deepen the understanding of exciton-physics in ML MX 2 for various applications.},

Due to the different thermal expansion coefficients of silicon and aluminum, the absorbed radiation induces a deformation of the cantilever, which is read out optically using a 1.5 μ m laser diode. By illuminating the detector with an amplitude modulated, 2.5 THz quantum cascade laser, we obtain, at room-temperature and atmospheric pressure, a responsivity of ∼ 1.5 × 10 8 pm W − 1 for the fundamental mechanical bending mode of the cantilever. This yields noise-equivalent-power of 20 nW / Hz at 2.5 THz.

The results of photoluminescence studies show that a thicker n-GaN layer is beneficial for obtaining higher In content for red MQWs. However, the sample with a thicker n-GaN layer has a poorer internal quantum efficiency, a larger full width at half maximum, and a shorter nonradiative recombination time, implying that there are stronger In-content fluctuations and more defects. Furthermore, red MQWs with higher In content are shown to exhibit more deep localized states.

The use of 2D materials can break the limitation of high cost of conventional epitaxial semiconductors and a complex cryogenic cooling system for multi-band detection, but there is still much room to improve the performance, especially in responsivity and signal noise ratio. Herein, we have fabricated a VIS-NIR dual-band photodetector based on a multilayer Ta 2 NiSe 5 /GaSe heterojunction. Benefiting from the type-II heterojunction, the separation of photo-induced carriers is naturally enhanced, which promotes the responsivity of this dual-band photodetector to 4.8 A W −1 (VIS) and 0.15 A W −1 (NIR) at room temperature with a suppressed dark current at ∼4 pA.

  abstract     = {We describe how a ladder emitter can implement a tunable quantum logic gate on photonic qubits encoded in the frequency basis. The ground-to-first excited state of the ladder emitter interacts with the control photon, and the first-to-second excited state transition interacts with the target photon. By controlling the relative detuning between the target photon and the first-to-second excited state transition of the ladder emitter, we enable any controlled-phase operation from 0 to π . We derive analytical formulas for the performance of the gate through the S -matrix formalism as well as describe the mechanism intuitively. This gate is deterministic, does not utilize any active control, and needs only a single ladder emitter, enabling low-footprint and more efficient decomposition of quantum circuits, especially the quantum Fourier transform. We suggest multiple potential systems for physical realization of our proposal, such as lanthanide ions embedded in Purcell-enhanced cavities. We expect these results to motivate further interest in photonic quantum information processing with designer emitters.},

The interfacial mechanics of a Janus evaporator with an interpenetrating structure are proposed to achieve a dramatic improvement in the solar–thermal evaporation rate. The Janus evaporator is composed of a membrane material of Cu 1.96 S grown in situ on a foamed copper skeleton (CF@Cu 1.96 S) and a graphene oxide/sodium alginate aerogel (GA), through an interfacial freeze-drying shape technology. In this unique architecture, the superhydrophilic GA can be stretched into the hydrophobic CF@Cu 1.96 S interior to build an interpenetrating network architecture (CF@Cu 1.96 S/GA), thereby adjusting the Laplace pressure and constraining capillarity. Due to the optimized water supply of interfacial mechanics, the CF@Cu 1.96 S/GA evaporator achieves an evaporation rate of 1.79 kg m −2 h −1 under 1 sun irradiation and exhibits superior salt resistance. This provides a rationale for the reasonable design of the structure of the solar–thermal evaporators.},

In this work, these issues are addressed via an in situ hybrid strategy, viz., highly conductive and thermally stable 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide is immobilized in nanoscale silica skeletons to form ionogel via a non-hydrolytic sol-gel route, followed by hybridizing with polymeric poly(ethylene oxide) and inorganic conductor Na 3 Zr 2 Si 2 PO 12 . Such hybrid design yields the required solid electrolyte, which shows not only a stable electrochemical stability window of 5.4 V vs Na/Na + but also an extremely high ionic conductivity of 1.5 × 10 −3 S cm −1 at 25 °C, which is demonstrated with the interacted and monolithic structure of the electrolyte by SEM, XRD, thermogravimetric (TG), and XPS. Moreover, the capabilities of suppressing sodium metal dendrite growth and enabling high-voltage cathode Mg-doped P2-type Na 0.67 Ni 0.33 Mn 0.67 O 2 are verified.

However, its actual PEC performances are inferior to theoretical values, which are challenged by rapid recombination of photogenerated carriers and sluggish water oxidation kinetics. Here, a flame method that has the advantages of being simplistic, controllable, and ultra-efficient is reported to generate a rich oxygen vacancy (OV) in WO 3 nanosheet arrays to enhance the PEC performance. The morphology, crystallinity, and PEC performance of the WO 3 nanosheet arrays were significantly sensitive to the process parameters. By optimizing the process, rich surface OVs were introduced in the WO 3 photoanode within 30 s, while the overall morphology, crystallinity, and conductive substrate were well preserved. The optimum deficient WO 3 photoanode exhibited a photocurrent density of 2.40 mA cm −2 , which is 3.33 times as high as that of the untreated counterpart. The OVs significantly improved the PEC performance of the WO 3 photoanode by enhanced carrier transports and stronger activation for OH − ions. Moreover, the proposed flame method exhibits great versatility in prevalent metal oxides for introducing OVs.},

Among novel memory technologies that promise efficient device operation on a sub-ns timescale, resistance switching between charge ordered phases of 1 T -TaS 2 has shown to be potentially useful for development of high-speed, energy efficient nonvolatile memory devices. Measurement of the electrical operation of such devices in the picosecond regime is technically challenging and hitherto still largely unexplored. Here, we use an optoelectronic “laboratory-on-a-chip” experiment for measurement of ultrafast memory switching, enabling accurate measurement of electrical switching parameters with 100 fs temporal resolution. Photoexcitation and electro-optic sampling on a (Cd,Mn)Te substrate are used to generate and, subsequently, measure electrical pulse propagation with intra-band excitation and sub-gap probing, respectively. We demonstrate high contrast nonvolatile resistance switching from high to low resistance states of a 1 T -TaS 2 device using single sub-2 ps electrical pulses. Using detailed modeling, we find that the switching energy density per unit area is exceptionally small, E A = 9.4 fJ/ μ m 2 . The speed and energy efficiency of an electronic “write” process place the 1 T -TaS 2 devices into a category of their own among new generation nonvolatile memory devices.},

Interestingly, the device operates only under the threshold switching mode with the switching voltage as low as ∼220 mV and a huge switching ratio of 10 7 . A systematic analysis of the impact of the bilayer configuration and the existence of the Pt NPs on the total memory performance is also provided, while a comprehensive numerical model is introduced to highlight the crucial role of the electrode material on the local temperature distribution and its influence on the memristive effect. On top of that, the proposed structure can imitate the normal, relaxation, and sensitization states of the nociceptors with about 0.3 pJ energy per spike. These enhanced properties are ascribed to the self-rupture of the Ag-based conducting filament, whereas valuable insights into the impact of the local temperature distribution on the switching dynamics are provided.},

Recently, the concept of the boundary-obstructed topological (BOT) phases has defined a class of topological phases without bulk energy band closing around zero energy, which greatly broadens the applications of the topological states. In this work, based on the two-dimensional Su–Schrieffer–Heeger network, we show that the band degeneracies around zero energy can be removed to open a complete bandgap by judiciously tuning the hopping terms to break C 4 v symmetry down to C 2 v symmetry but with the topological phase invariant, which can be directly characterized by the BOT phase. Furthermore, we experimentally propose a rigorous acoustic sample to visualize the hierarchy of the in-gap higher-order topological states exactly. Crucially, by designedly connecting the lattice with outside environment, we show that these spectrally isolated states still response to the specific frequencies robustly. Our results are expected to be helpful for manipulating wave propagation and sound energy harvesting.},

  abstract     = {Black phosphorus (BP)-based broken gap heterojunctions have attracted significant attention mainly owing to its wide thickness-dependent Fermi level, offering opportunities to demonstrate various carrier transport characteristics and high performing optoelectronic applications. However, the interfacial effects on the carrier scattering mechanism of the two-dimensional (2D) broken gap heterojunctions are unclear. Herein, we discuss the origin of random telegraph noise of multilayer BP/ReS 2 heterojunction diode, in particular, at the direct tunneling (DT) conduction regime. The gate-tunable diode characteristic of BP/ReS 2 heterojunction allows one to unveil systematically the transition of the charge fluctuation mechanism from drift-diffusion to the DT regime. Unlike individual BP and ReS 2 devices, the current noise histogram obtained from the BP/ReS 2 heterojunction device exhibits exclusively two dominant peaks at the DT regime. We ascribed this distinct low-frequency noise feature representing the presence of random telegraph signal to the BP/ReS 2 interfacial traps by taking into account of the inherent direct tunneling current conduction mechanism. In addition, the electrostatic bias-dependent power spectrum density manifests clearly that the dominant scattering mechanism is the carrier number fluctuation rather than tunneling barrier height fluctuation at the BP/ReS 2 heterointerface. This study elucidates the carrier transport and the charge fluctuation mechanism at the 2D heterostructure interface.},

Cryogenic electrical measurements reveal that R C exhibits weakly positive dependence on T until 77 K as well as a weakly negative correlation with t ch . In contrast to the non-negligible R C values extracted, an unexpectedly low effective thermal injection barrier of 36 meV is estimated, indicating the presence of significant tunneling injection in the subthreshold regime and the inapplicability of the pure thermionic emission model to estimate the height of the injection barrier.},

The improved efficiency is ascribed to the favored charge extraction and retarded charge recombination, as reflected by transient photovoltage/photocurrent curves and impedance spectroscopy measurement. In addition, the grazing incidence photoluminescence spectrum reveals that oleylamine doping causes a blue shift of the luminescence peak of the surface layer of the halide perovskite film, while the Mott−Schottky study observes 100 mV increment in the built-in potential, both of which indicate possible defect passivation behavior on the perovskite.

  abstract     = {Conventional memory technologies are facing enormous problems with downscaling, and are hence unable to fulfill the requirement of big data storage generated by a huge explosion of digital information. A resistive random access memory device (RRAM) is one of the most emerging technologies for next-generation computing data storage owing to its high-density stacking, ultrafast switching speed, high non-volatility, multilevel data storage, low power consumption, and simple device structure. In this work, colloidal MoS 2 quantum dots (QDs) embedded in an insulating matrix of poly-(4vinylpyridine) (PVP) were used as an active layer to fabricate a RRAM device. The MoS 2 QDs-PVP based RRAM device reveals an excellent nonvolatile resistive switching (RS) behavior with a maximum current on-off ratio (I ON /I OFF ) of 10 5 . High endurance, long retention time, and successive “write-read-erase-read” cycles indicate high-performance RRAM characteristics. The ultimate power consumption by this RRAM device is considerably low for energy saving. In addition, the MoS 2 QDs-PVP based device shows RS behavior even at 130 °C. High I ON /I OFF , low operating power, high endurance, long retention time, and excellent stability with temperatures reveal that the MoS 2 QDs-PVP based device can be a promising candidate for high-performance low power RRAM devices that can be operated at relatively higher temperatures.},

  abstract     = {Enhancing the central frequency ( f c ) and bandwidth (BW) and reducing insertion loss (IL) are essential steps in surface acoustic wave (SAW) filter applications in the 5G era. With this in mind, we construct a 32° Y-X LiNbO 3 (300 nm)/SiO 2 (300 nm)/poly-Si(1 μ m)/Si heterostructure to avoid both acoustic leakage through the waveguide effect and electrical loss through the introduction of a poly-Si layer. By separately modulating the electrode thicknesses of series and parallel resonators, the spurious modes can be mitigated out of the filter passband, preventing them from negatively impacting the filter characteristics. Moreover, to reduce Ohmic loss, an optimized design for an Al/Cu/Ti multilayer electrode is proposed as a replacement for the Cu/Ti electrode resonators built on Al/Cu/Ti electrodes provide a high resonance frequency of 3.76 GHz, a large electromechanical coupling coefficient of 23\%, and a maximum quality factor of 1510 (twice that of the Cu/Ti electrodes). Finally, SAW filters with an f c of 3728 MHz and a 3-dB BW of 1052 MHz are implemented, with IL of 0.92 dB. The achieved specifications demonstrates that one-chip SAW filter is expected to become n77 band filtering solution.},

Franckeite (Fr) is a naturally occurring van der Waals heterostructure comprised of two distinct alternately stacked semiconducting layers: (i) SnS 2 layer and (ii) Pb 3 SbS 4 . Though both layers in the heterostructure are semiconductors, the photoluminescence from Franckeite remains elusive. Here, we report the observation of photoluminescence (PL) from Franckeite. We observed two PL peaks at ∼1.97 and ∼2.12 eV at 1.5 K. By varying the temperature from 1.5 to 280 K, we found that the PL peak position blueshifts and the integrated intensity decreases slowly as we increase the temperature. We observed linear dependence of photoluminescence integrated intensity on excitation laser power, indicating that the photoluminescence is originating from free excitons in the SnS 2 layer of Fr. By comparing the PL from Fr with the PL from a monolayer MoS 2 , we determined that the PL quantum efficiency from Fr is an order of magnitude lower than that of a monolayer MoS 2 . Our study provides a fundamental understanding of the optical behavior in a complex naturally occurring van der Waals heterostructure and may pave an avenue toward developing nanoscale optical and optoelectronic devices with tailored properties.},

Electrolyte-gated transistors have drawn attention for their potential to mimic synaptic behaviors in neuromorphic applications, but they generally operate at low voltages to avoid instability and, hence, offer limited tunability. Sputtered silicon dioxide electrolytes are utilized in this work to gate indium-gallium-zinc-oxide thin-film transistors, which offer robust operation at much higher voltages. The synaptic memory behavior is studied under single and multiple pulses and under mild (1 V) and strong stimuli (up to 8 V). The devices are found to be capable of providing an extremely wide range of memory retention time from ∼2 ms to ∼20 000 s, over seven orders of magnitude. Furthermore, based on the experimental data on individual transistors, pattern learning and memorizing functionalities are conceptually demonstrated.},

  abstract     = {Metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) diodes with a high dielectric constant magnesium-oxide (MgO) insulating layer were fabricated using a magnetron radio frequency sputtering system. MgO has a high dielectric constant of approximately 11.2, which is three times higher than the dielectric constant (3.9) of silicon dioxide (SiO 2 ), thereby ensuring a three times thicker gate oxide and reducing gate leakage current while maintaining the same capacitance density. Post-annealing treatment was employed on the MgO film to study how annealing treatment affects the electrical characteristics of MOS diodes. It was observed that the post-annealing treatment of MgO effectively diminished the gate leakage current by approximately one order, thereby increasing the rectification ratio from 8.5 × 10 3 to 6.8 × 10 4 for the MOS diodes with as-deposited and post-annealed MgO. In contrast to the MOS diodes with as-deposited MgO, the post-annealing treatment of MgO significantly decreased the flatband voltage shift from 7.8 to 1.3 V and reduced the fixed oxide charge density from 1.3 × 10 12 to 2.3 × 10 11 cm −2 ; also, the interface trap charge density was suppressed from 1.8 × 10 13 to 3.2 × 10 12 cm −2 eV −1 . Large quantities of fixed oxide charge attracted more electrons accumulated at the Si surface, which decreased the barrier height from 0.85 to 0.81 eV for the MOS diodes with post-annealed and as-deposited MgO. Moreover, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy showed that the oxide charges were caused by the defects inside MgO, particularly oxygen vacancies. The oxygen vacancies were compensated by the oxygen atoms introduced from the air during the post-annealing treatment.},

  abstract     = {Recently, relaxor ferroelectric thin-film capacitors have attracted considerable attention for energy storage applications since their slim-type polarization–electric field hysteresis loops can yield large recoverable energy density ( W rec ) and high efficiency ( η ). In this work, we study the effects of buffer layers on energy storage properties of 0.93Pb(Mg 1/3 Nb 2/3 )O 3 -0.07PbTiO 3 (PMN-PT) thin-film capacitors with a 5 nm-thick SrTiO 3 (STO) and LaAlO 3 (LAO) films. The energy storage properties of Pt/PMN-PT/SrRuO 3 (SRO) capacitors are found to be significantly changed by incorporating the STO or LAO buffer layer at the top Pt/PMN-PT interface, while inserting the buffer layer at bottom PMN-PT/SRO interface shows negligible effects on the electrical properties. Specifically, with the STO buffering, the breakdown field is dramatically increased in the Pt/STO/PMN-PT/SRO capacitor due to the existence of an internal field in the STO, which prevents the growth of electrical trees from the bottom SRO to the top Pt electrode, and a large W rec of ∼48.91 J/cm 3 , more than three times of that of the PMN-PT capacitor, is achieved. However, buffered by the LAO, the Pt/LAO/PMN-PT/SRO capacitor exhibits a reduced relaxor character, which may be ascribed to a pinning effect of nanodomains associated with the charged LAO/PMN-PT interface. As a result, both W rec and η are significantly lowered, compared to the non-buffered PMN-PT capacitor. These results provide physical insights into the modulation of relaxor and dielectric behaviors by designing the characteristics of buffer layers, demonstrating a way for enhancing energy storage properties in thin-film capacitors.},

This paper studies SOT and the thermoelectric effect in SyAF of Pt/Co/Ru/Co/Pt by harmonic Hall resistance measurements. Different from the traditional Co/Pt bilayers, the second harmonic Hall resistance signals of the SyAF-based devices are obviously enhanced under a large external magnetic field ( B ext ), which is caused by the antiferromagnetic exchange coupling fields weakening the influence of B ext . By fitting the Hall resistance curves, the field-like torque is demonstrated to be the main contribution to the Hall resistance. Interestingly, both the SOT effective fields are greatly enhanced for antiparallel alignment. This study separates the contributions of SOT and the thermoelectric effect in the SyAF structures and enables the design of the spintronic devices with stability under a large magnetic field.},

Here, we report on the control of PMA in Pt/Co/Ir thin films by the strain produced by standing surface acoustic waves (SAWs). A significant (∼21\%) coercivity reduction (from 4.80 ± 0.03 to 3.80 ± 0.02 mT) can be obtained by applying a standing SAW with a center frequency of 93.35 MHz. Furthermore, the standing SAWs induce a greater-than 11-fold increase in magnetization reversal speed (from 168 ± 3 to up to 2100 ± 80 μ m 2 /s) at 3.2 mT for a total applied RF power of 22.5 dBm. During application of SAWs, wide-field Kerr microscopy reveals the formation of domains in stripes with a periodicity of half of the SAW wavelength. Micromagnetic simulations indicate that the anti-nodes of the standing SAW locally lower the anisotropy due to the magneto-elastic coupling effect, decreasing domain nucleation field while promoting magnetization reversal. Our study suggests the possibility of remote and energy-efficient control of magnetization switching using SAWs.},

  abstract     = {Although all-optical magnetization switching with fs laser pulses has garnered much technological interest, the ultimate data rates achievable have scarcely been investigated. Recently, it has been shown that after a switching event in a GdCo alloy, a second laser pulse arriving 7 ps later can consistently switch the magnetization. However, it is as of yet unknown whether the same holds in layered ferrimagnetic systems, which hold much promise for applications. In this work, we investigate the minimum time delay required between two subsequent switching events in synthetic ferrimagnetic Co/Gd bilayers using two fs laser pulses. We experimentally demonstrate that the minimum time delay needed for consistent switching can be as low as 10 ps. Moreover, we demonstrate the importance of engineering heat diffusion away from the magnetic material as well as control over the laser pulse energy. This behavior is reproduced using modeling, where we find that the second switch can occur even when the magnetization is not fully recovered. We further confirm that heat diffusion is a critical factor in reducing the time delay for the second switch, while also confirming a critical dependence on laser energy.},

  abstract     = {We present calculations of frequency and wavevector dispersion of conductivity of two-dimensional electrons confined in AlGaN/GaN heterostructures at the arbitrary level of the degeneracy and the presence of strongly inelastic scattering mechanism by the optical phonons. We found that the high-frequency conductivity deviates from that of the standard Drude–Lorentz model and changes significantly at elevated temperature. The results were applied for simulation of the spectral characteristics of the grating-based plasmonic structure for wide temperature range. We found that thermal activation of the inelastic scattering leads to significant red-shift of the plasmon resonances. This facilitates refinement of interpretation of experimental results published in series of recent papers. We concluded that for AlGaN/GaN heterostructures, the electron effective mass changes in narrower diapason of 0.22 m e , … , 0.26 m e ⁠ , when temperature varies from 77 to 300 K. We suggest that found peculiarities of the high-frequency conductivity and its spatial dispersion are of a general character and can be important for high-frequency and high power devices based on AlGaN/GaN heterostructures.},

  abstract     = {We explore the potential of highly mismatched alloys (HMAs) for realizing lossless plasmonics. Systems with a plasmon frequency at which there are no interband or intraband processes possible are called lossless, as there is no two-particle loss channel for the plasmon. We find that the band splitting in HMAs with a conduction band anticrossing guarantees a lossless frequency window. When such a material is doped, producing plasmonic behavior, we study the conditions required for the plasmon frequency to fall in the lossless window, realizing lossless plasmons. Considering a generic class of HMAs with a conduction band anticrossing, we find universal contours in their parameter space within which lossless plasmons are possible for some doping range. Our analysis shows that HMAs with heavy effective masses and small high-frequency permittivity are most promising for realizing a lossless plasmonic material.},

  abstract     = {Sound absorption is important for room acoustics and remediation of noise. Acoustic metamaterials have recently emerged as one of the most promising platforms for sound absorption. However, the working bandwidth is severely limited because of the strong dispersion in the spectrum caused by local resonance. Utilizing the coupling effect among resonators can improve the absorbers&#39; performance, but the requirement of collecting coupling effects among all resonators, not only the nearest-neighbor coupling, makes the system too complex to explore analytically. This Letter describes deep learning based acoustic metamaterials for achieving broadband sound absorption with no visible oscillation in a targeted frequency band. We numerically and experimentally achieve an average absorption coefficient larger than 97\% within the ultra-broadband extending from 860 to 8000 Hz, proving the validity of the deep learning based acoustic metamaterials. The excellent ultra-broadband and near-perfect absorption performance allows the absorber for versatile applications in noise-control engineering and room acoustics. Our work also reveals the significance of modulating coupling effects among resonators, and the deep learning approach may blaze a trail in the design strategy of acoustic functional devices.},

Specifically, we make use of 85 Rb to produce a broad gain spectrum via the optically pumped Raman gain process and 87 Rb to produce a narrow absorption spectrum via the optically pump Raman depletion process. A separate gain cell is used for the laser in each direction. Inferred from the simulation, the spectral sensitivity enhancements of the clock-wise and counter-clock-wise superluminal ring lasers are ∼362 and ∼505, respectively, with the imbalance attributed to differences in pump powers.},

First is tuning of the resonance frequency, achieved by applying DC bias voltage to the stiffness modulating structures. A tuning rate was found to be 0.95 Hz V −1 with up to 20 Hz of usable frequency range. Second, when direct excitation of the torsional mode is combined with the harmonic modulation of the spring stiffness, an optical scan angle is shown to be increased by more than 4° through 2:1 degenerate parametric amplification. By varying the phase of the parametric pump with respect to the direct excitation, the Q-factor is tuned between 617 and 898, corresponding to the minimum and maximum parametric gain factors of 0.84× and 1.21×, respectively, achieved at a nominal unpumped optical scan angle of 16.3°. Increasing the pump amplitude shows a moderate increase in the amplifier&#39;s gain with clear saturation at 1.43× in the superthreshold pumping regime, indicating a presence of the third order stiffness nonlinearity.

  abstract     = {Outdoor photoluminescence imaging on field-deployed solar cell modules has been conducted to an increasing extent in recent years. Photoluminescence images provide more details about defects than thermal infrared images, while the imaging procedure has the potential to be faster than electroluminescence imaging because it does not require electrical connection to the modules. However, when conducted with sunlight excitation, it is based on lock-in technique, which implies switching between the modules&#39; two operating points. This often results in the need to connect additional electrical equipment dimensioned for the task and leads to production disruption for the investigated modules. The present study demonstrates image acquisition based on the string inverter&#39;s ability to sweep the IV curve. The advantage of this approach is twofold. This is a noninvasive method, which only requires imaging apparatus and, therefore, allows for a flexible imaging procedure on the string, module, or cell level without having to take into account additional equipment. Furthermore, photoluminescence images spanning the whole IV curve can be obtained during one sweep, as opposed to obtaining images in two operating points when using lock-in technique. Such image series can be used to investigate the state of the cells and modules by looking at the photoluminescence images acquired on different current extraction levels.

  abstract     = {Decoupling the interdependence of various transport parameters in materials has been an intractable challenge in designing efficient thermoelectric materials. Using the first-principles density functional theory and the semi-classical Boltzmann transport theory, we demonstrate that the crucial criteria of obtaining suitable electronic and thermal transport have been achieved by utilizing the presence of mixed cations in spinel oxides. Differently coordinated cations present in spinel oxides lead to decoupled cationic contribution to the electronic and thermal transport properties. While electronic transport properties are controlled by tetrahedrally coordinated cation B (Co), the octahedrally coordinated cations A (Zn/Cd) only contribute to the thermal transport of the system. The combination of heavy bands in the electronic dispersions and tetrahedrally coordinated environment of Co results into an enhanced power factor. Additionally, the substitution of Cd leads to one order of magnitude reduction in the lattice thermal conductivity ( κ l ) without affecting the electronic transport properties. The significant reduction in κ l has been attributed to the large mass difference, and remarkably strong anharmonic phonon scattering introduced by Cd. Simultaneously achieved high power factor and low lattice thermal conductivity result in a maximum figure of merit of 1.68 in CdCo 2 O 4 spinel oxide. The approach of decoupling atomic contributions utilizing various cationic sites demonstrates a potential route to enhance thermoelectric performance.},

While research has been focused on reducing power consumption of transistors, low-power diodes have not been widely studied. Here, we report a low-power, thus steep-slope Schottky diode, with a “cold metal” source. The Schottky barrier between metal electrode and bulk MoS 2 enabled the diode behavior, and the steep-slope diode IV curve originated from the change in the density of states of a graphite (cold metal) source with a bias voltage. The MoS 2 Schottky diode with a cold metal exhibits an ideality factor (η) &lt; 1 for more than four decades of drain current with a sizable rectifying ratio (10 8 ). The realization of a steep-slope Schottky diode paves the way to the improvement in low-power circuit technology.},

Taking advantage of the electrode shielding effect on the depolarization field across an interfacial layer, the near-zero coercive field increases almost linearly with respect to the extending length of one side electrode covering the tail of the reversed domain, enabling nonvolatile ferroelectric domain wall devices in good polarization retention and fast operation speeds.},

  abstract     = {Actively controlling the infrared emissivity of materials is critical for many applications, such as radiative cooling and thermal camouflage. Multilayer graphene (MLG) has shown great potential as a functional material with a tunable infrared emissivity. However, the spatial homogeneity in adjusting MLG&#39;s emissivity through ion intercalation is rather poor, which limits its practical applications. Here, we study how mixing various molecular components (e.g., ethanol) with ionic liquids affects the performance of MLG-based infrared emissivity modulators. The results indicate that introducing a moderate concentration of molecular components not only significantly improves spatial homogeneity in tuning emissivity but also enhances modulation depth, dynamic response, and the stability of the modulators. This is likely due to the increasing conductivity of the mixture and the improved wetting properties between the mixture and the separator, which leads to more effective charge transfer from ions in ionic liquids to carbons in graphene. The microscopic structure of MLG, revealed by Raman spectroscopy, confirms that the improvement in modulator performance is mostly due to homogeneous transportation of ions in the modulators. This not only sheds light on the underlying physics of the modulator but also greatly expands the options when selecting ionic liquids, thereby opening a new route for the modulator design.},

In this work, a capacitance–voltage (C–V) model for PeLEDs is established to describe carrier behaviors. Four distinct regions in this typical C–V model, including a neutrality region, a barrier region, a carrier diffusion region, and a carrier recombination region, were analyzed. Importantly, the C–V model is implemented to guide the electroluminescence (EL) performance improvement in PeLEDs. By studying the measured C–V characteristics of a typical PeLED, issues of a high hole injection barrier and insufficient recombination are revealed. To address them, one MoO 3 interface layer with deep conduction band minimum is designed between a hole transport layer and a hole injection layer to enhance the hole injection. The C–V characteristics for the optimized PeLED confirm the reduced injection barrier and strengthened recombination rate. The optimized PeLED shows an improved external quantum efficiency from 8.34\% to 15.82\%. The C–V model helps us to quantitatively understand the essential carrier behaviors in PeLEDs and can serve as an efficient method to improve the EL performance of PeLEDs.},

Among them, bare carbide MXenes exhibit a metallic feature, greatly limiting the potential applications in optoelectronic devices. Herein, based on the particle swarm optimization and first-principles calculations, we predicted the existence of two single layer (SL) TMCs, namely, tetragonal β -MC and hexagonal γ -MC (M = Ti, Zr, Hf). The two structures are more stable than previously reported α -MC and possess semimetal and semiconductor properties, respectively. We further reveal that the β -MC monolayers have two nodal loops around the Fermi level. SL γ -TiC, ZrC, and HfC have a bandgap of 1.59, 1.24, and 1.57 eV, respectively, and display strong light-harvesting ability in the visible light range. Our research expands the 2D TMCs family beyond the extensively existing MXenes and greatly enriches the carbon chemistry.},

Inspired by the fluid lines and vorticity in hydromechanics, a characterization method of polarization lines and polarization vorticity is proposed herein for characterizing the vortex structure evolution. The polarization vorticity has the same unit as charge density, and the polarization vortex size is identified as a structure for vorticity concentration. Observing the radius and vorticity of vortices, we find that the domain evolution can be divided into three stages and the vortices react to mechanical loading in two ways: increasing the vorticity and enlarging the radius. Moreover, vortices exhibit three-dimensional shape, just like the vortex tube, and their conservation is proved. This paper provides a basis for further research on topological domain structures and the mechanism of vortex evolution, which might help improve high energy density devices.},

The PMA is originated by the orbital reconstruction and ferromagnetic exchange interaction at the interface between the CoO 6 and MnO 6 octahedra layers. The modulation ratio up to a significant value ∼200\% of PMA can be realized through the phase transition of LaCoO 3− δ layers between perovskite and brownmillerite via deprivation or replenishment of oxygen sites. The antiferromagnetic superexchange interaction at the interface between the oxygen-deficient CoO 4 tetrahedra layer and the adjacent MnO 6 octahedral layer with lattice distortion may suppress the magnetization and PMA. This work ensures promising outcomes in situ modulation of PMA in oxide films such as ferroelectric polarization or ionic liquid gating via the transport of oxygen vacancies.},

  abstract     = {Materials with large spin–orbit interactions generate pure spin currents with spin polarizations parallel to the interfacial surfaces that give rise to conventional spin–orbit torques. These spin–orbit torques can only efficiently and deterministically switch magnets with in-plane magnetization. Additional symmetry breaking, such as in non-collinear antiferromagnets, can generate exotic, unconventional spin–orbit torques that are associated with spin polarizations perpendicular to the interfacial planes. Here, we use micromagnetic simulations to investigate whether such exotic spin–orbit torques can generate magnetic droplet solitions in out-of-plane magnetized geometries. We show that a short, high current pulse followed by a lower constant current can nucleate and stabilize magnetic droplets. Through specific current pulse lengths, it is possible to control the number of droplets in such a system, since torques are generated over a large area. Additionally, the nucleation current scales with the out-of-plane component of the spin polarization and is linear as a function of magnetic field strength.},

We found that the sign of the magnetocrystalline anisotropy constant K 1 changes with increasing annealing temperature for certain FeAlSi compositions. This is caused by a change in the volume balance of the ordered phases with the annealing process and the point at which K 1 ∼ 0 shifts to the Al-rich concentration as the degree of D0 3 -ordering decreases. K 1 was precisely measured by ferromagnetic resonance under the optimal condition, and the value of 1.6 × 10 2 (erg/cc) was obtained, which is comparable to that of bulk. The uniaxial component of the magnetic anisotropy due to magnetostriction was small, and a fourfold symmetric component due to magnetocrystalline anisotropy was dominant.},

  abstract     = {Spin mixing conductance (SMC) at the ferromagnetic/non-magnetic material (FM/NM) interface governs the transport efficiency of the spin current. A high level of SMC is crucial for efficient spin injection and spin manipulation. Here, we report a reliable way to enhance the SMC at the FM/NM interface by rare-earth doping in the NM layer. As evidenced by the decreased saturation magnetization in permalloy (Py)/Cu–Nd structures, an induced magnetism in Nd is proposed, which is likely to be antiferromagnetically coupled to Py at the interface. By changing the doping content of Nd, the Py/Cu–Nd interface can be well designed, which gives rise to an effective tuning of the SMC from 0.37 × 10 15 to 16.26 × 10 15 cm −2 . Such a tuning effect of SMC is suppressed by inserting a Cu spacer, demonstrating the key role of the antiferromagnetically coupled interface to the improved SMC. Our results highlight the significance of rare-earth materials in spin transport, expanding the design capability of energy-efficient spintronic devices.},

The spin waves as well as the acoustic waves are studied by micro-focused Brillouin light scattering spectroscopy. At low magnetic bias fields, a resonant phonon–magnon conversion is possible, which results in the excitation of short-wavelength spin waves. Using micromagnetic simulations, we verify that during this excitation both energy and linear momentum are conserved and fully transferred from the SAW to the spin wave. This conversion can already be detected after an interaction length of a few micrometers. Thus, our findings pave the way for miniaturized magneto-elastic spin-wave emitters for magnon computing.},

Antiferromagnets can accommodate two magnon modes with opposite spin polarizations, which is equivalent to the spin property of electrons. Here, we propose an all-magnonic SG effect in an antiferromagnetic magnonic system, where a linearly polarized spin-wave beam is deflected by a straight Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction (DMI) interface into two opposite polarized spin-wave beams propagating in two discrete directions. Moreover, we observe bi-focusing of antiferromagnetic spin waves induced by a curved DMI interface, which can also spatially separate thermal magnons with opposite polarizations. Our findings provide a unique perspective to understand the rich phenomena associated with antiferromagnetic magnon spin and would be helpful for polarization-dependent application of antiferromagnetic spintronic devices.},

Understanding the thickness scaling limit of these intriguing magnetic properties in NiCo 2 O 4 thin films is critical for their implementation in nanoscale spintronic applications. In this work, we report the unconventional magnetotransport properties of epitaxial (001) NiCo 2 O 4 films on MgAl 2 O 4 substrates in the ultrathin limit. Anomalous Hall effect measurements reveal strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy for films down to 1.5 unit cell (1.2 nm), while T C for 3 unit cell and thicker films remains above 300 K. The sign change in the anomalous Hall conductivity ( σ x y ) and its scaling relation with the longitudinal conductivity ( ⁠ σ x x ⁠ ) can be attributed to the competing effects between impurity scattering and band intrinsic Berry curvature, with the latter vanishing upon the thickness driven metal–insulator transition. Our study reveals the critical role of film thickness in tuning the relative strength of charge correlation, Berry phase effect, spin–orbit interaction, and impurity scattering, providing important material information for designing scalable epitaxial magnetic tunnel junctions and sensing devices using NiCo 2 O 4 .},

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of 5G technology, acoustic wave filters with large bandwidths are urgently required to deal with the explosive increase in data traffic. Recently, there is extensive attention paid to shear-horizontal (SH) surface acoustic wave (SAW) resonators based on lithium niobate (LiNbO 3 ) substrates, thanks to its large effective coupling coefficient ( k 2 eff ). However, because of the bulk acoustic wave (BAW) energy radiation into the LiNbO 3 substrate, it is very challenging to obtain a high quality factor ( Q ) for SH-SAW resonators. In this study, a 30° YX-LiNbO 3 /SiO 2 /Si SAW resonator with the SH mode is proposed to achieve a large coupling and a high Q simultaneously. By bonding a LiNbO 3 thin film onto a thermally oxidized Si(100) substrate, the velocity mismatch between the piezoelectric layer and the SiO 2 /Si substrate could significantly reduce the BAW energy leakage. Finite element method simulation is employed to optimize the cut angle of the LiNbO 3 film and the thickness of each layer. The fabricated SH-SAW resonators with a resonant frequency of 924 MHz yield a k 2 eff of 24.8\% and a maximum of Bode- Q (Bode- Q max ) of 1107. In comparison with the previously reported same-type SAW resonators, a higher Bode- Q max is demonstrated in this work when their k 2 eff is larger than 20\%, providing a potential solution to enable wideband tunable filters in the 5G communication system.},

The distributed electric field from the anode to the outer edge of the ET demonstrates the effectiveness of the ET structure. However, EFISHG also shows that its effectiveness is strongly dependent on the acceptor charge distribution in the ET&#39;s partially compensated layer (PC). A generally lower amount of acceptor charge can be inferred from the measured electric field distribution resulting from excessive ion implantation energy or dose during ET fabrication and causing lower than optimal breakdown voltage. Localized field crowding can be observed when the remaining acceptors uncompensated by the implant in the PC layer are nonuniformly distributed around the periphery of the devices. Important information can be obtained from these direct electric field measurements and used for optimizing the device design and fabrication process.},

Although much progress has been made over the past three decades, today&#39;s CZT crystals still face certain challenges, especially the presence of the performance-limiting materials defects and the associated relatively high production cost. In this regard, Cd x Zn 1−x Te y Se 1−y (CZTS) is emerging as a next-generation compound semiconductor, which overcomes some of the limitations of CZT technology for the stated applications. Here, we conducted a study to evaluate the crystalline quality of the traveling heater method grown CZTS with an optimized alloy composition, i.e., Cd 0.9 Zn 0.1 Te 0.98 Se 0.02 . The as-grown samples were evaluated by low-temperature photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy and high-resolution x-ray diffraction using the synchrotron light source at Brookhaven National Laboratory. The full width at half maximum of both the PL and x-ray rocking curves was observed to be broadened due to the lattice disorder of the quaternary compound, eventually degrading the crystalline quality.

For GaN with intrinsic C doping, which is realized by reducing the V/III ratio, C N mainly exists in the form of C N − charged from the higher concentration of V N and, thus, may attract H + by coulomb interaction. Whereas for the extrinsically C doped GaN with propane as the doping source, the concentration of V N is reduced, and C N mainly exists in neutral charge state and, thus, nearly does not attract H ions.

In this work, we propose a non-Hermitian planar elastic metasurface to achieve unidirectional focusing of flexural waves. The unit cells are constructed by piezoelectric disks and metallic blocks that are asymmetrically loaded. A tunable material loss is then introduced by negative capacitance shunting. By suitably engineering the induced loss profile, a series of unit cells are designed, which can individually access the exceptional points manifested by unidirectional zero reflection. We then construct a planar metasurface by tuning the reflected phase to ensure constructive interference at one side of the metasurface. Unidirectional focusing of the incident waves is demonstrated, where the reflected wave energy is focused from one direction, and zero reflection is observed in the other direction. The proposed metasurface enriches the flexibility in asymmetric elastic wave manipulation as the loss and the reflected phase can be tailored independently in each unit cell.},

This provides the basis for an extrapolation scheme to estimate the reflection probability r r at random grain boundaries, which is relatively small, r r = 0.28–0.39, for Cu, Ag, and Au due to their nearly spherical Fermi surfaces, but approximately two times higher for Al, Ca, Ni, Rh, and Ir with a predicted r r = 0.61–0.72. The metal resistivity in the limit of small randomly oriented grains with fixed average size is expected to be proportional to the materials benchmark quantity ρ o λ × r r /(1 − r r ), where ρ o and λ are the bulk resistivity and bulk electron mean free path, respectively. Cu has the lowest value for this quantity, indicating that all other fcc metals have a higher resistivity in the limit of small randomly oriented grains.

Therefore, understanding the thermal transport between the head and the disk is of great importance. In this paper, we used a non-flying test stage to exclude the strong air cooling caused by the rotating disk and performed the thermal transport experiments across a closing nanoscale air gap on two substrates (silicon wafer and AlMg-substrate disk). The experimental results show that the disk-to-head back-heating from the hot spot on the substrate can be directly measured in the case of the AlMg disk (∼2–10 °C), while the silicon case shows no back-heating due to its high thermal conductivity.

In this study, we focused on electrochemically doped protons inside the TiO 2 thin film as one of the simplest platforms for volatile functions and aimed to clarify the design principle for volatile memories. It was found that the proton volatility from the TiO 2 surface can be controlled by the slow proton diffusion inside a few-nm SiO 2 cap layer, where TiO 2 and SiO 2 can be viewed as a proton container and a sealing cap, respectively. It was further shown that both volatile and nonvolatile protons exist in TiO 2 thin films, and hence, suppressing the influence of the latter would be essential for exploiting functions from volatile protons. These results indicate that simple material stacks with nanoscale thickness can control volatile protons in solid-state devices, providing a basic design principle for volatile memories.},

Adopting heterostructures for these nanocrystals allows tuning of their optical features and enhances their photostability, photoluminescence (PL), quantum yield (QY), and color purity for further device integration. Exchanging of carboxylate capping ligands on top and bottom [001] facets of CdSe NPLs with halide ligands is an alternative to achieve the aims of spectral tunability and improve surface passivation, but to date there have been no reports on integrating the advantages of halide ligand exchanged CdSe NPLs for device fabrication. In this work, we demonstrate green electroluminescence (EL) of bromide ligand-capped CdSe NPLs as active emitters in an electrically driven light emitting diode (LED) with a low turn-on voltage of 3.0 V. We observed EL emission at 533.1 nm with a narrow linewidth of 19.4 nm, a maximum luminance of 1276 cd/m 2 , and the highest external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 0.803\%. These results highlight the ability of halide ligand exchange in tuning the EL properties of CdSe NPL-LEDs and potential of bromide ligand-capped CdSe NPLs in contributing to the green emission region of NPL-LEDs, demonstrating its potential for future device integration and contribution to a high color rendering index of future NPL displays.},

The proposed angular filter consists of a mirror-symmetric heterostructure incorporating two groups of alternatively stacked Si and SiO 2 layers separated by a SiO 2 defect layer. Using the plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition technique, the fabricated DPC can achieve a narrow angular transparency window of ±6° at the near-infrared wavelength. Based on the angular filtration effect, DPC angular filter is further demonstrated to suppress the diffraction phenomenon in the far-field projection imaging. We envision that the proposed angular filter based on DPC has potential applications in lens-less imaging, privacy protection, and beam shaping.},

Information about the enhanced THz field is encoded into the deflected electron beam distribution at various time delays. Using rectangular slits as representative examples, we show that the spatiotemporal distribution of the THz field can be accurately retrieved. Furthermore, the measurement of the beam deflection demonstrates that the field can be enhanced by a factor of 20 in a rectangular slit by synthesis of a pulse train.

Such artifacts are due to the slow convergence of the Fourier series near such features, an effect referred to as the Gibbs phenomenon. While usually viewed as being purely mathematical in origin, the Gibbs phenomenon can often be found in a variety of physical situations, such as in imaging and spectroscopy. In this work, a physical description of the Gibbs phenomenon is presented where it is interpreted as an interference effect whereby slower destructive interference or “Fourier dephasing” occurs near sharp spectral features compared with the Fourier dephasing observed away from such features. Differences in Fourier dephasing can be exploited to localize magnetization near physical boundaries on timescales about an order of magnitude faster than can be achieved using conventional frequency or spatially selective pulses. This localization, which is reversible, also occurs on much faster timescales than can be attributed to irreversible sources, such as restricted diffusion or spatial variations of the intrinsic spin relaxation within the sample.},

This result enables the development of a multi-resolution microscope where multi-scale samples can be explored on different length scales by adjusting only the mask aperture size, without other modifications.

This technique can also be used as a method to analyze and measure the relaxation rate in an atomic vapor cell and offers a SI-traceable imaging approach for the microwave magnetic field. Its simple architecture holds great potential for the development of compact/miniature microwave field sensors.},

  abstract     = {We present the results of a comprehensive investigation of electric and thermal transport properties of polycrystalline Bi-substituted La 0.95− x Bi x Sr 0.05 CoO 3 for LBSCO-0, 1, and 2. The electrical resistivity reflects the semiconducting nature with n-type to p-type transition ∼52 K for LBSCO-1 and LBSCO-2 samples. In the low temperature region, the dominant transport mechanism is found to be variable range hopping with the hopping range decreasing with increasing temperature from 95 to 20 Å. The substitution of higher atomic weight element Bi at the La site drastically affects the overall thermal conductivity by reducing the lattice contribution (∼0.12 W/m-K at 50 K) and also enhancing the Seebeck coefficient ( S ∼ 354 μ V/K). The increase in the resistivity and Seebeck coefficient for the Bi-substituted system is related to the decrease in the available charge carrier concentration (∼5.12 × 10 20 cm −3 ). The overall variation in the Seebeck coefficient depicts a complex nature with a large decreasing trend below 50 K followed by an in-depth analysis of the Debye temperature (∼470 K) and e – ph coupling. These findings suggest that the Bi-substituted LBSCO system has phonon-mediated charge transport via the phonon drag effect below 50 K. Notably, we found a large increment in ZT ∼ 0.17 at room temperature for LBSCO-2 compositions that is one-order larger than pristine undoped LBSCO-0 and even higher than the other existing cobaltite-based thermoelectric choice.},

Spatial resolution and spatial isotropy are two of the most important indexes of a PAM. In this study, we propose a PAM scheme based on an aspheric acoustic mirror group to achieve the subwavelength resolution and enhance the spatial isotropy. The mirror group consists of an ellipsoid acoustic mirror and a parabolic acoustic mirror. The ellipsoid acoustic mirror expands the cone angle of signal collection, and the parabolic acoustic mirror reduces the cone angle of the PA beam. Their combination equivalently expands the numerical aperture of acoustic detection. Phantom experiments demonstrate that the proposed scheme can achieve the subwavelength resolution. Simultaneously, its spatial isotropy is improved from 48.2\% to 96.7\%. An in vivo mouse brain imaging experiment examines the biomedical practicability of the method. This method may be found wide potential applications in biomedicine.},

Based on the plasticity regulated with the spike frequency, a high-pass filter was realized. Flash memory as a special memory model in the nervous system has been simulated in the array.

The threshold voltage shifts positively due to hot electron trapping at the buffer layer under hot-carrier stress. However, the recovery between semi-on (V t 0 V) carrier stress is significantly different. This phenomenon is systematically discussed in terms of the applied gate voltage under stress condition, which affects the occupation of the surface donor states. After applying a semi-on hot-carrier stress, the threshold voltage continues to shift positively after relaxing the applied voltage. In contrast, the threshold voltage exponentially recovers after applying an on-state hot-carrier stress. Silvaco technology computer aided design (TCAD) simulation was performed to verify the effect of the surface donor state on the threshold voltages. Since switching between on-state and off-state in RF-applications includes both conditions, we suggest that the surface donor states are crucial to determine the failure of devices.},

  abstract     = {Ultrasonic energy harvesting has been developed as a promising power solution for implantable medical devices (IMDs) to perform tasks such as diagnosis, therapy, and monitoring. However, most current ultrasonic electronics use toxic lead-based piezoelectric materials (e.g., lead zirconate titanate) as core components and feature bulk or flat structures, representing common barriers to the development of future IMDs that should be eco-friendly and long-term fixation in the implanted position. Here, we present a KNN composite-based lead-free piezoelectric helix for ultrasonic transcutaneous energy harvesting. The device contains multilayer components (a matching layer, lead-free composites, a copper foil, and a Parylene-C film) to form a final self-supporting helix harvester, which can adapt to cylindrical objects (e.g., blood vessels) to maintain fixation. Nanodomain-induced high-performance ( d 33 ∼ 465 pC N −1 ) KNN ceramic was fabricated and further processed into 1–3 composites to enhance electromechanical coupling properties and mechanical flexibility. The developed prototype can be excited ultrasonically to generate adjustable power output up to ∼22.97 mW cm −2 . The generated electricity was stored in capacitors and used to operate light-emitting diodes. Further ex vivo tests showed that the device is still sufficient to support wireless energy transfer through porcine tissues, demonstrating the great potential of the lead-free piezoelectric helix for IMDs.},

Proton irradiation resulted in up to a factor of 2 reduction of minority electron diffusion length in the samples for temperatures between ∼ 300 and 400 K. Electron injection into the samples under test using a scanning electron microscope beam leads to pronounced elongation of diffusion length beyond the pre-irradiation values, thus demonstrating stable (days after injection) recovery of adverse radiation impact on minority carrier transport.

For the substrate of 4 mm in thick at the frequency of 27 GHz, when the substrate thickness equals three-quarters of a wavelength, in variant 2, a sharp increase in μ GMR was observed for a reflected wave. In this case, the relative variations of the reflected wave amplitude under the application of a magnetic field reached 44\%, whereas, in all other cases, the variations did not exceed 5\%–8\%.

Access to the local physical processes involved in these nanosystems during their operation is, therefore, crucial. We show how electric fields in real nanodevices can be studied under working conditions using operando electron holography. A specific sample preparation method was first developed to bias electron-transparent nanodevices extracted from production lines while ensuring their electrical connectivity and functionality without employing dedicated probe-based holders. Metal–insulator–metal nanocapacitors were prepared using this approach based on focused ion beam circuit modification. Operando electron holography allowed the electric potential to be quantitatively mapped in the active areas, and between devices, while biasing the devices in situ . Experimental results were compared with finite element method modeling simulations to determine local electrical parameters. We demonstrate that electrical properties, such as capacitance and surface charge density, can be measured at the nanoscale and have been preserved by our sample preparation methodology when compared to macroscopic measurements.

The electrical conductivity and Curie temperature of LSMO films are enhanced by bending stresses. The resistivity of u -shape bended LSMO decays three times faster than that of n -shape bended LSMO as a response to the same magnitude of strain. The asymmetric magnetic states in uniaxially strained LSMO are attributed to the dual actions of Jahn–Teller distortion and strain gradient mediated flexoelectric fields in an adjacent ferroelectric layer.

Magnetotransport measurements for the device at magnetic fields applied perpendicular to the nanosheet plane show dominantly weak antilocalization (WAL) characteristics at low fields and a linear magnetoresistance (LMR) behavior at high fields. We attribute the WAL characteristics to strong spin–orbit interaction (SOI) and the LMR to the classical origin of strong disorder in the nanosheet. Low-field magnetoconductivity measurements are also performed and are analyzed based on the multi-channel Hikami–Larkin–Nagaoka theory with the LMR correction being taken into account. The phase coherence length, spin relaxation length, effective 2D conduction channel number, and coefficient in the linear term due to the LMR in the nanosheet are extracted. It is found that the spin relaxation length in the Bi 2 O 2 Te nanosheet is several times smaller than that in its counterpart Bi 2 O 2 Se nanosheet, and thus, an ultra-strong SOI is present in the Bi 2 O 2 Te nanosheet. Our results reported in this study would greatly encourage further studies and applications of this emerging narrow-bandgap semiconductor 2D material.},

  abstract     = {We use in situ high-pressure neutron powder diffraction to study elastic properties of Fe 3 O 4 magnetite nanoparticles of different sizes. It is found that nanoparticles are elastically softer than the bulk. Apart from the smallest nanoparticle of diameter 8 nm, the atomic and magnetic structures do not change significantly with nanoparticle size or pressure. The 8 nm sample appears to take a disordered spinel structure instead of the inverse spinel structure of the bulk and larger nanoparticles, as seen in bond lengths and magnetic structures. Synchrotron x-ray total scattering was used to support this interpretation. Furthermore, this study suggests that the influence of magnetic disorder at the nanoparticle surface is significant for the size of 8 nm.},

A study of their capacitance vs temperature showed that the Pt/Al:HfO 2 /Pt had a relative dielectric permittivity of 23.30 ± 0.06 at room temperature with a temperature coefficient of capacitance (TCC) of 78 ± 86 ppm/°C, while the TiN/Al:HfO 2 /TiN had a relative dielectric permittivity of 32.28 ± 0.14 at room temperature with a TCC of 322 ± 41 ppm/°C. The capacitance of both devices varied less than 6\% over 1 to 1000 kHz from −125 to 125 °C. Both capacitors maintained loss tangents under 0.03 and leakage current densities of 10 −9 –10 −7 A/cm 2 between −125 and 125 °C. The TiN/Al:HfO 2 /TiN capacitor maintained an energy storage density (ESD) of 18.17 ± 0.79 J/cm 3 at an efficiency of 51.79\% ± 2.75\% over the −125 to 125 °C range. The Pt/Al:HfO 2 /Pt capacitor also maintained a stable ESD of 9.83 ± 0.26 J/cm 3 with an efficiency of 62.87\% ± 3.00\% over the same temperature range.

The recent discovery of 3D magnetic field sensing through the single spin–orbit torque device consisting of the Ta/CoFeB/MgO heterostructure, based on the domain wall motion, offers a revolutionary way to tackle this problem. Here, we demonstrate a 3D magnetic field sensor based on the W/CoFeB/MgO heterostructure via domain nucleation dominated magnetization reversal. In such a heterostructure, the in-plane (IP) and out-of-plane (OOP) magnetic field components drive the grains reversal with different manners, enabling the distinguishment of the contributions from IP and OOP components. The linear modulations of anomalous Hall resistance by x , y , and z components of magnetic fields have been obtained, respectively, with the same linear range of −20 to +20 Oe for each component. Typically, a higher linearity is realized in this work compared with the previous domain wall motion based sensor, which is a critical characteristic for the magnetic field sensor.},

Thin films of (001)-oriented Mn 3 NiN have their chiral antiferromagnetic structure located in the (111) plane facilitating the anomalous Nernst effect unusually in two orthogonal in-plane directions. The sign of each component of the anomalous Nernst effect is determined by the local antiferromagnetic domain state. In this work, a temperature gradient is induced in a 50 nm thick Mn 3 NiN two micrometer-size Hall cross by a focused scanning laser beam, and the spatial distribution of the anomalous Nernst voltage is used to image and identify the octupole macrodomain arrangement. Although the focused laser beam width may span many individual domains, cooling from room temperature to the antiferromagnetic transition temperature in an in-plane magnetic field prepares the domain state, producing a checkerboard pattern resulting from the convolution of contributions from each domain. These images together with atomistic and micromagnetic simulations suggest an average macrodomain of the order of 1 μ m 2 .},

To study such physical properties, Fe 3 Sn 2 epitaxial films without buffer layers are in urgent need. In this work, we fabricated the Fe 3 Sn 2 epitaxial films without buffer layers using the facing-target magnetron sputtering method, and their magneto-electronic transport properties were investigated systematically. It is found that the sign of the Hall resistivity slope in a high-field region is reversed when the temperature decreases below 100 K, suggesting a temperature-induced transition of charge carriers from electrons to holes. Moreover, a non-negligible topological Hall resistivity subtracted from the anomalous Hall resistivity is depicted, and its value is comparable to that of the Fe 3 Sn 2 single crystals. These results not only offer a clear understanding of ferromagnetic Fe 3 Sn 2 films with the kagome lattice but also provide guidance for fabrication and application of epitaxial Fe 3 Sn 2 films.},

The phononic crystal plate design is first validated by studying the basic AA- and AB-stack configurations under weak interlayer coupling. A specific commensurate twist angle giving rise to the sublattice exchange even symmetry is then studied to examine the twist-modulated band structure. Finally, this study demonstrates that the same twist angle, in concert with an ultra-strong interlayer coupling, can collectively create valley-dependent edge states that have not been previously observed in electronic bilayer graphene.},

Stabilizing the metastable ferroelectric phase in hafnia-based ferroelectrics is critical for realizing technological applications. Interface engineering is a critical method to stabilize the ferroelectric phase. However, the role played by the interface between the metal electrode and the hafnia-based ferroelectrics oxide remains unclear. In this work, a typical Hf 0.5 Zr 0.5 O 2 (HZO) ferroelectric oxide film sandwiched between the metal electrode and the silicon substrate was fabricated with and without the interfacial layer. By using the in situ transmission electron microscope, the atomistic structure evolution of the HZO film ferroelectric phase was studied under electrical stimuli. It is found that the phase transition from ferroelectric (FE) orthorhombic phase (O-phase) to dielectric monoclinic phase (M-phase) occurs from the interface between the HZO and the metal electrode. While in the one with Al 2 O 3 as an interfacial layer between the HZO and the metal electrode, the FE O-phase could remain without phase transition.

Based on our recent development of hexagonal boron nitride (BN) semiconductor thermal neutron detectors with a record high efficiency of 59\%, we report here the feasibility studies of BN detectors for detecting fast neutrons. A BN detector with a detection area of 2.1 cm 2 was fabricated from a 90 μ m thick BN epilayer. In the presence of a bare Cf-252 source emitting fast neutrons ranging from 1 to 9 MeV, the detection efficiency was estimated to be about 0.1\%. The measured mean free path of fast neutron in BN is about 7.6 cm. Together with the capability of BN for thermal neutron detection, the present results indicate that by incorporating BN with a large thickness, BN neutron detectors are expected to possess the unique capability of directly detecting thermal to fast neutrons as well as outstanding features resulting from the ultrawide bandgap of BN. The identification of a single material that is sensitive to both thermal and fast neutrons is valuable for the development of novel neutron detection technologies.},

  abstract     = {Aiming at a fundamental understanding of the defect chemistry of pure ZnSe for optical and quantum applications, systematic density functional theory calculations with hybrid exchange-correlation functionals were performed to build an accurate database of native defects in ZnSe, including isolated defects and first nearest-neighbor defect–defect complexes. From the defect formation energies, zinc vacancy is found to be the most prevalent defect as the Fermi level approaches the conduction band edge, while zinc interstitial in the selenium tetrahedron and selenium vacancy become the most prevalent defects as the Fermi level approaches the valence band maximum. The divacancy complex, consisting of first nearest-neighboring zinc and selenium vacancies, is also found to have a favorable binding energy across the entire bandgap. Its formation energy is, however, always higher than either the isolated zinc or selenium vacancy, meaning it will never be the predominant defect in equilibrium. Finally, a point defect with extended spin coherence in Fluorine-implanted ZnSe was recently discovered, and it was found to exhibit a broad emission peak centered at 2.28 eV. The identity of this defect was determined to be either zinc vacancy or its associated complex according to the electron paramagnetic resonance measurements. Explicit simulations of the optical signatures of all zinc vacancy-related native defects were conducted here, showing that both zinc vacancy and divacancy are the most likely native defect contributors to that peak.},

A high breakdown voltage of 1.74 kV and a low specific on-resistance (R ON,sp ) of 5.04 mΩ cm 2 are achieved for the fabricated SBD with a spatial distance (L AC ) of 15 μ m. Benefiting from the optimized groove anode technique, including a low-damaged etching process and a post-anode-annealing process, a low leakage current of 87 nA/mm at −500 V as well as a low turn-on voltage of 0.8 V defined at an anode current density of 1 mA/mm are obtained. Holes induced by polarization effects at the GaN/AlGaN interface inject to the anode edge at the ON state, and the negatively charged centers induced by a groove etching process are neutralized, which lead to the suppressed tunneling current (I TU ) and idealized ideality factor (η). The forward current density decreases due to the suppressed I TU at the barrier-limited region. When the devices are biased at the OFF state, holes around cathodes inject to the buffer layer, which suppress hole emission at the buffer layer, and current collapse is greatly suppressed even after a 300-s-long bias test at −600 V.},

  abstract     = {Flow control is a highly relevant topic for micromanipulation of colloidal particles in microfluidic applications. Here, we report on a system that combines two-surface bound flows emanating from thermo-osmotic and diffusio-osmotic mechanisms. These opposing flows are generated at a gold surface immersed into an aqueous solution containing a photo-sensitive surfactant, which is irradiated by a focused UV laser beam. At low power of incoming light, diffusio-osmotic flow due to local photo-isomerization of the surfactant dominates, resulting in a flow pattern oriented away from the irradiated area. In contrast, thermo-osmotic flow takes over due to local heating of the gold surface at larger power, consequently inducing a flow pointing toward the hotspot. In this way, this system allows one to reversibly switch from outward to inward liquid flow with an intermittent range of zero flow at which tracer particles undergo thermal motion by just tuning the laser intensity only. Our work, thus, demonstrates an optofluidic system for flow generation with a high degree of controllability that is necessary to transport particles precisely to desired locations, thereby opening innovative possibilities to generate advanced microfluidic applications.},

  abstract     = {Hexagonal (h) BN is a semiconductor that crystallizes in layers of a two-dimensional honeycomb structure. Since hBN exhibits high quantum efficiency (QE) near-band edge emission at around 5.8 eV in spite of the indirect bandgap, hBN has a potential for the use in deep-ultraviolet light emitters. For elucidating the emission dynamics of indirect excitons (iXs) in hBN, spatially and temporally resolved luminescence measurements were carried out on hBN epilayers grown using carbon-free precursors. In addition to major μ m-side flat-topped (0001) hBN columnar grains, sub- μ m-scale polytypic segments were identified, which were likely formed by certain growth instabilities. The hBN domains exhibited predominant emissions of phonon-assisted fundamental iXs at 5.7–5.9 eV and a less-pronounced 4.0-eV emission band. The photoluminescence lifetime ( ⁠ τ PL ⁠ ) for the iX emissions was 54 ps, which most likely represents the midgap recombination lifetime ( ⁠ τ MGR ⁠ ) for an iX reservoir. Because τ PL did not change while the cathodoluminescence (CL) intensity increased with temperature above 100 K, both the immobile character of iXs and strong exciton–phonon interaction seem significant for procreating the high QE. The CL intensity and τ PL of the 5.5 eV band monotonically decreased with temperature, indicating that τ PL represents τ MGR ⁠ , most probably a nonradiative lifetime, around the real states. Equally significant emissions at 6.035 eV at 12 K and 6.0–6.1 eV at 300 K were observed from the polytypic segments, most probably graphitic bernal BN, which also exhibited negligible thermal quenching property.},

Furthermore, a monolayer flake topography is confirmed by atomic force microscopy. Photoluminescence and Raman line-scanning characterization indicate the bandgap changes continuously from center (1.46 eV) to edge (∼1.61 eV) within a monolayer flake. Electronic devices based on this spatially composition-graded material exhibit tunable transfer curves. First principal calculation reveals that the electron affinity increases, while the bandgap decreases based on tellurium composition. This is consistent with experimentally observed non-monotonic dependence of the hole current on tellurium composition. This work provides the experimental groundwork for synthesis of the composition-graded transition metal dichalcogenide materials and offers a route toward tailoring their electrical properties by bandgap engineering in the future.},

  abstract     = {Far-UVC light can enable virus-deactivation while remaining harmless to human tissues. This triggered great efforts to create far-UVC light sources with sufficient emission power and efficiency. However, current sources, such as mercury lamps, KrCl excimer lamps, and LEDs, are made from hazardous chemicals or are limited by low efficiency. Consequently, an alternative approach for reaching the far-UVC is now receiving renewed interest: using phosphors for converting higher frequencies to the desired range of far-UVC. However, this concept is limited by the phosphor&#39;s conversion efficiency. In this paper, we propose to utilize principles of nanophotonics to create far-UVC sources. Specifically, we design a phosphor-dielectric multilayer that increases the efficiency of far-UVC light conversion and controls the intrinsic emission properties, including the angular spectrum and emission rate, by shaping the local density of photonic states. To exemplify our approach, we design an aperiodic multilayer nanostructure made of the phosphor material YPO 4 :Pr 3+ , showing an increase in light extraction by a factor of 3 compared to naïve bulk structures. Our approach can be applied to any phosphor material and any emitter geometry, opening avenues for engineering nanophotonic light sources in the far-UVC and other spectral regimes.},

Herein, we study the polarization dependence of photoluminescence (PL) properties from fab-compatible nanophotonic structures, comprising arrays of ultrathin (20 nm) silicon carbide nanowires (NWs) doped with oxygen and erbium ions. Polarization-resolved PL studies demonstrate a significant excitation polarization anisotropy (∼0.7) of the visible NW PL for light polarized parallel and perpendicular to the NWs&#39; long axis. This anisotropic behavior agrees with our simulations and with the classical dielectric contrast model and is consistent across the investigated periodicity range of the NW arrays. Furthermore, the effect of this anisotropy on the NW carrier dynamics is explored through power-dependence and transient PL measurements. We have observed a faster carrier lifetime for light polarized parallel to the NWs than the perpendicular polarization. Finally, we demonstrate a translation of this polarization dependence to the technologically significant erbium-induced 1540 nm emission from the erbium centers in the NW arrays. The ability to engineer emission polarization and placement of these centers in the NW array offers a promising platform for emission enhancement of telecom emitters through effective coupling to optical nanocavities for applications in chip-scale photonics and quantum photonics.},

Here, we report the laser cooling of the 7.5\% Yb 3+ -doped LuLiF 4 crystal down to 121 K reaching NIST&#39;s designated range of cryogenic temperatures (&lt;123 K). Further results based on the cooling window indicate a promising cooling limit of 59 K, provided with enhancement in pump absorbance and heat load management of the sample. Our work, therefore, can motivate an all-solid-state optical refrigeration application beyond the liquid nitrogen boiling point, thus bringing great opportunity to realize cryogenic coolers and radiation-balanced lasers in miniaturized systems.},

Although the dielectric constant of dielectric polymers can be improved by adding high contents of ceramic fillers, this approach comes at the expense of the breakdown strength ( E b ). This work is inspired by the idea that high-aspect-ratio fibers can induce a larger electric dipole moment without sacrificing too much E b compared to zero-dimensional nanoparticles, thereby effectively improving the energy storage performance of the composites. We synthesized antiferroelectric AgNbO 3 (ANO) fibers by using an in situ topotactic transition reaction which were then introduced into the polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) matrix for energy storage applications. The results show that the nanocomposite film with an ultralow loading of 0.4 wt.\% ANO fibers achieves a high discharge energy density of 12.97 J cm −3 at 490 MV m −1 . Nanocomposites based on ultralow content ANO fibers show great promise as one-dimensional antiferroelectric fillers for high energy density capacitor applications.},

In order to further optimize perovskite films, an ionic conducting polymer containing diblock-polymers of polyethylene oxide (PEO) 150 –polyphenylene oxide (PPO) 30 and alkali metal salts of KBr was incorporated into perovskite films. The hydrophilic PEO blocks will coordinate with polar cations and form uniform heterostructure interfaces to passivate defects at grain boundaries (GBs). The transport of alkali metal ions in polymers will increase the conductivity of perovskite films. The synergistic effects of polymers and KBr can significantly enhance the photovoltaic response. The entirely functionalized perovskite GBs can also improve the tolerance of perovskite films against environmental stress. Aside from that, the glycine solution was deposited onto SnO 2 films to passivate interface defects and further improve device performance. The improved charge transport dynamics and the suppressed charge recombination kinetics were determined using different characterization techniques. The optimized photoelectric conversion efficiency is 22.89\% (a V OC of 1.166 V, a J SC of 24.30 mA cm −2 , and a FF of 0.808) under a reverse scan.

The mechanical stability of textile devices is vital for their sustainable utilization in daily life. Herein, a NiCoB based in-plane textile device with excellent electrochemical and mechanical performances is achieved via combining screen printing and electroless deposition strategies. The upper layer of NiCoB with a continuous micro-balls structure can effectively disperse the central stress under bent state, well protecting the bottom Ni coating. Thus, the two-layer structure ensures the electric and electrochemical stability even suffering a mechanical loading. At the same time, the NiCoB is capable of providing considerable energy storage performance with a high capacitance of 883.3 mF cm −2 under 5 mV s −1 . Coupling with a synthesized ZIF-C negative material, the in-plane micro-supercapacitor (MSC) also exhibits great performances in both energy storage and mechanical stability. It can deliver a specific capacitance, a power density, and an energy density of 155.3 mF cm −2 , 1.09 mW cm −2 , and 42.27 μ Wh cm −2 , respectively, while sustaining a 1000 bending cycle with little capacity decay. This flexible in-plane MSC textile can be a powerful candidate for future integrated smart garments and will provide some enlightenment in developing composited textile devices with perfect mechanical performance.},

  abstract     = {What precludes lowering the supply voltage and overall power consumption of the transistor is the infamous Boltzmann tyranny, a fundamental thermionic limit preventing the subthreshold slope (SS) of the transistor from being lower than 60 mV dec −1 at room temperature (RT). Internal voltage amplification through the use of an additional threshold switch (TS) serially connected to the transistor channel has been shown to be highly effective to break the Boltzmann barrier. This approach, however, is typically heterogeneous by employing TS materials that are foreign to the transistor. Recently, semiconducting tellurium (Te) has gained considerable research interest for its use as an emerging low-dimensional p-type channel material with high hole mobility, air-stability, and the ability to be processed at near ambient temperature. In this work, we unveil a hidden advantage of Te for a steep-slope transistor in which Te serves as the channel material and the TS material at the same time. In a homogeneous and compact device architecture, RT-SS lower than 30 mV dec −1 can be achieved. This is enabled by a combination of unique electrical–electrochemical–thermal properties in Te. This work augments the functionality of Te and provides a low-power transistor solution.},

The theoretical calculations and finite element analysis results indicate that the P3HT/WO 3 interface plays a key role in device fatigue failure at variable temperatures. As the temperature dropped from 100 to −30 °C, a significant decrease in the loosely adsorbed polymer chains and flattened chains occurs at the P3HT/WO 3 interface and thus leads to the deterioration of the P3HT/WO 3 interface. The weak P3HT/WO 3 interfacial bonding substantially accelerates the crack propagation under low-temperature flexural cycles, which will ultimately cause the device to deteriorate.

Temperature stable 0.65 CaTiO 3 –0.35 LaAlO 3 microwave dielectric ceramic of high permittivity was utilized for fabricating the H-shaped dielectric patch, and the method of leveraging the multi-modal features of DPA was introduced. Further analysis of the antenna structure was accomplished by the simplified theoretical method. As a result, the H-shaped notch is properly ensembled in the dielectric patch to make the higher-order TM 121 mode close to the dominant TM 101 mode, greatly expanding the broadband of the HDPA. The accuracy of the proposed HDPA element model is evaluated by the commercial full-wave simulator CST Microwave Studio.

A narrow optimal range of the HfO 2 sublayer thickness was required to achieve facile crystallization into a tetragonal phase, followed by orthorhombic phase transformation through sufficient Al diffusion. Because the Al 2 O 3 sublayer cannot be completely dissolved, it should be as thin as possible so that it can easily agglomerate to provide an effective connection between the HfO 2 sublayers during the PMA process. When stabilizing the ferroelectric phase of HfO 2 films by mixing with dopants with limited solubility, the thicknesses of the HfO 2 and Al 2 O 3 sublayers in the nanolaminated form were revealed to be more critical than the nominal doping concentration inferred from their thickness ratios (ALD cycle ratios).},

  abstract     = {In many microwave dielectric ceramics systems, like MgTiO 3 –CaTiO 3 , MgTiO 3 –SrTiO 3 , and tri-layer MgTiO 3 /TiO 2 /MgTiO 3 , the resonant frequency shows a non-linear variation over a wide temperature range (−40 – 105 °C), indicating that the negative τ f (−40 – 25 °C) value deviates from zero when the positive τ f (25–105 °C) value is tuned to zero. To suppress the non-linear variation of resonant frequency in the range of −40 – 105 °C, a well-established and efficacious method has been proposed by introducing Li 2 Ti 0.85 (Mg 1/3 Nb 2/3 ) 0.15 O 3 ceramic to the MgTiO 3 system. Furthermore, a tri-layer architecture ceramic was designed to improve the dielectric properties. Compared with randomly distributed samples, the Q × f value can be increased by up to 51\%. Moreover, the electric field distribution was simulated by the finite element method with the aid of the eigenmode solver of high frequency structure simulator (HFSS) to clarify the dielectric mechanism and predict the microwave dielectric characteristics of the tri-layer structure ceramics. Finally, tri-layer Li 2 Ti 0.85 (Mg 1/3 Nb 2/3 ) 0.15 O 3 /MgTiO 3 /Li 2 Ti 0.85 (Mg 1/3 Nb 2/3 ) 0.15 O 3 ceramic with wide temperature stability and high Q × f value was obtained [ε r = 18.4, Q × f = 85 000 GHz, τ f + = −3.8 ppm/°C (25–105 °C), τ f − = 4.0 ppm/°C (−40 – 25 °C)], which refines the theory of non-linear variation of resonant frequency and holds promise for application in the 5G communication system.},

  abstract     = {Perpendicular magnetization switching driven by spin–orbit torques plays an increasingly important role for spintronic devices toward practical applications but is also hindered by the well-known technical challenge that an external in-plane magnetic field is required for deterministic switching. Here, we show that the deterministic switching can be achieved in synthetic antiferromagnets through the flexible domain control in the absence of external magnetic fields. Specifically, we have observed that the domain wall (DW) distorts under an applied electric current in contrast to the conventional rigid DW motion in a single ferromagnet. More importantly, the distorted DWs can be precisely controlled under zero magnetic field, leading to the deterministic switching. Our results indicate that the critical technical challenge may be addressed by employing a synthetic antiferromagnetic layer through the DW motion dominated field-free switching.},

Acoustic analogs of electronic topological insulators have brought a lot of new opportunities for manipulating sound propagation and have attracted the attention of many scholars. A variety of artificial acoustic systems hosting topological edge states have been proposed. However, the pseudo-spin edge states at a boundary have not been clearly and intuitively characterized. In this article, we provide experimental verification of pseudo-spin states by the method of acoustic particle manipulation by using the rotation of the particle to describe the pseudo-spin sound field characteristics at the boundary of the acoustic topological insulator in detail. It indicates the existence of pseudo-spin–orbit coupling effects and pseudo-spin-related acoustic unidirectional transmission even if the defect exists. Furthermore, the pseudo-spin sound field can be used to control the rotation of multiple particles and droplets. This kind of topological acoustic tweezer with defect immunity has great application potential in the fields of biomedicine and materials science.},

Here, we report calculations of the in-plane thermal conductivities of monolayer amorphous carbon and monolayer amorphous boron nitride, by reverse nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. We find that the thermal conductivities of both monolayer amorphous carbon (MAC) and monolayer amorphous boron nitride (ma-BN) are about two orders of magnitude smaller than their crystalline counterparts. Moreover, the ultralow thermal conductivities are independent of the temperature and strain due to their extremely short heat carrier mean free paths. The relation between the structure disorder and the reduction of the thermal conductivity is analyzed in terms of the vibrational density of states and the participation ratio. The ma-BN shows strong vibrational localization across the frequency range, while the MAC exhibits a unique extended G * diffuson mode due to its sp 2 hybridization and the broken E 2 g symmetry. The irregular vibrational patterns are also analyzed. The present results may enable potential applications of MAC and ma-BN in thermal management.},

The edge dislocations were annihilated during the epitaxial process on the PSS to afford a low surface dislocation density, which was in accordance with the results of transmission electron microscopy and cathodoluminescence spectroscopy. Furthermore, a reduced Fermi level and enhanced activation efficiency of Mg with suppressed segregation around the dislocations were demonstrated by Kelvin probe force microscopy and contact Hall measurements, respectively.

However, the ubiquitous defects in 2D TMDCs greatly affect the optoelectronic properties of them. For example, the prototype molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ) exhibits very poor photoluminescence (PL) due to the high defect density. Here, we report a defect repair strategy based on a facile one-step chemical vapor deposition method that achieves two orders of magnitude enhancement in photoluminescence (PL) and one order of magnitude prolonging in carrier lifetime. Interestingly, we can controllably synthesize Ga-doped samples with different morphologies by adjusting the ratio of precursors, and the PL intensities at the central and edge regions are quite different. Combined with scanning transmission electron microscopy characterization, we systematically elucidate this growth behavior and obtain a more precise defect repair strategy. This strategy of selectively repairing the defects of monolayer MoS 2 by gallium doping to achieve significant enhancement of photoluminescence may provide a facile and feasible method for the regulation of optoelectronic properties of 2D materials.},

Fabrication of Janus structures in a deterministic fashion is essential for their practical heterogeneous integration, which, however, remains challenging in the aspect of material synthesis technology. Here, we demonstrate a synthetic strategy to fabricate Janus WSSe structures at definite positions on its tungsten disulfide (WS 2 ) host through the local electron beam irradiation followed by controllable selenization. We show that the energetic electron flux can significantly modulate the WS 2 lattice properties, which locally increase the energy barrier between the WS 2 and its Janus counterpart WSSe, thus preventing the irradiated WS 2 from being selenized and creating well-defined hetero-boundaries. Moreover, by using monolayer and bilayer WS 2 as the hosts, both lateral and vertical heterostructures of WSSe–WS 2 can be achieved in a patternable manner. Our work provides a viable route toward the controllable fabrication of the Janus structures for multi-functional spintronics.},

Although interesting, the previously studied 3D topological elastic structures are fixed after fabrication and thus cannot adapt to changes in the external environment or operating conditions. This lack of reconfigurability limits potential performance and functionality. In this Letter, we advance the state of the art by proposing a programmable 3D topological metamaterial that can be tuned adaptively via carefully designed metastability. A metastable switching methodology is developed that enables the synthesis of multiple unique topological states in a 3D mechanical structure. By taking advantage of the adaptivity of the proposed metamaterial, the path of 2D topological surface states is on-demand controlled, a bilayer-locked topological state is discovered, and 3D elastic wave networks with advanced filtering and splitting capabilities are realized. The findings presented in this Letter offer insight into how topology can be used to control the flow of energy in 3D elastic structures. Furthermore, the advanced functionalities of the proposed metamaterial could be harnessed to create intelligent and robust devices for various purposes, such as mechanologic, vibration mitigation, energy harvesting, and remote sensing.},

Both approaches are incompatible with the ultimate objective of developing compact mode-selective sources powered by single emitters. In addition, the implementation of highly desirable functionalities, such as controllable distribution of guided modes between multiple detectors, becomes challenging in highly compact devices due to photon loss to reflections. Here, we demonstrate that a linearly polarized dipole-like source can selectively excite a topologically robust edge mode with the desired valley degree of freedom. Reflection-free routing of valley-polarized edge modes into two spatially separated detectors with reconfigurable splitting ratios is also presented. An optical implementation of such a source will have the potential to broaden the applications of topological photonic devices.},

We experimentally characterize nucleate boiling heat transfer performance on silicon surfaces custom-fabricated with controlled microstructures using HFE-7100 as the working fluid. We then undertake an analytical prediction of the microlayer evaporation from the microstructured surface. A clear dependence of the measured boiling heat transfer coefficients from microstructures of different dimensions on the predicted evaporation heat transfer coefficients allows us to conclude that microlayer evaporation governs the boiling enhancement from microstructured surfaces.},

Herein, we achieve the fabrication of a chlorine(Cl)-based non-covalent graphene analog stabilized by copper(Cu) adatoms on Cu(111) through an easy-to-facilitate self-assembly approach, as demonstrated by the combination of scanning tunneling microscopy imaging and density functional theory calculations. Moreover, the Cu adatoms are found to uniformly distribute within such a non-covalent graphene analog, which is inaccessible for covalent ones and shows potential for stabilizing the non-covalent graphene analog as well as modulating its overall electronic properties. Such findings exemplify the construction of non-covalent graphene analogs with a large area by a more effective self-assembled approach in contrast to the previous atomic manipulation method.},

We re-evaluate the use of a generalized Siegert relation in different device regimes. A full two-time quantum-optical theory is derived as a reference for obtaining first- and second-order correlation functions g ( 1 ) ( τ ) and g ( 2 ) ( τ ) in the steady state. We find that even in the partially coherent regime, the generalized Siegert relation is well suited as an approximation to g ( 2 ) ( τ ) as long as emitter correlations are negligible but does not apply well in the quantum regime of few-emitter nanolasers or to devices featuring sub- and super-radiant emission.},

  abstract     = {Optical levitation in vacuum has been proved as a promising platform for precision measurement and research on microscopic thermodynamics and the macroscopic quantum system. The performance of these applications is highly determined by the detection of the trapped particle&#39;s displacement, which is linked with the detection signal through a calibration coefficient. However, it is still a challenge to get the calibration coefficient in medium vacuum. Here, we present a nonlinear method to obtain the calibration coefficient with high accuracy to fill the pressure gap between 5 × 10 − 3 and 50 mbar. By averaging the trajectory segments with the same initial displacement, we analyze the relationship between the nonlinearity induced frequency shift and the amplitude, where the calibration coefficient can be obtained without a priori knowledge about mass and temperature of the trapped particle or the assistance with external force. We further apply this method to detect the mass and density of the trapped nanoparticle and observe the mass variation under different pressures. Therefore, it will pave the way to study the physical processes in medium vacuum based on the precision measurement of nanoparticle&#39;s mass, density, and other properties.},

Although breakthroughs have been made in terms of device performance in recent years, the power conversion efficiency is still far from the Shockley–Queisser limit. It is mainly attributed to the poor charge transport and abundant defects, which deteriorate the fill factor and result in grievous open-circuit voltage loss. Here, we improved the device performance through a synergetic approach: (i) by introducing ZnSnO 3 as the second electron transport layer, the current leakage was effectively reduced, and the charge extraction was enhanced; then, (ii) the prepared Sb 2 S 3 films were treated via a low-temperature and short-time post-treatment with thiourea, which significantly suppressed the carrier recombination and increased the open-circuit voltage. More importantly, we systematically analyzed the trap features of the Sb 2 S 3 films with/without treatment, mainly including the trap density, trap level, and trap capture cross section. We found that defects near the surface due to elemental inhomogeneity by the hydrothermal method could be effectively passivated, and defect-assisted recombination was suppressed after the thiourea treatment.},

The key issue of CsPbX 3 perovskites is their instability under light or exposure to air. Notably, the inherent phase instability of CsPbI 3 QDs severely restricts the development of red-light emission. Herein, we propose a simple method to post-process CsPbBr 3 QDs with a ZnI 2 solution. The prepared CsPbBr y I 3−y (named CPBI- z , where z corresponds to the photoluminescence peaks&#39; position) QDs exhibit adjustable photoluminescence in the range of 550–640 nm. The photoluminescence quantum yield is increased from 73.3\% to 97.2\% as the surface defects of QDs are passivated by I − and Zn 2+ . Compared with the pristine CsPbBr 3 QDs, the post-processed QDs are more stable under ultraviolet irradiation and in the air. Aside from that, under 532 nm nanosecond laser excitation, CPBI- z QD films exhibit excellent amplified spontaneous emission performance. The CPBI-640 QD film shows a low threshold, 102 μ J cm −2 for red stable amplified spontaneous emission.},

At the longer wavelengths associated with the mid-infrared, dramatic changes in the optical response of traditional nanophotonic materials, reduced efficiency optoelectronic active regions, and a host of deleterious and/or parasitic effects makes nano-scale optoelectronics at micro-scale wavelengths particularly challenging. In this Perspective, we describe recent work leveraging a class of infrared plasmonic materials, highly doped semiconductors, which not only support sub-diffraction-limit plasmonic modes at long wavelengths, but which can also be integrated into a range of optoelectronic device architectures. We discuss how the wavelength-dependent optical response of these materials can serve a number of different photonic device designs, including dielectric waveguides, epsilon-near-zero dynamic optical devices, cavity-based optoelectronics, and plasmonic device architectures. We present recent results demonstrating that the highly doped semiconductor class of materials offers the opportunity for monolithic, all-epitaxial, device architectures out-performing current state of the art commercial devices, and discuss the perspectives and promise of these materials for infrared nanophotonic optoelectronics.},

  abstract     = {In general, mixed modes and dispersion of guided wave occur at any excitation frequency, while single modes are needed for effective nondestructive evaluation of structures. In this work, we present an approach to generate a selective single-mode guided wave in plate-like structures by exploiting the unique directionality of the d 36 type piezoelectric wafer and the symmetry of fundamental guided wave modes. Specifically, we devise a unified fundamental shear horizontal (SH 0 ) wave/fundamental antisymmetric mode (A 0 ) wave directional transducer pair by attaching the d 36 type piezoelectric wafers back to back on the opposite sides of the plate to provide selective, directional single-mode guided waves for actuation and sensing. Originally, the d 36 -type piezoelectric wafer, poled and cut from the lead magnesium niobate-lead titanate crystal, produces a mixture of the in-plane SH 0 (symmetric) mode and out-of-plane A 0 (asymmetric) and S 0 (symmetric) modes. By applying the in-phase or out-of-phase applied electrical field to the coupled d 36 -type piezoelectric wafer pair, our devised approach generates selective single modes, SH 0 or A 0 , respectively, to propagate in the structure. We describe the theoretical development of our approach and conduct both numerical simulations and laboratory experiments for validations.},

The demonstration of hot-carrier solar cells (HCSCs), another high-efficiency approach that relies on harvesting the kinetic energy of the photo-generated carriers, has so far been hindered due to the difficulty of mitigating carriers&#39; thermalization. In this letter, we highlight the synergies of these two concepts by introducing the hot-carrier multi-junction solar cell (HCMJSC), a MJSC with a thin hot-carrier top junction. Using a detailed balance model, we compare the efficiency of different devices as a function of three parameters: the bandgap of the top and bottom junctions, the top cell thickness, and an effective thermalization coefficient, which encapsulates information on both thermalization and light trapping. Besides allowing for a much broader range of material combinations than MJSCs, we show that HCMJSCs can reach efficiencies higher than MJSCs with a larger thermalization coefficient than HCSCs. As such, HCMJSCs could provide a preferred route toward the development of hot-carrier-based high efficiency devices.},

By correlating the ADS to device thermal budget, we propose an analytical model to calculate the ADS limited mobility as a function of Al diffusion lengths (L D,Al ) in AlGaN/(AlN/)GaN HEMTs.

Atomic force microscopy tapping and conductive tip mode analyses reveal a very flat film with low roughness (0.2 nm RMS) with a high homogeneity of surface conductivity matching the best reference samples grown by sputtering. We finally evaluate its behavior in full MTJ spin valves, using a reference spin analyzer to highlight that the ALD grown layer is, indeed, spin polarized and can act as a functional spintronics electrode.

The strain in the device is measured when an electric field is applied for varying ALD thicknesses, displaying a non-monotonic dependence with a maximum strain achieved for a coating thickness of 3 nm. To understand this behavior, we apply finite element modeling to the smallest repeatable unit of the nanoporous template and simulate the mechanical response as a function of PZT coating thickness. We find that this non-monotonic response is caused by the interplay between two driving forces opposing one another. First, increased porosity works toward increasing the strain due to a reduced system stiffness. Second, decreased porosity involves a larger mass fraction of PZT, which drives the electro-mechanical response of the structure, thus leading to a larger strain. The balance between these two driving forces is controlled by the shear coupling at the CFO/PZT interface and the effective PZT cross section along the direction of the applied electric field. Our numerical results show that considering a nonlinear piezoelectric response for PZT leads to an improved agreement with the experimental data, consistent with ex situ poling of the nanostructure prior to magnetic measurements.},

The proposed noninvasive EEG sensors based on nanocomposites consisting of single-wall carbon nanotube random networks incorporated into a gelatin matrix exhibited a relatively low contact impedance of 11.16 × 10 2 Ω and a high sensitivity of 14.81 dB regardless of existing hair for real-time EEG recording without conductive gels or electrolytes. Furthermore, the origin of such advances induced by the soft and conductive electrode array is investigated by analyzing the effective contact area and signal-to-noise ratio on different scalp positions from 20 different subjects. A trapezoidal EEG electrode penetrates the dense hair and bypasses the hair shaft owing to its deformable shape induced by the soft and flexible nanocomposite film.},

  abstract     = {Extended investigations on 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) have opened sound possibilities to apply these materials in several technological fields such as sensing. To this end, fully reproducible methods for the wafer-scale production of crystalline and uniform 2D TMDCs are in demand. In this work, atomically thin MoSe 2 was grown by atmospheric-pressure chemical vapor deposition using the Na-assisted process with Se powder and Mo foil precursors on a glass substrate. The samples were extensively characterized via Raman and photoluminescence spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The MoSe 2 samples consist of submillimeter, monolayer single-crystals with 2H phase configuration. Being monolayer and crystalline, the samples exhibit well-defined and intense photoluminescence. CVD-grown 2D MoSe 2 was integrated into a device with strain-tunable optical properties and tested. Under tensile strain (in the range of 0.2\%–0.4\%), the spectral emission responded to an in-plane strain with marked peak shifts toward lower energies for increasing levels of strain (∼3 and ∼2 nm shift for the main PL component at 0.2\% and 0.4\%, respectively), indicating a reduction of the bandgap.},

The computational cost for a real defective system with more than thousands of atoms is considerably high. Here, we propose a framework to accurately predict the formation energy of defective 2D materials, graphene and molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ), at a large scale, by combining deep learning techniques and density functional calculations. To improve the training performance of deep learning models, a multi-layer structure descriptor using chemical bond parameters is proposed. For the defective graphene (MoS 2 ) over 300 nm 2 (650 nm 2 ), the calculated mean absolute error for the formation energy is less than 47 meV (53 meV) per 1000 atoms. This study provides a practical solution for the accurate and rapid description of large-scale defective 2D materials.},

In this Letter, Mn-doped CsPb(BrCl) 3 IPQDs with a cubic structure have been synthesized by the hot injection method. What make us excited is that the photoluminescence properties of a fixed ensemble of Mn-doped CsPb(BrCl) 3 IPQDs systematically depend on the varying concentration. This experimental phenomenon can be well explained by the quantitative model based on photon reabsorption. The results combining experiments with theoretical models indicate that the photon reabsorption is of paramount importance in the analysis of the luminescence properties of colloidal quantum dots especially at high concentrations. Further analysis based on time-resolved fluorescence and transient absorption spectroscopy reveals the effect of the solution concentration on the Mn-doped CsPb(BrCl) 3 IPQD exciton dynamics. The results suggest that exciton energy transfer can take place both inside and between IPQDs and also can be enhanced by increasing the concentration of a Mn-doped CsPb(BrCl) 3 IPQD solution. These results are of great significance to accurately interpret and control the luminescence properties of IPQDs.},

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional (2D) Janus materials have attracted the interest of scholars due to their asymmetric structure and unique physical properties. Recently, the 2D Janus MoSiGeN 4 based on MoSi 2 N 4 has been predicted. Here, the structure, electronic character, and carrier mobility of a bilayer in different stacks are investigated using the first-principles calculations. The results show that the dipole moment perpendicular to the x-y plane plays a dominant role in regulating the bandgap, which can be supported by the difference in vacuum energy levels between the two sides of the material. The layer stack has a dramatic effect on the bandgap, which is reduced to 0.57 eV for a bilayer structure. Further exploration of the electronic structure reveals that the bilayer energy band exhibits the type II energy band alignment, which is beneficial for the separation of photogenerated carriers. The bilayer boosts electron mobility by an order of magnitude to 58 522.3 cm 2 V −1 s −1 for the monolayer. The results demonstrate the potential of the bilayer MoSiGeN 4 for photocatalytic water splitting and electronic devices.},

In this work, we performed angle-dependence of magnetization and electron spin resonance (ESR) investigations on the CSL host Yb(Ni 1− x Cu x ) 3 Al 9 with x = 0.06 (YNCA). The angle-dependent magnetization reveals a peculiar variable magnetic anisotropy. The maximum magnetization axis is parallel to the ab -plane below the field of ∼35.7 kOe while shifts to the c -axis at higher fields. The microwave responses of the CSL helicoid and ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) of the forced ferromagnetic state (FFM) are observed and appear as two resonance lines on ESR spectra with the highest intensities in the ab -plane. When the external field is rotated from H ⊥ c to H / / c ⁠ , the resonance field H r 1 corresponding to the CSL helicoid decreases while H r 2 correlated with the FMR increases. Furthermore, the temperature-dependent ESR shows that the CSL persists until 15 K much higher than T C (6.4 K), which suggests a precursor phenomenon. The microwave response in YNCA provides a powerful tool for modulating and researching the CSL.},

  abstract     = {Higher-order topological insulators as an exotic type of topological phases harboring fascinating topological corner or hinge states have attracted extensive attention recently. Dislocations are crystallinity-breaking defects in lattices that cannot be removed by local deformations due to nontrivial real-space topology. It is recently realized that dislocations can be used as a probe for higher-order topology. In this work, we propose a scheme to obtain acoustic dislocation states by introducing screw dislocations into higher-order topological insulators in a Kagome lattice. The topological dislocation states carry nonzero orbital angular momentum, which are locked to their propagation direction. We show that the screw dislocation states exist for both the tight binding model and the waveguide model as long as the system symmetry is preserved. By delicately designing the dislocation core, the dislocation states with selective angular momentum can be shifted into the bulk bandgap. Based on this in-gap dislocation states, filtering of acoustic vortex with a selective angular momentum is well achieved.},

A thermally accelerated electron-releasing process of traps was quantitatively studied by Laplace ODLTS with individual emission time constant disclosed. At 300 K, the emission time constant was determined to be 0.21 and 1.40 s for E2 and E3, respectively, which adjacently existed in the bandgap and held activation energies of over 0.6 eV. As varying the optical injection pulse duration, a three-dimensional mapping of capacitance transient was obtained for each trap, attesting to the electron capture capability of each trap.

  abstract     = {The two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor lead iodide (PbI 2 ) has recently attracted considerable attention owing to its favorable properties in both applications as photodetectors and as a precursor for lead halide perovskite solar cells. Although earlier experiments have investigated the structural stability of PbI 2 below 20 GPa, the electric structures at high pressure remain ambiguous, as does the crystal structure at higher pressures. Herein, a structural phase transition and a semiconductor-metal transition are revealed in PbI 2 through high-pressure femtosecond optical pump-probe spectroscopy combined with Raman spectra, synchrotron x-ray diffraction (XRD), and resistance measurements up to 70 GPa. Two discontinuities appear in the pressure-dependent amplitude of the ultrafast spectroscopy at approximately 24.8 and 37.6 GPa. Raman spectra and in situ XRD patterns confirm a structural phase transition from orthorhombic Pnma to tetragonal I4/MMM symmetry at the first discontinuity. The second discontinuity is ascribed to the closure of the bandgap and the enhanced electron-phonon interaction across the semiconductor-metal transition, which is also revealed by the temperature dependencies of resistance for PbI 2 under pressure. Our results not only help to design optical devices based on lead iodide but also highlight that ultrafast spectroscopy is an efficient noncontact tool to investigate the crystalline and electric phase transition under pressures simultaneously.},

  abstract     = {(001) β-Ga 2 O 3 homoepitaxy on commercially available large-size (001) β-Ga 2 O 3 substrates remains a significant challenge for the wide bandgap semiconductor community. In this Letter, high-quality homoepitaxial (001) β-Ga 2 O 3 films were grown via metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) with the assistance of an in situ indium surfactant, where the growth modes and mechanisms were also elucidated. During the growth of β-Ga 2 O 3 , an etching process occurred by the desorption of the suboxide Ga 2 O, resulting in rough surface morphology with streaky grooves oriented along the [010] direction. It is postulated that the parallel grooves were associated with the surface desorption and anisotropic diffusion characteristics of β-Ga 2 O 3 . To suppress the desorption, indium surfactant was introduced into the growth environment. A 2D-like growth feature was prompted subsequently by the coadsorption of In and Ga atoms, accompanied by relatively smooth surface morphology. The crystal quality had no degradation despite the incorporation of indium in the epitaxial film. The O II peak of the β-Ga 2 O 3 film shifted ∼0.5 eV toward higher binding energy due to an increasing number of oxygen vacancies originating from the indium incorporation. This work provides a systemic investigation on the growth of high-quality (001) β-Ga 2 O 3 homoepitaxial films by MOCVD, which is critical for the development of β-Ga 2 O 3 electronic devices for future power switching and RF applications.},

The heterostructure exhibited an electron Hall mobility of 7224 cm 2 /V s at 32 K, which is more than one order of magnitude higher than the best value reported for this structure. From a comparison with the value of 134 m 2 /V s for a structure with a multi-domain 3C layer, we attribute the high mobility to single-domain formation. The nearly constant sheet carrier density of ∼1.5 × 10 13 cm −2 in the temperature range from 34 to 573 K and the high mobility suggest that conduction occurred in a two-dimensional electron gas.

  abstract     = {Oxygen in single crystalline antimony triselenide (Sb 2 Se 3 ) is addressed by infrared (IR) absorption spectroscopy. Measurements conducted on Sb 2 Se 3 samples doped—during growth, post-growth annealing in the O 2 ambient, or by O ion implantation—with 16 O reveal an IR absorption line at 527 cm −1 (10 K). Substitution of 16 O by 18 O “red”-shifts the signal down to 500 cm −1 based on which the line is assigned to a local vibrational mode of an isolated oxygen defect. Annealing of O-enriched samples in hydrogen atmosphere at temperatures above 380 °C results in the suppression of the 527-cm −1 line and concurrent appearance of the signals due to hydroxyl groups, suggesting formation of oxygen-hydrogen complexes. The configuration of the 527-cm −1 oxygen center is discussed.},

In this work, we propose and develop a composition gradient engineering approach that breaks inversion symmetry into inorganic halide perovskites with strong spin–orbit coupling. We synthesize epitaxial CsPbBr x Cl (3− x ) with Br/Cl composition gradient by a two-step chemical vapor deposition approach. Through optoelectronic measurements, we show the presence of circular photogalvanic effects (CPGEs), evidencing a Rashba-like spin polarized band structure. By spatially resolved photoluminescence spectra, we find that the observed CPGE is likely a cumulative result of inversion symmetry-broken interfaces featured by abrupt and stepwise composition gradient between the pristine and separated daughter phases. Our work suggests an avenue in engineering the spintronic property of halide perovskites for information processing.},

However, pushing the concept of the geometric phase toward the acoustic community still faces challenges. In this work, we utilize two acoustic nonlocal metagratings that could support a direct conversion between an acoustic plane wave and a designated vortex mode to obtain the acoustic geometric phase, in which an orbital angular momentum conversion process plays a vital role. In addition, we realize the acoustic geometric phases of different orders by merely varying the orientation angle of the acoustic nonlocal metagratings. Intriguingly, according to our developed theory, we reveal that the reflective acoustic geometric phase, which is twice the transmissive one, can be readily realized by transferring the transmitted configuration to a reflected one. Both the theoretical study and experimental measurements verify the announced transmissive and reflective acoustic geometric phases. Moreover, the reconfigurability and continuous phase modulation that covers the 2π range shown by the acoustic geometric phases provide us with the alternatives in advanced acoustic wavefront control.},

On the other hand, a seemingly irrelevant phenomenon of Tamm mode, a defect mode caused by elaborately introducing perturbation into the trivial structures, has also attracted enormous interest. In this Letter, we bridge the gap between acoustic Tamm mode and its correlation rule with typical topological acoustic mode. Starting from the 1D acoustic cavity-based SSH model, the topologically protected edge modes in a complete bandgap are achieved. Through modulating the height of boundary cavity, we find two types of Tamm edge modes both numerically and experimentally and grasp their distinct variation tendency from the topologically protected edge modes. Furthermore, we extend the study to 2D higher-order topological acoustic systems and the lower-dimensional Tamm corner modes are clearly observed. We foresee that the multi-frequency sound confinement introduced by the Tamm localized modes may open a revealing landscape for acoustic functional devices.},

Even if we prepare the surface of lithium metal rigorously by chemical cleaning and mechanical polishing inside a glovebox, both spectroscopic investigations show the existence of a few tens of nanometer-thick surface layers, consisting of lithium oxides and lithium carbonates. When lithium metal is exposed to room air (∼50\% moisture), in situ real-time monitoring of optical spectra indicates that the surface layer grows at a rate of approximately 24 nm/min, presumably driven by an interface-controlled process. Our results hint that surface-layer-free lithium metals are formidable to achieve by a simple cleaning/polishing method, suggesting that the initial interface between lithium metal electrodes and solid-state electrolytes in fabricated lithium metal batteries can differ from an ideal lithium/electrolyte contact.},

Here, we demonstrate proton transport in an aqueous medium across a 2D cubic Ti 2 C membrane, a representative defective MXene, from ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. We observe bidirectional translocation of protons, which occurs through the interstitial vacancies in the surface. We show from our simulations that water dissociates on the membrane and the dissociated proton moves into the interstitial sites in the membrane. The proton hops from interstitial-to-interstitial and transports across the membrane. We also show that this interstitial proton transport is associated with an induced electric field that is modulated with bidirectional transport of protons across the membrane.},

Despite advances in preparing, characterizing, and analyzing optoelectronic performance of cracked template networks, limited efforts have focused on predicting how their disordered structures help to determine their electrical and optical properties and explain their interrelationships. We introduce a geometric modeling approach for crack-templated networks and use simulation to compute their wavelength- and incident angle-dependent optical transmittance and sheet resistivity. We explore how these properties relate to one another and to those of metallic meshes with periodically ordered aperture arrays. We consider implications of the results for optoelectronic applications, compare figure-of-merit predictions to experimental data, and highlight an opportunity to extend the modeling approach using inverse methods.},

  abstract     = {Surface phonon polaritons (SPhPs) are important building blocks of nanophotonics, as they enable strong light–matter interaction on the nanoscale, are well-suited for applications in the mid- to far-infrared regime, and can show low losses. SrTiO 3 is an interesting material for SPhPs, because it allows for reversible, nonvolatile doping with free charge carriers via oxygen vacancies and for local switching with conductive AFM tips. As a result, SrTiO 3 could enable programmable nanophotonics with tunable SPhPs and direct writing of metasurfaces. Surface polariton properties can be determined by mapping their real-space propagation using scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM), which is sensitive to the high local electric fields with nanoscale lateral resolution. Low-confinement (LC) SPhPs with wavevectors close to that of free-space radiation, such as in SrTiO 3 and the model polar dielectric SiC, can be difficult to investigate in s-SNOM due to interference effects with the incident illumination and fringe spacings exceeding the scan range or the size of the focus spot. Here, we present s-SNOM measurements of LC-SPhPs on SiC and SrTiO 3 launched at gold stripes, retrieve physical quantities such as launching amplitude and phase, and show that they are influenced strongly by gold stripe geometry as well as illumination angle. Using two complementary measurements, we show a convenient way to determine the out-of-plane angle of the s-SNOM setup. Finally, we predict how control over the free charge carrier concentration in SrTiO 3 could enable tunable LC-SPhPs, showing the potential of SrTiO 3 for programmable nanophotonics.},

In this Letter, we present an experimental scheme for motionless synthesis and scanning of lattice light sheets using a single digital micromirror device. By fully exploiting its ability of complex amplitude modulation and fast switching, single-shot construction of a uniform lattice light sheet can be achieved by digital dithering. In particular, fast scanning of the lattice light sheet in the depth direction is also realized without any mechanical motion. As a proof of concept, various lattice light sheets are generated and characterized in the experiments.

  abstract     = {Size-controllable micro-droplets obtained in microfluidic cross-junctions are significant in microfluidics. Modeling and predictions in microfluidic-based droplet formation characteristics to date using various traditional theoretical or empirical correlations are far from satisfactory. Driven by unprecedented data volumes from microfluidic experiments and simulations, statistical learning can offer a powerful technique to extract data that can be interpreted into underlying fluid physics and modeling. This Letter historically combines the current experimental data and experimental/numerical data from previous publications as a microfluidics-based droplet formation characteristics database. Two supervised statistical learning algorithms, deep neural network and factorization-machine-based neural network (Deep-FM), were established to model and predict the formed droplet size in microfluidic cross-junctions. As a newly developed statistical learning code in 2017, the Deep-FM manifests a better prediction performance, where the average relative error was only 4.09\% and nearly 98\% of the data points had individual relative errors of 10\% or less. Such high accuracy can be attributed to the outstanding interactions between high-order and low-order features of the Deep-FM framework. Another innovation in this Letter lies in the training dataset shrinkage and optimization without sacrificing the prediction accuracy. Such a method pioneers statistical learning algorithms in small-sample modeling problems, which is different from big data modeling and analyses. The improved statistical learning proposed in this Letter provides universal high-accuracy modeling for microfluidic-based droplet characteristics prediction, which can be an influential data-processing framework that can boost and probably transform current lines of microfluidic physics research and industrial applications.},

The SRR provides a factor of 100 in the enhancement of the E-field measurement sensitivity. Using electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) with Aulter–Townes splitting, E-field measurements down to 5 mV/m are demonstrated with the SRR, while in the absence of the SRR, the minimal detectable field is 500 mV/m. We demonstrate that by combining EIT with a heterodyne Rydberg atom-based mixer approach, the SRR allows for a sensitivity of 5.5 μ V/m Hz ⁠ , which is two-orders of magnitude improvement in sensitivity than when the SRR is not used.},

The causes of CRS behavior are analyzed in detail, and these phenomena are attributed to the different oxidation degrees of the top electrode and propose that the transition state can be used as a signal for the emergence of CRS behavior. Moreover, the model is partially supported by measured switching behavior of the Pt/AlO x N y /TaO x device.

Although field-effect doping and charge doping have been demonstrated to manipulate the electronic properties of graphene derivatives, using these strategies to achieve nanoscale control remains a challenge. Herein, we developed a strategy for in situ triggering metallicity in semiconductor 3D graphene films (GFs) by building 1D wrinkles. Moreover, the controllable engineering of wrinkles represents a feasible way to realize the manipulation of 1D metallic states with characteristic width ranging from nanoscale to mesoscale. The global metallicity is achieved in GFs by constructing wrinkle percolation networks. The idea of in situ triggering metallicity in semiconducting graphene demonstrates potential application in high-power nanoelectronics. A striking case is that in situ constructing 1D metallic wrinkle provides a promising candidate as the metallic wire interconnects in all-carbon electronics.},

  abstract     = {Ferroelectric tunnel junctions (FTJs) are promising candidates for the next-generation memory technologies. The electroresistance mechanism, however, has been reported not only from the polarization-modulation of barrier profiles. Electrical migration of charged defects has also been observed as a possible origin for the resistive switching. Here, we achieve two kinds of electroresistance behaviors in Pt/Pb(Zr,Ti)O 3 /(La,Sr)MnO 3 tunnel junctions by introducing oxygen vacancies in the Pb(Zr,Ti)O 3 barrier. The oxygen vacancies are observed by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and their effects on the widely adopted piezoresponse force microscopy characterizations of ultrathin ferroelectric films have been analyzed by AC voltage-dependent hysteresis loops. For the Pt/Pb(Zr,Ti)O 3 /(La,Sr)MnO 3 device that is modulated by the polarization reversal, a counterclockwise resistance–voltage ( R – V ) relationship is observed due to the tunneling between high and low barriers, whereas the R – V hysteresis loop is changed to clockwise with the existence of oxygen vacancies, in which conductive filaments are formed in the Pb(Zr,Ti)O 3 barrier. However, such an ionic electroresistance is not stable during repetitive switching. Further investigation on memristive behaviors is, thus, performed on the ferroelectric-controlled Pt/Pb(Zr,Ti)O 3 /(La,Sr)MnO 3 tunnel junctions. An excellent linearity is achieved in continuous resistance change owing to the nucleation-limited-switching mode of domain switching in the Pb(Zr,Ti)O 3 barrier, giving rise to spike-timing-dependent plasticity behaviors for the Hebbian rule of learning and memory. These results provide insight into the distinguishing of ferroelectric and ionic contributions in electroresistance of FTJ devices, facilitating deep understanding of nonvolatile resistive memories.},

A frequency resonance is observed at which reversible trapping of gold nanoparticle “clouds” occurs in the gap center, producing almost a 1000-fold increase in density. Through accounting for gold cores surrounded by a conducting double layer ion shell, a simple model accounts for this reversibility. This suggests that substantial control over nanoparticle separation is possible, enabling the formation of equilibrium nanoarchitectures in specific locations.},

The PEDOT:PSS film conductivity was improved from 0.3 to 1287 S/cm through double treatments with cosolvent of formamide and methanol. The enhancement of conductivity is because of reduced insulating PSS and the change of PEDOT chain conformational.

In the unidirectional floating-film transfer method (UFTM), thin floating films of uniaxially aligned π-conjugated polymers are solidified at the air/liquid interface before transferring them onto device substrates. Therefore, packing structures in the films prepared by UFTM are not affected by the strong interactions with the device substrate as usually seen in other film growth methods. Here, one question arises: will the difference in interactions between the liquid substrate and air impact the orientational structure of the polymer chain near the two surfaces or not? To answer this question, we have studied the charge-transport anisotropy in top- and bottom-gate OFETs by changing the film thickness. As a result, the field-effect carrier mobility and its anisotropy did not significantly differ for both surfaces and were constant against the film thickness. These results indicate that the UFTM can provide unidirectional alignment of polymer chains throughout the film thickness and gives a similar superior performance either for a bottom- or a top-gate OFET.},

We measured both the in-plane and vertical carrier transport in the tBLG/ h -BN van der Waals (vdW) tunneling device. The moiré periods were determined from the in-plane carrier transport measurements. The observed vertical tunneling transport characteristics indicated that resonant tunneling occurs from the graphite electrode to tBLG through localized defect states in the h -BN tunnel barrier. We observed multiple defect-assisted resonant tunneling trajectories, from which we derived the density of states (DOS) for tBLG. The obtained DOS has broad flatband features, in qualitative agreement with the theoretical predictions. Furthermore, we obtained three types of DOS, suggesting that we probed local band structures corresponding to AA, AB/BA, and domain wall sites in tBLG. Thus, defect-assisted tunneling spectroscopy has potential as a tool to determine the local band structures in twisted 2D vdW materials.},

  abstract     = {Magnetoresistance measurements were performed on a 30 nm-thick SnTe quantum well (QW) grown by molecular beam epitaxy on the BaF 2 substrate in the temperature range of 1.9–50 K. The weak antilocalization (WAL) effect was observed at low temperatures and low magnetic fields as a result of the strong spin–orbit coupling present in the QW. Using the Hikami–Larkin–Nagaoka equation, we analyzed the experimental data and found that the WAL effect is not purely 2D but composed of 2D and 3D channels that exist within the QW structure. The spin–orbit and phase coherence mechanisms are also extracted, and a general view of the transport properties of the QW is also provided.},

  abstract     = {Recently, the C 2 N monolayer with an optical bandgap of 1.96 eV has emerged as a novel two-dimensional material for modern optoelectronic devices. Herein, we report its bandgap modulation by using a simple bilayer formation that includes the application of an electric field and strain. We identify four energetically favorable bilayer configurations (AA-, AB-, AB′-, and Min-stacking) by using a hybrid functional, obtaining a calculated bandgap of 1.3–1.6 eV. When subjected to a perpendicular electric field up to 4 V/nm, the bandgap decreases by as much as 0.5 eV, which correlates with the increasing energy of the valence-band maximum, where the N- p x and N- p y states shift closer to the N- p z state. Without the electric field, the bandgap decreases when the interlayer distance is contracted by a compressive strain. We express the strain (or interlayer distance) and the physical applied pressure via the stabilized jellium equation of state. For the Min-stacking configuration, the bandgap decreases from 1.75 to 0.9 eV upon applying a pressure of 35 GPa. The strain-induced reduction in the bandgap is similarly monitored under an applied electric field. Our theoretical work suggests that the electric field and strain (or applied pressure) can be used to tune the electronic properties of the bilayer C 2 N.},

Upward pointing polarization slightly depletes the concentration near the top interface, whereas downward polarization causes V O drift toward the top interface. The V O redistribution after wake-up is consistent with shifts in the I–V switching peak.

Temperature-dependent studies of the refractive index and the optical bandgap as well as in situ high-resolution x-ray diffraction measurements prove a ferroelectric–ferroelectric phase transition in the range between 250 and 300 °C. The experimental results strongly suggest that the high-temperature phase exhibits a distorted orthorhombic a 1 /a 2 crystal symmetry, with the electric polarization vector lying exclusively in the plane. A second phase transition was observed at about 500 °C, which presumably signifies the transition to the paraelectric phase.

  abstract     = {Considerable interest to magnetism of MnAs both in bulk or in the form of epitaxial films is stimulated by its applications as a magnetocaloric material and in spintronic devices. Since the MnAs films deposited on GaAs reproduce well a magnetic transformation related to α – β magnetostructural transition that occurs in bulk MnAs, this first-order phase transition occurs through a phase coexistence over a wide temperature range. Here, we considered the same magnetostructural transition in a bulk hybrid structure based on micrometer-scaled MnAs inclusions embedded into the Cd 3 As 2 matrix. In particular, the effect of high pressure and magnetic fields on the ferromagnetic transition temperature, T C , in a composite Cd 3 As 2 + 30 mol.\% MnAs has been studied. We found that at ambient pressure, the transition from α -MnAs to β -MnAs is accompanied by the absence of thermal hysteresis of magnetization, implying a phase coexistence regime. The hysteresis width does not markedly increase even at pressures about P = 0.35 GPa, and displacement of T C occurs with a rate of dT C / dP ∼ −91.42 K/GPa. In the temperature region of the α – β phase coexistence, a local peak at T = 283 K and P = 1 GPa is observed, which is associated with an antiferromagnetic order of MnAs inclusions. Direct measurements of isothermal magnetization vs pressure indicate both the stabilization of the ferromagnetic hexagonal α phase at P &lt; P max and the development of an orthorhombic antiferromagnetic long-range order, which propagate up to 5 GPa.},

Although magnon energies are generally much larger than phonon energies, until now their electronic band renormalization effect in 3 d ferromagnets suggests a significantly weaker quasiparticle interaction. Using spin- and angle-resolved photoemission, we show an extraordinarily strong renormalization leading to two-branch splitting of an iron surface resonance at ∼200 meV. Its strong magnetic linear dichroism unveils the magnetic nature and momentum dependence of the energy renormalization. By determining the frequency- and momentum-dependent self-energy due to generic electron–boson interaction to compute the resultant electron spectral function, we suggest that the surface-state splitting can be described by strong coupling to an optical spin wave in an iron thin film.},

By combining the exchange-bias effect along with THz emission, the photo-induced THz switching is observed without any applied magnetic field.

X-ray diffraction, magnetization, and electrical transport measurements show that the deposition at high substrate temperatures induces the crystallized structures of CMG, while the resistivity of the CMG films on YIG (GGG) prepared at and above 500 °C (550 °C) becomes too high to measure the thermo-spin and magneto-thermoelectric effects due to large roughness, highlighting the difficulty of fabricating highly ordered continuous CMG films on garnet structures. Our lock-in thermography measurements show that the deposition at high substrate temperatures results in an increase in the current-induced temperature change for CMG/GGG and a decrease in that for CMG/YIG. The former indicates the enhancement of the anomalous Ettingshausen effect in CMG through crystallization. The latter can be explained by the superposition of the anomalous Ettingshausen effect and the spin Peltier effect induced by the positive (negative) charge-to-spin conversion for the amorphous (crystallized) CMG films. These results provide a hint to construct spin-caloritronic devices based on Heusler alloys.},

By monitoring the temporal evolution of the interaction of light with coherent acoustic phonons, also known as Brillouin oscillations, phonon lifetime and optical absorption can be measured. However, the extraction of these quantities can be inaccurate due to the common assumption of the infinite coherence length of probe pulses. Here, we demonstrate the effect of probe pulse duration on picosecond ultrasonic measurements numerically and experimentally. We establish a model that shows how the probe coherence length affects the measured signal loss and how we can overcome this limitation and measure an upper limit of the acoustic attenuation factor. The model is verified experimentally on a GaAs bulk substrate by varying the probe pulse duration, showing a strong effect for sub-100 fs pulses. Finally, we applied to CH 3 NH 3 PbBr 3 , where we reveal a high acoustic attenuation factor, which is in line with recent claims of strong anharmonicity in halide perovskites.},

  abstract     = {The key obstacle toward realizing integrated gallium nitride (GaN) electronics is its low hole mobility. Here, we explore the possibility of improving the hole mobility of GaN via epitaxial matching to II–IV nitride materials that have recently become available, namely, ZnGeN 2 and MgSiN 2 . We perform state-of-the-art calculations of the hole mobility of GaN using the ab initio Boltzmann transport equation. We show that effective uniaxial compressive strain of GaN along the [ 1 1 ¯ 00 ] by lattice matching to ZnGeN 2 and MgSiN 2 results in the inversion of the heavy hole band and split-off hole band, thereby lowering the effective hole mass in the compression direction. We find that lattice matching to ZnGeN 2 and MgSiN 2 induces an increase in the room-temperature hole mobility by 50\% and 260\% as compared to unstrained GaN, respectively. Examining the trends as a function of strain, we find that the variation in mobility is highly nonlinear; lattice matching to a hypothetical solid solution of Zn 0.75 Ge 0.75 Mg 0.25 Si 0.25 N 2 would already increase the hole mobility by 160\%.},

  abstract     = {We report on the absence of strain relaxation mechanism in Al 0.6 Ga 0.4 N epilayers grown on (0001) AlN substrates for thickness as large as 3.5 μ m, three-orders of magnitude beyond the Matthews–Blakeslee critical thickness for the formation of misfit dislocations (MDs). A steady-state compressive stress of 3–4 GPa was observed throughout the AlGaN growth leading to a large lattice bow (a radius of curvature of 0.5 m −1 ) for the thickest sample. Despite the large lattice mismatch-induced strain energy, the epilayers exhibited a smooth and crack-free surface morphology. These results point to the presence of a large barrier for nucleation of MDs in Al-rich AlGaN epilayers. Compositionally graded AlGaN layers were investigated as potential strain relief layers by the intentional introduction of MDs. While the graded layers abetted MD formation, the inadequate length of these MDs correlated with insignificant strain relaxation. This study emphasizes the importance of developing strain management strategies for the implementation of the single-crystal AlN substrate platform for III-nitride deep-UV optoelectronics and power electronics.},

A typical bottom-gated single layer In 2 O 3 FET with maximum on-state current (I ON ) of 890 μ A/ μ m at V DS = 0.8 V and an on/off ratio over 10 6 is achieved with a channel length (L ch ) of 100 nm. The effects of HfO 2 capping and O 2 annealing are systematically studied, which is critical to realizing the multilayer FETs. Each atomically thin In 2 O 3 channel layer with a thickness (T IO ) of 0.9 nm is realized by atomic layer deposition (ALD) at 225 °C. Multilayer FETs with a number of In 2 O 3 layers up to 4 and 1.2 nm-thick HfO 2 between each individual layer are fabricated. An enhancement of on-state current (I ON ) from 183 μ A in a single layer In 2 O 3 FET to 339 μ A in a 4 layer device with an on/off ratio of 3.4 × 10 4 is achieved, demonstrating the key advantage of the multilayer FETs to improve the current. Several critical features, such as large-area growth, high uniformity, high reproducibility, ultrathin body, flexibility, and BEOL compatibility, have turned ALD In 2 O 3 into a noteworthy candidate for next-generation oxide semiconductor channel materials.},

  abstract     = {GeSn alloys are a promising emerging complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor compatible technology for applications in photonics and electronics. However, the unavoidable intrinsic compressive strain introduced during epitaxial growth has prevented researchers from pushing the performance of GeSn devices to the limit and realizing real-world applications. In this paper, we present a straightforward geometric strain-inversion technique that harnesses the harmful compressive strain to achieve beneficial tensile strain in GeSn nanowires, drastically increasing the directness of the band structure. We achieve ∼2.67\% uniaxial tensile strain in ∼120 nm wide nanowires, surpassing other values reported thus far. Unique pseudo-superlattices comprising of indirect and direct bandgap GeSn are demonstrated in a single material only by applying a periodic tensile strain. Improved directness in tensile-strained GeSn significantly enhances the photoluminescence by a factor of ∼2.5. This work represents a way to develop scalable band-engineered GeSn nanowire devices with lithographic design flexibility. This technique can be potentially applied to any layer with an intrinsic compressive strain, creating opportunities for unique tensile strained materials with diverse electronic and photonic applications.},

  abstract     = {In this Letter, the effects of trap states in AlN/GaN superlattice channel HEMTs (high electron mobility transistors) under total ionizing dose with γ-irradiation have been systematically investigated. After 1 Mrad γ-irradiation with a dose rate of 50 rad/s, negative drifts in threshold voltage and C – V characteristics are observed. Simultaneously, the two-dimensional electron gas sheet density of the upper channel increases from 5.09 × 10 12 to 5.47 × 10 12 cm −2 , while that of the lower channel decreases from 4.41 × 10 12 to 3.86 × 10 12 cm −2 , respectively. Furthermore, frequency-dependent capacitance and conductance measurements are adopted to investigate the evolution of trap states in an electron channel. The trap state density ( D T = 0.21–0.88 × 10 13 cm −2 eV −1 ) is over the E T range from 0.314 to 0.329 eV after irradiation for the upper channel, while the trap state in the lower channel decreases from 4.54 × 10 11 cm −2 eV −1 at E T = 0.230 eV to 2.38 × 10 11 cm −2 eV −1 at E T = 0.278 eV. The density (1.39–1.54 × 10 11 cm −2 eV −1 ) of trap states with faster τ T (0.033–0.037 μ s) generated in a lower channel is located at shallower E T between 0.227 and 0.230 eV. The results reveal the mechanism of trap states in the channel, affecting the performance of HEMTs, which can provide a valuable understanding for hardening in space radiation.},

To date, activation studies of implanted Ga in Ge have focused on high densities. Here, we extend activation studies into the low-density regime. We use spreading resistance profiling and secondary ion mass spectrometry to derive electrical activation of Ga ions implanted into Ge as a function of the rapid thermal anneal temperature and implant density. We show that for our implant conditions, the activation is best for anneal temperatures between 400 and 650 °C with a maximum activation of 69\% at the highest fluence. Below 400 °C, remaining implant damage results in defects that act as superfluous carriers, and above 650 °C, surface roughening and loss of Ga ions are observed. The activation increased monotonically from 10\% to 69\% as the implant fluence increased from 6 × 10 10 to 6 × 10 12 cm −2 . The results provide thermal anneal conditions to be used for initial studies of using low-density Ga atoms in Ge as nuclear spin qubits.},

MgVO 3 undergoes V–V dimerization at 500–550 K accompanied by a structural phase transition from the triclinic (low-temperature) to rhombohedral (high-temperature) phase. This transition induces a large anisotropic crystal structure deformation and results in a large NTE in the ceramic sample, which is caused by the microstructural effect. The NTE was observed over a temperature range of 450–630 K, and the total volume shrinkage reached approximately −0.7\%.

  abstract     = {The suitable energy level alignment between the electron transport layer (ETL) and perovskite absorber for facilitating electron extraction and transfer is essential for planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells (PSCs) to achieve high power conversion efficiency (PCE). The planar heterojunction CsPbBr 3 PSCs have attracted increasing attention due to their high stability in ambient in which TiO 2 is often used as the ETL. Actually, there is a large energy barrier between the conduction bands of TiO 2 and CsPbBr 3 , which limits the open-circuit voltage ( V OC ) and PCE of PSCs. Herein, we effectively optimized the energy level alignment between CsPbBr 3 and TiO 2 by tuning the Mg incorporation level in the latter. The Fermi level of TiO 2 ETL was gradually shifted upward using Mg incorporation, which led to a favorable band bending between TiO 2 and CsPbBr 3 and reduced the interfacial band offset. Consequently, the V OC of the devices was effectively increased from 1.36 to 1.49 V, and the corresponding PCE was also increased from 6.87\% to 8.76\%. This work highlights the importance of the energy level alignment between ETLs and perovskite absorbers for high-performance devices and offers an effective means to address the large energy barrier between the conduction bands of TiO 2 and CsPbBr 3 .},

Furthermore, the photodetectors also exhibit the ultrafast photoresponse speed with the rise time of 190 ns and the fall time of 180 ns, owing to the high crystal quality and the Schottky contacts between the Au electrodes and nanowires. In addition, the photoresponse of photodetectors is polarization angle sensitive in a broadband range from 266 to 808 nm, and the obtained maximum dichroic ratio is 3.54 at 808 nm, which results from the structural anisotropy of the Bi 1.85 In 0.15 S 3 crystal.

  abstract     = {This Letter reports a femtosecond ultraviolet laser absorption spectroscopy (fs-UV-LAS) for simultaneous in situ measurements of temperature and species. This fs-UV-LAS technique was demonstrated based on X 2 Π-A 2 Σ + transitions of OH radicals near 308 nm generated in low temperature plasmas and flames. The fs-UV-LAS technique has revealed three major diagnostic benefits. First, a series of absorption features within a spectral bandwidth of ∼3.2 nm near 308 nm were simultaneously measured and then enabled simultaneous multi-parameter measurements with enhanced accuracy. The results show that the temperature and OH concentration could be measured with accuracy enhanced by 29–88\% and 58–91\%, respectively, compared to those obtained with past two-narrow-line absorption methods. Second, an ultrafast time resolution of ∼120 picoseconds was accomplished for the measurements. Third, due to the large OH X 2 Π-A 2 Σ + transitions in the UV range, a simple single-pass absorption with a 3-cm path length was allowed for measurements in plasmas with low OH number density down to ∼2 × 10 13 cm −3 . Also due to the large OH UV transitions, single-shot fs absorption measurements were accomplished in flames, which was expected to offer more insights into chemically reactive flow dynamics.},

  abstract     = {Laser terahertz (THz) emission spectroscopy has broken the diffraction limit of THz frequencies and offers multifaceted spectroscopic and imaging capabilities for understanding the light–matter interaction in various quantum and energy materials. However, this advanced technique has not yet been applied in the recently extensively studied spintronic THz emission process, in which the material surface morphology may play an important role. Here, we conduct THz emission microscopy on 5.4-nm thick Pt/CoFeB/W heterostructures and obtain twice enhanced THz by tightly focusing the pumping laser, delicately choosing the radiation location on nanofilms and coating gold nanorods. Through THz emission mapping, the material surface morphology and its modification have a strong correlation with THz emission performance from spintronic emitters. Our proposed femtosecond fiber laser driven spintronic THz emission microscopy can provide exciting possibilities for studying surface morphology sensitive THz emission materials and microdomain ultrafast dynamics for low-dimensional small samples via further coupling optical microscopy.},

  abstract     = {Quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) materials are a newly arising topic in low-dimensional research. As a result of reduced dimensionality and enhanced anisotropy, the quasi-1D structure gives rise to novel properties and promising applications such as photodetectors. However, it remains an open question whether performance crossover will occur when the channel material is downsized. Here, we report on the fabrication and testing of photodetectors based on exfoliated quasi-1D BiSeI thin wires. Compared with the device on bulk crystal, a significantly enhanced photoresponse is observed, which is manifested by a series of performance parameters, including ultrahigh responsivity (7 × 10 4 A W −1 ), specific detectivity (2.5 × 10 14 Jones), and external quantum efficiency (1.8 × 10 7\%) when V ds = 3 V, λ = 515 nm, and P = 0.01 mW cm −2 . The conventional photoconductive effect is unlikely to account for such a superior photoresponse, which is ultimately understood in terms of the increased specific surface area and the photogating effect caused by trapping states. This work provides a perspective for the modulation of optoelectronic properties and performance in quasi-1D materials.},

  abstract     = {Optical components for laser beams with high peak and averaged powers are being developed worldwide using stimulated plasma scattering that occurs when plasmas interact with intense, coherent light. After decades of pursuit of pulse compressors, mirrors, and other plasma based components that can be created by stimulated scattering from electron density perturbations forming on ultra-short time scales (e.g., via Stimulated Raman Scattering), more recent work has produced optical components on longer time scales allowing ion motion as well [via Stimulated Brillouin Scattering (SBS)]. In the most recent work, ion wave plasma optics have had success in producing pulses of focusable coherent light with high energy and fluence by operating on ns time scales and now promise to enable numerous applications. Experiments have further shown that in some parameter regimes, even simple plasma response models can describe the output of such optics with sufficient accuracy that they can be used as engineering tools to design plasma optics for future applications, as is already being done to control power deposition in fusion targets. In addition, the development of more sophisticated models promises to enable still higher performance from SBS driven plasma optical components under a wider range of conditions. The present status and most promising directions for future development of ion wave plasma optic techniques are discussed here.},

  abstract     = {The performance of x-ray free electron lasers and ultrafast electron diffraction experiments is largely dependent on the brightness of electron sources from photoinjectors. The maximum brightness from photoinjectors at a particular accelerating gradient is limited by the mean transverse energy (MTE) of electrons emitted from photocathodes. For high quantum efficiency (QE) cathodes like alkali-antimonide thin films, which are essential to mitigate the effects of non-linear photoemission on MTE, the smallest possible MTE and, hence, the highest possible brightness are limited by the nanoscale surface roughness and chemical inhomogeneity. In this work, we show that high QE Cs 3 Sb films grown on lattice-matched strontium titanate (STO) substrates have a factor of 4 smoother, chemically uniform surfaces compared to those traditionally grown on disordered Si surfaces. We perform simulations to calculate roughness induced MTE based on measured topographical and surface-potential variations on the Cs 3 Sb films grown on STO and show that these variations are small enough to have no consequential impact on the MTE and, hence, the brightness.},

The system is composed of two inductively coupled reader-sensor parallel RLC resonators with gain and loss, respectively. By searching for the real mode that requires the minimum saturation gain, the steady-state frequency evolution as a function of the sensor capacitance perturbation is analytically deduced. The proposed system can work in different modes by setting different perturbation points. In particular, at the exceptional point of PT symmetry, the system exhibits high sensitivity. Experimental demonstrations revealed the viability of the proposed readout mechanism by measuring the steady-state frequency of the reader resonator in response to the change of trimmer capacitor on the sensor side. Our findings could impact many emerging applications such as implantable medical device for health monitoring, parameter detection in harsh environment, sealed food packages, etc.},

  abstract     = {The symmetry of the space where a spin qubit resides plays an essential role in the manipulation of quantum entanglement, which governs the performance of quantum information systems. Application of a magnetic field, which is usually necessary for spin manipulation and readout, inevitably breaks the spatial symmetry to induce competition among quantization axes between internal and external fields, thus limiting the purity of the entanglement. If we could manipulate and readout entanglement under a zero magnetic field, we would be able to avoid the competition among quantization axes to achieve ideally high fidelity. We here demonstrate the complete Bell state measurement, which is a core element of quantum processing, of two carbon nuclear spins in the vicinity of a diamond nitrogen-vacancy center. The demonstration was made possible by holonomic entanglement manipulations based on the geometric phase with a polarized microwave under a zero magnetic field, where the quantization axis is uniquely defined by the hyperfine field. The demonstrated scheme allows high-fidelity entanglement processing even when magnetic fields cannot be applied to the integration of superconducting and spin qubits, thereby paving the way for building fault-tolerant distributed quantum computers and quantum repeater networks.},

It becomes more challenging when there are inevitable interactions between qubits in the solid system. We employ a composite pulse sequence to deal with the problems. The electron spin state of the nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond is flipped with high fidelity by the composite pulse at room temperature. In contrast with traditional rectangular pulses, the composite pulse has a wider excitation profile at the same Rabi frequency. Hence, the three sublevels of host nitrogen nuclear spin can be flipped efficiently and simultaneously, which enhances the signal contrast and detection sensitivity of quantum sensing universally. The enhancement effect works over a wide range of bias magnetic fields. Our scheme can be used for sensing temperature, strain, and electric field and can be applied to other spin–spin coupling systems.},

However, its performance is difficult to be improved effectively by doping other atoms. The traditional synthesis processes have the disadvantages of low yield, complex steps, and long period. In this study, the Ag 2 Se 1+ x samples were rapidly synthesized by the melting method via changing the ratio of Ag and Se. The carrier concentration and mobility of Ag 2 Se are optimized by adding excess Se, which could regulate non-stoichiometric defects in the process of synthesis. A high Seebeck coefficient of ∼136.0 μ V K −1 , a large power factor of ∼3000.0 μ W m −1 K −2 , and the maximum figure of merit ( ZT ) of ∼1.02 of the Ag 2 Se 1.015 sample have been achieved at 375 K. The ZT value is 2.3 times than that of the pristine sample (Ag 2 Se). The mechanical properties of the molting sample are comparable to state-of-the-art thermoelectric materials. Finally, the highest ZT value of the material is predicted by factor B . This work provides an idea for further optimizing Ag 2 Se-based and other non-stoichiometric thermoelectric semiconductors by a slight excess of Se. Moreover, the fast synthesis technology can significantly save time and energy, which manifests great advantages to the wholesale manufacturing industry.},

Meanwhile, the cycle life of Li-O 2 batteries under 100\% depth of discharge increases from a few cycles to more than 20 cycles, attributed to the transition of Ni 2+ to Ni 4+ upon charging that promotes decomposition of reaction products Li 2 O 2 and by-products Li 2 CO 3 .

GI relies on the fabrication of high-quality absorption gratings, which has revealed to be quite challenging. This paper proposes an interferometer for dark-field and differential phase contrast imaging using a single phase-shifting element. This proposal simplifies the setup without penalizing the image quality. The proposed interferometer consists of a single dual-period phase grating having two distinct periods, which generates intensity modulation with a period large enough to be resolved directly by the detector. This makes the proposed GI system easily adaptable as there are no stringent alignment requirements. We show the utility of this method for a possible diagnostic task by imaging smoked murine lung samples. The simplicity of the proposed setup compared to a conventional Talbot(-Lau) interferometer suggests that it could be easily and widely used for a variety of applications.},

  abstract     = {The development of associated alpha particle scintillation screen that takes into account high spatial resolution, ultrafast temporal resolution, and high signal-to-noise ratio is the key to promote the “fingerprint” technology in the field of explosive detection—the deuterium–tritium (D–T) reaction associated particle neutron generator (APNG). Herein, the highly uniform and densely packed ZnO:Ga nanorod arrays, as designed alpha particle scintillation screen for the APNG, is proposed and prepared on a ZnO-seeded substrate by a radio frequency magnetron sputtering and hydrothermal method. The simulation results show that the theoretical cutoff thickness is 7.6 μ m for 3.5 MeV alpha particles, and the increase in array spacing is conducive to suppress transverse light output and improve its light output efficiency and spatial resolution simultaneously. Through hydrogen annealing treatment, the slow decay component is completely suppressed and the integrated intensity of the fast decay component with a rising edge response of 1 ns is significantly enhanced by nine times.},

  abstract     = {In the aspect of charge injection for perovskite light emitting diodes (PeLEDs), the surface charge induced capacitive effect, also coined as surface polarization, can be generated. It may severally affect the electron–hole recombination for the electroluminescence. Here, a joint experimental and theoretical study was performed in order to unravel interior mechanisms for both quasi-two dimensional (quasi-2D) and three dimensional (3D) lead-bromide perovskites [i.e., PEA 2 (MAPbBr 3 ) n−1 PbBr 4 and MAPbBr 3 ] based PeLEDs. We have found a negative capacitive effect at low frequencies under the application of bias voltage from 1 to 3.5 V. This is in accordance with the surface polarization induced electron–hole recombination. Such a negative capacitive effect is more remarkable for the quasi-2D PEA 2 (MAPbBr 3 ) n−1 PbBr 4 based PeLED. From our theoretical analyses, both surface recombination volumes ( α ) and lifetimes ( τ ) of the PeLED are bias dependent. Thus, despite ultrafast time responses (i.e., pico- to nano-seconds) for exciton dynamics, our study suggests that slow time responses (i.e., milliseconds to seconds) of the surface polarization induced recombination may contribute effectively for PeLED operations. The study indicates that the surface recombination is an alternative route for the electron–hole recombination upon electrical charge injection.},

  abstract     = {Here, we demonstrate that oxide thin film devices could be affected by humidity in their in-plane stress and in substrate curvature. We prepared silica glass and ceria crystalline thin films on Si(100) wafers by the sol-gel method. Both films had “tensile” in-plane residual stress. We cycled the relative humidity between ca. 20\% and 80\% in the square wave and monitored the substrate curvature in situ , from which in-plane stress was calculated. The increase and decrease in humidity resulted in a decrease and an increase in tensile stress, respectively. In situ ellipsometric measurements during humidity cycles showed that both thickness and refractive index increase and decrease on the increase and decrease in humidity, respectively. This guarantees that the volume expansion and shrinkage caused by water molecule adsorption/absorption and desorption, respectively, are the origins of the response of the stress to humidity. Responding to the change in humidity, thicker silica glass films with low porosities of 1\%–3\% showed more sluggish change in stress, suggesting absorption/desorption of water via diffusion in siloxane network in such dense films. Silica glass films with a larger porosity showed more quick response to humidity, indicating adsorption/desorption on the pore wall as the primary cause of the response. “Compressive” stress in a silica glass film with ca. 1\% porosity exhibited very slight response in stress to humidity, which was attributed to the hard diffusion of water in compressed siloxane network.},

The thick PbS CQDs&#39; film efficiently absorbs infrared light and then excites and separates electron–hole pairs to generate a photovoltage at the pn heterojunction of the PbS CQDs/ZnO film. The photovoltage is further amplified and transduced in situ by the CNT TFT under the heterojunction, and then the detector featured a specific detectivity of 5.6 × 10 13 Jones under 1300 nm illumination and a fast response of the sub-ms level (0.57 ms).

The current multiferroic research in a two-dimensional lattice is invariably focused on d -orbital based systems. We alternatively show by first-principles calculations that ideal multiferroics is present in a p -orbital based lattice of single-layer SiN. Single-layer SiN is a semiconductor exhibiting intrinsic ferromagnetism and ferroelectricity simultaneously. Its magnetism correlates with the extended p – p interaction between unpaired p orbitals of N atoms. The buckled symmetry guarantees the existence of an out-of-plane electric dipole, giving rise to the ferroelectric order. More remarkably, the ferroic orders in single-layer SiN display strongly coupled physics, i.e., the spatial distribution of magnetic moments can be well controlled by the reversal of electric polarization, thereby establishing the long-sought multiferroics with strong magnetoelectric coupling. These findings not only enrich a two-dimensional multiferroic family, but also enable a wide range of device applications.},

However, the optical absorbance of TMDs is relatively low because of the atomic-scale thickness, limiting further development of TMDs-based nonlinear optical devices. Here, we propose an effective method to enhance the nonlinear optical properties of TMDs using plasmons, which are from embedded silver (Ag) nanoparticles (NPs) inside the fused silica substrate. In such a configuration, the third-order nonlinear absorption coefficient of MoS 2 with non-contact Ag NPs is one order of magnitude higher than that of pure monolayer MoS 2 under excitation of 515 nm light, and at 1030 nm, the reverse saturable absorption switches to the saturable absorption due to the plasmonic implication. In addition, the mechanism of plasmon-enhanced nonlinear optical properties is confirmed by results of both transient absorption spectroscopy and near-field electromagnetic field simulation. This study on plasmon-enhanced third-order nonlinearity of MoS 2 expands the boundaries of TMDs-based optical nonlinearity engineering.},

Here, we propose a general mechanism for realizing intrinsic ferromagnetic triferroicity in two-dimensional van der Waals lattices through interlayer sliding and further demonstrate it in bilayer T′-VTe 2 . Using first-principles calculations, we reveal that bilayer T′-VTe 2 exhibits spontaneous ferromagnetism, ferroelasticity, and ferroelectricity simultaneously, yielding the long-sought intrinsic triferroicity. We further predict that such a system could possess many distinctive physics, for example, the ferroelastic control of magnetization orientation and ferroelectric control of magnetic moment distribution.

We find that when the composites are electrically poled, remanent strain from the piezoelectric PZT layer can be transferred to the magnetostrictive CFO layer. X-ray diffraction shows that this strain transfer is greatest in the most porous samples, in agreement with magnetometry measurements, which show the greatest change in sample saturation magnetization in the most porous samples. Strain analysis shows that porosity both accommodates greater lattice strain and mitigates the effects of substrate clamping in thin film strain-coupled composites.},

Our experimental results showed that the property enhancement from the ACP was remarkable only when the poling cycle number ( N L ) was kept low. When ACP was continued after the saturation, dielectric and piezoelectric properties gradually dropped down to traditional direct current poled levels or even lower. Such a decrease in material properties caused by the large N L during ACP was defined as the “overpoling effect of ACP” in this study. The following lattice symmetry and domain structure characterization studies were performed through x-ray diffraction (XRD) and piezoelectric force microscopy (PFM) to find the origin of the overpoling effect. The XRD measurements combined with temperature dependence of dielectric properties demonstrated that the field-induced phase transition continued when the samples became overpoled. Further PFM measurements illustrated that the domain density of the overpoled ACP sample was significantly lower than that of the normal one, while the “2R” domain configuration was maintained through the ACP process. In addition, the hysteresis loop characterization indicated large decreases in the coercive fields. The discovered overpoling effect of ACP could help us understand the mechanisms of ACP and optimize the ACP process.},

Vanishing of such anisotropic features in reference experiments where the La 0.67 Sr 0.33 MnO 3 film is grown on SrTiO 3 suggests that the anisotropic spin-wave propagation might be originated from different lattice mismatches of the LSMO film with these two substrates. Interestingly, the decay length and the relaxation time of spin waves are found to be largest when the wavevector is along the [110] crystalline orientation, which is neither at easy nor hard axis related to the in-plane uniaxial magnetic anisotropy. This suggests the possibility of individual control of the magnetic anisotropy and spin-wave anisotropy via strain engineering. Our discovery may enrich the material systems for anisotropic spin wave behavior and promote strain engineering and optimization of versatile magnonic devices.},

The obtained intensity of MJs (the ratio of an abrupt change in magnetization to saturation magnetization) increases to 53.3\%, which is about twice as much as previously reported values in HI-9. These unusually large MJs are achieved by intentionally introducing multiscale distortions with high-stress compression deformation. Both experiments and Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the increase in MJs&#39; intensity originates from the tunable atomic-scale and nano-scale distortions induced by crystal strain energy during the deformation process. Our findings provide an approach to modulate metamagnetic transitions and may inspire fresh ideas for creating high-performance antiferromagnetic materials.},

  abstract     = {With the great developments in electronic communication technology and miniaturized electromagnetic devices, near-field magnetic shielding has attracted much attention. However, for the widely used natural magnetic shielding materials, metal and ferrite, they have the unique limitations of large Ohmic loss and heavy weight, respectively. Although a compromise solution of the shielding layer may resort to the composite structure with metal and ferrite slabs, practical magnetic shielding with broadband, high efficiency, and ultra-thinness has remained a great challenge. In this work, inspired by the effective magnetic flux path established by the Halbach array, which is constructed by stacking permanent magnet in diverse directions, we propose a physical mechanism of local magnetic moment control in artificial structures, called the “Halbach-like structure.” We demonstrate the highly efficient and ultra-broadband near-field magnetic shielding in the Halbach-like structure with patterned metal and ferrite structures. By ingeniously designing the local magnetic moment, our structure not only provides an effective method for realizing high performance magnetic shielding but also paves the way to the other near-field controls, such as the wireless power transfer, wireless communications, and magnetic resonance imaging.},

The n-channel silicon trench FETs have a maximum transconductance of 1.83 × 10 −5 S at near-zero gate bias voltage, which is beneficial for the high sensitivity of electrical detection. The optical transparency and physical robustness of the integrated microfluidic channel are achieved by a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)/glass hybrid cover combining the good sealing characteristics of PDMS, and the thin and flat properties of glass. Device evaluation methodologies and measurement approaches are also presented demonstrating a synchronized time-lapse imaging and electronic detection of bead transport.

  abstract     = {Employing inorganic ion conductors as solid electrolytes (SEs) is one promising solution to develop advanced all- and quasi-solid-state batteries with high energy and safety advantages. Among numerous Li + ion conductors, Li 1.4 Al 0.4 Ti 1.6 (PO 4 ) 3 (LATP) has attracted extensive attention due to its preponderances of air stability and superior Li + conductivity. However, the practical application of the LATP electrolyte is still obsessed by serious side reactions at the Li-electrode/electrolyte interface. In this work, one kind of quasi-solid electrolyte (QSE) is designed combining anodic aluminum oxide (AAO), LATP, and liquid electrolyte [LE, LiPF 6 /ethylene carbonate-dimethyl carbonate (EC-DMC)], wherein well-ordered LATP arrays are constructed in the AAO framework to facilitate ionic transport, and a certain content of the LE is introduced to reduce the interfacial resistances. The characterization results suggest that the ionic conductivity of as-prepared AAO–LATP–QSE (ALQSE) is boosted up to ∼6.50 × 10 −3 S cm −1 with a Li + transference number of 0.66, especially the interval between the LATP compound and the Li-metal electrode can effectively restrain Ti 4+ →Ti 3+ reduction at the Li-anode/electrolyte interface. Thus, the assembled LiFePO 4 |ALQSE|Li cell exhibits excellent electrochemical stability, delivering an initial discharge capacity of 153.3 mAh g −1 at 0.1C and remaining 152.4 mAh g −1 after 60 cycles with a fairly mild reduction of 0.028\% per cycle. This study not only presents a facile strategy to prepare a robust QSE framework employing an AAO template but also promotes the rational interface design between titanium (Ti)-containing solid-state electrolytes and Li-metal anodes.},

Ba 8 Cu 15.43(2) Ga 0.3 P 30.26(3) crystallizes in a partially ordered orthorhombic Pmna clathrate-I superstructure with five out of 15 framework sites being jointly occupied by metal+phosphorus.

A combination of energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy, and single crystal x-ray diffraction was used to determine the structures alongside the compositions. The positional disorder was verified by 31 P solid state NMR spectroscopy. Characterization of the transport properties indicated that the Ga-substituted samples exhibit higher Seebeck coefficients and electrical resistivities compared to its pristine counterpart, in line with the expected reduction of the hole concentration due to Ga/Cu substitution. Moderate improvements in the thermoelectric power factor and overall figure-of-merit were observed for samples with 6.9\% and 3.8\% Ga/ M total as compared to those for the pristine Ba 8 Cu 16 P 30 clathrate.

  abstract     = {For systems that require complete metallic enclosures (e.g., containment buildings for nuclear reactors), it is impossible to access interior sensors and equipment using standard electromagnetic techniques. A viable way to communicate and supply power through metallic barriers is the use of elastic waves and ultrasonic transducers, introducing several design challenges that must be addressed. Specifically, the use of multiple communication channels on the same enclosure introduces an additional mechanism for signal crosstalk between channels: guided waves propagating in the barrier between channels. This work numerically and experimentally investigates a machined phononic crystal to block MHz Lamb wave propagation between ultrasonic communication channels, greatly reducing wave propagation and the resulting crosstalk voltage. Blind grooves are machined into one or both sides of a metallic barrier to introduce a periodic unit cell, greatly altering the guided wave dispersion in the barrier. Numerical simulations are used to determine a set of groove geometries for testing, and experiments were performed to characterize the wave-blocking performance of each design. The best-performing design was tested using piezoelectric transducers bonded to the barrier, showing a 14.4 dB reduction in crosstalk voltage. The proposed periodic grooving method is a promising technique for completely isolating ultrasonic power/data transfer systems operating in a narrow frequency range.},

Metasurfaces with strong ability to manipulate the polarization and phase of electromagnetic waves have been harnessed to generate vector beams. Among them, the proposal of metasurfaces with different responses to orthogonally polarized waves can undoubtedly enhance the flexibility of optical device design. Here, we introduce the diffractive optics (Fresnel zone plates) into the spin-decoupling metasurfaces, called the metasurface zone plates, utilized to engender desired vector beams. As a demonstration, we design two metasurface zone plates: one can generate a focused vector beam under linearly polarized incidence, and the other is exploited to engender a vector vortex beam. The simulated and measured results simultaneously demonstrate the feasibility and practicability of such a concept. Our work unlocks the potential of optical devices and may further promote the development of metasurface polarizers toward miniaturization and versatility.},

  abstract     = {The resonant nature and geometric scalability make metamaterials an ideal platform for an enhanced light–matter interaction over a broad frequency range. The mid-infrared (IR) spectral range is of great importance for vibrational spectroscopy of molecules, while IR metamaterials created from lithography-based planar nanostructures have been used to demonstrate enhanced molecular detection. Compared with visible and near-infrared, the relative long wavelengths of IR light make it possible to achieve three-dimensional (3D) IR metamaterials via the state-of-the-art 3D fabrication techniques. Here, we design and fabricate a 3D printed plasmonic metamaterial absorber (MMA), and by performing Fourier-transform IR spectroscopy, we demonstrate that a series of molecular fingerprint vibrations of glycine can be significantly enhanced by the high absorption mode supported by the 3D meta-atoms of the MMA. The observed enhanced IR detection can also be partially attributed to the improved accessibility offered by the 3D architecture of the MMA. In particular, due to capillary forces during the drying process, the microscale 3D printed features lead to selective analyte deposition in high-field regions, which provides another degree of freedom in the design of the 3D printed structures for surface-enhanced IR detection. Our study shows the flexibility of metastructures based on advanced 3D printing technology in tailoring the interaction between IR light and materials on a subwavelength scale.},

However, conventional sound-proofing barriers in the bulky configuration simultaneously impede the free airflow, which is highly required in the applications calling for ventilation. Although the advances in acoustic metamaterials have opened new routes for designing air-permeable barriers, a well-ventilated and omnidirectional sound barrier with deep-subwavelength thickness remains challenging. Here, we theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate an ultrasparse, ultrathin, and ultralight acoustic ventilated meta-barrier that is highly prohibitive to omnidirectional sound. The acoustic meta-barrier is designed by sparsely arranging the units composed of two central-symmetric cavities with the thickness about 0.12 λ ( λ is the sound wavelength) and the sparsity achieving up to 80\%. A sound wave from all directions impinging to the meta-barrier is efficiently blocked, and the airflow is allowed to freely transport, maintaining the wind velocity ratio measured higher than 90\%. Moreover, geometric parameter analysis is investigated to optimize and customize the meta-barrier according to the target frequency spectrum. The ultrasparse and omnidirectional acoustic ventilated meta-barrier in such a compact and open configuration would hold out promising solutions to sound insulation and offer an additional scheme to design sound-proofing yet air-permeable devices in various applications.},

As the radiation dose increases, the proportion of oxygen vacancies at the bottom of the film increases. However, the top of the IWZO film is hardly affected by the radiation dose. In addition, the resistive switching behavior of an IWZO memristor under irradiation has also been investigated. A forming process and a bipolar I–V curve of the IWZO memristor vary with the radiation dose. The high resistance state of the memristor is significantly degraded at a radiation dose of 1000 krad, which is due to the more defects in the IWZO film. The retention time of the IWZO memristor is up to 10 4 s at 85 °C with 100 krad. The damaged site in the IWZO film is observed and fabricated into memristors under radiation.

  abstract     = {Optimization of carrier extraction and/or transport layers is an important factor for the development of perovskite semiconductor devices. In particular, tin dioxide, SnO 2 , is being frequently used as an electron transport layer (ETL) in perovskite solar cells. However, a systematic study on preparation and characterization of the SnO 2 -ETL is still lacking, and thus, morphological and electronic-functional roles are not fully understood. In this paper, we systematically investigate the SnO 2 -ETL prepared on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates by a spin-coating technique. Using microscopic observations, we morphologically study how the SnO 2 film covers the FTO surface with large unevenness. Optical characterizations are employed for investigating an electronic band alignment of the perovskite/SnO 2 interface varied with the SnO 2 concentration in a solution. Furthermore, we systematically evaluate photovoltaic properties of FTO-based solar cell devices. A major finding from these investigations is the fact that while the SnO 2 -ETL prepared at the adequate condition exhibits an ideal band alignment, the excessive SnO 2 deposition causes a poor electron extraction and device performance degradation. Furthermore, we show that the spin-coated SnO 2 -ETL can cover the FTO surface as an ultrathin wrapping layer. These results highlight the importance of the SnO 2 -ETL and pave the way for optoelectronic device applications of perovskite materials.},

  abstract     = {Liquid transport regulation has attracted wide attention recently due to its potential applications in micro-fluidic devices, heat management, and mechanical engineering. Various liquid regulation strategies for direction guiding and speed enhancing have been developed with inspirations from nature, such as desert beetles and Nepenthes alata peristome with either gradient wettability or anisotropic structures, whereas their combined strategies for enhanced liquid regulations have barely been discussed due to the unclear coupling mechanisms. Herein, inspired by liquid transporting structure on Ligia exotica &#39;s leg, a smart flexible surface with gradient distributed and magnetized micro-cilia array is proposed to realize liquid spreading regulations in speed and direction. Different gradients and magnetic fields have been compared for liquid regulating performances, where the anisotropy ratio of liquid spreading could be enhanced from 0 on uniform surface to ∼0.3 on gradients surface, to even ∼0.6 by coupling magnetic field. The underlying liquid regulating mechanism has been established based on the mutual effects of liquid pinning and capillarity at different cilium inclined angles, cilium gap distance, and surface wettability. Finally, several liquid regulation applications are explored and offer potentials for fields of medicine and heat management.},

The valence band offsets are found to be 2.7 and 3.1 eV for Al 2 O 3 /H-terminated diamond and MoO 3 /H-terminated diamond, respectively. Compared to the MoO 3 /H-terminated diamond structure, a higher hole mobility was achieved with Al 2 O 3 inserted as an interface layer.

  abstract     = {Programmable fluidic systems on curved and flexible substrates are of increasing interest. One approach to achieving programmability is the controlled sequential wetting and dewetting on a surface using voltage actuation. In particular, liquid dielectrophoresis techniques have recently been shown to provide the ability to form a spread liquid film on a normally liquid repellent, but rigid, substrate via applying a spatially periodic electrical potential underneath an initial sessile droplet. In this work, we demonstrate the creation of thin, rectangular shaped, films of electrically insulating liquid on the side of a curved and flexible liquid repellant substrate using dielectrophoresis forces. We find that the experimental threshold voltage V T ( κ s ) for film formation has a monotonic dependence on the value of the substrate curvature κ s in the range −0.4 mm −1 &lt; κ s &lt; 0.26 mm −1 . By considering the balance of stresses acting on the films, including the Laplace pressure and the Maxwell stress, we develop an analytical theoretical expression that is in excellent quantitative agreement with our curvature dependent experimental threshold voltage measurements. The resulting physical insights and the demonstration of programmable wettability on curved and flexible substrates with both positive and negative curvature provide the foundations for applications in imaging, displays, and biochemical analysis.},

  abstract     = {The ability to resolve the polarization of light with on-chip devices represents an urgent problem in optoelectronics. The detectors with polarization resolution demonstrated so far mostly require multiple oriented detectors or movable external polarizers. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the feasibility to resolve the polarization of mid-infrared light with a single chemical-vapor-deposited graphene-channel device with dissimilar metal contacts. This possibility stems from an unusual dependence of photoresponse at graphene–metal junctions on gate voltage and polarization angle. Namely, there exist certain gate voltages providing the polarization-insensitive signal; operation at these voltages can be used for power calibration of the detector. At other gate voltages, the detector features very strong polarization sensitivity, with the ratio of signals for two orthogonal polarizations reaching ∼ 10 ⁠ . Operation at these voltages can provide information about polarization angles, after the power calibration. We show that such unusual gate- and polarization-dependence of photosignal can appear upon competition of isotropic and anisotropic photovoltage generation pathways and discuss the possible physical candidates.},

However, due to the rapid transition rate and wide dynamics, monitoring of processes is challenging. Previous detection methods are lack of speed and simplicity and require multiple interventions, which largely introduce human factors influencing the results and make it difficult to guarantee the accuracy and visualization. In this paper, the photonic spin Hall effect is used for real-time detection and highly sensitive analysis of the phase transition process of VO 2 films. By incorporating with quantum weak measurement, the photonic spin-Hall shift acts as the pointer, and the phase transition process of VO 2 is characterized effectively. The high measurement resolution with 63 S/(m μ m) is achieved due to weak-value amplification. In our scheme, it does not involve any mechanical adjustment of optical components, thus enabling real-time, visual, non-contact detection of dynamic phase transition processes.},

The high laser fluence illuminated on the particles causes significant part of probing swift electrons exchange energy with the laser light, creating enough PINEM electrons required for the dark-field imaging of particles with high spatiotemporal resolution at nanometer and femtosecond scale. Different from the bright-field PINEM imaging of particles where the outerspace with a close distance to the particle are illuminated by transmitted PINEM electrons, illumination is confined on the particles by selected scattered PINEM electrons, leading to a much more defined and sharp imaging of particles compared with a bright-field PINEM image.

By using the constant EPI, such as the deformation potential approximation, we carried out high-throughput electrical transport calculations in TE chalcogenides and ABX 2 compounds with diamond-like structures and effectively screened some high-performance TE materials; besides, the mobility in hybrid organic–inorganic perovskite CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 was also studied, which included the effect of temperature-induced structural fluctuation. Then, the phonon scattering mechanism for the electrical transports in two-dimensional Dirac sheets and chalcogenides ZnX (X = S, Se) with a zinc blende structure was further discussed by full accurate evaluation of the EPI. It is found that the scatterings from optical phonons and inter-bands are strong and should not be neglected in contrast to the common wisdom. Finally, we perspective the EPI effect on more aspects such as the band structure and thermal transport.},

  abstract     = {The outstanding properties of Gallium Nitride (GaN) have enabled considerable improvements in the performance of power devices compared to traditional silicon technology, resulting in more efficient and highly compact power converters. GaN power technology has rapidly developed and is expected to gain a significant market share in an increasing number of applications in the coming years. However, despite the great progress, the performance of current GaN devices is still far from what the GaN material could potentially offer, and a significant reduction of the device on-resistance for a certain blocking voltage is needed. Conventional GaN high-electron-mobility-transistors are based on a single two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) channel, whose trade-off between electron mobility and carrier density limits the minimum achievable sheet resistance. To overcome such limitations, GaN power devices including multiple, vertically stacked 2DEG channels have recently been proposed, showing much-reduced resistances and excellent voltage blocking capabilities for a wide range of voltage classes from 1 to 10 kV. Such devices resulted in unprecedented high-power figures of merit and exceeded the SiC material limit, unveiling the full potential of lateral GaN power devices.

  abstract     = {Device fabrication based on piezoelectric materials requires prior characterization of full matrix constants. For this, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers standard on piezoelectricity suggests the use of ultrasonic pulse-echo and electric resonance methods. However, these techniques tend to provide inconsistent characterization, because they require multiple samples with drastically different sizes. Resonant ultrasound spectroscopy (RUS) is a promising alternative, because it uses only a single sample for characterization, thus ensuring self-consistent results. The inverse problem of finding material constants from resonant frequencies is often solved using the nonlinear least squares method despite its being a time-consuming algorithm. Herein, deep learning (DL) is introduced in the inversion procedure of RUS. After the DL network is trained, the material constants are determined with high efficiency. The practicability and reliability of the combination of DL and RUS are demonstrated by characterizing the full tensor constants of LiNbO 3 single crystals.},

  abstract     = {Three-wave mixing is a key process in superconducting quantum information processing, being involved in quantum-limited amplification and parametric coupling between superconducting cavities. These operations can be implemented by superconducting nonlinear asymmetric inductive element (SNAIL)-based devices that present a Kerr-free flux-bias point where unwanted parasitic effects, such as Stark shift, are suppressed. However, with a single flux-bias parameter, these circuits can only host one Kerr-free point, limiting the range of their applications. In this Letter, we demonstrate how to overcome this constraint by introducing the gradiometric SNAIL, a doubly flux biased superconducting circuit in which both effective inductance and Kerr coefficient can be independently tuned. Experimental data show the capability of the gradiometric SNAIL to suppress the Kerr effect in a three-wave mixing parametric amplifier over a continuum of flux bias points corresponding to a 1.7 GHz range of operating frequencies.},

We find that the photoluminescence signal of an ensemble of implanted defects is enhanced in slab waveguides by an order of magnitude over identically implanted bulk defects. The slab waveguide-enhanced photoluminescence of several defect species is used to study recombination and diffusion in the presence of thermal annealing with both rapid quench cooling and a longer return to ambient conditions. The confined mechanical geometry of a thin film is exploited to measure the spin-strain coupling of the negatively charged silicon monovacancy. The methods in this work can be used to exercise greater control on near-surface emitters in silicon carbide and better understand and control the effects of strain on spin measurements of silicon carbide based color centers.},

  abstract     = {Thermoelectric (TE) generators and coolers are one possible solution to energy autonomy for internet-of-things and biomedical electronics and to locally cool high-performance integrated circuits. The development of TE technology requires not only research into TE materials but also advancing TE device physics, which involves determining properties such as the thermopower ( α ) and Peltier ( Π ) coefficients at the device rather than material level. Although Π governs TE cooler operation, it is rarely measured because of difficulties isolating Π from larger non-Peltier heat effects such as Joule heating and Fourier thermal conduction. Instead, Π is almost always inferred from α via a theoretical Kelvin relation Π = αT , where T is the absolute temperature. Here, we demonstrate a method for independently measuring Π on any TE device via the difference in heat flows between the thermopile held open-circuit vs short-circuit. This method determines Π solely from conventionally measured device performance parameters, corrects for non-Peltier heat effects, does not require separate knowledge of material property values, and does not assume the Kelvin relation. A measurement of Π is demonstrated on a commercial Bi 2 Te 3 TE generator. By measuring α and Π independently on the same device, the ratio ( Π / α ) is free of parasitic thermal impedances, allowing the Kelvin relation to be empirically verified to reasonable accuracy.},

These parameters are substantially superior to those previously reported for patch-antenna RTD oscillators, and they are close to the state-of-the-art level for all other types of RTD oscillators at around 1 THz. However, the double-RTD patch-antenna oscillators also provide essential advantages of compactness, simplicity, vertical emission from the chip surface, and a high degree of isolation from the external circuitry. These improved parameters are due to the implementation of conical vias with dramatically reduced parasitic inductance and due to the use of 1 nm barrier RTDs. We demonstrate that there is much room for further improvement of the parameters of these oscillators.},

We found that the regular skyrmion lattice phase in the single-crystal sample has been averaged in the MnSi polycrystal due to random grain orientations, which results in an extended skyrmion lattice-conical mixture phase down to 25 K. The magnitude of the out-of-phase component in α E of the polycrystal, not single crystal, decreases gradually with decreasing frequency. With the changing of the driven ac field, we reveal a depinning threshold behavior in both samples. The depinning field is stronger in the polycrystal than that in the single crystal and may be responsible for the diminishing of the dissipative behavior at lower frequency due to grain boundaries and defects. The composite magnetoelectric method provides a unique approach to probe topological phase dynamics.},

  abstract     = {While atomic disorder has provided a paradigm shift in crystalline materials because of unusual atomic arrangements and functional response, “partial” disorder is scarcely reported until now. We discovered partial cation disorder in Li 2 MnO 3 with fewer stacking faults, which was synthesized under high pressure. Mn and Li atoms in a Mn 2/3 Li 1/3 O 2 layer disorder while Li atoms in a Li layer order. Magnetization and specific heat measurements indicate a long-range antiferromagnetic (AF) order below 35 K. The irreversibility observed in the magnetization data and the hump observed for the specific heat data suggest the coexistence of an AF order and a partial magnetic disorder. Neutron diffraction measurements reveal that the coexisted state is formed instead of the Néel AF state that has previously been reported for conventional Li 2 MnO 3 . These results indicate that high pressure makes a breakthrough to introduce partial disorder within crystals and designs not only a unique magnetic structure but also other physical properties.},

Our calculations suggest a field-controlled Néel-type skyrmion lattice—a ferromagnet transition cycle. In addition, a spin-torque induced by spin-polarized current injection was simulated in order to study the motion of a skyrmion on a racetrack, where an increase in the skyrmion Hall angle is observed at high temperatures. Consequently, this study suggests that generation and annihilation of skyrmions can be achieved with temperature or field control and also manipulate the velocity and the direction of the Néel-type skyrmions through ultra-low current densities and temperature, thus shedding light on the general picture of magnetic skyrmion control and design of two-dimensional van der Waals heterostructures.},

We find that electrical conduction is predominantly controlled by free electrons in the temperature range 230–800 °C with the mutual compensation of the impurity donor (Si) and acceptor dopant (Fe), explaining the low concentration of free electrons and Fermi level pinning over a wide range of temperatures. Furthermore, the negative temperature-dependence of the carrier mobility indicates that it is limited by optical phonon scattering. Importantly, we find electrical conductivity to be largely independent of oxygen partial pressure ( p O 2 ) from air to 10 −4 atm at 600 °C, but it becomes slightly dependent on p O 2 at 800 °C, as intrinsic non-stoichiometric point defects begin to influence the charge balance.},

Based on the shift of the resonance frequencies, this sensor is able to detect the location of a sub-wavelength metallic object (whose diameter is smaller than 0.6 mm) randomly attached to the CSR. A prototype of the sensor is fabricated and tested. In practice, the CSR is excited through the EM coupling of the SSPP TL, and the location of the metallic object is obtained through the transmission coefficient (S21). To improve the accuracy, a retrieval curve for locating is generated and calibrated. It is proved that the random location of the sub-wavelength object can be accurately detected inside an area of 9π mm 2 with a low error of 2‰.},

Here, we introduce a high-efficiency and broadband spin-unlocked metasurface with two mechanisms of a resonance phase and a geometric phase perfectly combined together. The design strategy is quite simple just through changing one geometric parameter rather than multi parameter optimization. As a proof of concept, the anomalous photonic spin Hall effect based on the spin-unlocked metasurface is demonstrated first, showing high experimental efficiency (over 80\%) in a broad frequency range (11.3–16.6 GHz). Furthermore, another spin-unlocked metasurface is built to demonstrate the completely independent wavefront manipulations, i.e., the focusing effect and anomalous reflection. These findings significantly expand the electromagnetic control ability of a metasurface.},

At present, feasible methods mainly include exploiting spoof SPPs through complex structural design on metals or using semiconductors. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate that porous graphene induced by laser beams with low fabrication cost can support SPPs in the THz regime with good performance. Using a classical structure of the semicircular slit, a super-resolution focus with a size of ∼0.43λ is characterized by a THz-SPPs imaging system.

In this Letter, we show that Raman spectroscopy can serve as an effective in situ detection strategy to systematically observe the interfacial electron–phonon coupling (IEPC) between substrate and 2D OIHs. Combining non-adiabatic molecular dynamics simulations with ultrafast spectroscopy, we reveal that the different strengths of IEPC between substrates and 2D OIHs can directly modulate the photocarrier lifetimes of inorganic 2D materials, and therefore, indirectly modify the Raman-sensitive photo-induced charge transfer processes at the interface of 2D OIHs. Further in situ Raman evidence demonstrates the unique advantage of Raman spectroscopy with high sensitivity to monitor different substrate-induced IEPC under variable temperature.},

The method can be easily adapted to existing synchrotron end stations. We investigate dielectric capacitors with dissimilar electrodes to assess the feasibility of the modified total electron yield method. Furthermore, in operando soft x-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements are performed on ferroelectric capacitors under bias and using two ammeters. The experimental results are discussed in terms of the external and internal photoemission processes and their distribution in thin film capacitors under an external bias condition.

Bifacial absorbers can significantly enhance light absorption by capturing albedo light from the environment. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that free-standing silica-silver core–shell nano-resonator arrays allow bifacial and omnidirectional optical absorption across the visible spectrum. Specifically, resonator arrays can highly absorb light (&gt;80\%) with all polarizations from a directional range (−40° to 40°) on both front and rear sides of a surface. Numerical simulations reveal that such bifacial and omnidirectional light absorption results from hybridized excitation of surface plasmons and whispering gallery modes in a symmetrical configuration. The absorption band can be flexibly adjusted by changing the silica core size. In addition, the absorbed optical energy quickly decays as the excitation of plasmonic hot electrons as observed using transient absorption spectroscopy. Our work provides a bifacial absorber for many optoelectronic applications in photodetection, photovoltaics, and photocatalysis.},

A 580-nm-thick VSLED with a dominant emission wavelength of 427.8 nm is implemented on a 2-in. metal-based bonded III-nitride-on-silicon wafer. Based on a bit-loading discrete multitone modulation scheme, we establish a visible light communication system using 1 × 1 mm 2 VSLED, which can achieve a data transmission rate of 608 Mbps at a baud rate of 200 MBaud.},

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional van der Waals (vdWs) heterostructures have shown great potential in the field of electronic and optoelectronic applications over the recent decade. However, the controlled preparation of high-quality vdWs heterostructures remains a great challenge ascribing to the incompatibility of different material synthesis processes. Here, we report a two-step chemical vapor deposition method for the growth of high quality WS 2 on a WSe 2 template with a very low temperature of ∼550 °C, where WO 3 nanosheets formed in the first step are further employed as the precursor for synthesis of the top WS 2 layer in the second step. Such low growth temperatures in the second step also enable the effective protection of bottom WSe 2 during the WS 2 growth process and, therefore, result in high-quality WSe 2 /WS 2 heterostructures. Photoluminescence characterizations are further conducted, where significant interlayer exciton emission is observed, indicating strong interlayer coupling in the heterostructure. Based on the obtained WSe 2 /WS 2 heterostructure, dual-channel photosensitive devices were further designed and systematically studied, where high photoresponsivity (3 A/W) as well as fast response speed (&lt;1 ms) are obtained. The developed WO 3 -assisted growth technique would provide an effective reference for the controlled synthesis of high quality vdWs heterostructures and promote further applications in high-performance optoelectronic devices.},

We generate THz waves from two-color laser filaments and determine their polarization states with a detection bandwidth of up to 8 THz using a spinning gallium phosphide crystal. The polarization of THz emission can be controlled by adjusting the position and tilt angle of the β-barium borate crystal. We characterize the precision of this system for polarimetric measurements at fixed time delay to be 1.6 ° and 1.9 ° for complete time-domain waveforms. We also demonstrate the feasibility of our TDP system by measuring broadband optical properties of anisotropic samples in both transmission and reflection geometries. The THz-TDP technique can be easily integrated in conventional THz time-domain spectroscopy setups using nonlinear crystal detectors.},

  abstract     = {A van der Waals heterojunction photodetector has been constructed by vertically stacking a TaIrTe 4 flake, a 2D type-II Weyl semimetal, and a WSe 2 flake, a typical isotropic 2D semiconductor. Interestingly, the device exhibits a switchable operating mode depending on the direction of the voltage bias. Specifically, under a source-drain bias of −1 V, the device operates in a photovoltaic mode, featuring rapid response rate. Its response/recovery time is down to 22.5/25.1 ms, which is approximately one order of magnitude shorter than that of a pristine WSe 2 photodetector (320/360 ms). In contrast, under a source-drain bias of +1 V, the device operates in a photoconductive mode with high photogain. The optimized responsivity reaches 9.1 A/W, and the corresponding external quantum efficiency and detectivity reach 2776\% and 3.09 × 10 12 Jones, respectively. Furthermore, the effective wavelength range of the TaIrTe 4 –WSe 2 device has been extended to the long-wavelength region as compared to a WSe 2 device. Beyond these, by virtue of the highly anisotropic crystal structure of TaIrTe 4 , the hybrid device exhibits polarized photosensitivity. Its anisotropy ratio reaches 1.72 (1.75) under a voltage bias of +1 (−1 V). On the whole, this research work provides a paradigm for the design and implementation of 2D materials based multifunctional optoelectronic devices.},

However, restricted by the volume and available transmission range of the gain medium, the power output and wavelength diversity of guided-wave Brillouin devices are somewhat limited. In this work, we report the design and development of a cascaded Brillouin laser based utilizing a free-space optical layout with a diamond crystal as the Brillouin gain medium. A quasi-continuous-wave, 1 μ m laser was used as the pump laser, and Raman wavelength conversion is used as an intermediate process to facilitate stimulated Brillouin scattering with a low threshold. When the output transmission of the diamond cavity is 0.37\% and the incident pump power is 220 W, cascading of the Brillouin–Stokes field to the eighth Stokes and the seventh anti-Stokes orders was observed. By adjusting the cavity length, the order of the cascaded Brillouin laser output is controlled. A comprehensive analysis of the Brillouin generation process and the cascade of Stokes orders is undertaken for different incident pump powers and cavity lengths. This work is expected to enable practical applications of high-power Brillouin lasers and Brillouin frequency combs.},

However, this process is extremely inefficient and difficult to observe directly in experiments, which also hinders its applications. Here, we propose to enhance significantly the topological phase transitions by c-cut uniaxial crystals. We first give a full-wave theory to describe the spin–orbit interactions of a beam passing through a c-cut uniaxial crystal and experimentally observe the topological phase transition process of the transmitted beam when the angle between the beam propagation direction and the optical axis direction changes. It is found that the efficiency of the spin–orbit interactions caused by the momentum-dependent PB phase can be increased as high as 50\%, which is much larger than that at isotropic sharp interfaces. Our findings provide an alternative approach for manipulating the spin and orbital angular momenta of light and exhibit potential applications in the future spin–orbit photonic components.},

  abstract     = {Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) spectroscopy of bulk quantum materials have provided insight into phenomena, such as quantum phase criticality, magnetism, and superconductivity. With the emergence of nanoscale 2D materials with magnetic phenomena, inductively detected NMR and NQR spectroscopy are not sensitive enough to detect the smaller number of spins in nanomaterials. The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond has shown promise in bringing the analytic power of NMR and NQR spectroscopy to the nanoscale. However, due to depth-dependent formation efficiency of the defect centers, noise from surface spins, band bending effects, and the depth dependence of the nuclear magnetic field, there is ambiguity regarding the ideal NV depth for surface NMR of statistically polarized spins. In this work, we prepared a range of shallow NV ensemble layer depths and determined the ideal NV depth by performing NMR spectroscopy on statistically polarized 19 F in Fomblin oil on the diamond surface. We found that the measurement time needed to achieve a signal-to-noise ratio of 3 using XY8-N noise spectroscopy has a minimum at an NV ensemble depth of 5.5 ± 1.5 nm for ensembles activated from 100 ppm nitrogen concentration. To demonstrate the sensing capabilities of NV ensembles, we perform NQR spectroscopy on the 11 B of hexagonal boron nitride flakes. We compare our best diamond to previous work with a single NV and find that this ensemble provides a shorter measurement time with excitation diameters as small as 4 μ m. This analysis provides ideal conditions for further experiments involving NMR/NQR spectroscopy of 2D materials with magnetic properties.},

The presence of crosstalk decreases the individual addressability, causing erroneous results during simultaneous operations. For superconducting qubits which operate in the microwave regime, electromagnetic isolation is often limited due to design constraints, leading to signal crosstalk that can deteriorate the quality of simultaneous gate operations. Here, we propose and demonstrate a method based on the alternative-current Stark effect for calibrating the microwave signal crosstalk. The method is suitable for processors based on fixed-frequency qubits, which are known for high coherence and simple control. The optimal compensation parameters can be reliably identified from a well-defined interference pattern. We implement the method on an array of seven superconducting qubits and show its effectiveness in removing the majority of crosstalk errors.},

By using TEM characterization combined with transport measurements, the Mg 3 Sb 2 matrix is proposed to have three stages of evolution with the increase in extra Mg content: Mg vacancy-rich (Sb-rich phase) period, Mg vacancy-compensated (nearly no precipitates) period, and Mg vacancy-deficient (Mg-rich phase) period, revealing that the Mg vacancy concentration is a key factor in the intrinsic p-to-n transition. Our work will deepen the understanding of p-to-n transition in Mg 3 Sb 2 -based thermoelectrics and provide valuable references for developing other p/n-coexisted thermoelectrics.},

In spite of low price and nontoxicity, the poor intrinsic electrical properties of Cu 3 SbS 4 restrict its potential commercial applications. Herein, intermediate-phase-free Cu 3 SbS 4 -based bulks were fabricated by incorporating a sulfurization process between melting and sintering, and the as-formed dense twin and domain boundaries in a Sn-doped Cu 3 SbS 4 system can significantly enhance the electrical conductivity and retain a higher level of the Seebeck coefficient based on the energy filtering effect and band flattening and convergence. The high power factor of ∼13.6 μ W cm −1 K −2 and relatively low thermal conductivity are achieved for a 1.5\%Sn-doped Cu 3 SbS 4 sample, resulting in a record zT of ∼0.76 at 623 K in Cu 3 SbS 4 -based systems. This work develops an effective pathway to synthesize intermediate-phase-free Cu 3 SbS 4 -based TE materials and provides an effective strategy for enhancing TE performance in diamond-like semiconductors by interface engineering.},

In order to reduce the anchor loss, perfect matched layer-based finite element analysis simulations are utilized to design and optimize the device. Thanks to the high quality AlScN using magnetron sputtering with a single alloy target, vertical etching profile, and designed device structure, 1- μ m-thick Al 0.7 Sc 0.3 N-based LVRs with high performance are fabricated. The resonator equivalent electric parameters are extracted utilizing the modified Butterworth–Van Dyke model. The best Al 0.7 Sc 0.3 N LVR achieves an electromechanical coupling coefficient ( k t 2 ) of 9.7\% and a loaded quality factor ( Q r ) of 1141.5 operating at approximately 305 MHz. The same resonator shows a motional quality factor ( Q m ) of 1507.2, resulting in a high figure-of-merit ( FoM = k t 2 · Q m ) of 146.2. A 1.8 MHz tuning range is measured for an Al 0.7 Sc 0.3 N LVR by applying DC voltage in the range of −40 to 40 V due to the ferroelectric property of high Sc doping in Al 0.7 Sc 0.3 N. With the high FoM , Q r , Q m , and low motional resistance ( R m ), the Al 0.7 Sc 0.3 N-based LVRs show strong potential in applications of radio frequency communications and piezoelectric transducers.},

Here, we report a possible solution that can extend the working point from the conventional window (10 to 300 K) down to temperatures below 10 K. This method takes advantage of the unexpected resistance up-turn at T &lt; 10 K in gold strips, presumably due to the Kondo effect.

In this work, a frequency comb in 1:3 internal resonance region of an electrostatically coupled microsystem is reported. We demonstrate the occurrence conditions and its influencing factors of the frequency comb. A dynamical explanation, which has good agreement with the experimental results, is presented to further reveal its intrinsic mechanism.

Because of the anisotropic Seebeck coefficient of these inclined PbSe thin films, high TTE voltage signals were detected when the film surfaces were irradiated using various different continuous-wave lasers with wavelengths ranging from the ultraviolet (360 nm) to the far infrared (10.6 μ m). In addition, the amplitudes of the output voltage signals showed good linear dependence on both the radiation power density and the film inclination angle. The results above demonstrate the potential of PbSe for self-powered ultra-broadband light detection applications.},

The charge-carrier dynamics of the two-terminal perovskite-on-Si tandem solar cell in response to a supercontinuum light pulse is studied using transient photocurrent (TPC) measurements. Spectral dependence of TPC lifetime is observed and can be classified into two distinct timescales based on their respective carrier generation regions. The faster timescale (∼500 ns) corresponding to the spectral window (300–750 nm) represents the top-perovskite sub-cell, while the slower timescale regime of ∼25 μ s corresponds to the bottom-Si sub-cell (&gt;700 nm). Additionally, under light-bias conditions, the transient carrier dynamics of the perovskite sub-cell is observed to be coupled with that of the Si sub-cell. A sharp crossover from the fast-response to a slow-response of the device as a function of the light-bias intensity is observed. These results along with a model based on transfer matrix formulation highlight the role of charge-carrier dynamics in accessing higher efficiencies in tandem solar cells. The carrier transit times and lifetimes in addition to their optical properties need to be taken into account for optimizing the performance.},

This study reports the stability and reversibility of insulator-to-metal transition (IMT) in a vanadium dioxide (VO 2 ) thin film grown on flexible glass substrates under the external strain. The systematic application of the external strain was used to demonstrate red and blue shifts in the Raman spectra (ω V-O ) and the corresponding change in the IMT critical temperature. The effects of externally applied tensile strain on the electrical resistance of the VO 2 thin film were discussed concerning the stability and repeatability of the IMT. We demonstrated that the electrical performance of the thin film was nondegradable, although the sample was subjected to multiple cycles of tensile strain. Moreover, these results not only provide essential knowledge for understanding the correlation between the external strain and physical properties of VO 2 thin films but also suggest their applicability as strain-dependent phase-change devices.},

During the imprinting process, the surface smoothness and conductivity of the Au film are obviously optimized with the formation of nanostructures. After integrating proper nanostructures into OLEDs, the photons that trapped by SPPs mode within the device were effectively out-coupled. The current efficiency and luminance have been enhanced 45.3\% and 18.1\%, respectively.

  abstract     = {Using a relativistic symmetrized linear augmented cylindrical wave method, we investigated a formation of spin minigaps due to a torsion strain of the nonchiral hexagonal and gear-like armchair ( n , n ) and zigzag ( n , 0) silicon nanotubes (SiNTs). In the absence of mechanical twisting, the hexagonal ( n , n ) SiNTs have an inversion symmetry and metallic band structures with the spin-degenerate states at the Fermi region. The torsion deformation of hexagonal armchair SiNT breaks the inversion symmetry, transforming it into the chiral system with the right or left screw axis. Due to the combined effect of spin–orbit coupling and low-symmetry perturbation, the degeneration of levels is completely removed and the α and β type bands are formed. The torsion deformation works like a switch, the opposite twisting directions result in the opposite chirality of tubules and induce the opposite spin currents due to Rashba effect. Even in the ideal non-twisted gear-like SiNTs, there is no inversion symmetry. Such tubules have semiconductor band structures with the spin–orbit splittings of the valence and conduction bands. Twisting causes an increase in the antisymmetric component of the potential leading to a monotonic increase in the spin gaps.},

  abstract     = {The boom in high-power-density electronics and advanced pulsed power systems has led to a requirement for high-energy-density dielectric capacitors, for which the key enabler is the availability of dielectric materials with high energy densities and high efficiencies. Although antiferroelectric ceramics are promising dielectric materials with high energy densities, they have low efficiencies. In this study, we address this problem through the core–shell structure design. A phase-field model is developed by considering the core as antiferroelectric and the shell as linear dielectric, and the polarization hysteresis loops are determined. The results show that the polarization–electric field loop of the core–shell sample is slanted, with a delayed saturation polarization, decreased maximum polarization, and declined hysteresis loss compared with the pure sample. This phenomenon becomes more distinct with increasing shell fraction and decreasing shell permittivity, and vanished hysteresis is achieved in samples with a high shell fraction and a low shell permittivity. Through deconvolution, it is determined that the underlying mechanism of energy storage is the difference in the antiferroelectric polarization contribution of various shell parameters. It is found that a giant energy density of 15.5 J/cm 3 and an ultrahigh efficiency of 99.7\% at the saturation polarization can be achieved concurrently for a certain core–shell sample; these values considerably exceed the corresponding values (5.0 J/cm 3 and 52.8\%) for the pure sample. The findings of this study can serve as guidance for engineering core–shell structures, thus paving the way for enhancing the energy-storage performance of antiferroelectric ceramics.},

Thermally annealed Gd:HfO 2 layers with a thickness of 8.8, 6.6, and 4.4 nm exhibited orthorhombic crystalline structure and showed ferroelectric properties. Indeed, polarization vs electric field hysteresis loops were recorded with 2P r polarization ranging from 2 to 20 μ C/cm 2 . The studied layers showed the same coercive electric field (∼2 MV/cm). Consequently, polarization switching voltage between +P r and −P r decreased down to 0.9 V for the thinnest layer. Remanent polarization cycling showed a strong wake-up effect, with no fatigue, up to 10 9 , followed by a stabilization up to 10 10 cycles, where 2P r reached 33 μ C/cm 2 for 8.8 nm Gd:HfO 2 . This endurance result and the absence of noticeable remanent polarization fatigue can be attributed to the optimal chemical composition of the TiN/Gd:HfO 2 interface, which is supposed to be at the origin of defect generation, mostly oxygen vacancies, that leads to ferroelectric polarization fatigue.},

  abstract     = {The spin Hall effect appears in nature in two forms. Its intrinsic form is highly dependent on the crystal symmetry while its extrinsic form stems from impurity scattering. Its efficiency is defined by the spin Hall angle, θ S H ⁠ , and has profound impact on spintronic technologies. However, an accurate measurement of θ S H is not straightforward nor the identification of its origin. In this work, we apply a spin-torque driven ferromagnetic resonance method that is probed in two different ways, optically and electrically, to study the dependence of θ S H in the crystallographic direction in epitaxial Al 2 O 3 /Pt (111), MgO(110)/Pt (110), and MgO(001)/Pt (001) films. We show that the electrical technique is limited in its ability to accurately quantify θ S H at high current densities, and in some cases, it may even result in erroneous θ S H values. Such cases include films that exhibit a large inhomogeneous broadening. We find that θ S H is strongly affected by the crystallographic direction. Our study extends the understanding of one of the most commonly used methods for the exploration of the spin Hall effect.},

We obtain a large Kerr rotation angle of 10 mdeg, comparable with bulk single-crystal Mn 3 Sn. The composition x dependence of AHE and MOKE shows a similar trend, suggesting the same origin, i.e., the non-vanishing Berry curvature in the momentum space. Magnetic domain observation at the saturated state shows that x dependence of AHE and MOKE is explained by the amount of the reversible area that crucially depends on the crystalline structure of the film. Furthermore, in-depth observation of the reversal process reveals that the reversal starts with nucleation of sub-micrometer-scale domains dispersed in the film, followed by domain expansion, where the domain wall preferentially propagates along the [ 11 2 ¯ 0 ] direction.

Here, we report THz emission from two-color femtosecond laser plasma filaments modulated by a 60-kV/cm THz pulse from W/CoFeB/Pt heterostructures. Enhanced THz radiation based on electron acceleration in plasma is recorded when the direction of the spintronic THz modulating field is in line with that of the electron movement. This behavior is quantitatively reproduced by a local current model of the plasma THz source.

In addition, the MnPtGa film undergoes a spin reorientation transition at T sr = 160 K. We investigated the MnPtGa magnetic ground states using single-crystal neutron diffraction. A structurally forbidden (001) magnetic Bragg reflection emerges below T sr , indicating the existence of a spin-canted state, where the magnetic moments align ferromagnetically perpendicular to the basal plane, and a non-zero in-plane component exhibits an antiferromagnetic ordering along the c -axis. At 2 K, the refined magnetic moments of Mn are μ z = 4.2(4) μ B and μ x = 1.5(3) μ B , projected onto the c -axis and basal plane, respectively.

In this study, we artificially created a Pt/Co/MgO system with the regions exhibiting different anisotropy, that is, IM and PM regions, and the chirality-induced EMF at the PM/IM boundary was investigated using it. The EMF in the IM region was probed using magnetoresistance (MR) measurements. When the field was applied orthogonally to the wire, a unidirectional shift of the MR curve was observed, indicating that the EMF exists in the IM region. The dependence of the EMF on the width of the IM region suggests that the EMF acts dominantly on the magnetization near the PM/IM boundary. Moreover, the sign of the shift is reversed with reversing the PM direction. The sign and magnitude of the EMF observed in this study suggest that the EMF in the present system is caused by iDMI.},

  abstract     = {Single femtosecond-pulse toggle switching of ferrimagnetic alloys is an essential building block for ultrafast spintronics. It is believed that for switching to occur in these ferrimagnets, the individual sublattices must have very different (element-specific) demagnetization dynamics. This suggests that ferrimagnets composed of two different elements, such as rare-earth transition-metal alloys, are necessary for switching. However, experimental observations of toggle switching in the Heusler alloy Mn 2 Ru x Ga, which has two crystallographically nonequivalent Mn sublattices with antiparallel aligned moments, have questioned these assertions. To shed some light on this question, we present an atomistic spin model for the simulation of single pulse toggle switching of Mn 2 Ru x Ga. The magnetic parameters entering our model are extracted from previous experimental observations. We show that our model is able to quantitatively reproduce the experimentally measured magnetization dynamics of single pulse toggle switching. We demonstrate that toggle switching in Mn 2 Ru x Ga is possible even when both Mn sublattices demagnetize at very similar rates, in contradiction to the previous hypothesis about the importance of element-specific demagnetization rates in this process.},

  abstract     = {Ultra-wide bandgap (UWBG) semiconductors have great potential for high-power electronics, radio frequency electronics, deep ultraviolet optoelectronic devices, and quantum information technology. Recently, the two-dimensional UWBG GaPS 4 was first applied to the solar-blind photodetector in experiments, which was found to have remarkable performance, such as high responsivity, high quantum efficiency, etc., and promising applications in optoelectronic devices. However, the knowledge of monolayer (ML) GaPS 4 for us is quite limited, which hinders its design and application in optoelectronic devices. Here, we focus on the properties of electronic structure and intrinsic defects in ML GaPS 4 by first-principles calculations. We confirmed that the fundamental gap of ML GaPS 4 is 3.87 eV ⁠ , while the optical gap is 4.22 eV ⁠ . This discrepancy can be attributed to the inversion symmetry of its structure, which limits the dipole transitions from valence band edges to conduction band edges. Furthermore, we found that intrinsic defects are neither efficient p -type nor n -type dopants in ML GaPS 4 , which is consistent with experimental observations. Our results also show that if one expects to achieve p -type ML GaPS 4 by selecting the appropriate dopant, P-rich conditions should be avoided for the growth process, while for achieving n -type doping, S-rich growth conditions are inappropriate. This is because due to the low strain energy, P S ( c ) + has very low formation energy, which leads to the Fermi levels ( ⁠ E F ⁠ ) pinning at 0.35 eV above the valence band maximum and is not beneficial to achieve p -type ML GaPS 4 under the P-rich conditions; the large lattice relaxation largely lowers the formation energy of S G a − ⁠ , which causes the E F pinning at 0.72 eV below the conduction band minimum and severely prevents ML GaPS 4 from being n -type doping under the S-rich conditions. Our studies of these fundamental physical properties will be useful for future applications of ML GaPS 4 in optoelectronic devices.},

  abstract     = {The ultra-wide bandgap of Al-rich AlGaN is expected to support a significantly larger breakdown field compared to GaN, but the reported performance thus far has been limited by the use of foreign substrates. In this Letter, the material and electrical properties of Al 0.85 Ga 0.15 N/Al 0.6 Ga 0.4 N high electron mobility transistors (HEMT) grown on a 2-in. single crystal AlN substrate are investigated, and it is demonstrated that native AlN substrates unlock the potential for Al-rich AlGaN to sustain large fields in such devices. We further study how Ohmic contacts made directly to a Si-doped channel layer reduce the knee voltage and increase the output current density. High-quality AlGaN growth is confirmed via scanning transmission electron microscopy, which also reveals the absence of metal penetration at the Ohmic contact interface and is in contrast to established GaN HEMT technology. Two-terminal mesa breakdown characteristics with 1.3 μ m separation possess a record-high breakdown field strength of ∼11.5 MV/cm for an undoped Al 0.6 Ga 0.4 N-channel layer. The breakdown voltages for three-terminal devices measured with gate-drain distances of 4 and 9 μ m are 850 and 1500 V, respectively.},

The films annealed at temperatures above 600 °C are found to exhibit a pure monolithic phase with a bandgap of 4.7 eV. The thermally activated donor ionization and dielectric relaxation of these films are systematically investigated by temperature-dependent DC and AC conductivity measurements, and complex electric modulus analysis. A donor level at ∼180 meV below the conduction band edge and a small polaron tunneling (SPT) relaxation with an activation energy of ∼180 meV are observed in the as-grown amorphous Ga 2 O 3 film but not in the monolithic β-Ga 2 O 3 film. The SPT occurs between donor sites with its thermal relaxation of polarization being associated with the thermal ionization of the donor state. Thermal annealing of the amorphous films removes the 180 meV donors as well the corresponding SPT relaxation.},

Here we report on resonant Raman experiments based on a graded composition W x Mo 1– x S 2 alloy with tunable exciton energy without changing the energy of excitation laser. The intensities of the four most pronounced Raman features in the alloy are dramatically enhanced due to the resonance derived from the energy of B exciton shifting to the vicinity of the energy of excitation laser with an increase in W composition x . Specifically, through the resonance peak shift, absorption spectra and PL emission spectra under different excitation power, we conclude the resonance Raman is related to the exciton emission process. Our study extends the resonant Raman study of two-dimensional materials, which is expected to obtain deeper understanding of the excitonic effects in two-dimensional semiconductor materials.},

The analysis of the energy where electron tunneling most frequently occurs revealed that field emission (FE) tunneling dominates conduction instead of thermionic field emission (TFE) under a higher electric field in reverse-biased heavily doped SiC SBDs, while forward I – V characteristics are described only by TFE. In addition, the critical electric field for the TFE–FE transition is quantitatively clarified by carefully considering the sharply changing electric field distribution in SiC with a high donor concentration.},

Under sub-microsecond pulsing, a moderate DC-RF dispersion (current collapse) is observed before passivation in gate lag measurements, while no current collapse is observed in the drain lag measurements. The dispersion in the gate lag is possibly attributed to interface traps in the gate–drain access region. DC-RF dispersion did not show any strong dependence on the pulse widths. Temperature dependent RF measurements up to 250 °C do not show degradation in the cutoff frequencies. After Si 3 N 4 deposition at 350 °C, a shift of the threshold voltage is observed which changed the DC characteristics. However, the current collapse is eliminated; at 200 ns pulse widths, a 50\% higher current is observed compared to the DC at high drain voltages. No current collapse is observed even at higher temperatures. RF performance of the passivated devices does not show degradation. These results show that ex situ deposited Si 3 N 4 is a potential candidate for passivation of β -(Al x Ga 1−x ) 2 O 3 /Ga 2 O 3 HFETs.},

It is still quite challenging to accurately enlarge the bandgap to achieve high performance and stable blue Quasi-2D perovskite LEDs. The lattice strain due to the deformation of lead-bromide octahedra is a critical factor leading to the energy band adjustment and stability optimization. In this Letter, the lattice strain is adjusted via three cations with different sizes, Cs + , CH 3 CH 2 NH 2 + (EA + ), and Rb + , for sophisticatedly micro-tuning of the lattice strain to achieve overall lattice expansion and lattice contraction. A ternary quasi-2D blue bromide perovskite material PEA 2 (Cs x EA y Rb 1-x-y PbBr 3 ) 2 PbBr 4 is specially designed. The crystal structure and energy band are studied by the first principles calculations using the Density Functional Theory method. The luminescence properties of blue quasi-2D lead bromide perovskite materials are analyzed with spectra regulation from 508 to 464 nm for photoluminescence and from 510 to 470 nm for electroluminescence. The thermal treatment is used to accelerate the release of residual strain due to mismatch and disorder in the lattice, leading to defects and degradation. The lattice strain is strongly correlated with the energy band, luminescence performance, and thermal stability of blue quasi-2D lead bromide perovskite. The study of lattice strain relaxation in blue quasi-2D lead bromide perovskite could open avenues for high-performance and stable blue quasi-2D perovskite LEDs.},

Analysis of body centered cubic (BCC) and hexagonal close packed (HCP) lattices revealed an abrupt, nonlinear shift in the lattice parameters of both phases just after the HCP phase had nucleated. Postmortem transmission electron microscopy confirmed that V diffusion was mostly suppressed during cooling. Together, these results indicate that at this cooling rate of approximately 10 4 K/s, which is representative of cooling rates of many additive manufacturing and welding processes, kinematic coherency of the BCC–HCP interfaces gives rise to the anomalous lattice expansion and contraction behaviors of both phases during the initial nucleation and growth stages of (mostly) martensitic transformation from BCC to HCP; the role of diffusion in such lattice anomalies is shown to be minimal.},

However, static passive radiative cooling systems with a fixed thermal emissivity cannot automatically regulate emission in response to varying ambient temperature. Here, we propose an intelligent cooling system composed of nanoporous polyethylene, which acts as a solar reflector and a nanograting radiative cooler using the phase-transition material vanadium dioxide (VO 2 ) and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). The top reflector enables the cooling system to reflect solar irradiation during the daytime, and the bottom cooler plays the role of switching radiative cooling in the spectrum band (8 μ m &lt; λ &lt; 13 μ m) due to the phase transition characteristic of VO 2 , contributing to the temperature of radiative cooler near a critical temperature. Meanwhile, continuous stretching of the material can achieve dynamic radiative cooling via deformation of the elastic PDMS substrate to realize different desired cooling temperatures. The proposed VO 2 -PDMS-driven radiative cooling system can not only intelligently switch between “on” and “off” radiative cooling modes but also adjust thermal comfort in its on mode in response to changes in the ambient temperature. This work has a great potential to be applied in the intelligent temperature regulation of buildings, vehicles, and utilities.},

To date, spin-decoupled metasurfaces can only spatially split and deflect beams in coplanar directions not in non-coplanar, limiting further applications. Here, a single metasurface is proposed to experimentally as well as numerically demonstrate the spin-decoupled omnidirectional anomalous refraction. The results indicate that the three-dimensionally omnidirectional dual-beam refractions are attributed to arbitrary engineering of spin-independent phase gradients along any in-plane orientations of the single metasurface. It is believed that the proposed spin-decoupled omnidirectional metasurfaces are promising candidates for multifunctional applications in compact spin-based nanophotonic systems, such as polarized beam splitting, steering, and polarimeter.},

In this paper, we study the interfacial heat transfer between water and gold, nanostructuring the gold surface and coating it with graphene. By trapping air (or vacuum in our simulations) between graphene and the nanopatterned surface, we observe a considerable increase in the interfacial resistance compared to the planar gold situation, which is shown to scale with the effective graphene–gold contact surface for both monolayer and multilayer graphene. With the massive thermal resistances we predict (up to 200 nm in terms of Kapitza length), the system proposed here represents a robust alternative to superhydrophobic Cassie materials. Moreover, since the low thermal conductance is achieved primarily due to geometry (vacuum trapping), it is straightforward to extend our results to any material with a structure equivalent to that of the nanopatterned gold wall considered here.},

  abstract     = {Recent development on Ge 1−x Sn x nanowires with high Sn content, beyond its solid solubility limit, makes them attractive for all group-IV Si-integrated infrared photonics at the nanoscale. Herein, we report a chemical vapor deposition-grown high Sn-content Ge–Ge 0.92 Sn 0.08 core–shell based single nanowire photodetector operating at the optical communication wavelength of 1.55 μ m. The atomic concentration of Sn in nanowires has been studied using x-ray photoelectron and Raman spectroscopy data. A metal–semiconductor–metal based single nanowire photodetector, fabricated via an electron beam lithography process, exhibits significant room-temperature photoresponse even at zero bias. In addition to the high-crystalline quality and identical shell composition of the nanowire, the efficient collection of photogenerated carriers under an external electric field results in the superior responsivity and photoconductive gain as high as ∼70.8 A/W and ∼57, respectively, at an applied bias of −1.0 V. The extra-ordinary performance of the fabricated photodetector demonstrates the potential of GeSn nanowires for future Si CMOS compatible on-chip optical communication device applications.},

However, narrower linewidth lasers are more desirable for high-resolution molecular spectroscopy applications. This work narrows the spectral linewidth of an interband cascade laser from about 530 kHz down to about 30 kHz by applying optical feedback from an external mirror. In contrast to common laser diodes, the linewidth reduction of interband cascade lasers does not require any feedback phase control, which significantly simplifies the experimental configuration, and hence, is highly favorable for practical applications.},

  abstract     = {Despite graphene being an attractive transparent conductive electrode for semiconductor deep ultraviolet (UV) light emitting diodes (LEDs), there have been no experimental demonstrations of any kind of semiconductor deep UV LEDs using a graphene electrode. Moreover, although aluminum gallium nitride (AlGaN) alloys in the format of nanowires are an appealing platform for surface-emitting vertical semiconductor deep UV LEDs, in particular, at short wavelengths, there are few demonstrations of AlGaN nanowire UV LEDs with a graphene electrode. In this work, we show that transferred graphene can serve as the top electrode for AlGaN nanowire deep UV LEDs, and devices emitting down to around 240 nm are demonstrated. Compared to using metal, graphene improves both the light output power and external quantum efficiency. Nonetheless, devices with a graphene electrode show a more severe efficiency droop compared to devices with metal. Here, we attribute the heating effect associated with the large contact resistance to be the major reason for the severe efficiency droop in the devices with a graphene electrode. Detailed scanning electron microscopy and Raman scattering experiments suggest that the nanowire height nonuniformity is the main cause for the large contact resistance; this issue could be potentially alleviated by using nanowires grown by selective area epitaxy that is able to produce nanowires with uniform height. This work, therefore, not only demonstrates the shortest wavelength LEDs using a graphene electrode but also provides a viable path for surface-emitting vertical semiconductor deep UV LEDs at short wavelengths.},

However, the comprehensive study on mechanical properties of micro-spring has not been fully conducted yet due to a lack of reliable productions of varied-shaped micro-springs. Here, we report the design and manufacturing of triple-helix-shaped springs employing two-photon polymerization (TPP) technologies and present a systemic study on the mechanical properties of micro-springs particularly involving spring constants of k . To construct high-quality hollow microstructures, we optimize the TPP process by combining violet light post-treatment with a proper selection of cleaning liquid. Consequently, we demonstrate that the sensitives k can be actively tuned over a range of two orders of magnitude, from ∼1.5 to ∼108.2 μ N/ μ m while maintaining a high resolution of ∼1 μ N/ μ m. Furthermore, compression tests showcase an excellent agreement among all force-vs-displacement lineshapes, resulting in a small k fluctuation of &lt;1\%. On the whole, we expected that the modified TPP technique along with proposed helical springs opens an alternative avenue toward micro-scale force detection, leading to potential applications in the field of bio-sensing, where typical forces to be measured exist within a broad range from several piconewtons to several micronewtons.},

  abstract     = {Recently, organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) are becoming increasingly attractive to information security, wearable healthcare, and other fields. These fields propose different requirements for performances of OLEDs, especially for voltage-controlled color tunability. In this study, it is proposed to use an ultrathin layer consisting of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) material as an emitting layer of OLEDs. On the one hand, compared to devices with an ultrathin phosphorescent emitting layer, the OLEDs with TADF show observable color-tunability. On the other hand, the color-tunable OLEDs with TADF show much higher efficiency than the color-tunable fluorescent OLEDs. It demonstrates that the reverse intersystem crossing process not only enhances the exciton utilization efficiency but also leads to an insufficient host-guest energy transfer. With this strategy, a color-tunable OLED is achieved with an external quantum efficiency about 8\% and shows color variations over (0.04, 0.08) when its bias voltage increases from 4 to 8 V. By combining with a patterned mask technique, the color-tunable OLEDs can potentially be applied to the field of anti-counterfeiting and status lighting.},

A lower noise level than that of conventional QEPAS is achieved due to the optimal matching between the elliptical resonator and the beam profile, hence resulting in a ∼3 times higher signal-to-noise ratio gain factor compared with the circular resonator. The parameters of the elliptical resonator are optimized, and a 1 σ normalized noise equivalent absorption coefficient of 3.4 × 10 −8 cm −1 W/Hz 1/2 is obtained for dry NO 2 detection at normal atmospheric pressure.

  abstract     = {Point by point strain scanning is often used to map the residual stress (strain) in engineering materials and components. However, the gauge volume and, hence, spatial resolution are limited by the beam defining apertures and can be anisotropic for very low and high diffraction (scattering) angles. Alternatively, wavelength resolved neutron transmission imaging has a potential to retrieve information tomographically about residual strain induced within materials through measurement in transmission of Bragg edges—crystallographic fingerprints whose locations and shapes depend on microstructure and strain distribution. In such a case, the spatial resolution is determined by the geometrical blurring of the measurement setup and the detector point spread function. Mathematically, reconstruction of the strain tensor field is described by the longitudinal ray transform; this transform has a non-trivial null-space, making direct inversion impossible. A combination of the longitudinal ray transform with physical constraints was used to reconstruct strain tensor fields in convex objects. To relax physical constraints and generalize reconstruction, a recently introduced concept of histogram tomography can be employed. Histogram tomography relies on our ability to resolve the distribution of strain in the beam direction, as we discuss in the paper. More specifically, Bragg edge strain tomography requires extraction of the second moment (variance about zero) of the strain distribution, which has not yet been demonstrated in practice. In this paper, we verify experimentally that the second moment can be reliably measured for a previously well characterized aluminum ring and plug sample. We compare experimental measurements against numerical calculation and further support our conclusions by rigorous uncertainty quantification of the estimated mean and variance of the strain distribution.},

For the next generation of devices, materials that are able to maintain low microwave losses while providing new functionalities, such as large kinetic inductance or compatibility with CMOS platform, are needed. Here, we report on a combined direct current and microwave investigation of titanium nitride films of different thicknesses grown using CMOS compatible methods. For microwave resonators made of 3 nm thick TiN, we measured large kinetic inductance L K ∼ 240 pH/sq, high mode impedance of ∼ 4.2 kΩ while maintaining microwave quality factor ∼ 10 5 in the single photon limit. We present an in-depth study of the microwave loss mechanisms in these devices that indicates the importance of quasiparticles and provide insight for further improvement.},

  abstract     = {In this work, both thermal and electrical transport properties of diamond-cubic Si (Si-I) and metastable R8 phases of Si (Si-XII) are comparatively studied by using first-principles calculations combined with the Boltzmann transport theory. The metastable Si-XII shows one magnitude lower lattice thermal conductivity than stable Si-I from 300 to 500 K, attributed from the stronger phonon scattering in three-phonon scattering processes of Si-XII. For electronic transport properties, although Si-XII with smaller bandgap (0.22 eV) shows a lower Seebeck coefficient, the electrical conductivities of anisotropic n -type Si-XII show considerable values along the x axis due to the small effective masses of electrons along this direction. The peaks of the thermoelectric figure of merit ( ZT ) in n -type Si-XII are higher than that of p -type ones along the same direction. Owing to the lower lattice thermal conductivity and optimistic electrical conductivity, Si-XII exhibits larger optimal ZT compared with Si-I in both p - and n -type doping. For n -type Si-XII, the optimal ZT values at 300, 400, and 500 K can reach 0.24, 0.43, and 0.63 along the x axis at carrier concentrations of 2.6 × 10 19 , 4.1 × 10 19 ⁠ , and 4.8 × 10 19 cm −3 , respectively. The reported results elucidate that the metastable Si could be integrated to the thermoelectric power generator.},

The viscoelasticity changes of the blood from a liquid to a clot can provide critical information for assessing blood coagulation. Here, we reported on noncontact monitoring of blood coagulation under static and flow conditions with optical coherence tomography (OCT) autocorrelation analysis. After OCT imaging, blood tissue dynamics were assessed by the OCT autocorrelation analysis during coagulation of the whole porcine blood. The properties of blood coagulation were quantitatively evaluated by three metrics, including the coagulation reaction time, the clot formation duration, and the maximum clot strength. The results show that the OCT autocorrelation method can quantify the coagulation properties under static and flow conditions and provides a unique opportunity for in situ coagulation detection and point-of-care testing.},

However, plasmonic heat generation always limits its applications in capturing particles or biomacromolecules that are vulnerable to high temperatures. Here, we propose nanorefrigerative tweezers based on a single refrigerative nanocrystal, which can form a nanometer-sized cold-spot via anti-Stokes fluorescence. Numerical simulations are performed to compute the temperature and velocity fields. The results show that thermo-osmosis and thermophoresis play major roles in nanoparticle manipulation, while natural convection in the nanoscale is negligible. This tweezing scheme not only offers a sub-diffraction-limit way to manipulate nano-objects but also avoids possible thermal damage to the trapped targets. Therefore, it will potentially become a powerful tool in biomedical and biosensing research studies.},

A sixfold increment in quality factor is found when temperature decreases from room temperature ( Q = 5000) to 7 K ( Q = 30 000), and thus, a frequency-quality factor product of 1.5 × 10 14 is obtained.

The Mie resonator with a subwavelength scale is constructed with a non-uniform structure, which can generate Mie resonance with dipole-like characteristic. Two kinds of coding elements are introduced by horizontally or vertically reversing the Mie resonator in each element. To verify the performance of the designed coding metamaterials, three specific metamaterial patterns are fabricated to give different trajectories of sound propagation. Our finding may open an avenue for designing acoustic metamaterials and is expected to design intelligent acoustic devices with exciting reconfigurable and programmable applications.},

In addition, the parametric plot, which shows the planar Hall resistivity as a function of the in-plane anisotropic magnetoresistivity, has an ellipse-shaped pattern with a shifted orbital center, which further strengthens the evidence for the conductivity fluctuations.

The results show that the direction of the magnetic field has significant effects on the critical field values and the magnetic structure of this compound, which lead to different magnetotransport behaviors. The field-driven reorientation transitions can be utilized to estimate the antiferromagnetic interlayer exchange interaction coupling Jc and uniaxial magnetic anisotropy D .

In this work, we synthesize highly (111)-oriented La-doped HfO 2 (HLO) ferroelectric thin films via pulsed laser deposition. Furthermore, the effect of La dopant concentration, thickness, and growth temperature on the ferroelectricity of HLO films is investigated in detail. A maximum remnant polarization of ∼9 μ C/cm 2 is achieved for only the 5-nm-thick 3 mol.\% HLO films without a wake-up process. The 180° inversion of the domain, the butterfly-shaped capacitance–voltage curve, and typical ferroelectric displacement current curve further demonstrate the robust ferroelectricity at the nanoscale. Moreover, the phase evolves from the monoclinic to the orthorhombic and subsequently to the cubic phase with increasing La concentration, which is due to the combined action of oxygen vacancy, epitaxial strain, and chemical pressure. Additionally, in the interface configuration of HLO/La 0.7 Sr 0.3 MnO 3 (LSMO), the MnO 2 0.7− layer is substituted by the HLO layer on the MnO 2 -terminated surface of LSMO, which can be attributed to the fact that the HLO layer with higher electronegativity replaces the MnO 2 0.7− layer with the same electronegativity in the HLO film. Therefore, this study provides a reliable pathway for directly obtaining a lightly doped HLO ferroelectric thin film, which can help to broaden the understanding of the ferroelectric physical mechanisms with element doping.},

  abstract     = {Spontaneous Raman spectroscopy (SR) is a versatile method for analysis and visualization of ferroelectric crystal structures, including domain walls. Nevertheless, the necessary acquisition time makes SR impractical for in situ analysis and large scale imaging. In this work, we introduce broadband coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy (B-CARS) as a high-speed alternative to conventional Raman techniques and demonstrate its benefits for ferroelectric domain wall analysis. Using the example of poled lithium niobate, we compare the spectral output of both techniques in terms of domain wall signatures and imaging capabilities. We extract the Raman-like resonant part of the coherent anti-Stokes signal via a Kramers–Kronig-based phase retrieval algorithm and compare the raw and phase-retrieved signals to SR characteristics. Finally, we propose a mechanism for the observed domain wall signal strength that resembles a Čerenkov-like behavior, in close analogy to domain wall signatures obtained by second-harmonic generation imaging. We, thus, lay here the foundations for future investigations on other poled ferroelectric crystals using B-CARS.},

  abstract     = {We present a hybrid microwave superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) multiplexer that combines two frequency-division multiplexing techniques to allow multiplexing a given number of cryogenic detectors with only a fraction of frequency encoding resonators. Similar to conventional microwave SQUID multiplexing, our multiplexer relies on inductively coupling non-hysteretic, unshunted rf-SQUIDs to superconducting microwave resonators as well as applying flux ramp modulation for output signal linearization. However, instead of utilizing one resonator per SQUID, we couple multiple SQUIDs to a common readout resonator and encode the SQUID input signals in sidebands of the microwave carrier by varying the flux ramp modulation frequency for each SQUID. We prove the suitability of our approach using a prototype device and argue by means of fundamental information theory that our approach is particularly suited for reading out large cryogenic bolometer arrays.},

We demonstrate that the selection of the laser excitation wavelength is of importance for achieving optimal magnetic field sensitivity. The PDMR sensitivity obtained using a yellow-green (561 nm) laser surpasses the performances of a green laser (532 nm), by suppressing the photoionization of defects other than NV centers (such as P1 centers). It consequently allows to carry out the PDMR measurements at lower laser powers with increased magnetic resonance contrast.

Here, based on the density of functional theory, we study the electronic structures and magnetic properties of the Janus FeBrI/In 2 S 3 multiferroic heterostructure. The Curie temperature and magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE) can be modulated by the ferroelectric polarization due to the interfacial charge redistribution. According to the orbital-resolved magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy ( E MCA ) and the second-order perturbation theory, the difference of E MCA mainly stems from the change in electronic states near the Fermi level, which is associated with interfacial charge redistribution in different ferroelectric polarization directions. These findings not only reveal the physical mechanism of the change of MAE in detail but also suggest a feasible strategy to modulate the magnetic properties.},

Following an Ohmic regime for bias lower than 0.1 V, a transition to a space-charge limited regime occurred for higher bias. This transition appears to change with the doping level and is studied within the framework of the simplified theory of space-charge limited current assisted by traps. For the least doped samples, a single, doping independent trapping behavior is observed. For the most doped samples, an electron trap with an energy level around 150 meV below the conduction band is identified. The density of these traps increases with a Si doping level, consistent with a self-compensation mechanism reported in the literature. The results are in accordance with the presence of Si atoms that have three different configurations: one shallow state and two DX centers.},

Here, we probe the bulk plasmon modes in silicon in the vicinity of a copper plate perforated by a single aperture at frequencies between 10 and 60 GHz. Sharp transmission minima are observed at discrete frequencies. The observed frequencies depend on the size of the aperture and the carrier concentration in the silicon; they are well reproduced by the dispersion relation for bulk plasmons.

Having atomically thin thickness and high theoretical carrier mobility, TMDs are attractive semiconductors for future dense and high-performance 3D IC, and 2D hexagonal boron nitride ( h -BN) as a gate dielectric is known to significantly improve TMD device performance. However, h -BN growth requires 1000 °C temperature that is not compatible with CMOS fabrication, and ALD deposition of any high-k 2D insulator on TMD continues to be an elusive goal. The epitaxial 2D layered h -AlN by low-temperature ALD is characterized by synchrotron-based grazing-incidence wide-angle x-ray scattering and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. In addition, we demonstrate the feasibility of using layered h -AlN as an interfacial layer between WS 2 and ALD HfO 2 .

Here, we study electrical transport properties of Ta 2 Pd 3 Te 5 single crystals. Ta 2 Pd 3 Te 5 shows an insulating behavior with a trend of saturation below 20 K. The activity energy determined from the fits to polaron hopping model is E a ∼ 36.1 meV, close to the value of 42 meV determined from previous scanning tunneling microscopy measurement. The linear Hall resistivity with a negative slope suggests an n-type conductivity for bulk Ta 2 Pd 3 Te 5 . The magnetoresistance (MR) is positive at 2 K, and the dip-like feature at low magnetic fields is attributed to the weak antilocalization effect. On the other hand, a negative low-field MR develops in the temperature range between 5 and 30 K, which is identified as a fingerprint of the weak localization effect. Such a transition from weak antilocalization to weak localization with increasing temperature reveals that the spin–orbit interaction plays an important role in Ta 2 Pd 3 Te 5 .

Usually, the image recording system requires stable mechanical movement and accurate alignment between different phase-shift images, which greatly limits the imaging speed and stability, resulting in mismatch or low phase retrieval quality. In this work, we propose a single-shot polarization-sensitive phase retrieval developed from triple transport of the intensity method with anisotropic metasurface. By applying gradient phase along the interface, three images with diffractive phase differences are projected on the recording plane. The three images are formed with known diffraction distances due to the conjugate Pancharatnam−Berry phase modulation of metasurface. The recorded images are calculated and post-processed using transport of intensity equation technique to obtain the phase of object. As a proof-of-principle, we demonstrate the phase imaging results through measuring phase-only objects with single-shot capture. Compared to traditional transport-of-intensity equation optical systems, our method requires no mechanical or system tuning, and polarization or electric controller switching. Thus, it can acquire three differently focused images with single-shot. This significantly improves the time efficiency of the experiments. Such compact metadevice with simplified manipulation and easy post-processing for phase retrieval can be applied to various applications, such as optical microscopy, fluid measurement, and on-ship integration.},

Potential applications include diagnostic medical imaging, super-absorption, acoustic sensing, and acoustic stealth. In spite of recent progress, the investigation of AMs with a three-dimensional (3D) response is lagging behind, in particular for those that exhibit an isotropic response. Here, we demonstrate a highly compact subwavelength maze-like multi-shell plastic sphere, which generates Mie resonances with isotropic monopolar and anisotropic dipole, quadrupole, and octupole modes at low frequencies for airborne sound, based on an octahedral structure. Eigenmode analysis shows that the proposed maze ball exhibits a negative bulk modulus at the monopole Mie resonance frequency in the absence of viscous losses, which is a signature of strong transmission blocking. With a diameter of 0.17 λ and a volume filling factor of 13.5\%, a constructed single 3D maze ball reduces the experimentally-measured transmitted acoustic energy by 67\%, limited mainly by viscous losses. With optimized fabrication, the proposed 3D Mie resonator should provide a versatile approach for the manipulation of sound waves on a subwavelength scale, and lead to the realization of practical 3D metamaterial devices.},

Here, we demonstrate a linear suppression of electrical resistivity for correlated metallic SrVO 3 epitaxial films in a continuous and reversible fashion through the converse piezoelectric response-generated linear lateral compressive strain of ferroelectric Pb(Mg 1/3 Nb 2/3 )O 3 -PbTiO 3 substrates. By precisely tailoring the polarization domain configuration of the substrate, a lateral tensile strain can also be dynamically induced into films and, thus, can robustly increase the resistivity due to reduced effective electronic bandwidth and enhanced electron–electron interaction. Particularly, the electrically triggered nonvolatile opening and closing of a metal–insulator transition is driven by the ferroelastic strain-controlled Mott gap. Our findings illustrate the vital role of an electric field in controlling the lattice degree of freedom and electron correlation and provide a framework for exploring the essential physics of the straintronic effect in correlated metallic oxides.},

  abstract     = {We investigate the stoichiometry of a TiO 2 -rich SrTiO 3 (001) surface by depositing less than one monolayer of SrO under typical epitaxy conditions. We find that this deposition yields atomically flat islands on the step-and-terrace surface. All these islands have a height of exactly one full SrTiO 3 unit cell, instead of the expected half unit cell. Reflection high-energy electron diffraction indicates that a reconstruction occurs on the bare surface, which disappears with SrO deposition. To explain these results, we propose a simple model with two key elements: (i) a TiO 2 double layer must intrinsically be present on the as-prepared SrTiO 3 (001) surface, and (ii) with deposited SrO, this top layer rearranges itself to form islands with a height of one unit cell.},

Photoinduced force microscopy (PiFM) is a promising local spectroscopic technique to visualize nanoscale local optical responses by measuring the optical forces between the scanning tip and sample. In this study, we examined isolated single quantum dots (QDs) with ligands on a gold substrate via PiFM under ultra-high vacuum to characterize the QD adsorption state on the basis of the optical force. The strong self-consistent optical interaction through the tip-substrate plasmonic gap induced by laser light modulates the PiFM image depending on QD crystal existence in the gap. This observation clarified the QD absorption situation on the substrate, and the crystal position in the QDs was determined even though the ligand walls covered the crystal. This insight concerning force spectroscopy can aid further research on the photochemistry of nanostructured materials and molecular spectroscopy.},

  abstract     = {A ferromagnetic metal consists of localized electrons and conduction electrons coupled through strong exchange interaction. Together, these localized electrons contribute to the magnetization of the system, while conduction electrons lead to the formation of spin and charge current. Femtosecond out of equilibrium photoexcitation of ferromagnetic thin films generates a transient spin current at ultrafast timescales that have opened a route to probe magnetism offered by the conduction electrons. In the presence of a neighboring heavy metal layer, the non-equilibrium spin current is converted into a pulsed charge current and gives rise to terahertz (THz) emission. Here, we propose and demonstrate a tool known as the terahertz spintronic magnetometry. The hysteresis loop obtained by sweeping terahertz (THz) pulse amplitude as a function of the magnetic field is in excellent agreement with the vibrating-sample magnetometer measurements. Furthermore, a modified transfer-matrix method employed to model the THz propagation within the heterostructure theoretically elucidates a linear relationship between the THz pulse amplitude and sample magnetization. The strong correlation, thus, reveals spintronic terahertz emission as an ultrafast magnetometry tool with reliable in-plane magnetization detection, highlighting its technological importance in the characterization of ferromagnetic thin-films through terahertz spintronic emission spectroscopy.},

Molecular beam epitaxial (MBE) growth of highly doped InAs has emerged as a promising “designer metal” platform for the plasmonic enhancement of mid-infrared devices. However, while typical plasmonic materials can be patterned to engineer strong localized resonances, the lack of lateral control in conventional MBE growth makes it challenging to create similar structures compatible with monolithically grown plasmonic InAs. To this end, we report the growth of highly doped InAs plasmonic ridges for the localized resonant enhancement of mid-IR emitters and absorbers. Furthermore, we demonstrate a method for regaining a planar surface above plasmonic corrugations, creating a pathway to epitaxially integrate these structures into active devices that leverage conventional growth and fabrication techniques.},

The sensor is based on the nonlinear magneto-optical rotation effect: in a Bell–Bloom configuration, a higher order polarization moment (alignment) of Cs atoms is created with a pump laser beam in an anti-relaxation coated Pyrex cell under vacuum, filled with Cs vapor at room temperature. The polarization plane of light passing through the cell is modulated due the precession of the atoms in an external magnetic field of 2.1 μT, used to optically determine the Larmor precession frequency. Operation is based on a sequence of optical pumping and observation of freely precessing spins at a repetition rate of 8 Hz. This free precession decay readout scheme separates optical pumping and probing and, thus, ensures a systematically highly clean measurement. Due to the residual offset of the sensor of &lt;15 pT together with negligible crosstalk of adjacent sensors, this device is uniquely suitable for a variety of experiments in low-energy particle physics with extreme precision, here as a highly stable and systematically clean reference probe in search for time-reversal symmetry violating electric dipole moments.},

  abstract     = {Surface phonon polaritons (SPhPs) in van der Waals (vdW) materials are of great interest in fundamental and applied research fields. Probing the characteristics of vdW SPhPs at cryogenic temperatures is an essential task for their implementation in low-temperature physics. However, the most commonly used characterization technique of vdW SPhPs—scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM) operating in a tapping mode (an intermittent-contact mode)—can be problematic at low temperatures because the sample being tested may become brittle and fragile. Therefore, high fracture toughness is desired for the samples under intermittent-contact s-SNOM scanning at low temperatures. In this work, by taking α-phase molybdenum trioxide (α-MoO 3 ) as an example, we first confirm the potential surface deterioration induced by tip-sample interactions at low temperatures. Then, we propose to use few-layer hexagonal boron nitride as a mechanically tough yet optically passive cladding layer to enhance the surface stability of α-MoO 3 . Finally, we demonstrate the validity of our surface reinforcement strategy by probing the previously unexplored temperature dependence of SPhPs within the third Reststrahlen band of α-MoO 3 . Our method allows a sustained operation of tapping mode s-SNOM at cryogenic temperatures with negligible effect on intrinsic properties of SPhPs.},

Since the invention of the laser, virtually every property of coherent light has been tamed, making it one of the most precise tools available to science, technology, and medicine. Coherent control involves the transduction of an exquisitely defined property of light to an electronic system, imparting coherence to an attribute of its constituent electrons. Early developments in coherent control utilized Gaussian laser beams and spatially averaged measurements. The spatial structure and orbital angular momentum of laser light provide additional degrees of freedom for steering electronic and quasiparticle excitations in condensed matter systems. In this Perspective, we first introduce the concept of coherent control in semiconductors. We then proceed to discuss the application of structured light beams to coherent control and the requirement for spatially resolved current detection. Subsequently, we present an overview of recent experiments that were performed using cylindrical vector beams and laser beams with structured phase fronts. Finally, we provide an outlook on the horizons that have emerged with these developments and future directions of interest.},

  abstract     = {Phonon transport is a dominant mechanism of thermal conduction in solids that has been studied for decades. A good understanding of many transport regimes in micro- and nanostructures has been established, including ballistic and diffusive transport, mode softening, or band structure engineering in phononic crystals. However, the limit of quantized transport and the engineering of single transport channels is much less explored. In this Perspective, we discuss concepts and theoretical and experimental progress in the field of quantized phonon transport in channels, such as molecular systems. We particularly highlight open questions and research opportunities that should be within experimental reach. Challenges in experimental sensitivity and control hinder fast experimental progress. Recently, however, heat transport measurements through quantum channels and single molecules have become available at room temperature using break junction techniques. These techniques are well established in the molecular electronics community and have recently been expanded to the measurement of heat transport on the single-molecule level. Given the new experimental capabilities, it is now inviting to address the rather unexplored area of molecular phonon-engineering. Several interesting theoretical predictions concern the realization of the phonon quantum interference effect, suppression of phonon current via the introduction of side groups to molecules, and the construction of a phonon diode device based on molecular anharmonicity and asymmetry. This Perspective should serve the experimental and theory community by listing key challenges, thus a roadmap for making progress in the field of quantized phonon transport.},

Different physical mechanisms of conversion of charge current to spin current can be used in two-terminal and three-terminal device geometries. In two-terminal devices, charge-to-spin conversion occurs by spin filtering in the MTJ&#39;s ferromagnetic electrodes and present day MRAM devices operate near the theoretically expected maximum charge-to-spin conversion efficiency. In three-terminal devices, spin–orbit interactions in a channel material can also be used to generate large spin currents. In this Perspective article, we discuss charge-to-spin conversion processes that can satisfy the requirements of MRAM technology. We emphasize the need to develop channel materials with larger charge-to-spin conversion efficiency—that can equal or exceed that produced by spin filtering—and spin currents with a spin polarization component perpendicular to the channel interface. This would enable high-performance devices based on sub-20 nm diameter perpendicularly magnetized MTJ nanopillars without need of a symmetry breaking field. We also discuss MRAM characteristics essential for CMOS integration. Finally, we identify critical research needs for charge-to-spin conversion measurements and metrics that can be used to optimize device channel materials and interface properties prior to full MTJ nanopillar device fabrication and characterization.},

However, these methods are not suitable for studying surface chemistry of aqueous interfaces. Recently, an approach emerged for probing such interfaces using interfacial water as a contrast agent. This approach is based on second harmonic generation from water molecules next to a charged interface and can be utilized in both scattering and microscopy geometries. In this Perspective, we explain this approach in more detail and provide examples and comparisons for a diverse set of applications: colloid science and solid state physics, illustrated by silica–water surface chemistry, and biophysics, illustrated by membrane–water–ion channel interactions. Those two diverse applications show that by following the structure of interfacial water, it is possible to extract and quantify important chemical parameters such as surface potential values, structure of the electric double layer, and local dissociation constants that are useful in many different contexts.},

Light shifts induced by the CPT driving fields can impact the spectral profile of CPT resonances and are a common limit to the long-term stability of CPT clocks. Nonlinear light shifts have been observed in several CPT systems and have not been explored in detail. In this Letter, we demonstrate that nonlinear light shifts in CPT clocks can arise from spatially inhomogeneous CPT driving fields. We measure this effect using Gaussian laser beams in a buffer gas cell and show strong agreement with a four-level model describing the CPT Λ-system with a noninteracting “trap” state. We estimate the effect of this nonlinearity on recently developed light shift mitigation techniques and suggest improvements to existing techniques.},

  abstract     = {The quality of perovskite crystallization directly determines the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, there is a lack of research on the bottom crystallization of perovskite films of PSCs. Here, by simply controlling the annealing temperature of perovskite films, CsPbIBr 2 films with different surface textures on both the top and bottom sides were obtained, respectively. It is found that dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), which is widely used to enhance the crystallization of perovskite films, cannot be completely removed under 160 °C, leading to the formation of snowflower-like textures (SFT) composed of countless pinholes on the upper and lower surfaces of the perovskite film and the existence of obvious cavities between the perovskite layer and the TiO 2 layer. This is mainly due to the dissolution of CsPbIBr 2 in the residual DMSO. On the contrary, CsPbIBr 2 films with compact and smooth surface textures (CST) on both the top and bottom sides can be achieved under 250 °C. For PSCs, the CST-based champion device (9.66\%) exhibits higher efficiency and better stability than the SFT-based one (3.69\%), primarily due to the high quality film with superior carrier separation and migration properties. The proposed understanding and accurate control of the perovskite crystal growth process are of great significance to the future development of PSCs.},

  abstract     = {Boron-based materials have various attractive properties and gained increased attention in recent years as promising materials for energy storage applications. Despite vast literature on structural and mechanical properties of transition metal diborides, hafnium diboride (HfB 2 ) in particular, research that addresses the use of HfB 2 as an electrode for supercapacitor devices is lacking. Herein, we report both the synthesis and characterization of HfB 2 and its electrochemical performance as the electrode for all-in-one symmetric and asymmetric supercapacitor devices. HfB 2 powders were synthesized by mechanical activation assisted carbothermal reduction of hafnium oxide and boron oxide precursors. To improve the electrochemical energy storage performance of the electrodes, point defects (either Hf or B vacancies/interstitials) were formed in HfB 2 through annealing at different temperatures (1450 and 1650 °C) under a flowing Ar atmosphere. The origin of point defects and their localization on the surface in HfB 2 were identified using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and discussed both from chemical and materials point-of-view. The defective HfB 2 electrode exhibited higher performance than that of the non-defective one with specific energy and power densities of 0.144 W h kg −1 and 33.3 W kg −1 ; specific charge–discharge capacities of 0.32 and 0.31 mA h g −1 ; and 115.5\%, 106.2\%, and 84.1\% retention of the initial capacitances, respectively. The relation between the defect content and the improved supercapacitor performances was explained by employing several structural (x-ray diffractometer and x-ray fluorescence), electronic (EPR), and electrochemical (potentiostatic electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic cycling with potential limitation) characterization tools.},

High-performance top-gate-bottom-contact oxide-TFTs consisting of sol–gel-based high-k zirconium dioxide dielectric (ZrO 2 ) and indium-gallium-zinc oxide (IGZO) semiconducting films were developed by employing microwave annealing. Vibration energy induced microwave annealing even at a low temperature (∼120 °C) with a short process time (10 min), which is sufficient to form dense metal–oxygen bonding while suppressing oxygen vacancies as defect states, resulted in high-quality sol–gel-based amorphous ZrO 2 and IGZO films. The low-voltage operating oxide-TFTs with recessed S/D electrodes exhibited higher field-effect mobility (∼7.0 cm 2 V −1 s −1 ) than those with elevated S/D electrodes (∼0.15 cm 2 V −1 s −1 ). This result is attributed to the conformable deposition of the channel layer on the planar surface of S/D electrodes, leading to the improved interfacial characteristics. Relatively low effective contact resistance (∼79.7 Ω cm), which was extrapolated from a plot of the width-normalized resistance as a function of the channel length using a transmission line method, in oxide-TFTs with recessed S/D electrodes, is compared to that (∼1480.6 Ω cm) of elevated S/D electrodes. This was in good agreement with the Ohmic contact behavior contact where the low charge injection barrier improved charge transport.},

  abstract     = {The layered quasi one-dimensional compound TiS 3 is remarkable for its optical properties, especially, photoconductivity. Up to now, photoconductivity in TiS 3 was studied only at room temperature. Here, we report photoconductivity, δσ, of the TiS 3 whiskers in the temperature range of 5–300 K under irradiation in the near-infrared region. With a temperature decrease from room temperature down to T ∼ 100 K, δσ grows moderately, dominated by the variation of the mobility of the electrons. The estimates based on the values of δσ give the recombination time ∼3–25 μ s at 300 K. The results show that above ∼100 K, TiS 3 behaves as a semiconductor, where electron–hole pairs are excited across the gap, while the recombination goes through transitions of the excited electrons to a donor level with a long lifetime. Below 60 K, a drop of δσ is likely to reveal a phase transition of electrons into a collective state. Another feature in δσ( T ) is seen around 17 K, resembling the temperature variation of the conductivity. This feature indicates a drop in the mobility of the electrons. While the behavior of δσ( T ) is consistent with the transition of electrons into a collective state, it is strikingly different from δσ( T ) of the known quasi one-dimensional conductors with charge-density waves.},

  abstract     = {In this study, La- and V-doped SrSnO 3 epitaxial films were fabricated via pulsed laser deposition, and the effects of doping on the structure and physical properties of films were systematically investigated. Detailed x-ray diffraction characterization demonstrates that the lattice parameters of V-doped SrSnO 3 (SrSn 1− x V x O 3 , x = 0–1, SSVO) films decrease gradually as the V content increases. The optical bandgap first increases from 4.43 to 4.56 eV and then decreases to 3.31 eV with the increasing V content. Density functional theory calculations indicate that the strong hybridization between Sn 5 s and V 3 d orbitals causes an initial expansion of the bandgap. Doping SSVO films with 5\% La greatly improves the electrical conductivity. Hall-effect measurements show that the (La 0.05 Sr 0.95 )VO 3 film has the lowest room-temperature resistivity of 0.05 mΩ cm and correspondingly the largest carrier density of 1.79 × 10 22 cm −3 . Ferromagnetism in SrSn 1− x V x O 3 films is highly dependent on V concentration at room-temperature, and the origin of ferromagnetism may be explained by the bound magnetic polaron model.},

  abstract     = {THz polarization control upon generation is a crucially missing functionality. THz spintronic emitters based on the inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE) allow for this by the strict implicit orthogonality between their magnetization state and the emitted polarization. This control was until now only demonstrated using cumbersome external magnetic field biasing to impose a polarization direction. We present here an efficient voltage control of the polarization state of terahertz spintronic emitters. Using a ferromagnetic spin pumping multilayer exhibiting simultaneously strong uniaxial magnetic anisotropy and magnetostriction in a crossed configuration, an emitter is achieved where, in principle, the stable magnetization direction can be fully and reversibly controlled over a 90° angle span only by an electric voltage. To achieve this, an engineered rare-earth based ferromagnetic multilayer is deposited on a piezoelectric ( 1 − x ) [ Pb ( Mg 0.33 Nb 0.66 ) O 3 ] − x [ PbTiO 3 ] (PMN-PT) substrate. We demonstrate experimentally a reversible 70° THz polarization rotation by sweeping the substrate voltage over 400 V. This demonstration allows for a fully THz polarization controlled ISHE spintronic terahertz emitter not needing any control of the magnetic bias.},

The coercivity mechanism indicated a weak pinning model by magnetic mini-loop analysis. It was found that small grains were formed, accompanied by a certain number of {111} ⟨11-2⟩ twins for HD magnets. The magnetic domain observation showed that both the sub-micro grain boundary and the twin boundary were acted as the pinning center of the domain wall, but the latter had weaker pinning effect. The ultra-high coercivity of the HD-88\% Mn 1.33 Ga magnet originated mainly from the pinning of the grain boundary enhanced by grain refinement.

Antiferromagnets exhibit intrinsic dynamics in the THz regime, the highest among all magnets, and are, therefore, ideal candidates to address this energy-time dilemma. Here, we study theoretically the THz-driven parametric excitation of antiferromagnetic magnon-pairs at the edge of the Brillouin zone and explore the potential for switching between two stable oscillation states. Using a semi-classical theory, we predict that switching can occur at the femtosecond timescale with an energy dissipation down to a few zepto Joule. This result touches the thermodynamical bound of the Landauer principle and approaches the quantum speed limit up to 5 orders of magnitude closer than demonstrated with magnetic systems so far.},

However, under the gated region where p-GaN is recessed and depleted at thermal equilibrium, a parasitic electron channel (PEC) could appear at the AlGaN/GaN interface. This Letter reports experimental investigations on the PEC with specifically designed structures, confirming that the PEC does exist but imposes limited impacts on electrical characteristics of p-FETs. When connected with an external contact, the PEC could act as a back gate to modulate the overlaying p-channel. If isolated from external contacts, which is the case of p-FETs under normal operations, electrons in the PEC would redistribute under the active region of p-FETs in the horizontal direction (i.e., parallel to the surface) under different biases but are mostly confined near the AlGaN/GaN interface in the vertical direction (i.e., perpendicular to the surface).},

Although mechanical exfoliation has been used to prepare VP nanoribbons or nanosheets, production of the high quantum yield VP quantum dots (VPQDs) remains a challenge. Herein, the VPQDs are prepared via liquid exfoliation in ethanol and subsequent solvothermal treatment under 180 °C in dimethylformamide. The prepared VPQDs have a mean size of about 2 nm and can emit a strong blue photoluminescence (PL) when exchanged in ethanol solution. The quantum yield can reach 8.6\%. The strong PL arises from both the band-to-band recombination related to quantum confinement effects and P-O-C related surface bonding state. Furthermore, the VPQDs solution has a good photostability under ambient conditions, suggesting their possible potential in fluorescent biological imaging and photocatalytic reactions.},

Along with the CDW formation below T CDW ∼346 K, the a -axis resistivity shows a huge hump, but the b -axis resistivity exhibits no evident anomaly, manifesting the quasi-one-dimensional character of the CDW. Concomitantly, a rapid rise in positive Hall coefficient is observed due to partial gaping out of the Fermi surface. Based on our Raman scattering measurement, we observe two Raman-active phonon modes in the non-CDW state and, additionally, one collective amplitude mode and four zone-folded modes in the CDW state. The phonon-mode shift with temperature clearly deviates from the expected anharmonic model upon approaching T CDW , suggesting strong electron–phonon coupling in driving the CDW transition. The amplitude mode even survives at room temperature and above, whose evolution can be described by a modified mean-field model, indicating a well-defined CDW order. These results, in addition to the simple formula and easy-to-exfoliate layered structure, promise CuTe as a model system to study the Peierls-like CDW physics and hold great potentials for CDW-based applications.},

Here, (TiZrNbTa) 1−x W x and (TiZrNbTa) 1−x V x superconducting films have been produced by DC magnetron sputtering at different growth temperatures. The phase formation and superconducting behavior of these films depend on the content of alloying x and deposition temperature. A single body-centered cubic (bcc) phase can be formed in the low x range with enough driving energy for crystallinity, but phase transition between amorphous or two bcc structures is observed when increasing x. The highest superconducting transition temperature T c reaches 8.0 K for the TiZrNbTa film. The superconducting transition temperature T c of these films deposited at the same temperature decreases monotonically as a function of x. Increasing deposition temperature to 400 °C can enhance T c for these films while retaining nearly equivalent compositions. Our experimental observations suggest that T c of superconducting high entropy alloys relate to the atomic radii difference and electronegativity difference of involved elements beyond the valence electron number.},

We further investigate the corresponding contribution ratios of the guided modes to perfect retroreflection and find an orthogonal relationship between the contribution ratios of odd and even guided modes.

Herein, we demonstrated that nanoblisters formed by molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ) can produce in-plane strains via out-of-plane deformation. The in-plane strains can effectively modulate frictional behaviors of MoS 2 . Friction force microscopy results showed that the friction was significantly increased at the edge of MoS 2 nanoblisters due to the “step edge effect.” In addition, the friction measured in the central area of the MoS 2 nanoblisters was found increased as the height to radius aspect ratios of MoS 2 nanoblisters increased. Our atomically resolved friction images revealed that the dynamic friction tuned via nanoblisters was originated from the changes in the movement state of the tip caused by the in-plane strains. This study clarified the feasibility of nanoblisters as a simple strain engineering strategy to modulate the friction properties of 2D materials.},

In this Perspective, we focus on the most state-of-the-art dielectric energy storage films in the framework of domain engineering. Generally applicable domain engineering strategies are overviewed, followed by articulative examples of their implementation in modulating domain sizes and symmetries that enhance the energy storage. Finally, we envision prospects of further improvements of dielectric thin films within domain engineering and beyond.},

  abstract     = {The scaling of the already matured complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor technology is steadily approaching its physical limit, motivating the quest for a suitable alternative. Cryogenic operation offers a promising pathway toward continued improvement in computing speed and energy efficiency without aggressive scaling. However, the memory wall bottleneck of the traditional von-Neumann architecture persists even at cryogenic temperature. That is where a compute-in-memory (CiM) architecture, which embeds computing within the memory unit, comes into play. Computations within the memory unit help to reduce the expensive data transfer between the memory and the computing units. Therefore, CiM provides extreme energy efficiency that can enable lower cooling cost at cryogenic temperature. In this work, we demonstrate CryoCiM, a cryogenic compute-in-memory framework utilizing a nonvolatile memory system based on the quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE). Our design can perform memory read/write and universal binary logic operations (NAND, NOR, and XOR). We custom design a peripheral circuit assembly that can perform the read/write and single-cycle in-memory logic operations. The utilization of a QAHE-based memory system promises robustness against process variations, through the usage of topologically protected resistive states for data storage. CryoCiM is a major step toward utilizing exclusively cryogenic phenomena to serve the dual purpose of storage and computation with ultra-low power (∼nano-watts) operations.},

  abstract     = {Higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs), capable of hosting topological states over multiple dimensionalities, have received considerable attention recently, providing unprecedented platforms for robust wave manipulation. Aiming at applications of HOTIs for integrated sensing, energy harvesting, or control of structural vibration propagation, challenges remain in achieving topological states at low frequencies with ample flexibility and tunability. Here, we report the theoretical modeling and experimental realization of HOTIs in elastic locally resonant metamaterials (LRMs). By exploring the interplay between local resonance couplings and nontrivial band topology, a variety of higher-order topological corner states (TCSs) are constructed in deep sub-wavelength regime with high efficiency in energy confinement. More importantly, we reveal that the TCSs are dependent on localization mechanisms of interacting sites at interfaces, which endows our HOTIs with unique frequency-selective and dimension-switching abilities. We further design complex domain walls to demonstrate the TCSs can be selectively switched on at desired frequencies or geometric corners. Our findings not only offer effective routes for the design of deep sub-wavelength topological devices but also enrich the understandings of higher-order topological physics that can be extended to other classic systems.},

  abstract     = {Alkali metal dispensers have become an indispensable tool in the production of atomic vapors for magnetometry, alkali vapor cell clocks, and laser cooling experiments. A primary advantage of these dispensers is that they contain alkali metal in an inert form that can be exposed to air without hazard. However, their high temperature of operation (&gt;600 °C) is undesirable for many applications, as it shifts the atomic speed distribution to higher values and presents a radiative heat source that can raise the temperature of its surroundings. For this reason, dispensers are typically not used in line-of-sight applications, such as atomic beam generation. In this work, we present an integrated rubidium dispenser collimating device with a thickness of only 2 mm that produces a beam of atoms traveling primarily in the forward direction. We find that the collimator plate serves to both shield the dispenser&#39;s radiation and moderate the velocity of the atomic beam so that the measured longitudinal speed distribution is comparable to that of an ordinary alkali oven at only a slightly elevated temperature of 200 °C. To confirm our theory, we also constructed another compact apparatus consisting of a dispenser and a silicon collimator and the measurements support our conclusion. Our integrated dispenser collimator will particularly be useful in integrated photonics and cavity QED on-chip, where a localized, directed source of Rb vapor in small quantities is needed.},

Here, in this work, the performance of Pt 13−n M n (M = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn) bimetallic catalysts was systematically studied in this work using spin-polarized density functional theory calculations. The Gibbs free energy results show that the doping of Mn to the Pt clusters was more beneficial to the improvement of the catalyst activity, following is the addition of Zn and Co. Among all the clusters, 15 nanoclusters are promising catalysts with a barrier of ΔG &lt;1 eV. The Pt 8 Mn 5 , Pt 2 Mn 11 , and Pt 11 Mn 2 are the three most promising catalysts with the barrier of only 0.148, 0.237, and 0.286 eV, respectively, displaying all more than 1 eV lower than that of pure Pt 13 . For most of the Pt 13−n M n (M = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn) systems, the desorption of CO is the rate-limiting step. The d band center of Pt 8 Mn 5 is far from the Fermi energy level, which causes CO detachment more easily from Pt 8 Mn 5 . Pt 8 Mn 5 exhibits superior catalytic activity toward CO. The study can be used to guide the design of bimetallic catalysts in the future.},

Understanding the photo-induced carrier dynamics is fundamental and crucial for improving the photoelectric conversion efficiency of nanocomposites. In this work, we have constructed nanocomposite hybridizing CdTe QDs with Au nanoclusters (Au NCs) and investigated the ultrafast carrier dynamics and enhanced photoelectric properties. The concurrent photoluminescence quenching and lifetime decreasing of CdTe QDs and Au NCs suggest a type-II band alignment, facilitating the carrier dynamics in the CdTe QDs-Au NCs&#39; nanocomposite. The transient absorption measurements demonstrate an ultrafast and efficient electron transfer from CdTe QDs to Au NCs, effectively promoting the charge separation and inhibiting the exciton recombination. We found that the quantum efficiency of hot electron transfer can reach ∼50\% with a rate constant of 1.01 × 10 13 s −1 for the CdTe QDs-Au NCs&#39; nanocomposite. As a result, the photocurrent performance of the CdTe QDs-Au NC device has been dramatically enhanced due to the efficient separation of photogenerated carriers, compared to that of individual CdTe QDs and Au NCs. These findings are significant for developing the light-harvesting and photoelectric devices based on semiconductor QDs and metal NCs.},

Here, we construct a device, which incorporates a thermoelectric generator that harvests electricity from the temperature difference between the PV cell and the ambient surrounding. We achieve 50 mW/m 2 nighttime power generation with a clear night sky, with an open-circuit voltage of 100 mV, which is orders of magnitude higher as compared with previous demonstrations. During the daytime, the thermoelectric generator also provides additional power on top of the electric power generated directly from the PV cells.

To make rapid progress toward developing such atomic scale memory, a facile technique to fabricate atomristor prototypes has to be developed. In this work, one such simple and lithography free technique to fabricate an atomristor prototype using photoexfoliated monolayer molybdenum di-sulfide (MoS 2 ) is illustrated. Resistive switching characteristics of the atomristor were demonstrated by applying a write voltage pulse of 10 (SET) and −5 V (RESET) for 100 s between the active tantalum di-sulfide (TaS 2 ) and inert indium tin oxide electrodes. During the SET process (ON state), the Ta 2+ ions from the active electrode diffuse through monolayer MoS 2 to create a number of parallel conducting channels. The persistence of the conducting channel even after removing the SET bias drives the atomristor to the low resistance state. On applying the “RESET” bias, the device resistance increased by a factor of five possibly due to the rupturing of the conducting channel. On cyclically applying the “SET” and “RESET” biases, the device was switched between low and high resistance states with excellent repeatability. Interestingly, it was also observed that the switching ratio increased on increasing the SET bias making this device a promising candidate for realizing tunable write once read many (WORM) memory devices.},

In this paper, we quantitatively investigate the effect of planar etching treatment and trench formation on the performance of GaN-based MOS (metal oxide semiconductor) stacks. The results demonstrate that (i) blanket etching the GaN surface does not degrade the robustness of the deposited dielectric layer; (ii) the addition of the trench etch, while improving reproducibility, results in a decrease in the breakdown performance compared to the planar structures. (iii) For trench structures, the voltage for a 10 year lifetime is still above 20 V, indicating a good robustness. (iv) To review the trapping performance across the metal-dielectric-GaN stack, forward-reverse capacitance–voltage measurements with and without stress and photo-assistance are performed. Overall, as-grown planar capacitors devoid of prior etching steps show the lowest trapping, while trench capacitors have higher interface trapping and bulk trapping comparable to the blanket etched capacitors. (v) The nanostructure of the GaN/dielectric interface was characterized by high resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy. An increased roughness of 2–3 monolayers at the GaN surface was observed after blanket etching, which was correlated with the higher density of interface traps. The results presented in this paper give fundamental insight on how the etch and trench processing affects the trapping and robustness of trench-gate GaN-metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistors and provide guidance for the optimization of device performance.},

However, the ternary component could also affect other physical properties of the bulk-heterojunction (BHJ). Among these properties, heat transfer has rarely been reported, despite its relevance for thermal durability of OSCs. Here, we employ scanning photothermal deflection technique to study thermal diffusion properties of binary PM6:Y7 and ternary PM6:Y7:X BHJs, where X = PC 71 BM, ICBA, and N2200. It is found that fullerene derivatives deteriorate the thermal diffusivity ( D ) of blend films and the device thermal durability, despite enhancing the electrical and device performance. In contrast, when an n-type conjugated polymer N2200 is used as the ternary component, both the electrical and thermal properties are enhanced, with improved power conversion efficiency and prolonged device thermal durability. These results offer a perspective on how to choose a favorable third component. Fullerene derivatives are not necessarily the optimal choice for ternary component for BHJ cells because of the inferior thermal properties.},

Compared with DC-poled samples, enhancements in piezoelectric and dielectric properties can be obtained when the thickness is above 0.1 mm. However, inconsistency in poling effects was found in the crystals with thickness below 0.1 mm. To elucidate why such scaling effect arises, surface roughness was measured by an atomic force microscopy to correlate surface morphology and poling effects. It was found that non-uniform surface roughness led to inconsistent and decreased properties. Furthermore, temperature-dependent dielectric permittivity spectra were measured to explore how crystal thickness affects the thermal stability of ferroelectric phases. It is noted that complex changes in crystallographic symmetries emanate by decreasing thickness. Such phenomena can be attributed to more influential effects of surface morphology when thickness is reduced. We hope this work suggests a clue for solving the scaling effects of AC-poling on relaxor-PbTiO 3 single crystals.},

  abstract     = {Manipulation of exchange bias with electric field is appealing to boost energy efficiency in spintronic devices. Here, this effect is shown at room temperature in Ir 20 Mn 80 /Fe 80 Ga 20 /Ta layers grown onto ⟨011⟩-oriented PMN-32PT single crystals. After magnetic field-cooling (FC) along the [01-1] and [100] in-plane directions of PMN-32PT and upon allowing the system to relax through consecutive hysteresis loops (training effect), the exchange bias field (H EB ) is measured under the action of voltage (out-of-plane poling). Depending on the applied voltage (magnitude and sign), H EB can either increase or decrease with respect to its value at 0 V. The relative variations of H EB are 24\% and 5.5\% after FC along the [01-1] and [100] directions, respectively. These results stem from strain-mediated magnetoelectric coupling. The applied electric field causes changes in the coercivity and the squareness ratio of the films, suggesting a reorientation of the effective magnetic easy axis in Fe 80 Ga 20 . However, larger H EB values are observed when the squareness ratio is lower. It is claimed that the effect of voltage is equivalent to an in-plane component of an applied magnetic field oriented perpendicular to the cooling field direction. Perpendicular in-plane magnetic fields have been shown to induce an increase in exchange bias in some ferromagnetic/antiferromagnetic systems due to partial recovery of the untrained antiferromagnetic state. Remarkably, here, this effect is directly induced with voltage, therefore enhancing energy efficiency.},

The magnetic regions with different crystal directions have different coercivities, resulting in two opposite AHE channels in the polycrystalline SRO layer. However, single-crystal SRO films prepared under the same conditions are found to exhibit only one AHE. The superposition of the two AHE leads to the hump-like behavior of the Hall resistance loop, which is caused by the change of crystalline.

We find that transport has an influence on the magnetization dynamics closer to the excited surface as well as in regions deeper than the penetration depth of the laser.

  abstract     = {Spin–orbit torque (SOT) is an emerging candidate for electrically controlled magnetization switching in low-power and nonvolatile spintronic devices. However, SOT switching of perpendicular magnetization requires an auxiliary field or additional lateral symmetry breaking, which is difficult to achieve in practical applications. In particular, the mechanism of field-free switching through vertical symmetry breaking still lacks a quantitative description. In this work, a vertically asymmetric Co/Pt bilayer has been constructed through quantitative engineering of anisotropy gradient, while keeping the total magnetic thickness of the bilayer constant. Interestingly, the enhanced asymmetry with greater anisotropy gradient would induce higher SOT efficiencies and larger field-free switching ratios. Field-free switching can be attributed to the slight lateral asymmetry caused by the perpendicular anisotropy gradient. The SOT effective-field enhancement and field-free switching through quantitative engineering of the anisotropy gradient not only offer a deeper understanding of current-induced magnetization switching in perpendicularly asymmetric systems but also provide a potential avenue for practical applications of SOT devices at the wafer level.},

This helical-cavity coupled structure is selected as a logical unit “1,” the pure air hole is set as a logical unit “0,” and the reflective phase difference of the two units is approximately equal to π in a broad frequency range. More importantly, we reveal a somewhat unconventional mechanism of the coupling resonance between the helical channel and the air cavity for the broadband characteristic, which can be hardly realized by the traditional space-coiling or Helmholtz-resonator metasurfaces. We prove that the 0/1 encoding form can be reconstructed simply by inserting the spiral structure or not. By encoding the sequence of the logical units in the BACMs, the broadband acoustic focusing lens and acoustic splitter within the frequency range of [2.4, 5.6 kHz] are demonstrated numerically and experimentally.

Despite the thick metallic overlayer, we observe a prominent cyclotron resonance in a magnetic field that can be associated with the response of the interfacial states. Measurements of the THz range complex Faraday rotation allow the extraction of the sign and magnitude of the effective mass, density of charge carriers, and scattering times of the 2DEG despite the close proximity of the aluminum layer.

These low thermal conductivities are rooted in low-energy optical phonon modes with strong anharmonicity and the emergence of high-energy flat optical phonon modes with zero contribution to the lattice thermal conductivity. Heavier cationic atoms are found to soften low-lying optical phonon modes, which enhance phonon scattering and, therefore, favor a lower thermal conductivity. These combined characteristics lead to high and balanced figure of merit values around 2.3 for Zintl Ba 3 AlSb 3 at both optimal p -type and n -type doping and high temperature.

When using the SCAM substrate, the diffusion and/or penetration of impurities, including Mg, Sc, O, and Al, from the SCAM substrate poses as a challenge. To address this issue, we introduced an Al 0.74 In 0.26 N layer between the SCAM substrate and MQWs, which was lattice-matched to the substrate. The Al 0.74 In 0.26 N layer effectively blocked the diffusion of impurities from the SCAM substrate into the adjacent layers during the metal-organic vapor epitaxy (MOVPE) growth. For further suppression, a thick AlN layer was deposited on the back of the SCAM substrate before the MOVPE growth, which effectively suppressed impurity penetration from the growth surface. The structure proposed in this study improved the crystallinity and the surface roughness of MQWs, resulting in the improvement of internal quantum efficiency by approximately three times compared to that of the conventional sample.},

Post-annealing at temperatures higher than 700 °C increases the area of voids at bonded interfaces probably due to the difference in the coefficient of thermal expansion. The integration of β-Ga 2 O 3 on the GaN substrate achieved in this work is one of the promising approaches to combine the material merits of both GaN and Ga 2 O 3 targeting the fabrication of novel GaN/β-Ga 2 O 3 high-frequency and high-power electronics as well as optoelectronic devices.},

  abstract     = {Nanoporous metals produced by dealloying have aroused enormous interest due to exotic mechanical and physico-chemical properties that are usually inaccessible in their bulk form. Interestingly, when binary solid-solution alloys, such as Ag–Au alloys, are dealloyed, the resulting nanoporous metals usually inherit the crystal structure of their parent alloys. In this Letter, we examined the evolution of the crystal structure during the dealloying of Fe–Rh alloys that show single-phase solubility over a large range of compositions. In situ x-ray diffraction shows that the crystallographic structure of the Fe 85 Rh 15 alloy transforms from the original bcc to fcc structure during the dealloying. Transmission electron microscopy confirms the fcc structure of the nanoporous sample, which exhibits a typical bi-continuous porous structure with ligament sizes of only 2–3 nm and a high Fe concentration. The bcc–fcc transformation is driven by the chemical disordering of Fe and Rh atoms, induced by the highly dynamic dissolution and diffusion process at the alloy/electrolyte interface. Our study highlights the massive diffusion and the consequent disordered arrangement of elemental components during the evolution of the nanoporous structure.},

When the magnetic field is applied along the b -axis and a -axis at low temperature, a series of Shubnikov–de Haas oscillations on the longitudinal transport exhibit, demonstrating a three-dimensional Fermi-surface pocket for HfTe 5 rather than two-dimensional (2D). The investigations on Landau level fan diagram confirm the existence of the non-trivial π Berry phase. The cyclotron mass m cyc as around 0.02 m e and quantum scattering time τ at about 1.76 ps are also estimated with Lifshitz–Kosevich theory.

  abstract     = {Black phosphorus quantum dots (BPQDs) have recently obtained great attention owing to their outstanding properties, such as high hole mobility, quantum confinement effect, and edge effect. At present, several methods have been applied to prepare BPQDs using black phosphorus as precursor. In this study, BPQDs are obtained via shock-induced phase transformation using ball-milled red phosphorus nanopowder as precursor. The red phosphorus powder was ball-milled and shocked to induce phase transformation at transient high pressure and temperature. Multiple techniques are applied to characterize the recovered samples, including x-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and atomic force microscope. The characterization results demonstrate that the majority of recovered sample is BPQDs with a lateral size of 2–10 nm and a thickness of 0.9–2 nm. In addition, the formation mechanism of BPQDs under shock treatment was carefully analyzed, consisting of phase transformation induced by shock loading and exfoliation by tensile and shear effects. Furthermore, this study also confirms that the micromorphology of precursor is critical to the formation of BPQDs. This research provides an efficient one-step path to prepare BPQDs using ball-milled red phosphorus nanopowder as precursor.},

The proof-of-concept experimental results unambiguously demonstrate the path-dependent functionality, which was achieved by the compact bilayer structure of thermal diffusion media.

  abstract     = {Recent progress in minimizing sound absorbers is driven by their great scientific significance and engineering value; however, compact devices for low-frequency sound are still challenging. Here, we construct an ultra-thin metasurface by parallel connecting resonators with high dissipation loss to a non-resonant reactance-dominated boundary (RDB) with high radiation loss, which realizes extreme absorption asymmetry at the exceptional point of scattering eigenvalue. We develop a parallel transfer matrix method to design the system, and a deep-subwavelength absorber (the operating wavelength is 120 times of its thickness) with 99.2\% and 0.5\% absorption for sound incident from opposite ports is achieved. The extreme absorption asymmetry is ascribed to the distinct coupling between the RDB and resonant meta-atom in an unbalanced dissipating state with excellent robustness against geometrical reconfigurations originated from the broadband near-unity reflection characteristics of the RDB. In particular, the proposed strategy brings the design of a degree of freedom rather than typical multiple resonant modes, and an extensible prototype showing &gt;90\% (&lt;1\%) absorptance for left- (right-) incidence within a wavelength from 23.3 to 18 times its thickness is demonstrated.},

The apex temperature and electrical resistance of the diamond needles during FE were measured by electron spectroscopy. Transmission electron microscopy indicated that the diamond structure in the near-surface layer was transformed into well-ordered graphene layers after FE with currents of up to 30 μ A. The resulting structure can be viewed as a multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) having a diamond core. Thus, the observed FE behavior exhibited by the graphitized diamond needles is qualitatively similar to that of MWCNTs. On the other hand, due to its outstanding thermal conductivity, the diamond core ensures an efficient Joule heat dissipation, which provides better emission stability and higher currents, up to at least 225 μ A. It makes these graphitized diamond needles promising candidates for high-brightness point electron sources required for various applications, e.g., in electron microscopy or scanning electron lithography.},

Herein, by using a simple solution-based drop-casting technique, we fabricate a Ti 3 C 2 T x MXene/Ge two-dimensional/three-dimensional van der Waals heterostructure, which can function well as a highly efficient near-infrared photodetector. When shined by 1550 nm light illumination, the heterostructure exhibits an apparent photovoltaic effect and can, thus, work as a self-driven near-infrared photodetector. A representative photodetector achieves a photocurrent responsivity of ∼314.3 mA W −1 at zero bias voltage, which can be improved to as high as ∼642.6 mA W −1 by applying a small reverse bias voltage of −1 V. In addition, other critical performance parameters such as current on/off ratio, specific detectivity, and response speed are estimated to be ∼430, ∼2.01 × 10 11 Jones, and 17.6/13.6 μ s, respectively. The excellent device performance is comparable to that of many previously reported two-dimensional material/Ge heterostructure-based near-infrared photodetectors, which cannot be constructed using facile solution-based processes. This work provides a facile avenue for developing high-performance and low-cost near-infrared photodetectors, which will find important applications in future optoelectronic systems.},

Conventional spintronic devices, such as spin-transfer-torque magnetic-resistive random-access memory (STT-MRAM) and spin–orbit torque MRAM, are promising due to their non-volatility, energy-efficiency, and high endurance. STT-MRAMs are now entering into the commercial market; however, they are limited in write speed to the nanosecond timescale. Improvement in the write speed of spintronic devices can significantly increase their usefulness as viable alternatives to the existing CMOS-based devices. In this article, we discuss recent studies that advance the field of ultrafast spintronics and opto-magnetism. An optimized ferromagnet–ferrimagnet exchange-coupled magnetic stack, which can serve as the free layer of a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ), can be optically switched in as fast as ∼3 ps. Integration of ultrafast magnetic switching of a similar stack into an MTJ device has enabled electrical readout of the switched state using a relatively larger tunneling magnetoresistance ratio. Purely electronic ultrafast spin–orbit torque induced switching of a ferromagnet has been demonstrated using ∼6 ps long charge current pulses. We conclude our Perspective by discussing some of the challenges that remain to be addressed to accelerate ultrafast spintronics technologies toward practical implementation in high-performance digital information processing systems.},

  abstract     = {Operation of normal conducting accelerator structures at high accelerating gradients is beneficial for many accelerator applications in basic science, industry, medicine, and National Security. RF breakdown is the major factor that limits the achievable accelerating gradients. Previous experiments on copper (Cu) have demonstrated that RF breakdown probability can be significantly decreased by hardening the material and alloying Cu with solutes such as silver (Ag). In this paper, we propose a figure-of-merit (FOM) that characterizes the ability of Cu alloys to withstand high-gradients. The FOM represents a trade-off between hardening through solid solution strengthening and the additional thermal stress induced by incremental RF pulse heating resulting from changes in electronic properties induced by alloying. We performed high-throughput ab initio calculations and computed the FOM for a large number of binary Cu alloys. Several promising candidate alloys for high-gradient accelerating structures were identified, such as CuAg, CuCd, CuHg, CuAu, CuIn, and CuMg. CuAg alloys have previously exhibited low RF breakdown rates in experiments. The results provide guidance for selecting alloys for the future high-gradient normal conducting accelerating structures operating at very high gradients.},

  abstract     = {Fe-based nanoparticles are promising oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts. However, they often suffer from serious agglomeration during the electrocatalytic process, which leads to significant attenuation of catalytic performance. Herein, highly dispersed Fe nanoparticles with small sizes of ∼7 nm are confined in amorphous carbon matrix by pulsed laser deposition technology. Based on this, a simple N 2 radio frequency plasma strategy is proposed to introduce N doping in the Fe nanoparticles. Electrochemical measurements suggest that N-doped Fe nanoparticles exhibit enhanced OER activity and stability, which offers a low overpotential of 246 mV at 10 mA cm −2 and the Tafel slope of 50 mV dec −1 in 1 M KOH solution. Based on experimental measurements combined with first-principles calculations, the outstanding OER performance of N-doped Fe nanoparticles can be attributed to the synergistic effect of the unique confined structure and N doping, which not only enhances the electrochemical surface area and improves electrical conductivity but also weakens the adsorption of intermediates and reduces the energy barrier of OER reaction. This work provides a facile method for the construction of metal nanoparticles with confined nanostructure and controlled N doping, which will greatly promote the development of OER electrocatalysts.},

One TPM image includes several millions of pixel data of three-dimensional optical information such as refractive index (RI) values of cell components. In this work, the obtained TPM data of living cells were analyzed using X–Y cross sections to visualize the localization of cell components. Distribution of RI values at the cell surfaces and inside the cells were quantified. The results showed that the RI values were slightly lower at the cell center (RI ∼ 1.400) than the cell boundary (RI ∼ 1.420). RI values were fluctuated according to the depth measured from the cell surface also. Furthermore, statistical analysis by root mean square and Moran&#39;s I methods revealed unique localization of RI values for several cells among 25 individuals. In addition, the volumes of the cells estimated using TPM data corresponded to the cell volumes obtained via scanning electron microscopy. Our work proposed an effective procedure to quantitatively/statistically investigate intracellular materials of living cells based on physical information of TPM data.},

  abstract     = {Recently, ion-doped HfO 2 thin films are highly desirable for the next-generation nonvolatile memories due to excellent compatibility with current complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor processes and robust ferroelectricity persisted down to the nanoscale. In this work, we study conduction mechanisms of 4 and 8 nm-thick La:HfO 2 ultrathin films sandwiched between Pt and (La 0.67 ,Sr 0.33 )MnO 3 (LSMO) electrodes based on band alignments of the Pt/La:HfO 2 /LSMO, measured by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and temperature-dependent current-voltage curves from 50 to 300 K. In a 4 nm-thick La:HfO 2 thin-film capacitor, the conduction mechanism is found to be governed by direct tunneling at 50–100 K and phonon-assisted indirect tunneling when the temperature is further increased to 300 K in which the ( La Hf 4 + 3 + ) ′ acceptors are served as localized states, facilitating hole hopping through the La:HfO 2 barrier. When the thickness is increased to 8 nm, the tunneling through a La:HfO 2 layer is suppressed, and the current-voltage character becomes rectifying, which is regulated by the dominated La:HfO 2 /LSMO interfacial barrier. The transport for a forward bias of the La:HfO 2 /LSMO barrier is found to be governed by thermionic-field emission, exhibiting a temperature-independent build-in potential of ∼2.77 V. For the reverse bias, the Fowler–Nordheim tunneling is observed. The revealing of conduction mechanisms in terms of band alignments sheds light on leakage problems and facilitates the design of HfO 2 -based ferroelectric devices with excellent insulating character for high-performance memory applications.},

Thanks to stable resistance switching behavior of memristor and outstanding controllability of device conductance by transistor gating of 1T1R, the experimental demonstration of the acquisition and extinction of Pavlovian conditioning were realized. Moreover, the temporal relation between the conditioned and unconditioned stimuli was also established in which the memory time of associative learning decreased with the increase in the interval of two stimuli. This work provided an idea to biorealistically mimic the Pavlovian conditioning, paving the way for memristive neuromorphic computing.},

The CBRAMs are fabricated with CMOS compatible materials and processes. DC I–V sweep characterizations show an ultra-low SET/RESET voltage of 0.35 V/−0.05 V, and the RESET voltage is the lowest among all ultra-low voltage CBRAMs. The CBRAM is capable of withstanding endurance tests with over 10 6 pulses of +0.4 V/−0.1 V with 1 μ s pulse width, with the resistance at LRS maintaining at an ultra-low value of only 20 Ω, which is the lowest among all CBRAMs to date, and it is reduced by at least 2.95 times compared with prior studies. Meanwhile, the switching ratio between high resistance state and LRS is more than 1.49 × 10 4 . Moreover, the switching time characterization of the CBRAM demonstrates an ultra-short SET/RESET time of 7/9 ns.

The device demonstrated nonvolatile and stable resistive switching (RS) properties under URS and BRS modes. The current–voltage (I–V) fitting analysis and temperature dependence measurements suggested that one Pt/NiFe 2 O 4 /Pt RRAM cell follows two significantly different RS and carrier transport mechanisms under URS and BRS modes. Under URS mode, the carrier mechanism alternates between the high resistance state (HRS) with Schottky emission and low resistance state (LRS) with the Ohmic mechanism. In contrast, under BRS mode, carrier transport at HRS and LRS is dominated by space-charge-limited current and nearest-neighboring hopping, respectively. Finally, a physical model, combining oxygen ion (O 2− ) migration and electric field distribution simulated by COMSOL Multiphysics, is proposed to further clarify the coexistence of two distinct RS and carrier transport mechanisms in the single Pt/NiFe 2 O 4 /Pt RRAM device.},

The crystal structure was investigated using x-ray diffraction and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). These analyses revealed that the polar orthorhombic phase was stabilized, even at a thickness of 100 nm, whereas the formation of a nonpolar monoclinic phase was suppressed. In addition, the elemental mappings obtained by STEM–energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy revealed that the film was compositionally uniform across its thickness. The chemical state of Ce in the polar orthorhombic domain was investigated using STEM–electron energy loss spectroscopy, which revealed the coexistence of Ce 4+ and Ce 3+ . In addition, pinched polarization-electric field loops were observed, and their shapes were found to remain unaltered even after 10 9 electric field cycles. The strain-electric field curves originating from ferroelectricity were observed before and after the electric field cycling, and the high-field observed strain, S max / E max , was found to be approximately 7.2 pm/V. These results demonstrate that thicker CeO 2 -HfO 2 ferroelectric films are promising candidates for use as piezoelectric materials.},

Comparing the condensation energy of the Bardeen–Cooper–Schrieffer (BCS) singlet ground state with the paramagnetically polarized state suggests that for an applied field μ 0 H &gt; 1.8 T c (in SI), singlet pairing is not energetically favorable. Materials exceeding or approaching this limit are interesting from fundamental and technological perspectives. This may be a potential indicator of triplet superconductivity, Fulde–Ferrell–Larkin–Ovchinnikov (FFLO) pairing, and other mechanisms involving topological aspects of surface states and may also allow Cooper pair injection at high magnetic fields. We have analyzed the microscopic composition of such a material arising from an unexpected source. A microjet of an organo-metallic gas, W [ ( CO ) 6 ] ⁠ , can be decomposed by a gallium ion-beam, leaving behind a track of complex residue of gallium, tungsten, and carbon with remarkable superconducting properties, like an upper critical field, H c 2 &gt; 10 T ⁠ , above its paramagnetic limit. We carried out atomic probe tomography to establish the formation of nano-crystalline tungsten carbide (WC) in the tracks and the absence of free tungsten. Supporting calculations show that for Ga distributed on the surface of WC, its s,p-orbitals enhance the density of states near the Fermi energy. The observed variation of H c 2 ( T ) does not show features typical of enhancement of critical field due to granularity. Our observations may be significant in the context of some recent theoretical calculation of the band structure of WC and experimental observation of superconductivity in a WC-metal interface.},

  abstract     = {Carbon-based magnetic nanostructures have long spin coherent length and are promising for spintronics applications in data storage and information processing. Recent experiments demonstrate that a pair of substitutional boron atoms (B 2 ) doped 7-atom-wide armchair graphene nanoribbons (B 2 -7AGNRs) have intrinsic magnetism, providing a quasi-1D magnetic material platform for spintronics. In this work, we demonstrate that the magnetism in B 2 -7AGNRs is contributed by π-electrons, originating from the imbalance of electrons in two spin channels in response to boron dopants. The spin-dependent transport across single and double boron pair doped 7AGNRs (B 2 -7AGNRs and 2B 2 -7AGNRs) by constructing lateral graphene nanoribbon heterojunctions has been investigated by using first-principles calculations. We show that for B 2 -7AGNRs with spin splitting π - electronic states near the Fermi level, by applying a bias voltage, one can obtain a current spin polarization over 90\% and a negative differential resistance effect. For 2B 2 -7AGNRs, two spin centers have been found to be antiferromagnetically coupled. We demonstrate a magnetoresistance effect over 15 000\% by setting those two spin centers to be ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic alignments. Based on the above spin-polarized transport properties, we reveal that GNR heterojunctions based on B 2 -7AGNRs could be potentially applied in quasi-1D spintronic devices.},

The x-ray diffraction and scanning electron microstructure results reveal that the arc-melted HoB 2 exhibits preferred grain orientation along the solidification direction. The measured rotating magnetic entropy changes ( − Δ S R ) and refrigeration capacity are 6.27 J/kg K and 73.7 J/kg, respectively, under the magnetic field change of 1 T.

Such an ultralow κ lat is attributed to WB 4 monolayer&#39;s predominantly large phonon scattering rates and flat acoustic phonon dispersion caused by strong anharmonicity. By analyzing the vibrational patterns and bonding environment, we confirm the origin of the strong anharmonicity to be tungsten atom rattling inside the framework of two boron sheets. Such a mechanism fulfills the concept of phonon glass-electron crystal, making the WB 4 monolayer an outstanding 2D thermoelectric material.

  abstract     = {Recently, the important role of high-order anharmonic phonon–phonon interactions has been revealed in several materials, such as cubic boron arsenide (BAs), in which the wide phononic energy gap is found to be a critical factor causing the importance of four-phonon scattering. In this work, by solving the Boltzmann transport equation, we show that the four-phonon scattering has a significant impact on the thermal transport in honeycomb structured monolayer BAs (m-BAs) and its hydrogenated bilayer counterparts (bi-BAs). The lattice thermal conductivity (κ L ) values of all these structures are reduced after considering four-phonon scattering. Particularly, a huge drop in κ L as large as 80\% is observed for m-BAs compared to the case without four-phonon scattering, which is mainly caused by the suppression of phonon lifetimes. More interestingly, as opposed to the case of graphene, κ L of m-BAs is abnormally lower than its bi-BAs counterparts, which is attributed to the much larger phonon scattering rate in m-BAs compared to that in bi-BAs. By further comparing BAs sheets with and without horizontal mirror symmetry, it is found that the contribution of flexural acoustic phonon exhibits most significant reduction in both mi-BAs and bi-BAs with horizontal mirror symmetry after including four-phonon scattering. This work provides physical understanding of the role of mirror symmetry and high-order phonon scattering on the thermal transport in two-dimensional materials.},

A model dielectric function critical point analysis was applied to examine the dielectric function and critical point transitions for each temperature. The lowest energy M 0 -type critical point associated with the direct bandgap transition in ZnGa 2 O 4 is shown to red-shift linearly as the temperature is increased with a subsequent slope of −0.72(4) meV K −1 . Furthermore, increasing the temperature results in a reduction of the excitonic amplitude and increase in the exciton broadening akin to exciton evaporation and lifetime shortening.

All samples were epitaxially grown using metal organic chemical vapor deposition and were characterized using x-ray diffraction and room-temperature Hall measurements. The measured hole concentrations are compared against calculated values from STR FETIS ® , and the measured mobility trends are explained using the separation of the positive polarization interfaces from the two-dimensional hole gas in the systems, strengthening the hypothesis. A second study is also presented where acceptor traps were ionized in a p-type modulation doped GaN/AlGaN SL without an AlN layer—by keeping the superlattice period thickness constant and increasing the AlGaN composition.

  abstract     = {The local structure around boron doped in 6H-type silicon carbide (SiC) was investigated using neutron holography. Three-dimensional atomic images reconstructed from multiple-wavelength holograms revealed the boron substitution for both silicon and carbon. To determine boron locations accurately, we calculated holograms with varying occupancies of six different sites and fit image intensities with those obtained from experimental holograms by the steepest descent method. As a result, it was found that boron atoms were selectively located at the Si–C-cubic site layer. Furthermore, boundaries right above the boron locations were suggested from the absence of atomic images in the upper region of reconstruction.},

An α-MoO 3 to MoO 3 -II transition and another MoO 3 -II to MoO 3 -III transition were observed at 11 and at 27 GPa, respectively. Accompanied by the structural transition, its optical anisotropy also changes with pressure. While maintaining the similar angle-resolved intensity patterns, the polarization angle with the maximum intensity of the Mo–O 2 –Mo symmetric stretching mode moves from 90° to 105° then back to 90° with pressure. The result is helpful to understand the mechanism of the pressure-induced phase transition and tune the anisotropic optical properties of MoO 3 .},

An obstacle ball was set between the target and the substrate so that ablated droplets would collide with the ball and be eliminated, while other ablated atoms went around the ball and were deposited on the substrate. A flat, transparent, and high-density coating layer was deposited on the substrate in an H 2 O vapor atmosphere at 0.1 Torr for different substrate surface temperatures from 20 °C to 650 °C. The phase of the coating layers was significantly changed from amorphous calcium phosphate to crystalline HAp when the temperature was set to over 360 °C, as determined from Raman microscopy measurements. Raman spectroscopy also showed that the HAp crystal size became larger as the temperature was increased to over 360 °C. It was concluded that the eclipse type PLD method with irradiation on a β-TCP target would improve the quality of HAp coatings and allow effective lowering of the annealing temperature.},

Its compatibility with pulsed sources is hampered by the requirement of a high-repetition rate imposed by lock-in detection. We describe a sampling method, called quadrature-assisted discrete (quad) demodulation, which circumvents this constraint. Quad demodulation operates by measuring the optical signal and the modulation phases for each individual light pulse. This method retrieves the near-field signal in the pseudoheterodyne mode, as proven by retraction curves and near-field images. Measurement of the near-field using a pulsed femtosecond amplifier and quad demodulation is in agreement with results obtained using a CW laser and the standard lock-in detection method.},

They propagate anisotropically along the flake of α-MoO 3 and show anomalously concave wavefronts when being excited by a pointlike source. Such anisotropic propagation is governed by the anisotropic wavevectors of HPhPs, which have been studied in different works. However, extracting the complex-valued wavevectors of all HPhP modes directly from the observed anomalous wavefront remains elusive. Here, we theoretically and experimentally demonstrate that the complex-valued HPhP wavevectors can be accurately quantified by fitting the concave wavefront profiles with a modified damped sine-wave function in all allowed directions. To that end, HPhPs are launched by an infrared antenna on a thin flake of α-MoO 3 and are imaged in real space by using scanning near-field optical microscope. From the recorded concave wavefronts of HPhPs, we have experimentally retraced both the real part and the imaginary part of polariton wavevectors along different propagation directions. Our results are of fundamental importance for analyzing the optical properties of HPhPs in α-MoO 3 , which can also be generic to other anisotropic optical/polaritonic systems.},

By mapping the conventional amplitude modulation to spatial mode modulation and employing an integrated orbital angular momentum (OAM) mode multiplexer, we present an integrated approach to break the spatial light modulation speed limit and implement the high-speed silicon-chip-assisted OAM encoding information transfer. The silicon chip is formed by a multi-mode micro-ring resonator with angular grating embedded in the inner wall and two bus waveguides with different widths for OAM mode multiplexing. Using the fabricated silicon-based OAM mode multiplexer (OAM +1 and OAM -14 ), we demonstrate 15-Gbit/s amplitude-to-OAM modulation mapping in the experiment, which is far beyond the achievable low-speed OAM encoding information transfer with a conventional spatial light modulator (SLM). The observed optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR) penalties at a bit-error rate (BER) of 2 × 10 −3 are about 1.0 dB, and the OSNR penalty is improved by about 1.4 dB with the balanced detection. The demonstrations with favorable performance may open up added opportunities in more spatial-mode-enabled applications by photon dimension mapping with silicon chips.},

However, existing techniques for distributing the OAM modes rely on specially designed fibers or couplers. Direct transmission of multiplexed OAM modes through a long standard multimode fiber remains challenging because the strong mode coupling in fibers disables OAM demultiplexing. Here, we propose a deep-learning-based approach to recover the scattered data from multiplexed OAM channels without measuring any phase information. Over a 1-km-long standard multimode fiber, our method is able to identify different OAM modes with an accuracy of more than 99.9\% in the parallel demultiplexing of 24 scattered OAM channels. To demonstrate the transmission quality, color images are encoded in multiplexed twisted light and our method achieves decoding the transmitted data with an error rate of 0.13\%. Our work shows that the artificial intelligence algorithm could benefit the use of OAM multiplexing in commercial fiber networks and high-performance optical communication in turbulent environments.},

  abstract     = {While experiment, simulation, and theory all show that the gas breakdown voltage decreases linearly with gap distance for microscale gaps at atmospheric pressure due to the contribution of field emitted electrons, the continuing reduction in device size motivates a more fundamental understanding of gas breakdown scaling for nanoscale gaps. In this study, we measure current–voltage curves for electrodes with different emitter widths for 20–800 nm gaps at atmospheric pressure to measure breakdown voltage and assess electron emission behavior. The breakdown voltage V b depends more strongly on effective gap distance d eff than the ratio of the emitter width to the gap distance. For 20 and 800 nm gaps, we measure V b ≈ 5 V and V b ≈ 275 V. Independent of emitter width, V b decreases linearly with decreasing d eff for d eff ≳ 200 nm; for d eff &lt; 200 nm, V b decreases less rapidly with decreasing d eff , which may correspond to a change in the field enhancement factor for smaller gaps. While gas breakdown usually proceeds directly from field emission, as for microscale gaps, some cases exhibit space-charge contribution prior to the transition to breakdown, as demonstrated by orthodoxy tests. Applying nexus theory, we determine that the range of d eff studied is close to the transitions between field emission and space-charge-limited current in vacuum and with collisions, necessitating a coupled theoretical solution to more precisely model the electron emission behavior. Implications on device design and an overall assessment of the dependence of emission and breakdown on gap distance are also discussed.},

We show PA to be more reliable at low energy x-ray spectra (40 kVp), where conventional DE breaks down due to insufficient separation of the energies used in measurements, and to produce results comparable with “standard” DE implemented at high energy (120 kVp), therefore, offering a valuable alternative in applications where the use of high x-ray energy is impractical.},

Changes in the lattice strain and temperature were simultaneously characterized by changes in the phonon frequency of E 2 (high) and A 1 (LO) from the on-state and unpowered/pinched off reference states. Lower doses of radiation improved electrical properties; however, degradation initiated at about 10 6 rads. We observed about 16\% decrease in the saturation current and 6\% decrease in the transconductance at the highest dose. However, a leakage current increase by three orders of magnitude was the most notable radiation effect. We observed temperature increase by 40\% and mechanical stress increase by a factor of three at a dose of 10 7 rads compared to the pristine devices. Spatial mapping of mechanical stress along the channel identifies the gate region as a mechanically affected area, whereas the thermal degradation was mostly uniform. Transmission electron microscopy showed contrast changes reflecting a high vacancy concentration in the gate region. These findings suggest that localized stress (mechanical hotspots) may increase vulnerability to radiation damage by accommodating higher concentration of defects that promote the leakage current.},

In single-photon detection, a saturated counting rate is obtained at a low dark count rate (&lt;10 cps). Furthermore, we observed 16 output modes corresponding one-to-one with 16 states (15 photon responses + 1 state without photons) in multiphoton mode. This structure not only inherits the advantages of high quantum efficiency and low dark count rate of traditional SNSPD, but also realizes the resolution of photon position and number simultaneously without complicated optical system.

Specifically, by using a small-scale model of a channel hydraulic radius of ∼3 mm, we demonstrate that the light-driven water pump having light-absorbing and reflecting parts produces a net flow of ∼0.27 mm/s (flow rate ∼10 μ l/s) in a circular channel under the irradiation intensity of 160 W/m 2 . That is, we have developed a light-driven water pump that works under sunlight without a special energy supply. Furthermore, through the discussion about the scale-up model, we estimate that a 10-times larger-size light-driven water pump has the performance of flow rate ∼1 l/s with a high-pressure difference in the future. Therefore, our technology can help to achieve sustainable transport of water or fluids.},

However, an ongoing challenge arises from inadequate response to the photoacoustic impulses owing to limited bandwidth of the piezoelectric transducer. Here, we develop spectroscopically resolved optical-resolution photoacoustic microscopy (OR-PAM) by incorporating a broadband surface plasmon resonance sensor (∼169.5-MHz bandwidth) as the ultrasonic detector. The photoacoustic spectra from polystyrene and polymethyl methacrylate microspheres represent the close dependence upon the density and sound speed in addition to the diameter. The photoacoustic structural images of the two types of microspheres with the same morphology manifest the nearly identical appearances, while the photoacoustic spectroscopic analysis permits them to be clearly distinguished because of the different densities and sound speeds. The results suggest that, by simultaneously revealing the anatomic structures and acoustic spectra, our spectroscopically resolved OR-PAM system is potentially valuable in characterizing the microscopic features of biological samples at a cellular level.},

The open-orbit topology contributes to a non-negligible part of the Fermi surfaces (FSs), like that of the isostructural compound MoAs 2 , where the open FS is proposed to likely explain the origin of XMR. We further demonstrate the observation of open characters in the overall FSs of W 2 As 3 , which is also a XMR semimetal with the same space group of C 12/ m 1 as the TmPn 2 family and MoAs 2 .

  abstract     = {The ferroelectric properties of hafnium oxide and zirconium oxide based thin films are promising for applications in low power electronics, such as ultra-thin ferroelectric tunneling devices. However, the amount of ferroelectric phase in the film depends on their polycrystalline morphology, which changes with film thickness. Therefore, controlling the film thickness without changing the ferroelectric properties has remained challenging. Here, we propose the use of thermal atomic layer etching to decouple the ferroelectric phase stabilization from the film thickness. First, the ferroelectric phase fraction is maximized by crystallizing the film at an optimized film thickness. Subsequently, the ferroelectric film thickness is reduced to the desired range by atomic layer etching. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach for a ferroelectric hafnium zirconium oxide film of 10 nm initial thickness, which we integrate into a double-layer ferroelectric tunnel junction. The atomic layer etch rate of ferroelectric hafnium zirconium oxide using HF and dimethylaluminum chloride is found to be ∼0.2 Å/cycle. Although the ferroelectric phase persists after atomic layer etching, the etching increases the surface roughness. For applications in ferroelectric tunnel junctions, we show that atomic layer etching of ferroelectric hafnium zirconium oxide can improve the read current by more than a factor of 200, while at the same time reducing the read voltage by 43\%. The resulting tunneling electroresistance of about 2500 is the highest reported so far for polycrystalline hafnium zirconium oxide-based materials.},

In this work, we present studies of the optimization of such structures through a multi-pronged approach, taking advantage of material and interface engineering to enhance THz spintronic emission. This includes the application of multi-stacks of HM/FM junctions and their application to trilayer structures, the use of spin-sinks to simultaneously enhance the THz emitted fields and reduce the use of thick Pt layers to reduce optical absorption, and the use of semi-metals to increase the spin polarization and, thus, THz emission. Through these approaches, significant enhancements of the THz field can be achieved. Importantly, taking into account the optical absorption permits to elucidate novel phenomena such as the relation between the spin diffusion length and the spin-sink using THz spectroscopy, as well as possibly distinguishing between self- and interface-spin-to-charge conversion in semi-metals.},

To overcome this problem, we present a temperature dependence study of the transverse resistance changes in the switching experiment with CoO | Pt devices. We demonstrate the possibility to extract a pattern of spin Hall magnetoresistance for current pulses with a density of 5 × 10 7 A cm − 2 that is present only below the Néel temperature and does not follow a trend expected for thermal effects. This is the compelling evidence for the magnetic origin of the signal, which is observed using purely electrical techniques. We confirm these findings by complementary experiments in an external magnetic field. Such an approach can allow determining the optimal conditions for switching antiferromagnets and be very valuable when no imaging techniques can be applied to verify the origin of the electrical signal.},

  abstract     = {A two-sublattice ferrimagnet undergoes a transition from a collinear to the canted magnetic phase at magnetic field oriented along an easy magnetization direction. In this work, we study the transition by means of the magneto-optical Faraday effect in a thin film of compensated iron garnet (Lu 3− x Bi x )(Fe 5− y−z Ga y Al z )O 12 grown on the Gd 3 Ga 5 O 12 substrate. In the immediate vicinity of the compensation temperature, a precursor of the transition with a complex shape was observed. Using a special sample with variable thickness, we demonstrate an interfacial origin of the precursor. Diffusion of gadolinium from the substrate into the film forms a thin intermixed layer with enhanced magnetization. It induces an extended inhomogeneous magnetic structure in the film. A two-step shape of the precursor appears due to an easy-plane anisotropy of the intermixed magnetic layer. We emphasize that an effective width of the inhomogeneous magnetization distribution in the film grows enormously while approaching the compensation temperature.},

  abstract     = {Deterministic magnetization switching driven by current-induced spin–orbit torque (SOT) without an external magnetic field has potential applications in magnetic random access memory. Here, we realized the field-free magnetization switching in a T-type structure (CoFeB/W/CoFeB), where the two CoFeB layers have perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and in-plane magnetic anisotropy (IMA), respectively. We discovered that the direction of symmetry-breaking field is parallel to the magnetization of the bottom CoFeB (IMA), which cannot be explained by a stray field of this layer. In addition, by placing a 2.5-nm thick insulating layer of MgO between the bottom CoFeB and W layer (CoFeB/MgO/W/CoFeB) to block the interlayer exchange coupling and the spin current from the bottom CoFeB, the field-free SOT switching was still achieved, primarily due to the Néel orange-peel effect in our devices. By using micromagnetic simulations, the roughness of angstrom magnitude was introduced into the model to calculate the symmetry-breaking field, finding a qualitative agreement with experiments. Moreover, we obtained the spin Hall angle of CoFeB ( ⁠ θ SH = −0.024) by the current-induced hysteresis loop shift method, and the contribution of the effective efficiency χ from the bottom CoFeB was accounted for about 26\% of the total in the current-induced SOT switching process. These results indicated that an in-plane ferromagnet layer in the T-type structure provides not only the symmetry-breaking field but also spin current for the field-free SOT magnetization switching.},

  abstract     = {We explore the terahertz (THz) emission from CoFeB/Pt spintronic structures in the below-magnetic-saturation regime and reveal an orientation dependence in the emission, arising from in-plane uniaxial magnetic anisotropy (UMA) in the ferromagnetic layer. Maximizing the UMA during the film deposition process and aligning the applied magnetic field with the easy axis of the structure allow the THz emission to reach saturation under weaker applied fields. In addition, the THz emission amplitude remains at saturation levels when the applied field is removed. The development of CoFeB/Pt spintronic structures that can emit broadband THz pulses without the need for an applied magnetic field is beneficial to THz magneto-optical spectroscopy and facilitates the production of large-area spintronic emitters. Furthermore, by aligning the applied field along the hard axis of the structure, the linear polarization plane of the emitted THz radiation can be manipulated by changing the magnitude of the applied field. We, therefore, demonstrate THz polarization control without the need for mechanical rotation of external magnets.},

  abstract     = {Polarization-induced (Pi) distributed or bulk doping in GaN, with a zero dopant ionization energy, can reduce temperature or frequency dispersions in impurity-doped p–n junctions caused by the deep-acceptor-nature of Mg, thus offering GaN power devices promising prospects. Before comprehensively assessing the benefits of Pi-doping, ideal junction behaviors and high-voltage capabilities should be confirmed. In this work, we demonstrate near-ideal forward and reverse I–V characteristics in Pi-doped GaN power p–n diodes, which incorporates linearly graded, coherently strained AlGaN layers. Hall measurements show a net increase in the hole concentration of 8.9 × 10 16 cm −3 in the p-layer as a result of the polarization charge. In the Pi-doped n-layer, a record-low electron concentration of 2.5 × 10 16 cm −3 is realized due to the gradual grading of Al 0-0.72 GaN over 1 μ m. The Pi-doped p–n diodes have an ideality factor as low as 1.1 and a 0.10 V higher turn-on voltage than the impurity-doped p–n diodes due to the increase in the bandgap at the junction edge. A differential specific on-resistance of 0.1 mΩ cm 2 is extracted from the Pi-doped p–n diodes, similar with the impurity-doped counterpart. The Pi-doped diodes show an avalanche breakdown voltage of ∼1.25 kV, indicating a high reverse blocking capability even without an ideal edge-termination. This work confirms that distributed Pi-doping can be incorporated in high-voltage GaN power devices to increase hole concentrations while maintaining excellent junction properties.},

Spectral signatures are seen for a number of optical transitions between the valence and conduction bands, including a broad peak at 1.5 eV, which is likely dominated by bulk band-to-band optical transitions but is at the same energy as the well-known optical transition between the two topologically protected conducting surface states.

While the performance of photodetectors based on crystalline Ga 2 O 3 thin films grown on hard substrates has been continuously improved, photodetectors based on amorphous Ga 2 O 3 grown on less-stringent substrates in a more convenient and accessible way emerged as alternative technology and received increasing attention. Herein, we choose thulium (Tm) for doping and grow amorphous Tm-Ga 2 O 3 films on non-lattice-matched flexible mica substrates. Thanks to the larger bandgap of Tm 2 O 3 (∼6.5 eV) and stronger Tm–O bond, the (Tm x Ga 1− x ) 2 O 3 films possess broadened bandgap and lessened oxygen vacancies compared to pure Ga 2 O 3 . Consequently, the photodetectors that were produced based on these amorphous (Tm x Ga 1− x ) 2 O 3 films exhibit high performances with both low dark current and fast response speed (36.47 pA and 0.07 s at x = 0.05) and well maintain the performance after multiple cycles of bending at radius as small as 5 mm.

X-ray photoelectron microscopy analysis reveals good band alignment between p-MnO QDs and n-GaN, demonstrating the (type-II) staggered band alignment p–n heterojunction-based device. Electrical and photocurrent measurements show a high photocurrent response with a low dark current, while superior photo-responsivity (∼2530 mA/W) is achieved, along with self-powered and visible-blind characteristics (265 nm cutoff), demonstrating a high-performance DUV device with high detection limit for low light level applications. This study provides insights into the potential of p-type MnO QDs for III-nitride p–n junction DUV devices.},

  abstract     = {We demonstrate the synaptic characteristics of analogously modulated channel currents in Cu-ion-actuated electrochemical RAM (ECRAM) based on an HfO x electrolyte and a WO x channel. Uncontrolled synaptic response is found as a function of the gate pulse when a Cu-rich gate electrode delivers mobile ions, presumably due to many ions injected from the infinite ion reservoir. As a result, we propose a CuO x oxide electrode to limit ion sources, which is indirectly validated by a physical examination of the degree of chemical bonding between Cu and oxygen, thereby boosting gate controllability over the channel. In addition, the HfO x electrolyte needs to be designed to facilitate the adequate migration of Cu ions, considering thickness and film quality. Using material stack engineering, the channel current of optimized CuO x /HfO x /WO x ECRAM can be steadily tuned via repeated identical gate pulses. The channel current and its change are proportional to the device area and the amount of migrated ions relevant to the gate pulse conditions, respectively. The homogeneous flow of ions across the entire area can, thus, be used to explain the obtained analog switching. The gate-controllable synaptic behavior of the ECRAM accelerates deep neural network training based on backpropagation algorithms. An improved pattern recognition accuracy of ∼88\% for handwritten digits is achieved by linearly tuned multiple current states with more than 100 pulses and asymmetric gate voltage conditions in a three-layer neural network validated in simulation.},

  abstract     = {Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) provide a powerful method to develop novel materials for photocatalysis and photovoltaics. To realize efficient visible light absorption for these applications, the metal nodes play the crucial role in determining the bandgap, conduction band position, and thus the light absorption. Tungsten (W) can be an outstanding choice for MOFs owing to their semi-occupied d orbitals, which will reduce the bandgap and shift the light absorption toward the visible-light region. However, there is a lack of pure W-based MOFs (W-MOFs). Here, three W-MOFs, named BOW, BCOW, and BSOW, are constructed by using benzene-based ligands, 1,4-benzene-diol, 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid, and 1,4-benzenedisulfonic. Ab initio calculations reveal the energetic stability and the effect of ligands on the modification of the electronic and light absorption properties of these W-MOFs. The benzene-linked BOW has a LUMO–HOMO gap of 1.85 eV and strong absorption in the range of green light owing to the weakened hybridization caused by the nonpolar-benzene-structure, whereas the stronger polarity of –COO– and –SO 3 – in BCOW and BSOW recovers the high W–O hybridization, enlarges the bandgap, and blueshifts the light absorption.},

By arraying several metasurface units with a gradient index distribution in the radial direction, a gradient-index three-dimensional planar underwater acoustic lens was constructed. Moreover, a lens with fewer units was designed to reduce the radial size by nearly a half to the original one while maintaining the excellent broadband focusing capability unchanged. In addition, by adding a back cavity on the focusing side of the lens, a lens-based acoustic concentrator was proposed which could greatly enhance the sound energy gain in a wide frequency range. Finally, samples of the underwater acoustic planar lens and concentrator were fabricated and measured in an anechoic tank, which verified that the designed underwater acoustic concentrator has excellent broadband sound energy enhancement performance. The underwater acoustic planar lens and concentrator proposed in this work have potential application values including but not limited to underwater target detection and acoustic energy harvesting.},

Increasing the fraction of the surface that is terminated with an SrO layer is correlated with a decrease in the chemical potential whereby the valence band maximum moves closer to the Fermi level, but without a significant change in the bandgap. Inasmuch as SrO-terminated STO (001) has previously been shown to act as an electron scavenger in which carriers from the bulk are trapped, we argue that the high fraction of SrO in the terminal layer is what lowers the chemical potential in Sr-rich STO. Our experimental results provide important insights into various physical phenomena that can occur on STO (001) surfaces and their effect on bulk electronic properties.},

The interfacial analysis through the transmission electron microscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy shows a thickness reduction in the SiN layer of ∼1.7 nm, which converts to a thin SiC layer at the diamond/SiN interface, and no carbon diffusion is found in the SiN layer after the diamond growth. Device simulation using the thermal properties extracted by time domain thermoreflectance predicts a temperature drop of 17.1 °C when the diamond only covers the device access region and reveals that the improvement of thermal boundary resistance is much more effective than that of the diamond thermal conductivity for the top-side heat spreading, which is mainly due to the limited thickness of the top diamond film.},

The results indicate that the proposed strategy produces a greater pressure difference for sub-droplet generation, especially when traditional droplet splitting is not possible with restricted microfluidics device geometries. The proposed geometrical model is a powerful tool to propose several improved droplet generation strategies.

In this Letter, we investigated the dislocation propagations and reactions in α -Ga 2 O 3 micropillar arrays selectively grown by halide vapor phase epitaxy technique. Screw dislocations in α -Ga 2 O 3 micropillars grown from the selective area epitaxy (SAE) to ELO mode exhibited an independent character with an average density of 4.5 × 10 6 cm −2 while the edge dislocation density was reduced to 5.3 × 10 8 cm −2 . During the initial SAE process, the α -Ga 2 O 3 hexagonal pyramid is developed with the observed inversion domains within the pillar cores. The successive epitaxial lateral overgrowth ELO facilitates the formation of inclined facets upon the SiO 2 mask. Almost complete filtering of the underlying threading dislocation has been demonstrated in the ELO wings. Strong image forces induced by inclined free surfaces drive the propagation and reaction of threading dislocations until annihilation, which is well described by the dislocation-filtering model during the dynamic geometry transition of micropillars. These findings may pave the way for the success of the heteroepitaxy of low dislocation density α -Ga 2 O 3 toward the development of high-performance power devices.},

Two few-cycle pulses with pulse widths of 9.3 and 4.5 fs were generated in the long-wavelength side and the short-wavelength side, respectively. The temporal profiles were measured as the function of the different delay between the two pulses. The shortest 3.6 fs, 0.75 mJ near-single-cycle pulses were synthesized at an optimal delay. The delay-controlled high-harmonic generation in MgO was experimentally demonstrated leading to twofold enhancement of high-order harmonic (HH) yields at 10.3 eV and the extension of HH frequency under time-delay modulation. This method provides an extensive way for manipulating delay-controlled multi-color pulses, which can be used for controlling ionization dynamics in extreme nonlinear optics.

  abstract     = {Solid-state pyroelectric heat engines that utilize the temperature and electric field dependence of electric displacement are promising for high-efficiency high-power thermal-to-electrical energy conversion. However, one of the key challenges for pyroelectric energy conversion is the inaccessibility of tunable transient heat sources for energy harvesting. This Perspective analyzes the potential of thermal waveform engineering for pyroelectric energy generation. We use the Landau-Devonshire phenomenological model to evaluate the energy conversion performance of a representative pyroelectric material coupled to (1) static heat source/sink via thermal switches, and (2) modulated heat source. Using this thermodynamic analysis, which accounts for thermal and electrical losses, we demonstrate a path toward maximizing pyroelectric energy conversion performance through purposeful thermal and electrical control.},

  abstract     = {The development of pulse electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy at microwave frequencies above 100 GHz is rather challenging and expensive due to the low output power of modern high-frequency solid state electronics. However, there is a number of scientific problems that require spin relaxation measurements at THz frequencies. The rapid scan ESR is an alternative technique that does not require high microwave power and still provides information on the spin relaxation times. The method takes advantage of fast sweeps of the excitation microwave frequency over the ESR line. When the frequency sweep reaches a sufficiently high rate, distinct oscillations (also called wiggles ) appear in the ESR spectrum. These oscillations bear information about T 2 electron spin relaxation time, which can be extracted via fitting the rapid scan spectrum using the modified Bloch equations. In this Perspective Letter, we introduce the recent advances in this technique and discuss the future steps necessary to make the THz rapid scan ESR a convenient and easy to use tool.},

  abstract     = {The nonlinear mechanical behavior of individual nanoscale collagen fibrils is governed by molecular stretching and sliding that result in a viscous response, which is still not fully understood. Toward this goal, the in vitro mechanical behavior of individual reconstituted mammalian collagen fibrils was quantified in a broad range of strain-rates, spanning roughly six orders of magnitude, from 10 −4 to 35 s −1 . It is shown that the nonlinear mechanical response is strain rate sensitive with the tangent modulus in the linear deformation regime increasing monotonically from 214 ± 8 to 358 ± 11 MPa. More pronounced is the effect of the strain rate on the ultimate tensile strength that is found to increase monotonically by a factor of four, from 42 ± 6 to 160 ± 14 MPa. Importantly, fibril strengthening takes place without a reduction in ductility, which results in equivalently large increase in toughness with the increasing strain rate. This experimental strain rate dependent mechanical response is captured well by a structural constitutive model that incorporates the salient features of the collagen microstructure via a process of gradual recruitment of kinked tropocollagen molecules, thus giving rise to the initial “toe-heel” mechanical behavior, followed by molecular stretching and sustained intermolecular slip that is initiated at a strain rate dependent stress threshold. The model shows that the fraction of tropocollagen molecules undergoing straightening increases continuously during loading, whereas molecular sliding is initiated after a small fibril strain (1\%–2\%) and progressively increases with applied strain.},

Furthermore, effective coupling coefficients ( k 2 eff ) and quality factor ( Q ) of the devices have been investigated systematically. Specifically, spurious-free SAW resonators with the SH wave frequency over 7.40 GHz and the high k 2 eff value of ∼7.8\% were obtained at a nanoscale wavelength of 480 nm. Finally, high-performance filters with a bandwidth over 300 MHz were achieved. The demonstrated filters show sharp roll-off and spurious-free responses within the passband with insertion loss &lt;−5 dB and a small temperature coefficient of frequency of ∼−45.8 ppm/K at a super-high frequency of 7.17 GHz.

  abstract     = {A hardware based artificial neural network (ANN), which holds the potential to alleviate the computation load and energy of a digital computer, has propelled the development of memory devices that can resemble the synapse. Memcapacitors, especially based on ferroelectric materials, with theoretically no static power, nondestructive readout, and multiple polarization states, are expected to have good energy efficiency and endurance as emerging artificial synapses. However, conventional ferroelectric devices are characterized with extremely high remnant polarization, which requires high energy for polarization state updating and always leads to low linearity and symmetry in updating properties. Here, we show a memcapacitive synapse based on an Au/HfZrO x (HZO)/Au ferroelectric memcapacitor with moderate remnant polarization that can offer unexceptionable updating properties for building an ANN. The memcapacitor demonstrates more than 64 weight states with an ultralow weight updating energy of ≤3.0 fJ/ μ m 2 . Both potentiation and depression synaptic characteristics show an ultralow non-linearity of &lt;10 −2 . Based on these properties, a two-layer restricted Boltzmann machine is built based on this memcapacitive synapse, and it can be trained to reconstruct incomplete images. The reconstructed images show reduced Euclidean distance to originals in comparison with that of the incomplete images. Furthermore, the memcapacitive synapse is also tested by a handwritten digits recognition task based on a simple perceptron, and the pattern recognition accuracy is as high as 93.4\%. These results indicate that the HZO-based capacitive synapse devices have great potential for future high-efficiency neuromorphic systems.},

Here, we study the temperature-dependent behavior of PCM devices by probing the reset power at ambient temperatures from 80 to 400 K. We find that different device structures exhibit contrasting temperature-dependent behavior. The reset power in our confined-type PCM is nearly unchanged with ambient temperature, corresponding to a temperature-dependent thermal resistance, whereas results for mushroom-type PCM from the literature show a linear relation between power and temperature, suggesting a more constant thermal resistance. This discrepancy is ascribed to different temperature distributions and thermal properties of the dominant components of the PCM cell thermal resistance, as shown by electro-thermal modeling. In the confined cell, the thermal boundary resistance of the GST and the thermal conductivity of the bottom electrode dominate the thermal resistance, while for the mushroom cell, the GST thermal conductivity plays a greater role. These findings can help to design more power- and energy-efficient PCM devices by better focusing thermal management efforts on the key components of the device.},

  abstract     = {Liquid dye lasers have long been considered as ideal tunable laser sources in the visible range but are bulky, expensive, and require a complex system for dye circulation. Here, we present a system that relies on a low-cost blue laser diode as the pump source and a sealed dye cell with no flowing circuitry, resulting in a device that combines the convenience and size of a solid-state device with the stability of a liquid organic laser. A very high photo-stability is obtained (up to 1.2 × 10 9 pulses or 12 days at 1 kHz), which is five orders of magnitude higher than a solid-state dye laser operated in similar conditions. The number of pulses obtainable at low repetition rates is found to be limited by molecular self-diffusion and, hence, related to the total cuvette volume. In contrast, the repetition rate is limited to a few kHz, which suggests that thermal effects play a bigger role than triplet population effects. Thermal effects participate in the suppression of lasing through the buildup of a strong negative thermal lens; correcting the non-aberrant part of this thermal lens by resonator design enables the repetition rate to be pushed up to 14 kHz with possible further optimization. This work shows a route for building off-the-shelf, compact, low-cost, and convenient tunable pulsed lasers in the visible range that have superior stability over organic solid-state lasers.},

The photoluminescence resulting from recombination across the interface is expected to be long-lived and to exhibit non-exponential decay of emission intensity after pulsed excitation. We verify this prediction using time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy on nanowires containing a single heterostructure between a single segment of wurtzite and zinc blende. We find that a significant intensity of type-II emission remains even more than 30 ns after excitation. The decay of the emission intensity is also non-exponential and considerably longer than the exponential decay of the wurtzite InP segment (260 ps). Our results are consistent with the expected photoluminescence characteristics of a type-II interface between the two polytypes. We also find that the lifetime becomes shorter if we create an electron gas at the interface by n-type doping the entire wurtzite segment of the nanowire. This is expected since there are many electrons that a given hole can recombine with, in contrast to the undoped case.},

  abstract     = {Sample suspension is a valuable method to improve the mechanical, thermal, electronic, and optical properties of low-dimensional materials. In terms of confined light-matter waves—the polaritons, sample suspension can elongate the wavelength of polaritons with a positive phase velocity. Previous work demonstrates a wavelength elongation of ∼10\% for hyperbolic phonon polaritons (HPPs) in uniaxial crystals of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). In this work, we report the alteration of HPPs in biaxial α-phase molybdenum trioxide (α-MoO 3 ) by sample suspension. Our combined infrared nano-imaging experiments and electromagnetic theory reveal a wavelength elongation &gt; 60\% and a propagation length increase &gt; 140\%, due to the simultaneous wavelength elongation and dissipation elimination in the suspended specimen. We have also examined HPPs in α-MoO 3 with a negative phase velocity. The sample suspension shortens the HPP wavelength and simultaneously reduces the dissipation due to the unique permittivity tensor. The HPPs with improved figures of merits in the suspended specimen may be developed for nano-polaritonic circuits, biochemical sensing, emission engineering, and energy transfer.},

The first one is the positive up negative down method, which allows us to obtain information about the switching and non-switching contributions to the polarization. It shows that the as-deposited film is ferroelectric before annealing, since it has a switching contribution to the polarization. After annealing, both the switching and non-switching contributions to polarization increased by a factor of 1.6 and 2.33, respectively, indicating a stronger ferroelectric behavior. The second method is based on impedance spectroscopy coupled with Rayleigh analysis. The results show that post-deposition thermal annealing increases the reversible domain wall contribution to the dielectric permittivity by a factor of 11 while keeping the threshold field similar. This indicates that, after annealing, domain wall density is larger while domain wall mobility remains similar. These two complementary characterization methods show that annealing increases the ferroelectric behavior of the thick film by increasing the domain wall density, and its influence is visible both on polarization vs electric field loop and dielectric permittivity.},

Furthermore, the excitation and reception performances were evaluated. It is determined from the finite element simulation that the CAS-based guided wave transducer can excite pure SH 0 waves in a specific direction. Experimental results confirmed that pure SH 0 waves could be achieved and received by the designed CAS-based transducer, which is in good agreement with the theoretical study.

Such fluxons are supercurrent vortices that can be accelerated by bias current up to the Swihart velocity, which is the characteristic velocity of electromagnetic waves in the junction. We experimentally demonstrate slowing down relativistic fluxons in Josephson junctions whose bulk superconducting electrodes are replaced by thin films of a high kinetic inductance superconductor. Here, the amount of magnetic flux carried by each supercurrent vortex is significantly smaller than the magnetic flux quantum Φ 0 ⁠ . Our data show that the Swihart velocity is reduced by about one order of magnitude compared to conventional long Josephson junctions. At the same time, the characteristic impedance is increased by an order of magnitude, which makes these junctions suitable for a variety of applications in superconducting electronics.},

When the magnetic field was applied parallel to the c-axis (H ‖ c-axis), however, the negative MR disappeared and a positive MR appeared around zero field at low temperatures. Detailed analysis and modeling indicate that the positive MR is due to the weak anti-localization effect arising from the strong spin–orbit coupling of CNS.},

In the Fe film, a regular alternation of magnetic anisotropy produces a back-and-forth rotation of uniform magnetization in zero magnetic field. Spin waves propagating across this domain structure are refracted at the magnetic domain walls because of abrupt changes in the dispersion relation and phase velocity. Using super-Nyquist sampling magneto-optical Kerr effect microscopy, we image the routing of spin waves and analyze the dependence of the effect on frequency and the propagation direction. We find that spin waves are routed efficiently by angles up to 60° without measurable loss in amplitude. The experimental results are reproduced by micromagnetic simulations and calculations based on the modified Snell&#39;s law for magnonics.},

Here, we present two strategies to minimize the temporal separation of two consecutive femtosecond laser pulses to toggle the out-of-plane direction of the magnetization of ferrimagnetic rare-earth transition metal alloys. First, by systematically changing the heat transfer rates using either amorphous glass, crystalline silicon, or polycrystalline diamond substrates, we show that efficient cooling rates of the magnetic system present a prerequisite to accelerate the sequence of double pulse toggle switching. Second, we demonstrate that replacing the transition metal iron by cobalt leads to a significantly faster recovery of the magnetization after optical excitation allowing us to approach terahertz frequency of write/erase cycles with a minimum pulse-to-pulse separation of 7 ps.},

While a variety of approaches are currently used to determine the exchange parameter, each has its limitations, and good agreement among them has not been achieved. To date, neutron scattering, magnetometry, Brillouin light scattering, spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance spectroscopy, and Kerr microscopy have all been used to determine the exchange parameter. Here, we present a method that exploits the wavevector selectivity of Brillouin light scattering to measure the spin wave dispersion in both the backward volume and Damon–Eshbach orientations. The exchange, saturation magnetization, and magnetic thickness are then determined by a simultaneous fit of both dispersion branches with general spin wave theory without any prior knowledge of the thickness of a magnetic “dead layer.” In this work, we demonstrate the strength of this technique for ultrathin metallic films, typical of those commonly used in industrial applications for magnetic random-access memory.},

Particularly, low or high frequency components are suppressed at the border of the excitation area depending on the orientation of the external magnetic field with respect to the magnetocrystalline anisotropy axes of the film. The effect is ascribed to the ultrafast local heating of the film. Furthermore, the time resolution of the implemented all-optical technique allows us to extract the chirp of the MSSW packet in the time domain via wavelet analysis. The chirp is a result of the group velocity dispersion of the MSSW and, thus, is controlled by the film&#39;s magnetic parameters, magnetization and anisotropy, and external field orientation.

It is demonstrated that the covering of the BP flakes with hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) films leads to the hybridization of the BP&#39;s SPPs with the hBN&#39;s hyperbolic phonon polaritons and to the significant enhancement of the NFRHT at the hBN&#39;s epsilon-near-zero frequencies. It is also shown that the NFRHT in the BP/hBN parallel-plate structure can be actively switched between the ON and OFF states by changing the chemical potential of the BPs and that the NFRHT can be modified by altering the number of the BP layers. Finally, we replace hBN with α-MoO 3 and explore how the NFRHT is spectrally and strongly modified in the BP/α-MoO 3 parallel-plate structure. We believe that the proposed BP/polar-vdW-material parallel-plate structures can prove useful in the thermal management of optoelectronic devices.},

  abstract     = {Brillouin oscillation appears in picosecond ultrasonics for a transparent specimen because of backward light scattering by moving strain pulse. Its amplitude is comparable with those of other responses, such as pulse-echo signals and through-thickness resonance, obscuring these non-Brillouin-oscillation responses. We here find that Brillouin oscillation can be suppressed in a transparent free-standing film by coating both sides with a metallic thin film of appropriate thickness and that this peculiar behavior is caused by strain pulses generated on both sides with a slight phase difference. This phenomenon allowed us to fabricate a Brillouin-oscillation-free diamond free-standing film, which showed a high capability for sensor applications.},

In this Letter, inorganic halide perovskite CsPb(I x Cl y Br 1−x−y ) 3 epitaxial alloyed films on (001)-SrTiO 3 (STO) substrates were grown by PLD. The film crystal quality, phase stability, and the epitaxial relationship between the film and substrate were characterized with a detailed x-ray diffraction technique like high-resolution reciprocal spatial mapping and ϕ-scan. In addition, the photocarrier dynamics of the alloyed epitaxial films were investigated by photophysics spectroscopy, including steady and femtosecond transient optical absorption spectroscopy and temperature-dependent and time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy. The bandgap of the CsPbX 3 films was tuned from 1.75 to 2.98 eV by substituting X with I/Br/Cl and their mixture of different ratios. Free exciton emissions were observed at a low temperature photoluminescence spectrum (PL, 10 K), which confirmed the high crystal and optical quality of the epitaxial perovskite alloyed films except the CsPbI 3 film. The femtosecond transient absorption spectra also showed that such perovskite films are of very low concentration of exciton trap states. These results indicated that PLD is a powerful technology for growing high quality inorganic halide perovskite films with a tunable bandgap covering the full visible light range, which provided more options for CsPbX 3 based panchromatic LED and other optoelectronic devices.},

  abstract     = {Strong spontaneous polarization and piezoelectric effects in hexagonal gallium nitride (h-GaN) seriously limit the efficiency of h-GaN-based devices. To overcome this issue, a pyramidal-shaped four V-grooved silicon (4PVG-Si) patterned substrate is introduced for transforming h-GaN into cubic GaN (c-GaN) at the nanoscale. The purpose of using 4PVG-Si instead of simple V-grooved Si (VG-Si) is to improve the crystal quality with the maximum cubic volume of GaN. The growth of c-GaN was verified by high-resolution x-ray diffraction and cathodoluminescence, whereas high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) was further used to analyze the excessive and smooth c-GaN growth. The HRTEM images revealed that optimizing the growth of an aluminum nitride layer with 10–15 nm thicknesses promotes the maximum c-GaN volume. However, exceeding this thickness tended to the reduction in c-GaN volume, resulting in the development of big voids with abnormal tip-shaped growth. In the presence of big voids and abnormal tip-shaped growth, the hexagonal growth closed very late, and the cubic volume of c-GaN is reduced. To further promote the cubic phase of GaN, the growth conditions of GaN were also optimized. Our results proved that the design of 4PVG-Si and optimized growth conditions promote the maximum cubic volume of GaN.},

It has been reported that the temperature dependence of the resistivity of CCNWO deviates from that predicted by the Arrhenius equation over a wide temperature range.

A combination of transmission electron microscopy and the density functional theory showed that CaCeNbWO 8- δ and CaCe 0.5 La 0.5 NbWO 8- δ have a modulated defect structure, and the carriers mainly undergo a Nb 4d →W 5d transition. At low temperatures, anisotropic defects promote the diversification of transport properties, variable-range hopping, and nearest neighbor hopping. With increasing temperature, isotropic defects promote simplification of the transport property. Compared with CCNWO, CaCe 0.5 La 0.5 NbWO 8- δ , with a more stable structure, has stronger electron–electron interactions and shifts the localization–delocalization transition point to a higher temperature.

In this work, we use experiments, analytical models, and density functional theory calculations to study the scattering mechanisms that determine Hall mobility in two Cu 2 O samples. First, we examine a polycrystalline Cu 2 O thin film deposited by RF magnetron sputtering, and second, a single-crystalline Cu 2 O bulk substrate. Temperature-dependent Hall measurements indicate that neutral impurity and grain boundary scattering are dominant for the polycrystalline Cu 2 O thin film, while phonon scattering is dominant for single-crystalline Cu 2 O. Our first-principles calculations show that the room-temperature intrinsic hole mobility of Cu 2 O is 106 cm 2 V −1 s −1 , indicating the great promise of the material for p-type electronic devices. This intrinsic mobility is limited by phonon scattering, with the most dominant scattering modes having phonon energies of 88.4 and 17.1 meV. These results indicate that the key pathways to increase the hole mobility in Cu 2 O thin films are by reducing the impurity concentration and by increasing grain size. Our work thus sets the stage for the future development of high performance Cu 2 O-based p-type thin film transistors.},

In order to achieve the cubic phase at low temperatures, we have grown SnTe employing the modified Bridgman method and studied its properties in detail. Analysis of the crystal structure using Laue diffraction and rocking curve measurements shows a high degree of single crystallinity and mosaicity of the sample. The magnetic susceptibility shows diamagnetic behavior, and the specific heat data match phonon contributions typical of a bulk insulator. Resistivity data exhibit metallic conduction similar to two-dimensional systems, and the signature of the structural transition has not been observed down to the lowest temperature studied. Detailed powder x-ray diffraction measurements show a cubic structure in the entire temperature range studied. This is supported by the angle-resolved photoemission data at low temperatures exhibiting a Dirac cone typical of a topological material. These results demonstrate that the ground state structure of SnTe can be stabilized in the cubic phase, providing a promising platform for quantum applications.},

  abstract     = {In this Letter, we report on establishing high performance hysteresis-free and μ s-switching depletion/enhancement-mode (D/E-mode) β-Ga 2 O 3 heterojunction (HJ) field effect transistors (FETs) with the state-of-art power figure-of-merit (P-FOM). By optimizing the p-NiO x /n-Ga 2 O 3 interface and n-Ga 2 O 3 recess technology, a positive threshold voltage (V T ) as well as a low subthreshold slope can be substantially achieved. The trade-off between the on-resistance (R on,sp ) and breakdown voltage (BV) is improved by incorporation of T-shaped NiO x , resulting in the R on,sp of 6.24/13.75 mΩ cm 2 and the breakdown voltage (BV) of 2145/1977 V for D/E-mode devices and yielding the P-FOM = BV 2 /R on,sp to be 0.74/0.28 GW/cm 2 . To the best of all the authors&#39; knowledge, those P-FOMs are the highest ones among all published lateral Ga 2 O 3 FETs. Benefited from the high-quality interface, a negligible hysteresis of 4 mV and μ s-switching can be essentially achieved, showing the great promise of Ga 2 O 3 HJ-FETs for future high-power, high-efficiency, and high-speed power electronics.},

  abstract     = {The recently discovered kagome net compounds A V 3 Sb 5 ( A = K, Rb, and Cs) become superconducting on cooling, in addition to displaying interesting topological features in the electronic structure. They also exhibit charge density wave ordering, which manifests as a breathing-mode distortion in the kagome layers. It has been suggested that such ordering derives from nesting between saddle points on the Fermi surface. In aid of the evolving understanding of this intriguing materials class, we present calculations of Fermi surface nesting and Lindhard susceptibility of CsV 3 Sb 5 . The breathing mode distortions appear to not display a simple link with Fermi surface nesting (FSN) and do not display the signatures of a Peierls-like transition. The FSN is agnostic to changes along k z and is only mildly impacted by small shifts of the Fermi level. The results suggest that FSN is largely independent of specific features in the saddle point.},

It is in part attributable to the vast impedance mismatch between those materials and ambient media. Adding openings may facilitate to better bridge energy over, yet ineffective in many applications and may also damage the structural integrity. Here, we present an auxiliary ultrasound focusing meta-lens for stiff and dense materials. It offers significantly enhanced ultrasound transmission and focusing through a stiff metal plate yet without enforcing any through holes or openings. The simple, one-sided only meta-structures are designed and optimized by an inverse strategy based on the genetic algorithm. We numerically and experimentally demonstrate the much enhanced ultrasound transmission when the meta-lens is added to a flat brass plate, along with the capability to offer simultaneous ultrasound focusing. This design methodology can be easily extended to deal with more complex shaped target in a straightforward manner, offering a practical solution to the efficient tunneling of ultrasound energy through stiff and dense materials. With simple grating structures, the meta-lens can be easily fabricated, showing great application prospects in medical imaging and disease treatment.},

However, conventional UV photodetectors (PDs) have been facing intrinsic drawbacks of complicate structural issues and interference from ambient visible light. Therefore, wide bandgap semiconductors have attracted significant attention. Herein, self-powered PDs based on the monolithic germanium disulfide ( m -GeS 2 )/gallium nitride (GaN) pn heterojunction have been proposed with a large-size m -GeS 2 over 2 cm 2 . The electronic and optical properties of the m -GeS 2 /GaN heterojunction are investigated via experiments and first-principles methods. The PDs reveal an impressive performance in self-powered response and high responsivity and detectivity of 16.8 mA W −1 and 1.03 × 10 11 Jones, respectively. Further analyses determined that the PDs show an ultrafast photoresponse with a rise and fall time of &lt; 0.30 and 1.10 ms at 365 nm. Consequently, this study provides a feasible method for the synthesis of large-sized m -GeS 2 and demonstrates its enormous potential in high-performance, self-powered UV photodetection.},

  abstract     = {Unique effects of terahertz (THz)-wave–matter interaction push rapid progress in THz optoelectronics aimed at bridging the problematic THz gap. However, majority of modern methods of THz spectroscopy and imaging are still hampered by low spatial resolution. Common lens/mirror-based THz optics fails to overcome the Abbe barrier and usually provides resolution larger than a free-space wavelength λ (i.e., hundreds of micrometers or even few millimeters). To mitigate this difficulty, supperresolution THz imaging modalities were introduced recently, among which we particularly underline different methods of THz scanning-probe near-field microscopy. They not only rely on strong light confinement on sub-wavelength probes and provide resolution down to ∼ 10 − 1 – 10 − 3 λ but also suffer from small energy efficiency or presume an interplay among imaging resolution, signal-to-noise ratio, and performance. In this paper, we consider reflection-mode THz solid immersion (SI) microscopy that offers some compromise between the high imaging resolution of 0.15 λ and high energy efficiency, which is due to the absence of any subwavelength probe in an optical scheme. Recent achievements, challenging problems, and prospects of SI microscopy are overviewed with an emphasis on resolving the inverse problem and applications in THz biophotonics.},

  abstract     = {In ultrafast transmission electron microscopy, time zero can be accurately determined by making use of the photon-induced near-field electron microscopy (PINEM) effect, which causes electrons interacting with the near fields of a nanoparticle to coherently gain or lose energy in multiples of the photon energy when the laser pump and electron probe pulse overlap in time. If the instrument is not equipped with an energy filter, which is required to observe the PINEM effect, the response of a sample is frequently monitored instead. However, the gradual or delayed onset of this response can render an accurate measurement as challenging. Here, we demonstrate a simple and accurate method for determining time zero without an energy filter that is based on the observation that the outline of a nanoparticle blurs when the electron and laser pulse overlap in time. We show that this phenomenon arises from the PINEM effect, which causes some electrons to gain a large energy spread, thus blurring the image due to the chromatic aberration of the imaging system. This effect can also be used to characterize the instrument response and determine the laser polarization in situ . Furthermore, it may find applications for mapping out the near fields of a nanoparticle without the help of an energy filter.},

Semiconductor photocathodes are widely used here, as they enable the production of low-emittance beams with variable charge at high repetition rates. One of the key figures of merit of photocathodes is the minimum achievable bunch length. In semiconductor cathodes, this is dominated by scattering effects and varying penetration depths of the extracting photons, which leads to a characteristic electron emission function. We present a method to determine this cathode time response with resolution on the tens of femtoseconds level, breaking the resolution barrier encountered in previous studies. The method is demonstrated with cesium-telluride (Cs 2 Te) and gold cathodes, revealing response times of (184 ± 41) fs up to (253 ± 58) fs for the semiconductor and an upper limit of (93 ± 17) fs for the metal.

As the result of the temperature changes, the volume and, thus, the shape of the slender microgel change, which leads to repeated cycles of bending and elastic relaxation, and to net locomotion. Small devices designed for biomimetic locomotion need to exploit flows that are not symmetric in time (non-reciprocal) to escape the constraints of the scallop theorem and undergo net motion. Unlike other biological slender swimmers, the non-reciprocal bending of the gel centerline is not sufficient here to explain for the overall swimming motion. We show instead that the swimming of the gel results from the flux of water periodically emanating from (or entering) the gel itself due to its shrinking (or swelling). The associated flows induce viscous stresses that lead to a net propulsive force on the gel. We derive a theoretical model for this hypothesis of jet-driven propulsion, which leads to excellent agreement with our experiments.},

Finite element simulation is performed to analyze the characteristics of the gradient auxetic energy harvester.

Many UV PDs have been reported. However, high performance UV PDs with high responsivity and ultrafast light response time still need to be explored further. Here, we synthesized layered In 4/3 P 2 Se 6 nanoflakes via the chemical vapor conversion (CVC) method. The UV PDs based on as-grown In 4/3 P 2 Se 6 nanoflakes exhibit a very high light switching ratio of up to 6 × 10 5 at room temperature, which is ascribed to the large photocurrent and an ultralow dark current of ∼80 fA. Meanwhile, an ultrafast rise and a decay time of ∼ 470 μ s/440 μ s are achieved. The according responsivity, external quantum efficiency, and special detectivity are 4.31 A W −1 , 1485.2\%, and 6.3 × 10 12 Jones, respectively, which are excellent performance among the UV PDs based 2D layered materials. Notably, it has both high responsivity and fast light response time, better than other 2D layered semiconductor photodetectors.

Measured results indicate that both mobility and carrier velocity exhibit modest dependence on temperature, suggesting that AlGaN channel HEMTs are promising for future RF power applications.},

  abstract     = {Recently, perovskite compounds with ABX 3 structures have been attracting increasing attention because of their excellent properties and their potential for applications in fields such as optoelectronics and memory devices. In this Letter, we introduce a BaTiO 3 /Nb:SrTiO 3 (BTO/NSTO) heterostructure that displays both resistive switching and photovoltaic response characteristics. As a dual-function device, our heterostructure device not only exhibits bipolar resistive switching behavior with a switching ratio of up to 10 3 without any forming process but also shows a tunable photovoltage effect with an open-circuit voltage ( V oc ) of approximately 0.38 V. In addition, a high-resistance state and a low-resistance state of the device can be modulated by light illumination. This photo-modulation mechanism is revealed and shows that resistive switching can be attributed to migration of photogenerated carriers and charge trapping/detrapping caused by ferroelectric polarization reversal, which changes depletion layer characteristics at the BTO/NSTO interface. This work may help to provide an understanding of multifunctional characteristics of the BTO/NSTO heterostructure and will pave the way toward practical applications of this heterostructure in memory and optoelectronic devices.},

Time-resolved photoluminescence and impedance spectrum studies show similar results. The accelerated charge transfer and retarded recombination are due to defect passivation.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and theoretical calculation indicate that the reduced trap density is due to the chemical interaction between carbonyl group (from capsaicin) and Sn atom, and that between carbonyl group and Pb atom.},

However, the presence of charge recombination at the interface of the electron transport layer (ETL)/perovskite hinders the performance of perovskite solar cells, preventing them from reaching the Shockley–Queisser limit. Herein, the SnO 2 /TiO 2 nanoparticles (NPs) composite (S/T-NC) ETL is developed by adopting a simple method at low temperature and applied into planar PSCs. Our results show that the maximum power conversion efficiency of PSCs based on the S/T-NC ETL is 20.51\% with a V OC of 1.09 V, a J SC of 24.15 mA/cm 2 , and a fill factor of 77.84\%, much higher than that for both SnO 2 NPs based PSCs (18.19\%) and TiO 2 NPs based PSCs (17.81\%). Further analysis reveals that the mixing of TiO 2 and SnO 2 can improve film quality and reduce trap density, thus, suppressing charge recombination and improving stability. These findings prove that the use of SnO 2 /TiO 2 composite ETL is an effective way to further improve the performance for planar PSCs.},

  abstract     = {InP-based high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) are potential candidates for sub-millimeter wave and terahertz satellite communications due to their ultrahigh frequency performance. Therefore, the study of their irradiation reliability is extremely urgent. In this paper, a 2 MeV proton irradiation experiment has been carried out in InP-based HEMTs, and damage mechanisms have been systematically studied, including dc and rf characteristics. The experimental results show that InP-based HEMTs have wondrously excellent radiation tolerance. The degradation of electrical characteristics occurs only when the irradiation fluence is higher than 1 × 10 13 H + /cm 2 . The drain saturation current and the maximum transconductance have, respectively, decreased by 7.1\% and 5.4\% at a fluence of 1 × 10 14 H + /cm 2 . Different from the other III–V HEMTs, the irradiated InP-based HEMTs exhibited an abnormality in the “peak collapse” of transconductance. Rf characteristics&#39; parameters demonstrate slighter degradation compared to dc transconductance. Transmission line model (TLM) measurement and Schottky barrier calculation have shown that there is no noticeable degradation of an Ohmic contact and a Schottky contact; therefore, the main possible reason for device degradation comes from the interior of a semiconductor structure. Furthermore, device simulation indicates that defects introduced by irradiation on the upper and lower heterojunction interface of the channel and the interface of the gate recess should be responsible for degradation. Our experiments show that InP-based HEMTs have excellent radiation resistance, and they have good prospects for applications in radiation environments.},

Transition metal trichalcogenides (MX 3 type) are the emergent class of 2D materials, which gathered a lot of interest because of their quasi-one-dimensional anisotropic properties with the van der Waals force of attraction in between the layers. Herein, TiS 3 being a MX 3 -type of material is preferred as the battery type-supercapacitor electrode for energy storage applications with detailed theoretical predications and experimental validations. The highest capacitance attained for TiS 3 is found to be 235 F/g (105 C/g) at 5 mV/s with a battery type of charge storage mechanism. The asymmetric hybrid device is fabricated using Ti 3 C 2 T x MXene nanosheets as a negative electrode, and a brilliant 91\% of capacitance retention is accomplished with an extensive potential window of 1.5 V.

We find that MoSi 2 N 4 /GaN is a direct bandgap type-I VDWH, while MoSi 2 N 4 /ZnO is an indirect bandgap type-II VDWH. Intriguingly, by applying an electric field or mechanical strain along the out-of-plane direction, the band structures of MoSi 2 N 4 /GaN and MoSi 2 N 4 /ZnO can be substantially modified, exhibiting rich transitional behaviors, such as the type-I-to-type-II band alignment and the direct-to-indirect bandgap transitions.

The structure, consisting of PLZT stacked layers 30 and 90 nm thick, showed drastically improved performance in three main measures: low leakage current, high saturation polarization, and low saturation voltage. Secondary ion mass spectroscopy indicated that atomic interdiffusion between PLZT and IrO x in the top electrode (TE) was suppressed by the 30 nm thick PLZT, which plays the role of a diffusion barrier, producing a low leakage current and high saturation polarization. The higher oxygen atomic density of the PLZT near the TE interface lowers the oxygen vacancy, which should also suppress the leakage current and the P–V hysteresis shift (imprint). The large grain size and high crystalline quality of PLZT near the TE interface in the PLZT structure provide a high saturation polarization with low leakage current.},

The terahertz-induced ultrafast demagnetization, driven by spin-flip scattering mediated by the spin–orbit interaction, is measurable in the pristine amorphous sample and much reduced in the sample with the highest crystalline order. Surprisingly, the largest demagnetization is observed at intermediate annealing temperatures, where the enhancement in spin-flip probability is not associated with an increased charge scattering. We are able to correlate the demagnetization amplitude with the magnitude of the in-plane magnetic anisotropy, which we characterize independently, suggesting a magnetoresistance-like description of the phenomenon.},

It is found that field-free switching depends on the direction of the imposed pulse current. Only when the electric current is along the y (010)-direction but not along the x (100)-direction does field-free switching happen, which can be attributed to the tilted PMA induced symmetry breaking in the x–z plane. Furthermore, under the field-free condition, our FePt single layer system exhibits stable multi-state magnetic switching behavior and nonlinear synaptic characteristics. This work paves the way to realize field-free SOT switching in the L 1 0 -FePt single layer, which will have significant impact on spin memory devices and synaptic electronics.},

Recently, however, it turned out that the commonly used technique of the transverse magneto-optical Kerr effect (T-MOKE) in the extreme ultraviolet range may have issues with unwanted crosstalk between different elemental signals and energy-dependent non-linear response. This problem can be sizeable, which puts recent observations of ultrafast spin transfer from Fe to Ni sites in FeNi alloys into question. In this study, we investigate the Fe-to-Ni spin transfer in a crosstalk-free time-resolved x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) experiment with a reliable time reference. With XMCD near the absorption maxima, we find a very similar Fe and Ni dynamics as with T-MOKE from identical samples. Considering the potential non-linearities of the T-MOKE response, such a good agreement in our findings is remarkable. Our data provide the ongoing discussion about ultrafast spin-transfer mechanisms in FeNi systems with a broader experimental basis.},

  abstract     = {Magnetothermal applications of nanoparticles in biomedicine are currently limited by low thermal responses to oscillating magnetic fields on one side and by detrimental physiological effects of electromagnetic radiation on the other side. In this paper, using Zn–Mn ferrite nanoparticles, we demonstrate that an appropriate choice of size and chemical composition of magnetic nanoparticles results in the superquadratic (upto 5th power) dependence of the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) on a magnetic field (SAR proportional to H 5 ). This gives an opportunity to obtain SAR values above 10 W/g in an oscillating magnetic field, while maintaining the field-frequency product at a level close to the physiological Brezovich&#39;s limit ∼ 10 9 A/(m s).},

For short wavelengths needed in small-scale devices, the group velocity is directly proportional to the spin-wave exchange stiffness constant λ ex ⁠ . Using wave vector resolved Brillouin light scattering spectroscopy, we directly measure λ ex in Ga-substituted YIG thin films and show that it is about three times larger than for pure YIG. Consequently, the spin-wave group velocity overcomes the one in pure YIG for wavenumbers k &gt; 4 rad/ μ m, and the ratio between the velocities reaches a constant value of around 3.4 for all k &gt; 20 rad/ μ m. As revealed by vibrating-sample magnetometry and ferromagnetic resonance spectroscopy, Ga:YIG films with thicknesses down to 59 nm have a low Gilbert damping ( ⁠ α &lt; 10 − 3 ⁠ ), a decreased saturation magnetization μ 0 M S ≈ 20 mT, and a pronounced out-of-plane uniaxial anisotropy of about μ 0 H u 1 ≈ 95 mT, which leads to an out-of-plane easy axis.

Since the proposed scheme of gate dielectric and SFP effectively suppresses the gate leakage and alleviates the peak electric field (E-field) around gate region, the maximum breakdown voltage ( V BK ) was improved to 92 V, which is 54 V higher than that of the conventional device. The fabricated ultrathin AlGaN/GaN HEMT with 60-nm SFP-T-gate exhibited the peak f T of 177 GHz and peak f max of 393 GHz, yielding high figure-of-merits of f T · V BK = 16 THz V and f max ·V BK = 36 THz V. Moreover, load-pull measurements at 30 GHz reveal that these devices deliver output power density ( P out) of 4.6 W/mm at V ds = 20 V and high power-added efficiency up to 52.5\% at V ds = 10 V. Essentially, the experimental results indicate that the employment of SFP and in situ SiN gate dielectric is an attractive approach to balance the breakdown and speed for millimeter wave devices.},

Substrates were cut at various angles Δ b from the (001) plane ( Δ b = 0°) to the (010) plane ( Δ b = 90°) of bulk crystals grown by the edge-defined film-fed growth method. The growth rate increased with increasing absolute value of Δ b near the (001). However, from the (001) to the (010), as Δ b increased, the growth rate decreased sharply, and streaky grooves observed in the grown layer on the (001) substrate became triangular pits. The length of the pits decreased with increasing Δ b , and a pit-free homoepitaxial layer grew at Δ b ≈ 60°. The valley line of the pits was parallel to the [010] direction; therefore, the length of the pits decreased with increasing Δ b . In addition, transmission electron microscopy observations of the deepest part of a pit revealed that the pits originate from dislocations propagating in the substrate at an angle of 60° with respect to the (001) plane. Therefore, pits are not formed on the grown layer surface when the Δ b of the substrate is ∼60°, because its surface is substantially parallel to the dislocations. The homoepitaxial growth of a pit-free layer on the (011) substrate ( Δ b = 61.7°) was demonstrated, and void defects and dislocations in the substrate were confirmed by the etch-pit method to not be inherited by the homoepitaxial layer.},

Measurements of field and frequency dependencies of magnetic response due to spin transitions associated with nitrogen defects in 4H-SiC are shown as an example. THz-EPR-GSE dispenses with the need of a cavity, permits independently scanning field and frequency parameters, and does not require field or frequency modulation. We investigate spin transitions of hexagonal ( h ) and cubic ( k ) coordinated nitrogen including coupling with its nuclear spin (I = 1), and we propose a model approach for the magnetic susceptibility to account for the spin transitions. From the THz-EPR-GSE measurements, we can fully determine polarization properties of the spin transitions, and we can obtain the k coordinated nitrogen g and hyperfine splitting parameters using magnetic field and frequency dependent Lorentzian oscillator line shape functions. Magnetic-field line broadening presently obscures access to h parameters. We show that measurements of THz-EPR-GSE at positive and negative fields differ fundamentally and hence provide additional information. We propose frequency-scanning THz-EPR-GSE as a versatile method to study properties of spins in solid state materials.},

A combination of synchrotron-based scanning x-ray diffraction microscopy with an x-ray focus size of 50 nm and numerical finite element calculations on the elastic strain reveals a three-dimensional relaxation scenario, which becomes particularly complex next to NW nucleation points. Despite a lattice mismatch of 4.2\%, lattice compliance is preserved, since strain can effectively be released close to the seeding window. Areas in the NWs other than that appear fully relaxed. The resulting NW twist, i.e., lattice rotations around the growth axis, amounts to less than 0.1°.},

We find that room temperature magnetron sputtering deposition results in polycrystalline thin films with an intrinsic tensile strain and a ⟨110⟩ fiber axis preferentially oriented normal to the substrate. Moreover, we demonstrate that post-deposition vacuum annealing treatments produce a secondary anisotropic phase characterized by compressive strain that increases with the annealing temperature. Finally, we use the Z-scan optical technique to accurately measure the complex nonlinear susceptibility χ ( 3 ) and the intensity-dependent refractive index change Δ n for samples with different structural properties despite featuring similar ENZ wavelengths. Our intensity-dependent analysis demonstrates that an enhancement of the optical nonlinearity can be achieved by tuning the structure of ENZ nanolayers with values as large as χ R ( 3 ) = ( 5.2 ± 0.3 ) × 10 − 17 m 2 / V 2 ⁠ .

In this work, the work functions of LIG were controlled by adjusting the frequency or speed of the laser, and a series of LIG/GaO x Schottky photodetectors were formed. When the work function of the graphene increases, the Fermi energy is shifted below the crossing point of the Π and Π * bands, and then more electrons or holes can be activated to participate in the conduction process, resulting in low resistance. Meanwhile, a large built-in electric field can be formed when using a high work function LIG, which is more beneficial to separate photo-generated carriers. Enabled by the controllable LIG, LIG/GaO x Schottky photodetectors can be modulated to have high photoresponsivity or self-powered characteristics. Our work provides a high-performance photodetector with excellent mechanical flexibility and long-life stability, promising applications in the flexible optoelectronic fields.},

One major issue is the absence of an efficient model to characterize the spectral features of incoherent light scattering. Here, we put forward the incoherent light transmission matrix (TM) approach in thin scattering layers. The proposed model is a unique form of TM that characterizes the spectral transmission feature of a system with multiple spatial transmission modes. With this method, we recover hyperspectral information from a single-shot monochromatic light spot without any additional dispersion or imaging elements. The proposed TM method can also be extended to recover other information from the light field, such as the polarization information without the use of a traditional polarizer. Our method also outperforms traditional optimization algorithms in terms of time and memory cost. The results demonstrate the feasibility of our method for retrieving the abundant information from natural light scattering with the help of simple optical setups.},

State-of-the-art polishing enables the production of atomically flat surfaces of even advanced materials, such as diamond, SiC, and GaN, by exploiting the exceptional chemical characteristics of particle surfaces, fluid solutions, and pad surfaces. Although various effective chemical reactions are employed, chemical reactivities of organic polymer surfaces have not been thoroughly explored. We demonstrate a water-only and slurry-less polishing technique using an acrylic polymer plate. We investigated the possibility of glass processing with several polymer materials and found that normal acrylic polymers have remarkable properties for polishing. Glass and silicon surfaces with atomic-level flatness can be produced using only an acrylic polymer plate and water. We believe that the developed polishing methods will become popular in the future because they are simple and cost-effective processes.},

In particular, a magnetic cloak has gained special attention for high practicability when compared with its electromagnetic counterparts. In this work, we report a bi-physical metamaterial invisible coating technique that could effectively hide underwater objects from being detected via both magnetic fields and acoustic waves. An ultra-thin coat could work for objects having irregular shapes like squares, greatly broadening potential practical applications. The bilayer magnetic cloaking technique is fully exploited to cast a spatially dependent permeability profile, which could quasi-statically balance out the diamagnetic response of irregular-shaped metals based on field “scattering” cancellation. Integrated with this magnetic cloak, an ultrathin acoustic metasurface made of periodic microbubbles is developed to achieve broadband acoustic absorption for acoustic stealth. This integrated magnetic-acoustic bi-physical conformal coat may lead to important applications not only for military purposes but also for civilian apparatus in shielding the field and wave disturbances, for example, in medical scanning.},

Here, a flexible transparent artificial nociceptor device is demonstrated to simulate the biological nociceptor functions based on the indium tin oxide (ITO) memristor, which exhibits forming-free and reproducible threshold resistive switching behaviors. This structurally simple memristor can imitate the key features of biological nociceptor, including “threshold,” “relaxation,” and “no adaptation” behaviors and sensitization phenomena of hyperalgesia and allodynia upon external stimuli. Finally, an alarm system is built to demonstrate the simplicity and feasibility of this artificial nociceptor for future neuromorphic systems.

This behavior is known as a Poisson-like effect, and it was theoretically described in different acoustic structures. This effect is experimentally demonstrated for flexural waves excited in an aluminum perforated plate, and it is explained in terms of a physical mechanism different to that reported for acoustic waves interacting with thin hollow cylinders embedded in water. In addition, a collimator device based also in free holes is designed and validated with the purpose of providing the beam impinging the redirector device. The measurements indicate that the amount of redirected energy is strongly enhanced when a barrier of two-beam resonators is added at the rear side of the redirector.

However, the limited wave-absorbing band and low transparency of conventional electromagnetic protection materials are the impediment for extensive applications. Here, a transparent and electrically tunable wave-absorbing metamaterial for stealth technology and electromagnetic protection has been theoretically and experimentally realized. The trend of the absorption feature change in simulation is consistent with that of the experiment results. The main part of this material adopts a sandwich structure consisting of two layers of indium tin oxide (ITO) and one layer of glass in between. The upper ITO layer is periodically patterned and combined with varactor diodes, which function as a frequency-selective surface. The effective operating frequency range is in the S-band, which covers the common frequency band of WiFi and many other electronic devices. The wave absorbing performance of this material can be electronically tunable by changing the applied voltage. The main absorption peak can be up to 90\% with a tunable amplitude range of 30\% and a tunable frequency band range of 1 GHz, and the transmittance of the sample in the visible is 80.23\%. The metamaterial has high performance on electromagnetic shielding, whose effectiveness is larger than 30 dB in the range of 2.6–3.95 GHz. This transparent and tunable metamaterial has great potential for the applications in electromagnetic protection and stealth.},

By adjusting the Mg 2+ doping concentration of the P-GaN, it can achieve an open circuit voltage (V oc ) of 14.2 V and a short circuit current (I sc ) density of ∼25.5 A/m 2 . This I sc is about 50 times higher than the performance of the Cu/GaN Triboelectric Nanogenerator, and the power density increases by more than 120 times.

In order to assess the piezoelectric performance of these two types of polarized nanofibers, piezoelectric nanogenerators (PNGs) were fabricated. It was observed that the PNG based on negatively biased nanofibers exhibited mechanosensitivity 11 times higher than the PNG based on positively biased nanofibers. As a result, excellent bio-sensing capabilities of negatively poled nylon-11 nanofibers enable tracking of physiological events such as arterial pulse, carotid pulse, and various facial movements for a next generation health care system.},

Diamond is a promising candidate for spintronics and quantum systems, where nano-structuring of diamond surfaces on nanometer length scales is required. Here, direct-write modification of a diamond surface at sub-50 nm resolution is demonstrated. This is achieved with an atomic force microscope tip used as a spatially localized field emission source or so-called field-emission scanning probe lithography on a sample in ambient conditions, which are rendered conductive only through the surface conductivity of hydrogen-terminated diamond. Mask-less direct structuring of the diamond surface is observed, creating features of depth in the range of 4–8 nm and linewidths of 70–150 nm, as well as the desorption of hydrogen from the surface achieving minimum linewidths of 40 nm. Both the linewidth and depth of etching appear to depend on the energy of emitted electrons and the resulting electron exposure dose. These findings demonstrate the possibility of controllably nano-structuring diamond surfaces with features over micrometer length scales and with sub-50 nm resolution, while held under ambient conditions.},

Black phosphorus quantum dots (BPQDs) have the advantages of tunable bandgap size, high absorption coefficient, and high electron mobility. Therefore, we introduced black phosphorus quantum dots (BPQDs) in aqueous SnO 2 colloidal solution by laser liquid-phase ablation to improve the carrier extraction rate and reduce the trap density. By characterizing the prepared complete devices, we found that the device efficiency reached 15.83\% after the introduction of BPQDs, which is 12\% higher compared to 14.06\% for the blank sample.

  abstract     = {WTe 2 , a type-II Weyl semimetal, has recently attracted much attention due to its unique band structure leading to extremely large magnetoresistance and exceedingly high mobility. In this report, we discuss the signature of Lifshitz transition in WTe 2.08 nanosheets through electrical transport measurements. We observed a resistivity anomaly (at T = T*) in the resistivity ( ρ xx ) vs temperature (T) curve, which shows significant thickness dependence. The Hall resistance evolves from non-linear to linear with a decrease in thickness. Combining both zero-field resistivity and Hall measurements, we provide evidence substantiating the resistivity anomaly as a direct manifestation of Lifshitz transition.},

  abstract     = {Strain engineering, aiming to tune physical properties of semiconductors, provides a promising paradigm for modern micro/nanoelectronics. Two-dimensional materials (2DMs) are the ideal candidates for the next generation of strain engineered devices because of their intrinsic exceptional mechanical flexibility and strength. However, conventional strain modulation methods in 2DMs cannot satisfy the demand of future device applications, because strained structures by these methods lack consistency, reproducibility, and design flexibility. Here, based on the photoresist degeneration induced by electron irradiation, we present a non-contact approach to accurately and directly write the strains with designed patterns from the nanometer to micrometer scale in 2DMs. Profit from controllable manipulation of the electron beam, the developed strategy offers a capability for constructing tensile, compress, or complex strains in MoSe 2 monolayers; hence, unique electronic structures for unique physical properties can be designed. Aside from 2DMs, this approach is also appropriate for other types of materials such as Au, α-Si, and Al 2 O 3 . Its flexibility and IC-compatibility allow our strain lithography methodology promising in accelerating the potential applications of 2DMs in extensive fields ranging from nanoelectromechanical systems, high-performance sensing, and nontraditional photovoltaics to quantum information science.},

To date, α-Bi 4 Br 4 nanowires can be obtained by using the exfoliation method from the bulk. However, it is still a great challenge to efficiently prepare α-Bi 4 Br 4 nanowires suitable for potential applications, e.g., saturable absorber in ultrafast pulsed fiber lasers. Here, we report the controllable growth of α-Bi 4 Br 4 thin films consisting of nanowires via molecular beam epitaxy technique. We show that the morphology of the α-Bi 4 Br 4 nanowires depends on the growth temperature and BiBr 3 flux. In addition, we also achieve α-Bi 4 Br 4 nanowires on NbSe 2 and gold substrates. Furthermore, we performed the saturable absorption property of α-Bi 4 Br 4 thin films with a modulation depth of 21.58\% and mode-locking at 1556.4 nm with a pulse width of 375 fs in the pulsed fiber lasers. Those results demonstrate the synthesis of quasi-1D topological material α-Bi 4 Br 4 , which is expected to be used for the fundamental research of topological physics and potential applications in optical devices.},

Therefore, for optimum device performance, precise knowledge of the WF is prerequisite while employing any new material in electronic devices. In this work, using metal oxide semiconductor capacitors, we experimentally determine the WF of layered van der Waals topological semimetals (TSMs) 1T′-MoTe 2 , 1T-PtSe 2 , and T d -WTe 2 as 4.87, 5.05, and 4.82 eV, respectively. The experimentally obtained results are corroborated with density functional theory calculations. Furthermore, by analyzing the vertical current transport across the metal oxide semiconductor stack using Fowler–Nordheim tunneling formalism, the barrier height between the TSMs and the gate insulator (SiO 2 ) is experimentally calculated. The obtained barrier heights are also following the same trend as that of WF for three TSMs. These TSMs host unique topological nontrivial phases potentially useful for the development of emerging quantum technologies, and therefore, the findings of this study are significant for designing the future quantum devices.},

A conceptually different approach has recently exploited the strain sensitivity of heavy-fermion superconductors, selectively transforming regions of the crystal into the metallic state by strain gradients. The strain is generated by differential thermal contraction between the sample and the substrate. Here, we present an improved finite-element model that reliably predicts the superconducting transition temperature in CeIrIn 5 even in complex structures. Different substrates are employed to tailor the strain field into the desired shapes. Using this approach, both highly complex and strained as well as strain-free microstructures are fabricated to validate the model. This enables a high degree of control over the microscopic strain fields and forms the basis for more advanced structuring of superconductors as in Josephson junctions yet also finds natural use cases in any material class in which a modulation of the physical properties on a chip is desirable.},

Being inspired by the recent synthesis of the 2D MA 2 X 4 family with various electronic properties, including nontrivial topological properties, 2D ferromagnetism, Ising superconductivity, and robust valley polarization, we systematically studied the electron structure, magnetism, and spin transport properties for VSi 2 X 4 (X = N, P, As) monolayers by the density functional theory combined with the nonequilibrium Green&#39;s function method. The results show that VSi 2 X 4 monolayers are ferromagnetic type-II SGS and BMS with high Curie temperatures 230–250 K. The interesting electronic phase transitions of type-II-SGS-to-metal-to-type-I-SGS for VSi 2 P 4 and BMS-to-type-I-SGS-to-type-II-SGS for VSi 2 As 4 can be achieved by applying the biaxial strain. Furthermore, the VSi 2 P 4 monolayer exhibits the bias-dependent spin filtering effect and the temperature-driven spin Seebeck effect. The high Curie temperature, the versatile strain-tuned electronic phase transitions, and the excellent spin transport characteristics make 2D VSi 2 X 4 the promising candidate for spintronic applications and will stimulate intensive studies on this class of high-spin-polarized 2D systems.},

The domain switching process is governed by domain wall propagation rather than the nucleation of reversed domains, similar to a pure ferromagnet. The domain wall velocity v increases exponentially with the ME pressure, that is, the simultaneous application of magnetic H and electric E fields. The v – E curve under a constant H can be scaled by the ME pressure with the assistance of the exchange bias. We determined the depinning threshold, pinning energy scale, and depinning velocity based on the model for the magnetic domain wall creep. Compared with the depinning velocity in various other systems, it was suggested that the ME-driven mechanism could yield a fast domain wall velocity utilizing the low pressure.},

  abstract     = {Semi-hydrogenated graphene (SHG) is a ferromagnetic semiconductor with a large Curie temperature. Using this simple structure as a platform, we investigate how the coupling between magnetic order and lattice vibration affects the thermal transport by using first-principles calculations and the phonon Boltzmann transport equation. The results show that both paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases are stable in SHG. The frequency features of the Raman-active phonon modes of the two phases clearly differ, which could serve as a fingerprint by which to identify the different magnetic orders. In addition, the coupling effect plays a critical role in the lattice thermal conductivity. At room temperature, SHG in its paramagnetic phase has a lattice thermal conductivity of about 24.5 W/mK, whereas, in its ferromagnetic phase, it is about 55.7 W/mK, almost twice as large as the paramagnetic case. An analysis of the phonon modes reveals that the enhanced thermal conductivity of ferromagnetic SHG is mainly due to the greater group velocity of the flexural acoustic mode and the attenuation of the anharmonicity of the transverse and longitudinal acoustic modes. These results reveal how magnetic order affects phonon transport in SHG and open the way for potential applications of magnetic monolayer materials as thermal switching devices.},

The critical behavior of high temperature ferromagnetic transition at 331 K was analyzed, and the critical exponents β = 0.335, γ = 0.878, and δ = 3.617 are extracted by the modified Arrott plot method, which lie between the values of long-range mean-field and short-range three-dimensional theories, demonstrating that PrMn 2 Ge 2 possesses multiple magnetic interactions. This is also confirmed by the moderated interaction function, which is decay as J ( r ) ∼ r − 4.69 ⁠ .

  abstract     = {We present electronic band structure properties of strained In x Ga (1− x ) As/InP heterostructure near surface quantum wells oriented in the (100) crystallographic direction using eight-band k · p theory, which are further parameterized by an energy level, effective mass, and nonparabolicity factor. The electronic band structure parameters are studied for the well composition of 0.2 ≤ x ≤ 1 and thickness from 5 to 13 nm. The bandgap and effective mass of the strained wells are increased for x &gt;0.53 due to compression strain and decreased for x &lt; 0.53 due to tensile strain as compared to that of unstrained wells. The calculated band structure parameters are utilized in modeling long channel In 0.71 Ga 0.29 As/InP quantum well MOSFETs, and the model is validated against measured I–V and low frequency C–V characteristics at room temperature and cryogenic temperature. Exponential band tails and first- and second-order variation of the charge centroid capacitance and interface trap density are included in the electrostatic model. The Urbach parameter obtained in the model is E 0 = 9 meV, which gives subthreshold swing (SS) of 18 mV/dec at T = 13 K and agrees with the measured SS of 19 mV/dec. Interface trap density is approximately three orders higher at T = 300 K compared to T = 13 K due to multi-phonon activated traps. This model emphasizes the importance of considering disorders in the system in developing device simulators for cryogenic applications.},

  abstract     = {A promising route for the development of opto-electronic technology is to use terahertz radiation to modulate the optical properties of semiconductors. Here, we demonstrate the dynamical control of photoluminescence (PL) emission in few-layer InSe using picosecond terahertz pulses. We observe a strong PL quenching (up to 50\%) after the arrival of the terahertz pulse followed by a reversible recovery of the emission on the timescale of 50 ps at T = 10 K. Microscopic calculations reveal that the origin of the photoluminescence quenching is the terahertz absorption by photo-excited carriers: this leads to a heating of the carriers and a broadening of their distribution, which reduces the probability of bimolecular electron-hole recombination and, therefore, the luminescence. By numerically evaluating the Boltzmann equation, we are able to clarify the individual roles of optical and acoustic phonons in the subsequent cooling process. The same PL quenching mechanism is expected in other van der Waals semiconductors, and the effect will be particularly strong for materials with low carrier masses and long carrier relaxation time, which is the case for InSe. This work gives a solid background for the development of opto-electronic applications based on InSe, such as THz detectors and optical modulators.},

  abstract     = {Although the hydrogen induced electronic transition within the perovskite family of rare-earth nickelate ( Re NiO 3 ) beyond conventional semiconductors was recently discovered, the existing research stays at Re NiO 3 with light rare-earth compositions. To further extend the cognition toward heavier rare-earth, herein we demonstrate hydrogen induced electronic transitions for quasi-single crystalline Re NiO 3 /LaAlO 3 (001) heterostructures, covering a large variety of the rare-earth composition from Nd to Er. The hydrogen induced elevations in the resistivity of Re NiO 3 ( R H / R 0 ) show an unexpected non-monotonic tendency with the atomic number of the rare-earth composition, e.g., first increases from Nd to Dy and afterwards decreases from Dy to Er. Although Re NiO 3 with heavy rare-earth composition (e.g., DyNiO 3 ) exhibits large R H / R 0 up to 10 7 , their hydrogen induced electronic transition is not reversible. Further probing the electronic structures via near edge x-ray absorption fine structure analysis clearly demonstrates the respective transition in electronic structures of Re NiO 3 from Ni 3+ based electron itinerant orbital configurations toward the Ni 2+ based electron localized state. Balancing the hydrogen induced transition reversibility with abruption in the variations of material resistivity, we emphasize that Re NiO 3 with middle rare-earth compositions (e.g., Sm) are most suitable in catering to the potential applications in correlated electronic devices.},

The fabricated AlGaN-channel SBD with an anode–cathode distance (L AC ) of 30 μ m achieves a high blocking voltage of 2.55 kV and a power figure-of-merit of 363 MW/cm 2 . Meanwhile, the current transport mechanism of AlGaN-channel SBDs goes through thermionic emission, thermionic field emission, and trap-assisted tunneling as the reverse bias is gradually increased. The thermal activation energy (E A ) is calculated to be 141.3 meV at high reverse bias. I R at 475 K is only 3 μ A/mm, which shows an adequate barrier height for rectifying at high temperature even with low V ON . The AlGaN-channel SBDs show great promise for next-generation power electronics with balanced forward and reverse characteristics.},

Whereas a water drop is frozen into a peach-like crystal due to the volume expansion upon freezing, the shape of a frozen complex fluid drop is still mysterious. In this work, we investigate the freezing dynamics of a nanosuspension drop in two different schemes, i.e., sessile and deposited. We find that the top of a frozen nanosuspension drop can either be a singular tip or flat plateau depending on the thermal condition onset of icing nucleation. Illustrated using a Hele–Shaw cell experiment, we attribute such intriguing freezing behaviors to the interplay between nanoparticles and two types of ice, i.e., dendritic ice formed in the recalescence stage and planar ice formed in the isothermal stage. Specifically, microcells constructed by dendritic ice lead to the failure of global freezing segregation, which yields the formation of the flat plateau. The fundamental understanding and the ability to control the shape of a frozen complex fluid drop have numerous promising applications in additive manufacturing, microelectronic systems, and others.},

When a positive gate voltage ( V GS ) is applied and protons are injected toward the film channel layer, the SFO films are electrochemically reduced, leading to increases in the channel resistance. On the other hand, when a negative V GS is applied and protons are removed, the SFO films are oxidized, and as a result, the channel resistances decrease. In addition, we found that the electrochemically reduced SFO films accommodate protons, forming the proton-containing oxide H x SrFeO 2.5 whose proton concentration is determined by elastic recoil detection analysis to be x ∼ 0.11.

Herein, we report the dramatic enhancement of photoresponse in the DUV region of a h -BN device coupled with plasmonic nanostructures of either h -BN nanosheets (BNNSs) or Au nanoparticles (NPs). Large-area h -BN thin films that have been directly grown on quartz substrates using the ion beam assistant deposition method exhibit a uniform thickness of ∼200 nm, an ultrawide bandgap (∼ 6 eV), and an excellent light transparency in the visible region. Based on the vertical charge transfer integrated with plasmonic nanoarrays, the photocurrent of the h -BN device can be greatly enhanced by up to about 7–9 times under the illumination of 205 nm by showing a cutoff wavelength at ∼220 nm. Owing to the retained low dark current and large photo-gain induced by localized plasmonic resonances, this hybrid photodetector exhibits 32- and 57-fold improvement in responsivity at a 205 nm wavelength by BNNSs and Au NPs, respectively. This work demonstrates plasmonic enhancement on optoelectronic properties of h -BN based on not only metallic but also semiconducting nanostructures and provides alternative pathways for the development of low-cost, large-area, high-performance, DUV photodetectors for various optoelectronic devices and security applications.},

  abstract     = {InAs-based interband cascade lasers (ICLs) can be more easily adapted toward long wavelength operation than their GaSb counterparts. Devices made from two recent ICL wafers with an advanced waveguide structure are reported, which demonstrate improved device performance in terms of reduced threshold current densities for ICLs near 11 μ m or extended operating wavelength beyond 13 μ m. The ICLs near 11 μ m yielded a significantly reduced continuous wave (cw) lasing threshold of 23 A/cm 2 at 80 K with substantially increased cw output power, compared with previously reported ICLs at similar wavelengths. ICLs made from the second wafer incorporated an innovative quantum well active region, comprised of InAsP layers, and lased in the pulsed-mode up to 120 K at 13.2 μ m, which is the longest wavelength achieved for III–V interband lasers.},

A compositionally graded and unintentionally doped InGaAlAs layer with a delta-doped nano-layer behaves as the barrier for majority carrier flow. The pixels fabricated with a 20 μ m pitch mesa process yielded peak quantum efficiencies of 67\% and 53\% without anti-reflective coating for the e-SWIR and SWIR sides, respectively. Dark current measurements on a large area pixel yield 3.40 mA / cm 2 at 300 K and 0.61 μ A / cm 2 at 200 K for the e-SWIR side, while 8.05 μ A / cm 2 at 300 K and 1.09 nA / cm 2 at 200 K are obtained for the SWIR side. I–V characteristics analysis performed with pixels having different areas shows that the designed nBn structure has no surface leakage current presenting a potential benefit for dual-band applications requiring mesa structures that usually suffer from surface states for the InGaAs material system.

  abstract     = {In this work, we investigated the temperature-dependent photodetection behavior of a high-performance AlGaN/GaN-based ultraviolet phototransistor (UVPT) operating under 265 nm illumination. As the temperature continuously rises from room temperature to 250 °C, the photocurrent of a device increases in the beginning but suffers from degradation afterwards. This can be explained by the competing process between the generation and recombination rate of photo-induced carriers in the UVPT at room and high temperatures. Intriguingly, we found that the optimal operating temperature for our UVPT is around 50 °C, featuring a high peak responsivity of 1.52 × 10 5 A/W under a light intensity of 45 μ W/cm 2 . Furthermore, the photoresponse time of our UVPT is also highly temperature-dependent, exhibiting the shortest rise time of 50 ms at 100 °C while the decay time is monotonically reduced as the temperature rises to 250 °C. Notably, our AlGaN/GaN-based UVPTs exhibit ultra-high responsivity at high temperatures, which have outperformed those earlier reported UV photodetectors in the form of different device architectures, highlighting the great potential of such device configurations for harsh environment applications.},

To achieve efficient blue InP QLEDs through light extraction, the internal grating structure is a feasible way to extract waveguide modes, but it may bring complicated fabrication process and deteriorated electrical performance. In this work, we proposed an effective strategy to extract light from waveguide modes to air modes by using a thin hole transport layer (HTL), a high-index substrate, and substrate surface-roughening. Through optical tunneling, the thin HTL and the high-index substrate facilitate light transmission from waveguide modes to substrate modes. Thus, substrate surface-roughening can be applied to further extract light from enhanced substrate modes to air modes. As a result, light extraction efficiency has been significantly improved, leading to an external quantum efficiency enhancement from 2.1\% to 2.8\%, which is a record value among counterparts to date. This light extraction strategy is simple but effective to exploit the potential of high-efficiency (blue InP) QLEDs.},

A unique characteristic of antiferromagnetic magnons is the coexistence of opposite spin polarization, which mimics the electron spin in a variety of transport phenomena. Among them, the most prominent spin-contrasting phenomenon is the magnon spin Nernst effect (SNE), which refers to the generation of a transverse pure magnon spin current through a longitudinal temperature gradient. We introduce selected recent progress in the study of magnon SNE in collinear antiferromagnets with focus on its underlying physical mechanism entailing profound topological features of magnon band structures. By reviewing how the magnon SNE has inspired and enriched the exploration of topological magnons, we offer our perspective on this emerging frontier that holds potential in future spintronic nano-technology.},

By means of molecular dynamics simulations, we investigated the friction coefficient of water on both sides of graphene/h-BN heterostructures under various rotation angle, which shows a non-monotonic but symmetrical variation with relative interlayer angle. Despite that friction coefficient of h-BN surface is larger than that of graphene, as the rotation angle increases, the friction coefficient of water on both sides of the graphene/h-BN heterostructure exhibits the same “M”-shaped curve. The center of symmetry of the curve is at the rotation angle of 30°; the friction coefficient is the largest when the rotation angle is 10° and 50°. It was found that graphene/h-BN heterostructure is a device whose friction coefficient is different on both sides and can be adjusted by twisting the relative interlayer angle. These results could be demonstrated by the van der Waals interaction and different pattern of free energy landscape.

  abstract     = {We demonstrate the bandwidth enhancement of an all-optical spin-exchange relaxation-free (SERF) magnetometer based on amplitude-modulated (AM) light. Alkali metal atoms are modulated directly by the pump beam instead of the modulation field or radio frequency field. The first harmonic demodulation of an AM SERF magnetometer with a modulation intensity of 15 kHz results in a high bandwidth of over 11 kHz with a sensitivity of 20 fT / Hz 1 / 2 at 30 Hz and 60 fT / Hz 1 / 2 at 10 kHz. Meanwhile, the AM SERF magnetometer with DC demodulation presents the same sensitivity as a traditional DC SERF magnetometer ( ⁠ 6 fT / Hz 1 / 2 at 30 Hz). The presented technique for modulating the amplitude of the pump beam allows AM SERF magnetometers to enter the domain of high-bandwidth magnetometers and opens the door to many areas that are inaccessible to conventional magnetometers.},

  abstract     = {Hydroelectricity is an emerging novel electricity generation phenomenon that can generate electric power simply when nanostructured materials are in direct contact with omnipresent liquid water or moisture. In this work, after alkali treatment, a molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ) sponge can produce a high-output voltage of about 430 mV and a remarkable output current of 62 μ A under a relative humidity of 80\%, which is over three times and 20 times as compared with that of pure MoS 2 coating sponges, respectively, and it also achieves a continuous electric output over 1 h with good stability. The increasing number of movable cations after alkali treatment probably results in the improvement of power generation performance. Demonstrating the ability of the MoS 2 coating sponges to function as a practical power source, the output voltage of the devices is further scaled up to 10 V by simple series connections, and capacitors charged to 5 V are able to power an electronic screen with single-chip computers.},

  abstract     = {Highly efficient absorption of broadband low-frequency sound with a slim subwavelength meta-structure promises extensive applications in acoustic engineering, which remains a major challenge due to the weak coupling of strong scattering resonant modes. Here, we formulate the interaction of resonant modes in different damping states on the basis of a coupled-mode theory and draw the conclusion that couplings between over-damped modes demonstrate superiority to under-damped or critically coupled states in sound absorption. Furthermore, we theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate an ultra-broadband sound absorber by hybridizing multi-order Helmholtz resonators, which support a series of over-damped modes in a single element with flexible key acoustic parameters, including operating frequencies and loss and leakage factors decorated at will. Due to the intense coupling between these elaborated over-damped modes, the designed absorber demonstrates 81\% average absorptance for airborne sound ranging from 100 to 1000 Hz (exceeding three octaves) with a thickness down to 1/18.8 of wavelength at the lower-limit frequency. We envision the design methodology to push forward more versatile functional devices.},

However, the physical mechanism behind the electrically induced phase transition is still not clear due to the lack of direct temperature measurements during the transition. To shed light on this problem, in this Letter, we directly image the spatially resolved temperature of a 1T-TaS 2 device by IR thermal microscopy. Combining this method with pulsed electrical transport measurements, Raman spectroscopy, and a simple resistor network model, we show that the transition is a result of Joule-heating. More broadly, we show that thermal imaging is important to determine the power dissipation in electronic devices due to the inhomogeneous nature of the temperature distribution.},

Due to the transient and dark nature of high-lying triplet states (T n , n ≥ 2), the normative methods to characterize the hot exciton mechanism have not been thoroughly developed. Here, a normal technique combining transient photoluminescence and magneto-electroluminescence (MEL) measurements has been proven to visualize the reverse intersystem crossing process from T 2 to S 1 states in 5,6,11,12-tetraphenylnaphthacene (rubrene) molecules. Rubrene is chosen as a model system since its T 1 is far below S 1 and T 2 is resonant with S 1 . This hot exciton process opens an additional route, marked as Dexter energy transfer channel ( ⁠ CT 3 → T 2 → S 1 ⁠ , DET channel), together with the well-known Förster resonance energy transfer channel ( ⁠ CT 1 → S 1 ⁠ ) to transfer the host energy to the guest. With proper approximates, the DET channel assisted by the hot excitons process can contribute about 46.6\% excitons to rubrene S 1 and 83.4\% rubrene emission in rubrene-doped devices. These studies set an in situ normative characterizing frame to visualize the hot excitons process in OLEDs.},

We use field-effect transistor configuration with four probe contacts (two tunnel and two ohmic) and bottom gates.

Different from a normal Raman spectrum of BLG, a unique Raman band G r + is observed in its tip enhanced Raman spectrum and assigned as a split of the G band. We attribute this split to the nonuniformity distribution of the charge on carbon atoms. Compared with BLG, the G r + band intensity of TwBLG is dramatically enhanced at a small twist angle and decreases with the angle increasing. Interlayer Coulomb interaction represented in the G r + mode of TwBLG matches well with the atom vibration strength distribution of the G r + band at different twist angles, and thereby the properties of the G r + band can be tuned by the twisted angle. The results may help to further understand the Raman spectra of TwBLG and provide deep insights for exploring vibrational modes of two-dimensional nanomaterials.},

Optoelectronic plasticity is a prerequisite to achieve these functions. In this study, we demonstrate a nonvolatile reconfigurable broadband photodetector based on a ferroelectric heterostructure composed of BP (black phosphorus)/α-In 2 Se 3 . The plasticity of the device comes from the ferroelectric polarization of α-In 2 Se 3 that can tune the built-in potential of the p–n junction. As a result, the rectification ratio and responsivity increase almost one order when changing the gate voltage pulse from +16 V to −16 V. Due to the introduction of BP, the device has a wide spectral response covering 473–1550 nm. In addition, our devices show excellent performance in terms of a high responsivity of up to 4.73 × 10 4 A/W, a large specific detectivity of ∼2.09 × 10 12 Jones, a high external quantum efficiency of 9.21 × 10 6\%, and a notable photo-on-off ratio of 4.82 × 10 3 .

However, little is known about how large the maximum dielectric change Δ ε ′/ ε ′ can achieve and why the Δ ε ′/ ε ′ variations obey the dependence of square of normalized magnetization ( m 2 ), which are critically important for searching and designing materials with higher Δ ε ′/ ε ′. Here, we perform approximate theoretical derivation and reveal that the maximum Δ ε ′/ ε ′ can be estimated using intrinsic tunneling spin polarization ( P T ) and extrinsic normalized magnetization ( m ), that is, Δ ε ′/ ε′ = 2 P T 2 m 2 . This formulation allows predicting over 200\% of theoretical limit for m = 1 and accounts for the observed m 2 dependence of Δ ε ′/ ε ′ for a given P T . We experimentally demonstrate that x -dependence of Δ ε ′/ ε′ in (Co x Fe 100−x )–MgF 2 films is phenomenologically consistent with this formulation. This work is pivotal to the design of ultra-highly tunable magnetoelectric applications of the TMD effect at room temperature.},

Using this easily prepared architecture, we design and fabricate a broadband Josephson parametric amplifier, which has gain in an excess of 20 dB with a bandwidth of hundreds of MHz. Furthermore, by varying the working point of the device, the operating frequency of amplification can be tuned in a wide frequency range of 1 GHz while the amplifier operates in the mode of either three-wave mixing or four-wave mixing. Such a parametric amplifier is suitable for engineering applications of superconducting circuit quantum electrodynamics.},

Using operando magnetometry, we performed a reversible toggling of lithium ion induced magnetic phase transition between nano-Co (superparamagnetism) and CoO (antiferromagnetism), which enables an ON–OFF magnetism switching. On this basis, a robust modulation of exchange bias by electric field at low temperature is achieved. In addition, reversible tuning of coercivity and magnetization up to 71\% and 118\%, respectively, in a Co/CoO bilayer at room temperature are performed. This work provides a more efficient means to modulate antiferromagnetism and exchange bias, facilitating the development of antiferromagnetic spintronics.},

The magnetic measurements indicate that a spin-glass phase occurs at low temperatures in the high-entropy compounds, which is induced by the strong compositional disorder of rare-earth sublattice. The glassy state can lead to a sluggish magnetic transition and consequently a potential improvement in the magnetocaloric performance. Due to the increase in configurational entropy, large refrigerant capacity of 247 and 203 J/kg for a magnetic field change of 70 kOe is obtained in the (Gd 1/5 Dy 1/5 Ho 1/5 Er 1/5 Tb 1/5 )FeO 3 and (Dy 1/4 Ho 1/4 Er 1/4 Tb 1/4 )FeO 3 compounds, respectively.

Exploring magnons is advantageous as they can travel far and fast due to their low dissipation and high group velocity, transferring spin without charge transport, thus reducing the Joule heating. Moreover, magnon currents can switch a film&#39;s magnetization via a magnon torque facilitated by a perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA). We demonstrate the proof of principle for three states&#39; memories via transport studies of thermally excited magnon currents at room temperature in ferrimagnetic insulating magnon valves TmIG/Au/TmIG with PMA. While varying the relative TmIG magnetizations orientation, magnon currents excited in TmIG films are detected as a voltage in a top platinum electrode film due to the inverse spin Hall effect. The magnon transmission is maximum in the parallel state where the two signals sum up. Possibilities are seen for wave-based nonvolatile magneto-resistive random-access memory, sensing, and logic devices.},

We find that (i) Co 2 MnGa and Co 2 MnAl are efficient terahertz spin-current generators reaching efficiencies of typical 3d-transition-metal ferromagnets such as Fe. (ii) The relaxation of the spin current provides an estimate of the electron-spin relaxation time of Co 2 MnGa (170 fs) and Co 2 MnAl (100 fs), which is comparable to Fe (90 fs). Both observations are consistent with a simple analytical model and highlight the large potential of magnetic Weyl semimetals as spin-current sources in terahertz spintronic devices.

In particular, we analyze devices with changing gate-metal/p-GaN junction area and p-GaN/AlGaN/GaN heterostructure area in the linear regime. These devices exhibit unique threshold voltage and subthreshold swing scaling dependence with gate geometry that is in contrast with classic field-effect transistors. On the other hand, peak transconductance and ON resistance are found to scale classically. We find that these results arise from the fact that with a Schottky contact to the p-GaN layer, under steady-state conditions, the p-GaN layer voltage is set by current continuity across the gate stack. Furthermore, a detailed scaling study of the gate current reveals that current flow across the p-GaN/AlGaN/GaN heterostructure is not uniform—instead, it preferentially flows through the ungated portion of the p-GaN layer. Our study concludes that in Schottky-type p-GaN gate HEMTs, the respective areas of two junctions constitute an additional design degree of freedom to fine-tune device performance.},

Efficient activation of the implanted Mg dopants and reasonable hole accumulation at the SiO 2 /GaN interfaces were also achieved for p-type capacitors by UHPA, but the fabricated inversion- and accumulation-type p-channel GaN MOSFETs were hardly turned on.

Using the state-of-the-art ab initio methods, we examine the main scattering channels, which contribute to the total electron–phonon scattering rate and the energy loss rate of photoexcited electrons in silicon as well as their temperature dependence. Both temperature dependence and the main scattering channels are shown to strongly differ for the total electron–phonon scattering rate and the energy loss rate of photoexcited electrons. While the total electron–phonon scattering rate increases strongly with temperature, the temperature dependence of the energy loss rate is negligible. Also, while acoustic phonons dominate the total electron–phonon scattering rate at 300 K, the main contribution to the energy loss rate comes from optical modes. In this respect, DFT-based results are found to disagree with conclusions of Fischetti et al. [Appl. Phys. Lett. 114 , 222104 (2019)]. We explain the origin of this discrepancy, which is mainly due to differences in the description of the electron–phonon scattering channels associated with transverse phonons.},

These waves may possess spin-like degrees of freedom associated with a gapped band structure reminiscent of the spin Hall effect. In semi-infinite plates or strips with zero displacement edges, the Dirac-factored elastic wave equation shows the possibility of edge modes moving in opposite directions. The finite size of strips leads to overlap between edge modes consequently opening a gap in their spectrum eliminating the spin Hall-like effects. This Dirac factorization tells us what solutions of the elastic wave equation would be if we could break some symmetry. Dirac factorization does not break symmetry but simply exposes what topological properties of elastic waves may result from symmetry breaking structural or external perturbations.},

For applied field spinning close to the magic angle, ϑ m = 54.7 ° ⁠ , dipolar interactions vanish and the dynamic assembly of the pair is driven only by HIs. Further, we provide a theoretical description based on the balance between dipolar forces and HIs that allow understanding the role of anisotropy on the collective dynamics.

  abstract     = {Gaseous ammonia has previously been demonstrated as a compelling gain medium for a quantum cascade laser pumped molecular laser (QPML) exhibiting good power efficiency. Here, we explore the potential of the ammonia QPML to produce powerful, broadly tunable terahertz frequency lasing on rotational and pure inversion transitions. After theoretically predicting possible laser frequencies, pump thresholds, and efficiencies, we experimentally demonstrate unprecedented tunability—from 0.763 to 4.459 THz—by pumping Q- and R-branch infrared transitions with widely tunable quantum cascade lasers. We additionally demonstrate two types of multi-line lasing: simultaneous pure inversion and rotation–inversion transitions from the same pumped rotational state and cascaded lasing involving transitions below the pumped rotational state. We report single frequency power levels as great as 0.45 mW from a low volume laser cavity.},

Compared to the traditional RDP film preparation methods reported in the previous literature, thermal evaporation is an appealing option for RDP film fabrication with uniform crystallization, high repeatability, and precise control. Here, based on the vacuum deposition method, we adopted a combined strategy, including annealing treatment and device structure optimization. Meanwhile, we investigated the effects of post-annealing on charge carrier recombination kinetics, exciton energy transfer, and phase distribution of vacuum-deposited RDP films. As a result, we achieved an external quantum efficiency of 6.5\% for the device, which is one of the best performances among prevailing research on vacuum-processed RDP-based LEDs.},

The performance of the sensor is systematically evaluated by placing subwavelength dielectric analytes (with different sizes and relative permittivities) within the ENZ waveguide and moving them along the propagation and transversal axes. It is experimentally demonstrated how this ENZ sensor is able to detect deeply subwavelength dielectric bodies of sizes up to 0.04λ and height 5 × 10 −3 λ with high sensitivities (and the figure of merit) up to 0.05 1/RIU (∼0.6 GHz −1 ) and 0.6 1/RIU when considering the sensor working as a frequency- or amplitude-shift-based device, respectively.},

For such technology to be competitive, it should outperform the traditional technology for LEDs grown on GaN substrates and offer improved output characteristics. InGaN based LEDs on In y Ga 1−y N templates with varying In-content of 8\% ≤ y ≤ 12\% are studied for the same emission wavelength. The electroluminescence, optical output power, and external quantum efficiency of the LEDs are investigated as a function of the In-content in the templates. LEDs on InGaN templates with In-content of 8–10\% show better performance than LEDs grown on GaN. This enhancement is attributed to improved radiative recombination as a result of the reduced strain in the quantum wells. However, templates with In-content of ∼10.5\% and ∼11\% show inferior performance to the LEDs on GaN because the deterioration from the increased defects from the template is stronger than the improvement in the radiative recombination. It can be concluded that the InGaN templates with 8–10\% offer a technology for LEDs that is outperforming the traditional GaN technology.},

  abstract     = {To implement quantum light sources based on quantum emitters in applications, it is desirable to improve the extraction efficiency of single photons. In particular, controlling the directionality and solid angle of the emission are key parameters, for instance, to couple single photons into optical fibers and send the information encoded in quantum light over long distances, for quantum communication applications. In addition, fundamental studies of the radiative behavior of quantum emitters, including studies of coherence and blinking, benefit from such improved photon collection. Quantum dots grown via Stranski–Krastanov technique have shown to be good candidates for bright, coherent, indistinguishable quantum light emission. However, one of the challenges associated with these quantum light sources arises from the fact that the emission wavelengths can vary from one emitter to the other. To this end, broadband light extractors that do not rely on high-quality factor optical cavities would be desirable, so that no tuning between the quantum dot emission wavelength and the resonator used to increase the light extraction is needed. Here, we show that metallic nano-rings combined with gold back reflectors increase the collection efficiency of single photons, and we study the statistics of this effect when quantum dots are spatially randomly distributed within the nano-rings. We show an average increase in the brightness of about a factor 7.5, when comparing emitters within and outside the nano-rings, in devices with a gold back reflector, and we measure count rates exceeding 7 × 10 6 photons per second and single photon purities as high as 85\% ± 1\%. These results are important steps toward the realization of scalable, broadband, easy to fabricate sources of quantum light for quantum communication applications.},

A pair of interferometrically locked broad-band femtosecond pulses is used to launch SPPs from lithographically patterned plasmonic nanohole arrays. SPPs launched in the co- and counter-propagating directions are probed using a third probe pulse in a photoemission electron microscope. Using this approach, we record interferometric SPP–SPP linear autocorrelations that selectively report on the resonances of SPPs launched from arrays of varying pitches and hole diameters. Aside from advancing an approach to selective SPP spectroscopy, we illustrate that resonant coupling in the counter-propagating direction may be exploited to control the spatial, temporal, and spectral characteristics of SPPs. For the counter-propagating direction, we show that tuning the array pitch near the fundamental plasmon resonance generates color-tuned (∼770–820 nm), narrow bandwidth SPPs, and the bandwidth may be controlled by changing the ratio of pitch to hole diameter. The SPP resonances we recover through Fourier transforms of the interferometric autocorrelations shed light on the classical problem of Fano interference in nanohole array extinction spectra.},

Due to the internal crystal anisotropy of the spin defect, however, external bias fields—critical for the study of magnetic materials—must be applied along specific spatial directions. In particular, the most common diamond probes made from {100}-cut diamond only support fields at an angle of θ = 55 ° from the surface normal. In this paper, we report fabrication of scanning diamond probes from {110}-cut diamond where the spin anisotropy axis lies in the scan plane ( ⁠ θ = 90 ° ⁠ ). We show that these probes retain their sensitivity in large in-plane fields and demonstrate scanning magnetometry of the domain pattern of Co–NiO films in applied fields up to 40 mT.

  abstract     = {Quantum computing relies on the operation of qubits in an environment as free of noise as possible. Assessing the quality of this environment is a key aspect of ensuring high-fidelity implementations based on superconducting qubits. Relaxation, decoherence, dephasing, and quasiparticle tunneling rates have been measured for various shielding configurations used in the measurement environment for state-of-the-art transmon qubits. An ensemble of approximately 120 control devices was used for this study, with five different capacitor pad designs. The shielding elements varied in the configuration included an indium gasket at the qubit can&#39;s lid, Cryoperm magnetic shielding, the mixing chamber shield of the dilution refrigerator, the inclusion of a vacuum pump-out port, and capping unused subminiature version A connectors at the top of the measurement can&#39;s lid. It was found that the qubit lifetimes T 1 , T 2 , and T ϕ are robust to the all of configuration changes tried until the mixing chamber shield was removed, significantly increasing blackbody radiation levels in the qubit measurement space, where in that limit it was found that tapering the qubit pads reduced the amount of loss. In contrast, the quasiparticle tunneling rates were found to be extremely sensitive to all configuration changes tested. Consistent with earlier reports [McEwen et al. , arXiv:2104.05219 (2021); Cardani et al. , Nat. Commun. 12 , 2733 (2021); Wilen et al. , Nature 594 , 369–373 (2021); Ristè et al. Nat. Commun. 4 , 1913 (2013)], the findings from this study indicate that non-equilibrium quasiparticles do not currently limit the lifetimes of well-shielded transmon qubits.},

Adv. 6 , eaaz8423 (2020)], while the origin of its exceptional ductility is still not very clear. Here, we systematically investigate the temperature-dependent structure and thermodynamic behavior of the Ag 2 S x Te 1− x ( x = 0–1.0) system by means of in situ x-ray powder diffraction and dynamic thermodynamic analysis, respectively. Our experimental results reveal that the degree of crystallization in Ag 2 S x Te 1− x varies continuously with the ratio of S and Te. The Ag 2 S 0.4 Te 0.6 sample is composed of two amorphous phases, i.e., the S-rich and Te-rich Ag 2 (S,Te) glasses. The S-rich Ag 2 (S,Te) amorphous phase with the atomic ratio about Ag:S:Te = 66:21:13 is identified as the ductile phase, which is the origin of ductility in the Ag 2 S 0.4 Te 0.6 sample. The Ag 2 S-based glass in the supercooled liquid state at room temperature behaves like a Newtonian fluid at low strain rates, leading to the excellent ductility of Ag 2 S 0.4 Te 0.6 . Our work demonstrates the great potential to design and realize flexible inorganic functional materials through amorphization.},

Pressure-induced structural changes in AeH 2 materials could improve hydrogen transport properties and result in a better understanding of the structure-property relationship. In this work, pressure evolution of carrier transport properties of SrH 2 was investigated using impedance spectroscopy measurements at room temperature and first-principles calculations. The pressure-induced structure phase transition from a Pnma phase to a P6 3 /mmc phase was accompanied by a transition from pure electronic conduction to mixed ionic-electronic conduction, which was related to the ionic migration barrier energy. In the P6 3 /mmc phase, the H − ionic and electronic resistances of bulk and grain boundaries were distinguished, respectively. The total resistance of SrH 2 decreased by about four orders of magnitude after the phase transition. This work provides critical insight into the structure-conduction relationship and the role of grain boundaries in the transport process of alkaline-earth hydrides under high pressure.},

Intentionally, Ag-deficient CaAg 0.9 P shows a promising thermoelectric figure of merit, achieving zT = 0.43 at 660 K. This derives from moderate power factors, S 2 /ρ = 1.25 mW m −1 K −2 , and a low lattice thermal conductivity, κ lat = 1.2 W m −1 K −1 . The thermoelectric properties of CaAg 0.9 P are consistent with that of a small bandgap semiconductor. High levels of doping are key to suppressing bipolar transport, enabling promising zT values, despite the low ∼0.2 eV bandgap. Unusually, the onset of bipolar transport coincides with a transition to a more electrically resistive state, indicating a fundamental change in electronic properties at high temperature.},

However, the complete micro-dynamic mechanism remains to be established, which restricts its further applications. In this work, we investigate one representative material-plastic crystal neopentyl glycol (NPG) by means of large-scale molecular dynamics simulation. It is found that NPG exhibits colossal barocaloric effects (CBCEs) with high isothermal entropy changes and potentially large adiabatic temperature changes, which closely relates to the reversible order disorder change in NPG&#39;s molecular orientation, in which the non-bond interaction between molecules plays a key role. Further analysis of orientational dynamics and hydrogen bond energy during phase transition along with pressure dependent thermal conductivity sheds light on the underlying microscopic mechanism. Our work reveals the molecular mechanism of CBCEs in NPG as a prototypical plastic crystal, providing valuable insight into achieving practical caloric materials in future cooling technology.},

  abstract     = {Flexible thermoelectric (FTE) devices have become attractive in recent years since they can be utilized as a power generator for wearable and portable electronics. This work fabricated FTE nanocomposites from bacterial cellulose (BC) and Ag 2 Se via an easy and inexpensive method. The blended BC was thoroughly mixed with Ag 2 Se powders before casting onto a filter paper via vacuum filtration, followed by oven-drying and hot-pressing. Phase formation of Ag 2 Se in the BC nanofiber network was confirmed by x-ray diffraction and energy dispersive spectroscopy. SEM images revealed the distribution of Ag 2 Se particles in the BC matrix. The Ag 2 Se particles were densely packed for large Ag 2 Se concentrations in the BC/Ag 2 Se nanocomposite. Thermoelectric measurements found that the electrical conductivity ( σ ) and Seebeck coefficient ( S ) varied with the Ag 2 Se proportion due to the changes in the carrier concentration and carrier mobility. The maximum σ of 5.7 × 10 4 S/m and S of −80 μ V/K were observed at room temperature (RT), yielding the power factor (PF) of ∼300 μ W/mK 2 . This PF value is comparable to other FTE materials, but the process used in this research is much simpler. The thermal conductivity was 0.56 W/mK at RT. Moreover, the BC/Ag 2 Se nanocomposites were highly flexible and could be attached to curved surfaces. In addition, the FTE module was constructed from BC/Ag 2 Se uni-leg elements, which could generate an output power of 0.28 μ W. In addition, the simple fabrication process makes the BC/Ag 2 Se nanocomposite readily expandable to an industrial scale for modern FTE devices.},

  abstract     = {Chalcogenide superlattice (CSL) is one of the emerging material technologies for ultralow-power phase change memories. However, the resistance switching mechanism of the CSL-based device is still hotly debated. Early electrical measurements and recent materials characterizations have suggested that the Kooi-phase CSL is very likely to be the as-fabricated low-resistance state. Due to the difficulty in in situ characterization at atomic resolution, the structure of the electrically switched CSL in its high-resistance state is still unknown and mainly investigated by theoretical modelings. So far, there has been no simple model that can unify experimental results obtained from device-level electrical measurements and atomic-level materials characterizations. In this work, we carry out atomistic transport modelings of the CSL-based device and propose a simple mechanism accounting for its high resistance. The modeled high-resistance state is based on the interfacial SbTe bilayer flipped CSL that has previously been mistaken for the low-resistance state. This work advances the understanding of CSL for emerging memory applications.},

However, the reduced dimensionality and weak interlayer vdW interaction seriously suppress the magnetic Curie temperature T c , raising the concern with enhancing the interlayer FM coupling. It is argued that proper ion intercalation may enhance the interlayer coupling by establishing strong chemical bonding. In this work, this issue in a 2D vdW FM Fe 3 GeTe 2 (FGT) bilayer as an example is addressed, and our first-principles calculations predict that beryllium (Be) can be a promising intercalant for such enhancement. It is revealed that the Be-ion migration in-between the vdW gap has only moderate energy barriers owing to its small ionic radius, suggesting the feasibility of reversible intercalation. Particularly, Be-ion intercalation can significantly enhance the interlayer FM coupling by reducing the interlayer distance. The strong bonding that pulls two FGT monolayers closer is ascribed to orbital hybridization between Be-ions and interfacial Te-Fe I sites. Be-ion intercalation also contributes to electron doping via charge transfer, favoring the enhanced intralayer FM coupling. This work suggests an alternative scheme for reversibly controlled ferromagnetism enhancement in 2D vdW ferromagnets using ion intercalation.},

Here, we demonstrate intense second-harmonic emission in scalable embedded Ag nanoparticle arrays fabricated by ion implantation into BK7 glass. The interparticle coupling effect significantly enhances the local field at the nanogap (gap size ∼ 1 nm) of two neighboring Ag nanoparticles and finally amplifies second-harmonic emission generated at the surface of plasmonic nanoparticles. Notably, the intensity of second-harmonic emission in embedded Ag nanoparticle arrays is comparable to that of two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides under the excitation of a fundamental wave at 1064 nm and independent of the incident polarization angles. Our work offers a promising strategy on the rapid fabrication of low-cost nonlinear optical nanostructures with great environmental stability.},

Transition metal nitrides (TMNs) are seldom investigated due to the difficulty in fabricating high-quality and stoichiometric single crystals. In this Letter, we report the epitaxial growth and electronic properties of CrN films grown on different-oriented NdGaO 3 (NGO) substrates. Astonishingly, CrN films grown on (110)-oriented NGO substrates maintain a metallic phase, whereas the CrN films grown on (010)-oriented NGO substrates are semiconducting. We attribute the unconventional electronic phase transitions in CrN films to the strain effects. The effective modulation of bandgap by the anisotropic strain triggers the metal-to-insulator transition consequently. This work provides a convenient approach to modify the electronic ground states of functional materials using anisotropic strain and further stimulates the investigations of TMNs.},

Under high electric fields within the TiS 3 channel ( ⁠ ≤ 115 kV/cm), we observe the emergence of a critical fixed point, separating insulating and metallic regions in the transfer curves of the device. The critical gate voltage that defines this fixed point evolves systematically with the drain bias (field), allowing us to map out a phase diagram that identifies the conditions for metallicity or for insulating behavior. Dependent upon the choice of the gate voltage used to tune the carrier concentration in the nanowire, the existence of the field-induced MIT allows the TiS 3 to be either insulating or metallic over an extensive range of temperature. The possible connection of this strongly nonequilibrium state to some form of charge density wave is discussed.},

In this article, we introduce a Ta 2 Ni 3 Se 8 material as an example of an emerging one-dimensional (1D)-vdW-based material. Recently, it was demonstrated that bulk Ta 2 Ni 3 Se 8 crystals may be effectively exfoliated into a few-chain-scale nanowires using simple mechanical and liquid-phase exfoliation. We performed density-functional theory calculations to get a better understanding of its electrical, magnetic, and transport properties. Theoretically, we expect that this Ta 2 Ni 3 Se 8 is a semiconducting material, displaying the indirect-to-direct bandgap transition from bulk to single, as well as the band splitting and bandgap opening with the inclusion of Coulomb interaction. Based on deformation potential theory, the carrier mobility of bulk Ta 2 Ni 3 Se 8 along the axis direction (a-axis) is as high as 264.00 cm 2 V −1 s −1 for electrons and 119.62 cm 2 V −1 s −1 for holes. The calculated carrier mobility of Ta 2 Ni 3 Se 8 , a 1D single nanowire, is 59.60 cm 2 V −1 s −1 for electrons and 42.90 cm 2 V −1 s −1 for holes, which is comparable to that of other 1D materials. This confirms that a recently developed field-effect transistor based on Ta 2 Ni 3 Se 8 nanowires exhibits maximum experimental mobilities of 20.3 and 3.52 cm 2 V −1 s −1 for electrons and holes, respectively. On the basis of the obtained intriguing properties of 1D vdW Ta 2 Ni 3 Se 8 material, it is expected to be a potential candidate for additional 1D materials as channel materials.},

In this study, an automatic full-angle light intensity detection algorithm is developed to study polarizing light microscopy images of domain structures and the phase evolution process is decoded using the scale invariant feature transform method. This data processing algorithm is then used to characterize the phase transition process in relaxor ferroelectric PMN-0.29PT single crystals with complex domain structures. An emerging in-plane tetragonal phase is tracked during the rhombohedral (R) to tetragonal (T) phase transition, which is associated with peaks present in the temperature-dependent dielectric curve. Compared to the traditional polarizing light microscopy characterization method, this computer-aided algorithm enables a quicker and more informative analysis of domain evolutions in ferroelectric single crystals.},

Rhombohedral (R) and tetragonal (T) phases coexisted in two regions, i.e., the ferroelectric region with {001} C and {011} C nanodomains and the relaxor region with polar nanoregions. In situ observations show that the applied electric fields induced a reversible 90° domain switching in the ferroelectric region and an incomplete reversible relaxor-to-ferroelectric transition in the relaxor region. A reversible T–R phase transition was also evidenced by the [130] C electron diffraction patterns. The electric-field-induced domain switching and phase transition in both regions contributed significantly to the enhanced macroscopic properties. These findings provide deep insights into the dynamic structural evolution of NBT-based materials near MPB and help to understand the microstructural mechanism of the macroscopic piezoelectric behaviors.},

By analyzing the data gathered at the Co M 2 , 3 and Pt O 3 edges, we are able to show that after femtosecond laser irradiation, both components display a very similar loss of magnetic order, with almost identical demagnetization amplitudes and characteristic times, but a small delay (10–20 fs) of the Pt magnetization quenching with respect to Co. Comparing our experiments with literature results, therefore, suggests that in these 3d–5d multilayers and alloys, the different constituents remain strongly coupled after optical excitation; no matter whether the thin films possess a preferred in-plane or out-of-plane easy magnetization direction.},

  abstract     = {Thermal expansion phenomena are of both engineering and fundamental interest. The conventional theory of thermal expansion of solids considers anharmonic phonon effects but largely neglects other kind of elementary excitations. A recent experiment reported a negative thermal expansion (NTE) of a two-dimensional magnet CrBr 3 at low-temperatures. Our first-principles calculations, if only the effects of atomic vibrations are considered, predict a low-temperature NTE but lower by several orders of magnitude than experimental data. We propose magnetic excitations (magnons) as another important contributor to the NTE. We extend the theory of thermal expansion by including the contribution from magnons to Helmholtz free energy. First-principles calculations based on this theory confirm the dominate role of magnons in the negative thermal expansion of CrBr 3 as well as in other two-dimensional magnets.},

The AFM/HM-based artificial neurons are excited with short THz-range pulses, triggering precession in AFM. Bias electric current in the HM layer can be used to modify the resonance frequency of precession. The conversion of the precession into the electric current in the HM-layer occurs via the inverse spin Hall effect. A model of a neuromorphic processor is, thus, proposed, consisting of excitatory AFM-based artificial neurons—oscillators, and processing neurons—detectors. We show that the use of optical excitation can significantly increase the processing speed of neuromorphic computing at low power consumption. Examples of the implementation of the simplest logical operations (OR, AND) are demonstrated.},

The MTJ is composed of a type-II spin gapless semiconductor (SGS) Ti 2 CoSi inverse Heusler alloy (used as a lower electrode), a thin MgO layer (used as a tunnel barrier), and a half-metallic ferromagnet (HMF) Co 2 MnSi Heusler alloy (used as an upper electrode). Spin dependent transport properties reveal that the micro-fabricated MTJ can act as a reconfigurable magnetic tunnel diode, which lets the electric current to flow in either the forward or reverse path relying on the relative alignment of the magnetization direction of the upper and lower magnetic electrodes. A considerably high on/off current ratio (∼10 3 ) and a significantly low turn on voltage (V T ) of 0.09 V have been achieved at 5 K for both parallel and antiparallel configurations. Another important characteristic shown by our fabricated MTJ is that it exhibits extremely large tunnel magnetoresistance ratios of 892\% at 5 K and 197\% at room temperature, which brings to light the utmost importance of using the combination of HMF and SGS materials as magnetic electrodes in a tunnel junction for potential applications in modern spintronic devices. All these exceptional features can undoubtedly nominate CMS/MgO/TCS MTJs as a promising candidate to serve as memory or logic elements in next generation ultra-high density magnetoresistive random access memories together with contemporary spin based electronic devices.},

  abstract     = {Low bandgap thermoelectric materials suffer from bipolar effects at high temperatures, with increased electronic thermal conductivity and reduced Seebeck coefficient, leading to a reduced power factor and a low ZT figure of merit. In this work we show that the presence of strong transport asymmetries between the conduction and valence bands can allow high phonon-limited electronic conductivity at finite Seebeck coefficient values, leading to largely enhanced power factors. The power factors that can be achieved can be significantly larger compared to their maximum unipolar counterparts, allowing for doubling of the ZT figure of merit. We identify this behavior in low-bandgap cases from the half-Heusler material family. Using both advanced electronic Boltzmann transport calculations for realistic material band structures and model parabolic electronic bands, we elaborate on the parameters that determine this effect. We then develop a series of descriptors that can guide machine learning studies in identifying such classes of materials with extraordinary power factors at nearly undoped conditions. For this we test more than 3000 analytical band structures and their features, and more than 120 possible descriptors, to identify the most promising ones that contain: (i) only band structure features for easy identification from material databases and (ii) band structure and transport parameters that provide much higher correlations, but for which parameter availability can be somewhat more scarce.},

  abstract     = {Precision synthesis of ultrawide-bandgap semiconductors with a desired crystal phase is of broad interest for developing advanced electronic devices. However, it is highly challenging for gallium oxide (Ga 2 O 3 ), which is known for versatile crystal phase transition. Here, we report a non-equilibrium epitaxy strategy to confine the crystallization pathways of Ga 2 O 3 toward two distinct metastable polymorphs during the pulsed laser deposition (PLD) growth. This is achieved by synergic control of the substrate orientation and intentional tin (Sn) doping, which dramatically modifies the nucleation and growth kinetics of Ga 2 O 3 . Using a-plane sapphires and a medium Sn doping level, we overcome the commonly observed growth limitations of α-phase Ga 2 O 3 (α-Ga 2 O 3 ) films that are only stable for the initial few monolayers in previous PLD studies. Instead, we stabilize epitaxial α-Ga 2 O 3 films with excellent phase uniformity and crystallinity for a thickness beyond 200 nm. This contrasts to the otherwise formed ε-phase Ga 2 O 3 films by simply switching the sapphire substrate orientation to c-plane regardless of the Sn doping level. Density functional theory calculations reveal the critical role of the surface energy minimization for selective stabilization of metastable phases. This study provides a perspective to improve the non-equilibrium synthesis capability for exploring emerging ultrawide-bandgap semiconductors.},

In this paper, the aluminum-rich region of the L2 1 phasespace in Fe–V–Al is explored by a step-by-step increase in the Al content in Fe 2 VAl x . We reveal a promising route to improve the thermoelectric properties of p -type Heusler alloys. First, we find an ultrahigh solubility of Al in Fe 2 VAl x and confirm the presence of a single Heusler phase up to x = 2 using x-ray diffraction analysis and scanning electron microscopy. Second, thermoelectric transport properties, measured in a wide temperature range from 4 to 800 K, show a substantial increase in the thermopower by over 100\% and a significant decrease in the thermal conductivity by up to 80\% for the Al-rich samples. Detailed analysis of the carrier-concentration-dependent thermopower as well as Hall measurements indicate the formation of a resonant state at the valence band edge as a likely origin for this enhancement. This is further corroborated by density-functional-theory calculations of the electronic density of states. Our work sets the stage for p -type full-Heusler materials with enhanced thermoelectric performance, applying the principle of resonant states to this material class.},

This scheme avoids possible surface damage or contamination caused by the traditional transfer of sample into the DBRs. The single-mode laser with low threshold (∼1.3 μ J/cm 2 ) was obtained in the CsPbBr 3 microdiscs sandwiched in DBRs and measured by using the micro-photoluminescence spectroscopy. The length of the resonant cavity is short enough to support a large free spectral range, which ensures only one mode in the bandwidth of the optical gain. Moreover, by modulating the thickness of the CsPbBr 3 microdiscs, the wavelength of single-mode laser emission can be broadly tuned from 529.6 to 544.1 nm. This work provides a method of fabricating single-mode laser in DBRs, which may have potential applications in on-chip integration of optoelectronic devices and signal processing.},

Simulations demonstrate that two-dimensional InAs nanosheets can support multiple resonance modes, thus leading to a strong and broadband absorption from visible light to mid-wave infrared. Moreover, we can tune polarization-dependent property in InAs nanosheets to be polarization-insensitive by forming a nanosheet based clover-like and snowflake-like nanostructures. We further optimized the design of InAs nanosheet arrays based on such structures and achieved high absorption (up to 99.6\%) covering a broad wavelength range from 500 to 3200 nm. These absorption properties are much superior to their nanowire and planar film counterparts, making it attractive for infrared photodetection applications.

Three-terminal metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect phototransistors have shown excellent controllability of performance, but the hysteresis issue impedes their stable operation. In this work, the metal–semiconductor field-effect phototransistor based on the exfoliated Ga 2 O 3 microflake and graphene thin film is demonstrated. The high-quality quasi-van der Waals interface between Ga 2 O 3 and graphene eliminates the hysteresis issue and generates a subthreshold swing as low as 69.4 mV/dec. By regulating gate voltage ( V g ), the dominated mechanism of photocurrent generation in the device can be tuned continuously from the fast photoconduction effect to photogating effect with high photogain. Accordingly, the responsivity, dark current, detectivity, rejection ratio, and decay time of the device can be well adjusted by the V g . At V g = −1 V and a source to drain voltage of 2 V, the device shows excellent performance with a responsivity of 2.82 × 10 3 A/W, a rejection ratio of 5.88 × 10 5 , and a detectivity of 2.67 × 10 15 Jones under 254 nm illumination.

  abstract     = {Photochromic diarylethenes undergo reversible isomerization upon alternate irradiation with ultraviolet and visible light, having excellent thermal stability and durability. Thus, in combination with localized light, they are expected to exhibit intelligent functions based on light–matter composite systems at the nanometer-scale. In previous work, the formation of a clear open-ring/closed-ring boundary was observed on the surface of photochromic diarylethene thin-film crystals by simultaneously irradiating visible and ultraviolet light. To examine dynamic processes of the boundary formation, we developed a multi-probe atomic force microscope allowing simultaneous and continuous observations at different spatial positions. In this study, we developed atomic force microscopy containing two independent probe tips that allow simultaneous observation at spatially different positions. We used a unique method to control two probes in close proximity to achieve measurements at arbitrary positions. We have correlated the structural changes on the surface of photochromic thin films with the movement of the phase boundary at the crystal surface caused by photoisomerization under simultaneous broad visible and ultraviolet light irradiation. We also measured inhomogeneous expansion of nanometer-scale photoisomerizations due to local photoexcitation. This study paves the way for the elucidation of phenomena in the dynamic optical processes of crystals and for understanding versatile spatiotemporal dynamics in two- and three-dimensional optoelectronic structures within a nanometer scale.},

This material system exhibits properties like a low effective electron mass of the well material of 0.023 m 0 , beneficial for higher optical absorption strength, and a high conduction band offset of 2.1 eV, allowing the design of QCDs in the mid-infrared and near-infrared region. The presented QCD has a peak spectral response at 2.7 μ m (0.459 eV), the center of a CO 2 absorption band. To enable top side illumination, a grating was implemented. This additionally bypasses absorption by the narrow bandgap 0.345 eV (3.54 μ m) InAs substrate material. The QCD has a peak responsivity at a room temperature of 5.63 mA/W and a peak specific detectivity of 1.14 × 10 8 Jones.},

Compression of the first anomalous DW results in the subsequent cascade DW generation. Combined with the soliton induced blue-shifted dispersive wave and red-shifted dispersive wave, the spectrum spans from visible to mid-IR with high coherence. The four DWs generation process has agreement with prediction of the phase-matching condition. Overall, this multiple DWs generation method in a Si 3 N 4 waveguide provides the possibility for having an efficient, compact, and coherent mid-IR light source.},

The optical absorption and spectral response of sub-wavelength metal grating/Si:P blocked-impurity-band hybrid structure detectors are simulated by Finite Difference-Time Domain solution. Compared with the detector without grating structure, the hybrid structure detectors have the effects of selective absorption amplification and filtering. Moreover, the fabrication and experimental details of the hybrid structure detectors have been investigated. The results show that the response peak wavelength 18.3 μ m of the Si:P blocked-impurity-band detector has been modulated to 14.3, 22.8, 28.2, and 33.1 μ m (∼9.1 THz). Especially, about 140\% absorption enhancement is achieved at the response peak wavelength 28.2 μ m. Furthermore, the modulation mechanisms of spectral responses on operation bias voltages and temperatures have also been studied.

In contrast to digital alloy (DA), RAs are manufacturable due to the ease of growth. The 910 nm-thick RA AlGaAsSb was grown at a low temperature around 450 °C to mitigate phase separation by suppressing surface mobility of adatoms. The high quality of the RA AlGaAsSb material was verified by x-ray diffraction, Nomarski, and atomic force microscope images. Capacitance–voltage measurement found that the background doping concentration was 6–7 × 10 14 cm −3 , indicating very low impurity density in the RA AlGaAsSb material. Current–voltage measurements were carried out under dark condition and 455 nm laser illumination at room temperature. The breakdown occurs at −58 V. The dark current density at a gain of 10 was found to be 70 μ A/cm 2 . This value is three orders of magnitude lower than previously reported DA AlAs 0.56 Sb 0.44 APDs [Yi et al. , Nat. Photonics 13 , 683 (2019)], one order of magnitude lower than DA AlGaAsSb [Lee et al. , Appl. Phys. Lett. 118 , 081106 (2021)], and comparable to RA AlInAsSb APDs [Kodati et al. , Appl. Phys.

We also highlight recent progress in materials and approaches made during the past few years. We then focus on the “structural-ion” approach as developed in our research group in which the mobile ions are already present in the target material and discuss its potential advantages and challenges. Particular emphasis is given to the energetic and structural benefits of using nitrogen as the mobile ion, as well as on the unique manner in which ionic motion occurs in CoN and FeN systems. Extensions into patterned systems and textures to generate imprinted magnetic structures are also presented.

Using this advanced protocol, the sensitivity of the clock frequency to laser power, microwave power, and laser frequency variations is reduced, at least by one order of magnitude, in comparison with continuous-wave or Ramsey interrogation schemes. Light-shift mitigation obtained with the SABR sequence benefits greatly to the clock Allan deviation for integration times between 10 2 and 10 5 s.

T V2a spin defects were embedded in the channel region of well-defined 4H-SiC MOSFETs via controlled proton irradiation. The number of detected T V2a spins was estimated to be ∼10 5 .

The composite records somewhat higher electrical resistivity than pristine Bi 2 Te 3 , because the interface possibly interrupts carrier transport.

The composite also records a much lower thermal conductivity than the pristine Bi 2 Te 3 because of phonon scattering effects at the interface. The composite induces significant decoupling of electrical and thermal properties, thus affording the remarkably enhanced figure of merits ( ZT max ∼ 1.19 at 132 °C, ZT ave ∼ 1.14 at 50–150 °C), which are approximately double those of the pristine Bi 2 Te 3 .

However, it is challenging to simultaneously reach a high generation rate and a high collection efficiency due to their conflictive dependence on the thickness of photocatalytic films, especially for metal oxide photocatalysts. Therefore, it is critical to select an appropriate thickness to reach the highest photocatalytic rate under certain light illustration. Herein, we proposed a physical model to predict the optimal thickness of photocatalytic films by combining computation and experiments. In this model, a photoelectrode was investigated by thoroughly considering the electric potential distribution in the whole photocatalytic film rather than only considering the depletion layer as previously. We solved the continuity equation and got the distribution of minority carriers in photocatalytic films. The used parameters for calculation were obtained through density functional theory calculation and experiments. The optimal thickness of photocatalytic films can be predicted with this model. We have used CuFeO 2 films as the model material to verify the accuracy of the proposed model. Compared to the traditional trial-and-error process, our computation-assisted approach is highly efficient and can be broadly employed to other materials.},

More importantly, no foreign substances were introduced into isolated cells in the whole process, thus maintaining high vitality of cells.},

  abstract     = {Quantitative images of multiple molecular components in tissues have significance in understanding tissue functions. However, most imaging methods of quantifying a multicomponent mixture often rely on multiple excitations with different wavelengths or intensities. In this study, a transmission-mode photoacoustic microscope is developed to achieve quantitative images of two components in specimen slices. Different from other methods, the proposed method only scans the specimen one time by using a single-wavelength laser. After each laser excitation, the ultrasound transducer detects two signals: One is only related to optical absorption and the other is associated with both absorption and scattering. A linear equation system is proposed to describe the relationship between the signal magnitude and the molecular concentrations of thin-specimen. Solving these equations, we extract quantitative images of components in the thin-specimen from the two signals excited by a single-wavelength laser. Experiments demonstrate that the scheme accurately quantifies the concentrations of various mixtures of sterile sheep blood and milk, moreover, correctly revealing the concentration gradient due to molecular diffusion along the boundary between different components. This method could overcome the limitations induced by multiple excitations, and it will be helpful in developing a quantitative multiple-molecular imaging system.},

  abstract     = {Enhanced directional radiation is important for various applications such as lasers and antennas. However, almost all existing enhanced directional emitters rely on the use of materials or structures that provide multiple reflections, which are often bulky, lossy, and difficult to fabricate. Here, we theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate acoustic enhanced directional radiation with topological interface states in a specially designed acoustic waveguide with subwavelength width and no additional structure for multiple reflections. This waveguide is an acoustic analog of the double Su–Schrieffer–Heeger chain, in which a topological bandgap can be created by opening degenerate points away from the boundary of the Brillouin zone. Topological interface states between two topologically different waveguides were experimentally observed. A leaky-wave design is proposed for acoustic enhanced directional radiation. This leaky-wave waveguide can improve the radiation resistance and efficiency of a point source, and the radiation direction is locked by the momentum of the degenerate points. Acoustic enhanced directional radiation with more than ten times energy enhancement is observed in the experiment. The proposed strategy shows potential in the subwavelength wave manipulation and can be applied to acoustic communication, nondestructive evaluation, and biomedical imaging.},

Nevertheless, the corresponding gain part is hard to be realized experimentally in acoustic systems. In this paper, by combining the concept of injecting external energy and the soundwave–structure interaction, we propose a S-shaped waveguide model with a wave modulator, which exactly obtains the effective acoustic gain medium. We both numerically and experimentally show the implementation of the acoustic gain medium and calculate the effective parameter refractive index by the standard retrieval method. Crucially, the flexible reconstructions of the proposed structure can be easily conducted by merely changing one parameter of the proposed structure (e.g., height of the wave modulator). Moreover, to construct the on-demand PT-symmetric refractive index period, we further present a practical approach by applying the well-selected parameters of the model and analyzing the modulator&#39;s impedance. Our results are expected to be helpful for the design and potential applications of the acoustic PT-symmetric systems.},

Electrically detected magnetic resonance measurements also reveal generation of E′ oxide defects near the Si/SiO 2 interface.

The unexpected high shielding effectiveness of dilute graphene composites in blocking terahertz radiation was mostly achieved by absorption rather than reflection. The shielding effectiveness increases with increasing frequency.

In this Letter, a two-dimensional ferromagnetic half-metal 1T-FeCl 2 with super-exchange interactions and high Curie temperature is used to construct ferrovalley heterostructures under the means of magnetic proximity effects. The valley polarization up to 47.6 meV can be achieved in the HfNX (X = Cl, Br, I)/FeCl 2 . Meanwhile, we modulate the valley polarization by changing the interlayer spacing, applying biaxial strain, and changing the magnetization directions. Surprisingly, we find that the super-exchange interactions of the 1T-FeCl 2 lead to particular robustness of the valley polarization, so the valley signals in this structure are nonvolatile. Finally, the Berry curvature demonstrates that the HfNI/FeCl 2 is capable of achieving the anomalous valley Hall effect. The controllability and the robustness of the valley polarization in HfNX/FeCl 2 heterostructure are expected to overcome the volatility of the valley signals, which will be of great help for future applications in spintronics and valleytronics.},

Traditional RSFQ MPG designs, however, suffer from a large footprint as multiple RF components (including impedance matching networks, filters, etc.) are separately implemented one after another. In this Letter, we propose a compact on-chip MPG by introducing an integrated RF module. Using a generalized filter synthesis technique, the integrated RF module combines the functionalities of impedance matching and bandpass filtering as a single inductor-capacitor ( LC ) lumped network. Plenty of circuit elements can, thus, be saved, and the resultant LC network is applicable to both real and complex terminal impedance cases. For validation, a superconducting MPG adopting a fourth-order, 5 GHz centered, 100 MHz bandwidth integrated RF module is designed and fabricated, whose correct operations are confirmed through both simulation and measurement. These results raise the availability of controlling large-scale quantum systems by low-power superconductor technology in the future.},

In the latter case, the information on the details of the excitation is lost and, therefore, the electron dynamics can be described using quasi-equilibrium concepts. In this work, we study the effect of the pump photon energy on the ultrafast demagnetization dynamics in ferromagnetic nickel. We find that the magnetization dynamics for similar absorbed energies for a range of pump photon energies are almost identical and depend only on the absorbed energy. This is in stark contrast to characteristic differences in the optically excited electronic distributions, as calculated from the band structure. In addition, the measured fluence-dependent dynamics can be reproduced with a model based on local temperatures. These findings indicate that it is mainly secondary processes that are responsible for the observed demagnetization dynamics.},

  abstract     = {In highly non-equilibrium conditions of laser induced spin dynamics, magnetic moments can only be obtained from the spectral information, most commonly from spectroscopy of core or semi-core states using the so-called x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) sum rules. The validity of these sum rules in tracking femtosecond spin dynamics remains, however, an open question. Employing the time dependent extension of the density functional theory (TD-DFT), we compare spectroscopically obtained spin moments with those directly calculated from TD-DFT densities. We find that for pump pulses with low fluence, these two very distinct routes to the spin moment are, for Co and Ni, in excellent agreement, validating the experimental approach. However, for short and/or intense pulses with high fluence, the XMCD sum rules fail with errors exceeding 50\%. This failure is most pronounced during the pulse and occurs when the pump pulse excites charges out of the d -band and into sp -character bands, invalidating the core or semi-core to d -state transitions assumed by the XMCD sum rules.},

  abstract     = {Control over spin transport in antiferromagnetic systems is essential for future spintronic applications with operational speeds extending to ultrafast time scales. Here, we study the transition from the gigahertz (GHz) to terahertz (THz) regime of spin transport and spin-to-charge current conversion (S2C) in the prototypical antiferromagnet IrMn by employing spin pumping and THz spectroscopy techniques. We reveal a factor of 4 shorter characteristic propagation lengths of the spin current at THz frequencies (∼0.5 nm) as compared to GHz experiments (∼2 nm). This observation may be attributed to different transport regimes. The conclusion is supported by extraction of sub-picosecond temporal dynamics of the THz spin current. We identify no relevant impact of the magnetic order parameter on S2C signals and no scalable magnonic transport in THz experiments. A significant role of the S2C originating from interfaces between IrMn and magnetic or non-magnetic metals is observed, which is much more pronounced in the THz regime and opens the door for optimization of the spin control at ultrafast time scales.},

  abstract     = {Strain is a useful method to manipulate properties of three-dimensional (3D) topological insulators (TIs). In this study, we demonstrate the possibility to tune the circular photogalvanic effect (CPGE) of surface states of 3D TI Sb 2 Te 3 films by applying external strain. The CPGE of 3D TI Sb 2 Te 3 grown on SrTiO 3 (STO) with different thicknesses has been systematically investigated. It is found that as the thickness of Sb 2 Te 3 films increases from 7-quintuple layer (QL) to 27-QL, the CPGE current first increases and then decreases. Additionally, the CPGE currents demonstrate remarkable temperature dependence, which even reverse sign when the temperature is increased from 77 to 300 K. This phenomenon is due to the vertical thermoelectric effect and inverse spin Hall effect. Finally, the CPGE measurements of Sb 2 Te 3 films under different mechanical strains are performed, and it is found that the CPGE current linearly decreases with the increase in the external strain. The variation in the CPGE current can be tuned up to 11\% and 44\% in the 18- and 12-QL Sb 2 Te 3 grown on STO substrates under a tensile strain of 0.0225 and 0.0066, respectively. In particular, it can even reach 100\% in the 30-QL Sb 2 Te 3 film grown on an InP substrate under a tensile strain of 0.0033, which is due to the combined effect of mechanical deformation and spin injection from substrates. Our work provides a method to effectively manipulate the CPGE in 3D TIs by the combined effect of mechanical strain and spin injection from substrates, which paves the way for novel opto-spintronic devices.},

Spin transporting behaviors of the Pt/BLFO structure were investigated at room temperature. Interestingly, a magnetoresistance effect was observed at the interface of the Pt/BLFO bilayer. The spin mixing conductance at the interface between BLFO and Pt was estimated after a corrections of Pt thickness.

Our measurements were performed by magnetic force microscopy on samples with and without aluminum at remanence, after application of successive external magnetic field steps. Experimental results show that both evolution of magnetization and monopole population under external field are affected by the aluminum presence. Very good agreement between those results and excitation model simulations was found when both emergent magnetic monopole and dipole strengths decrease on the presence of the aluminum cap. We suggest that the observed strength weakening of emergent particles occurs due to its field screening by aluminum-free electrons. The screening on the presented heterostructure could be used for devices design with different magnetic monopole mobility or for selective thermodynamic activation in samples close to superparamagnetic regime.},

  abstract     = {Electrically detected magnetic resonance (EDMR) measurements have been extended to sub-mT magnetic fields through utilization of frequency sweeping of the oscillating magnetic field, where conventional electron paramagnetic resonance-based measurements traditionally utilize magnetic field magnitude ramping. In spin-dependent transport measurements in devices, an oftentimes pervasive near-zero field magnetoresistance effect overwhelms the sub-mT regime. This magnetoresistance effect is independent of the RF drive. Thus, by utilizing a constant DC magnetic field and a frequency sweep of the RF magnetic field, the magnetoresistance effect is not detected, leaving only the EDMR response. Interesting EDMR-based phenomena emerge at sub-mT fields when the oscillating field magnitude approaches the static field, such as multiple-photon transitions caused by the emergence of Floquet spin states and Bloch–Siegert shifts. A spectral-narrowing effect also emerges as the static field is reduced. In this work, we show that the narrowing of the frequency-swept EDMR response with static field can be modeled by changes in intermediate spin-pair relaxation through modulation of hyperfine fields caused by stochastic perturbations from the environment. We utilize recently developed theory to model the relaxation of spin pairs and show that stochastic interactions of the electron spin with the environment yield both Floquet spin states and changes in intermediate spin-pair relaxation.},

The dominant mechanism is symmetry breaking (current-driven Néel wall motion) at the large (small) current. Due to the competitive relationship of these two mechanisms, the non-hysteresis effect magnetic switching without an external magnetic field is obtained.

In this work, the BaFe 10.2 Sc 1.8 O 19 (BFSO)/BaTiO 3 (BTO) bilayer epitaxial thin films are fabricated. Results show that compared to the single BFSO film, there are significant increases in magnetic susceptibility, multiferroic transition temperature ( T cone ), and EFCM in BFSO/BTO bilayer films. The room temperature magnetoelectric coupling coefficient in BFSO (80 nm)/BTO (300 nm) bilayer films (189.6 ns/m) is 14.7 times higher than that in the single layer BFSO film and 345 times larger than single crystalline BiFeO 3 . A change in magnetization Δ M\% about 38\% at 20 K and 7.1\% at 390 K is obtained in the BFSO (80 nm)/BTO (300 nm) bilayer film. Moreover, repeatable low voltage (≤4 V) EFCM with a high signal-to-noise ratio in the BFSO/BTO bilayer film device is verified at temperatures ranging from 20 K to above 390 K. This high temperature EFCM is mainly contributed by the high T cone of BFSO and strong piezoelectric/magnetostrictive coupling at the BFSO/BTO interface. The above findings enable the potential usage and integration of BFSO/BTO bilayer films into micro-integrated microwave devices.},

We characterize the thin films with x-ray reflectivity measurements for the film growth characteristics, with photoluminescence spectroscopy for structural defects, with electrical transport measurements for carrier density, electrical resistivity, and Seebeck coefficient, and with time-domain thermoreflectance measurements for thermal conductivity. Photoluminescence spectroscopy data suggest that elongation of the purge period creates structural defects, which increase the electron carrier density; this would explain the enhanced electrical conductivity of the films. At the same time, the defects are likely to hinder the thermal transport in the films. The, thus, realized simultaneous increase in electrical conductivity and decrease in thermal conductivity are of fundamental importance in thermoelectrics. Moreover, the simple control of the intrinsic electrical transport properties is highly desired for the semiconducting ZnO films in optics and microelectronics.},

The remaining n + GaN on the barrier, serving as contact ledges, provides an additional current path to achieve the reduced equivalent source-drain distance and, thus, improved output current, and more current contribution is made by contact ledge as the actual source-drain distance shrinks. With the assistance of contact ledge, the fabricated device demonstrates output current density of 2.8 A/mm, a peak extrinsic transconductance of 823 mS/mm, a knee voltage of 1.6 V, and an on-resistance of 0.47 Ω·mm.

At 30 GHz and V DS of 6 V, decent power-added-efficiency of 52\% together with output power density of 1.2 W/mm is achieved, revealing the great potential of the proposed regrown Ohmic contact with contact ledge structure for low voltage RF applications.},

It was found that the electronic excess noise of the diamond diodes is dominated by the 1/ f and generation-recombination noise, which reveals itself as Lorentzian spectral features ( f is the frequency). The generation-recombination bulges are characteristic of diamond diodes with lower turn-on voltages. The noise spectral density dependence on forward current, I , reveals three distinctive regions in all examined devices—it scales as I 2 at the low ( I 10 mA) currents and, rather unusually, remains nearly constant at the intermediate current range. The characteristic trap time constants, extracted from the noise data, show a uniquely strong dependence on current. Interestingly, the performance of the diamond diodes improves with the increasing temperature. The obtained results are important for the development of noise spectroscopy-based approaches for device reliability assessment for high-power diamond electronics.},

  abstract     = {The present study reports the dynamics of phase transitions at the high electron injection limit in two-dimensional layers of VO 2 , an archetypical strongly correlated oxide that undergoes an insulator to metal transition (IMT) at 67 °C. Prior studies to date have reported electron doping as high as ∼10 21 cm −3 in epitaxial thin films and nanoparticles of VO 2 through catalytic spillover and electrochemical gating in ionic liquid electrolytes, which has been shown to induce a sequential insulator-to-metal-to-insulator phase transition. With the use of two-dimensional crystalline platelets, which enable fast Li + diffusion and out diffusion kinetics during electrochemical gating, we show that an electron density as high as 4 × 10 23 cm −3 can be reversibly injected into VO 2 without significant structural damage. This leads to a giant conduction modulation involving an unprecedented three-step insulator-to-metal-to-insulator-to-metal transition along with a switch in the electrical polarity from n-type to p-type due to electron doping. A unified “lattice redox model” to explain the origin of thermal-, electrochemical-, and compositional-induced IMT that involves vanadium redox-induced band filling, structural distortion, and electron correlative effects is proposed.},

Scanning thermal microscopy was used to determine the out-of-plane thermal conductivity and estimate the in-plane values. Nanoporous Ca 3 Co 4 O 9 films exhibit a thermal conductivity of 0.82 W m −1 K −1 , which is nearly twofold lower than that obtained from nonporous Ca 3 Co 4 O 9 films. Nanoporous Ca 3 Co 4 O 9 exhibit a room-temperature electrical resistivity of 4 mΩ cm, which is comparable to polycrystalline Ca 3 Co 4 O 9 and twice that reported for single-crystal Ca 3 Co 4 O 9 .

We show that the acoustic absorption can be predicted by the resonance of the cavities associated with the tortuous paths. For a given fractal/geometry order, the acoustic absorption at specific frequencies is also enhanced by maximizing the difference between the minimum and maximum fluid particle velocity of the air inside the patterns.

The fundamental cause is the different dislocation dynamics in the two types of metals. In this Letter, we use atomistic simulations to quantify dislocation glide in two RMPEAs: MoNbTi and NbTiZr. Edge and screw dislocations on the {110} and {112} slip planes are studied. A series of dislocation line lengths, ranging from 1 nm to 50 nm, are employed to elucidate the line-length-dependence. To serve as references, the same simulations are performed on pure metals. For the RMPEAs, the dependence of critical stresses on length becomes undetectable within the statistical dispersion for dislocations longer than 25 nm, as a result of the change in dislocation behavior. This length is in good agreement with those predicted by analytical models. Compared to the pure metals, the critical stress anisotropy among different slip planes and character angles is substantially reduced, providing an explanation for the homogeneous plasticity in RMPEAs observed in prior experiments.},

In light of recent advances in fabricating slanted microstructures by using photolithography or reactive ion etching techniques, however, a complex, environmentally unfavorable, and tedious fabrication process makes them far from practical in application. Herein, we present a viable strategy to prepare a slanted shape memory microcone array (SSMMA) by combining the femtosecond laser oblique microfabrication and replica-mold method. Thanks to its fast temperature-responsive feature, SSMMA enables the transition of adhesion forces to effectively control the sliding of droplet on the surface. The underlying principle of the adjustable migration behavior of droplet is that SSMMA switches between the slanted and collapsed states. Moreover, we systematically studied the influence of the microcone spacing/height together with the microcone bending angle on the wetting performance of water droplet. More significantly, the resulted SSMMA analogous to a “machine hand” is experimentally demonstrated to be competent for the grab and transfer of fragile and smooth objects (e.g., coverslip) with a maximum adhesion force of ∼19.404 mN. The current study opens up an avenue for rapidly fabricating functional slanted microstructures for practical usage.},

In this work, surface discharge propagation characteristics in the C 4 F 7 N/CO 2 mixture under positive impulse voltages are investigated. The surface discharges are detected electrically and observed by optical imaging. The residual surface charge distribution is acquired by an electrostatic probe method and a dust figure method after surface discharge. Comparative studies in CO 2 and SF 6 are further conducted. Results exhibit some significant differences between CO 2 and C 4 F 7 N/CO 2 mixtures in the propagation pattern and morphology of surface discharges. The surface discharge in the C 4 F 7 N/CO 2 mixture develops in a stepwise expansion pattern, which is a result of alternative formation of streamers and leaders. A leader channel and a streamer development region are clearly distinguished in the optical image. The dust figure shows that no charge is deposited on the leader channel area after discharge, proving that the leader channel is electrically neutral and of high conductivity. The residual surface charge distribution in the C 4 F 7 N/CO 2 mixture is obtained and resembles pine branches.

With a light pulse applied, the resistance of a BP/2DEG heterojunction decreases dramatically over five orders of magnitude. Such a low resistive state is maintained over 5 days without any sign of recovery. The application of the negative bias voltage can tune the device into a high resistive state. By combining the light and bias voltages, the device enables it to change into any resistance value, indicating a potential application for multi-bit photoelectric memory. Further study demonstrates that the BP/2DEG heterojunction can achieve both optical writing/electric erasing and electric writing/optical erasing.

Relaxing the amplitude constraint during the iterations is an effective method to solve the above problem. In this work, a GS-double amplitude freedom (GS-DAF) algorithm is proposed. The amplitude constraint relaxation is realized by both the combined amplitude constraint and the support constraint. The spherical initial phase and oversampling method are applied to further improve the optical reconstruction quality of the GS-DAF algorithm. An enhanced reconstruction quality with less speckle noise has been achieved. The peak signal-to-noise ratio can be improved from 14.98 to 33.32 dB after 200 iterations.},

  abstract     = {Increasing any degree of freedom of vortex light beam can broaden the application area of this special light beam. Here, up to nine multicolor concentric ultrafast vortex beams (MUCU-VBs) with controllable orbital angular momentum (OAM) are generated simultaneously using cascaded four-wave mixing in an yttrium aluminum garnet plate. The topological charges (TCs) of the MUCU-VBs are controllable by changing the TCs of the two input pump beams. The MUCU-VBs can be manipulated simultaneously in temporal, spatial, and spectral domains and OAM state, which will be of wide and special applications, such as multicolor pump-probe experiments, simultaneous microparticle manipulation, and optical communication. Moreover, the special focusing properties of the multicolor ultrafast sidebands, such as multi-focus of different wavelengths, may further extend their application areas. The method can be used to generate MUCU-VBs in other spectral ranges such as UV or mid-infrared.},

  abstract     = {In a photodiode made from a narrow bandgap III–V material such as InSb, the dark current is usually dominated by thermal generation-recombination (GR) in the depletion region. In an XB n or XB p barrier detector, the GR current is suppressed by confining the depletion region to a wide bandgap barrier material with a band alignment that blocks majority carriers. Diffusion limited barrier detectors are essentially unipolar and represent a device architecture with unity gain that is fundamentally different from that of the traditional photodiode. High performance barrier detector arrays spanning the mid- and long-wave infrared atmospheric transparency windows are currently being produced with both bulk alloy and type II superlattice (T2SL) absorbers several micrometers thick. In T2SLs, 5–10 μ m diffusion lengths have been demonstrated for both InAs/GaSb XB p and InAs/InAsSb XB n devices. The former exhibit minority electrons with a short lifetime and a high mobility, while the latter exhibit minority holes with a long lifetime and a low mobility. The contrasting behavior is understood in terms of competing GR and Auger recombination mechanisms, and a transition between metallic and nonmetallic conduction. These properties present unique challenges for the future design of monolithic dual band photodetectors.},

We present a holistic analysis of technical requirements to design ideal neuromorphic hardware in which linearity is the critical aspect during training, whereas retention is the essential criterion of inference.

The in silico model is informed by relevant data from previously published in vitro experiments (cancer cell viability), providing detailed information on (i) cell population number (N cell ) development during incubation and (ii) probability values for apoptosis (\%P Apoptosis ) and mitosis (\%P Mitosis ) following cell subjection to the plasma-conditioned RPMI-1640 medium (PC-RPMI), DOX, and DOX combined with APPJ. When treating cancer cells with PC-RPMI and DOX separately, at the smallest plasma duration ( d Plasma = 15 s) and DOX concentration ( c DOX = 0.05 μ M), only a small decline in N cell , an increase in\%P Apoptosis , or/and a decrease in\%P Mitosis are measured with respect to the control conditions (non-treated cancer cells). However, cell cytotoxicity is increasingly enhanced with increasing d Plasma and c DOX up to 120 s and 0.5 μ M, respectively. At those highest values studied in in silico , simulated\%P Apoptosis are significantly larger than\%P Mitosis , resulting in a severe decrease in N cell compared to control in agreement with the corresponding in vitro experiments. Furthermore, cell treatments combining the smallest two c DOX (0.05 and 0.1 μ M) with d Plasma = 15 s result in smaller N cell , larger\%P Apoptosis , and lower\%P Mitosis compared to PC-RPMI and DOX effects alone. The present in silico model is particularly useful in the plasma (cancer) medicine field since it can effectively simulate and quantify responses of various cancers to APPJ or/and cancer drugs being strongly complementary to in vitro experiments.},

Using a data-based methodology of short-open-load calibration at a temperature of 30 mK, we report calibrated 1-port scattering parameter data of individual qubit drive line components. At 5 GHz, cryogenic return losses of a 20-dB-attenuator, a 10-dB-attenuator, a 230-mm-long 0.86-mm silver-plated cupronickel coaxial cable, and a 230-mm-long 0.86-mm NbTi coaxial cable were found to be 35 − 2 + 3 dB, 33 − 2 + 3 dB, 34 − 2 + 3 dB, and 29 − 1 + 2 dB, respectively. For the same frequency, we also extract cryogenic insertion losses of 0.99 − 0.04 + 0.04 dB and 0.02 − 0.04 + 0.04 dB for the coaxial cables. We interpret the results using master equation simulation of all XY gates performed on a single qubit. For example, we simulate a sequence of two 5 ns gate pulses (X and Y) through a two-element Fabry–Pérot cavity with 276-mm path length directly preceding the qubit and establish that the return loss of its reflective elements must be &gt;9.7 dB (&gt;14.7 dB) to obtain 99.9\% (99.99\%) gate fidelity.},

The ability to perform multi-qubit operations in a single step could vastly improve the fidelity and execution time of many algorithms.

We show numerical evidence for a process fidelity over 99.5\% and a gate time of 450 ns for superconducting qubits interacting via tunable couplers.

By cooling down the device in an external magnetic field while crossing the metal-to-superconductor transition, the gradiometric fluxonium can be locked either at 0 or Φ 0 / 2 effective flux bias, corresponding to an even or odd number of trapped fluxons, respectively. At mK temperatures, the fluxon parity prepared during initialization survives to magnetic field bias exceeding 100 Φ 0 ⁠ . However, even for states biased in the vicinity of 1 Φ 0 ⁠ , we observe unexpectedly short fluxon lifetimes of a few hours, which cannot be explained by thermal or quantum phase slips.

Nevertheless, the requirements for the two functionalities are different, leading to challenges to coordinate them. In our work, we propose a near-field TPX system composed of the CdTe LED and InP photovoltaic (PV) cell to realize two such functionalities with high performance. With wide-bandgap and high-quality semiconductors, the proposed system achieves a bandgap alignment at various temperatures and has low nonradiative recombination rates, thus enabling the functionality integration. Without changing the structures and materials, the system can switch functionality from power generation to electroluminescent refrigeration by tuning the LED temperature from 800 to 260 K while the PV temperature is maintained at 300 K. In addition, we suggest an additional layer of a thin Pt film on the PV cell to suppress phonon-polaritons parasitic heat transfer and further improve the system efficiency of both functionalities. This work theoretically demonstrates the possible integration of multiple functionalities and triggers further explorations of practical TPX systems.},

  abstract     = {Metamaterials can be utilized for a variety of applications and have emerged as a valuable tool in THz technologies. Used as THz biosensors, metasurfaces can significantly improve the sensitivity in the detection of biomolecules, but the high THz absorption of water represents a major challenge for the realization of a sensor for measurements in liquids. In this article, we propose an approach where the resonance feature of complementary asymmetric split ring resonators (CASRR) is maintained even for measurements in water, allowing highly sensitive detection of biomolecules in strongly absorbing liquids. This is enabled by the introduction of substrate-integrated microfluidics, which are shown to have a minimal effect on the transmission properties of the metamaterial. Due to this approach, the metamaterial structure design is independent from the microfluidic channels. Our simulations also show that the sensitivity of CASRR changes only marginally for lossless and highly absorbing materials. At the same time, the presented concept is easy to fabricate by standard lithography methods and can be applied to other metamaterial structures as well.},

  abstract     = {Intrinsic lipid and protein components in biological tissues hamper the translation of light-related techniques to in vivo applications and highlight the need for strategies to improve photon trafficking. To meet this demand, we propose a method for the production of transient micro-sized bubbles to improve the local light intensity in the scattering medium by combining ultrasound and super hydrophobic polytetrafluoroethylene nanoparticles (PTFE NPs) with a mean size of 350 nm. The underlying idea was to convert the initial Rayleigh scattering effect into a Mie scattering effect to reduce loss during light propagation. The Monte Carlo simulation confirmed our hypothesis that only a specific size of microbubbles would increase light propagation. By fine-tuning the acoustic parameters (1.5 MPa, 100 cycles, and 10 Hz of pulse repetition frequency) and PTFE NPs&#39; concentration (0.05 mg/ml), shell-less microbubbles were transiently and locally generated, resulting in a reduction in the scattering coefficient of the medium and improving the delivered light fluence by 6.2\%. The experimental results further confirmed that only microbubbles of the proper size could repeatedly increase the light propagation. This method may be suitable for in vivo deep-tissue optical applications such as the delivery of PTFE NPs to deep tumor regions to increase the efficiency of photothermal therapy.},

This is indicative of detection and manipulation of a single interface trap spin species located at the boundary between the SiO 2 gate dielectric and Si substrate (almost certainly a P b type center). This demonstration in sub-micrometer devices in which Dennard scaling of the gate oxide has yielded extremely large gate oxide leakage currents eliminates interference between the charge pumping current and the leakage phenomenon. The result is the ability to measure single trap charge pumping reliably and easily, which would otherwise be completely inaccessible due to oxide leakage. This work provides a unique and readily available avenue for single spin species detection and manipulation, which can be applied as a quantized standard of electrical current as well as to serve as a potentially useful platform for developing quantum engineering technologies. Finally, we discuss potential underlying physical mechanisms that are involved in producing a seemingly contradictory measure of both odd and even integer values for charge per cycle.},

Hexagonal (Sc x Ga 1−x ) 2 O 3 alloys show more negative formation enthalpies than (Al x Ga 1−x ) 2 O 3 alloys, and the increments in the positive formation enthalpies for monoclinic (Sc x Ga 1−x ) 2 O 3 alloys are different from the (Al x Ga 1−x ) 2 O 3 alloys. (Sc x Ga 1−x ) 2 O 3 alloys will undergo the compressive strain if grown on the Ga 2 O 3 substrate.

It is noted that Ga 2 O 3 /(Sc x Ga 1−x ) 2 O 3 heterojunctions keep the type-II band alignments and whose conduction and valence band offsets can be significantly and negligibly enlarged by increasing Sc concentration, respectively. The large conduction band offsets for Ga 2 O 3 /(Sc x Ga 1−x ) 2 O 3 heterojunctions allow (Sc x Ga 1−x ) 2 O 3 alloys to be an electron blocking layer for the Ga 2 O 3 device, and ease the problems of parasitic conduction in the field effect transistor.},

We use deep level transient spectroscopy (DLTS) to evaluate such defect levels in the n-drift layer of vertical gallium nitride (v-GaN) power diodes with V BD ∼ 1500 V. DLTS reveals three energy levels that are at ∼0.6 eV (highest density), ∼0.27 eV (lowest density), and ∼45 meV (a dopant level) from the conduction band. Dopant extraction from capacitance–voltage measurement tests (C–V) at multiple temperatures enables trap density evaluation, and the ∼0.6 eV trap has a density of 1.2 × 10 15 cm −3 . The 0.6 eV energy level and its density are similar to a defect that is known to cause current collapse in GaN based surface conducting devices (like high electron mobility transistors). Analysis of reverse bias currents over temperature in the v-GaN diodes indicates a predominant role of the same defect in determining reverse leakage current at high temperatures, reducing switching efficiency.},

The terahertz absorption of electric-field-induced hole carriers increases with decreasing frequency down to 150 cm −1 (4.5 THz). However, it is not reproduced by the simple Drude model but tends to be suppressed with decreasing frequency. The spectral shape of the absorption and the mobility value were simultaneously reproduced by the Drude–Anderson model, which incorporates carrier scattering due to thermal molecular fluctuations. The frequency of the intermolecular vibration that dominates carrier scattering is estimated to be approximately 8 cm −1 , which is in good agreement with the theoretically predicted value. Moreover, analyses of the absorption spectra at low temperatures reveal that the mobility increases to 14 cm 2 V −1 s −1 at 240 K.

Here, we present an Opuntia-based broadband omnidirectional antenna element, operating at several Wi-Fi communication bands, spanning from 900 MHz to 7.7 GHz. A high relative permittivity in the GHz range exceeds 20. As a result, a variety of Mie resonances within the cladode are measured and revealed by the multipole expansion technique. Modal hierarchy, resonantly excited with a coaxial cable, is demonstrated to provide a broadband impedance matching below −10 dB over the ∼150\% bandwidth.

In particular, the strongly bound interlayer exciton (IX) within vdWH offers a platform for exploring fundamental physics as well as innovative device applications. However, to date, it remains a critical challenge to modulate the IX emission energy, limiting the achievement of high-performance spin-valleytronics and excitonic devices. Here, we report a simple strain engineering approach to efficiently modulate the MoS 2 /WSe 2 IX via uniaxial strain. By encapsulating the vdWH within a flexible substrate, the applied mechanical strain could be effectively transferred to the lattice of vdWH during the mechanical bending process, leading to an unprecedent IX modulation range of 144 meV with a linear fitted gauge factor of 121.8 meV per 1\% strain. Furthermore, we found that the gauge factor of IX in vdWH is larger than that of individual MoS 2 and WSe 2 intralayer excitons, further confirming that the observed IX originates from the momentum-indirect exciton between the K point of the MoS 2 conduction band and the Γ point of the WSe 2 valence band. Our study not only achieves a high vdWH IX modulation value using efficient strain engineering but also provides a route to investigate the evolution of band energy for various two-dimensional (2D) materials as well as their vertical vdWH.},

A particularly striking recent example is the observation of an Ising superconducting transition at high carrier densities induced through the field effect in an electric double layer transistor (EDLT). So far, this phenomenon has been accounted for by assuming that the original triangular prismatic bulk crystal structure is unaffected by the heavy doping. However, this assumption has not been verified so far, even though other crystal phases of these layered materials were shown to host Ising superconductivity as well. Here, we provide experimental evidence that the initial triangular prismatic crystal structure of the MoS 2 , which serves here as a representative member of the TMD family, is not altered during operation of the EDLT even when the carrier density is large enough to induce the superconducting transition. The latter is monitored via transport measurements, while the crystal structure is simultaneously examined in situ with micro-Raman spectroscopy at low temperature.},

In this study, we investigated the relationship between the metallic domain size and the device-size-dependent MIT property of VO 2 thin films grown on hBN. We observed by temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy and optical microscopy the emergence of the metallic domains and determined the metallic domain size in VO 2 thin films grown on hBN. The metallic domain size of the VO 2 thin films grown on hBN was determined to be ∼500 nm on average in length and up to sub-micrometer scale. Electric transport measurements revealed that VO 2 /hBN microwires exhibit multi-level step-like resistivity changes that change by one to two orders when the length and width are ∼2 μ m owing to the confined metallic domains in the micrometer scale.

  abstract     = {We demonstrate experimentally that nanoscale control of plasmonic field enhancement becomes available by changing the polarization state of light. This is revealed by photoelectron emission from plasmonic nanorods illuminated with linearly and circularly polarized femtosecond laser pulses. Simulations show that the tunability of the field enhancement originates from the mode-mixing property of circularly polarized illumination, meaning simultaneous excitation of multiple plasmon modes of the nanostructures. Performing trajectory calculations of the photoemitted electrons, we prove that the kinetic energy scaling law remains the same irrespective to the polarization state.},

As the thickness decreases, the superconducting transition temperature T c is gradually suppressed and ultimately out of detection when the thickness is comparable to the superconducting coherence length. The enhanced disorder with the decrease in thickness is expected to play an important role on the suppressed T c . Furthermore, the distinct weak antilocalization effect is observed in the SnTaS 2 nanoflakes, and the temperature-dependent phase coherence length extracted from weak antilocalization agrees with strong electron–phonon scattering in the sample. Our results provide insight into the electronic properties in the low dimensional limit of topological superconductor candidate SnTaS 2 .},

Comparison of experimental data obtained by reflected high-energy electron diffraction and the calculated concentration of ammonia fragments on the GaN surface, and surface energy showed that the movement of adsorbed ammonia fragments into strongly bound states is an effective mechanism to control the GaN morphology. The minimum value of equivalent NH 3 beam pressure at different temperatures to prevent the conversion of the two-dimensional (2D) GaN layer to three-dimensional (3D) islands has been established. It was shown that the boundary between the 2D and 3D states on the surface is defined by the elemental composition of adsorbed particles on the surface and the temperature dependence of the surface energy of the facets of islands.},

While the A-site atomic images around the Ba ion can be well understood based on the BaTiO 3 structure, those around the Ca ion are located at the closer positions to the emitter. Furthermore, the shape of the atomic image around the Ca ion is elongated in the radial direction. These features clearly show the local lattice contraction around the Ca ion and a significant displacement of the Ca ions from the ideal position. On the basis of the detailed analysis of the position and the shape of the atomic image around the Ca ion, it is found that the Ca ions are displaced by ∼0.36 Å in the ⟨ 111 ⟩ direction, and the surrounding Ba ions are displaced by ∼0.22 Å in the ⟨ 100 ⟩ direction.

Samples were stencil printed on metal foils and cured at 120 °C. The effective transverse piezoelectric coefficient (d 31eff ) was calculated by utilizing the converse piezoelectric effect and measuring the displacement of a cantilever sample’s tip in an electric field. Interestingly, the results showed improved piezoelectric properties with the stiffer steel substrate samples. The highest d 31eff achieved was about −22 pm/V, which was 29\% higher than in samples printed on brass foil (−17 pm/V). Both are substantially higher compared to the coefficients reported with similar ceramic-polymer composites on polymer substrates. The improvement is suggested to originate from the prevention of buckling effects and more effective bending deformation, while the structure remained flexible. Due to the high effective values of d 31 and g 31 , the developed material and cantilever structures are feasible for both sensor and energy harvesting applications.},

Since the formation and dynamics of domain walls are decisive to the properties of ferroelectrics, in this study, a representative orthorhombic niobate-based ferroelectric perovskite, i.e., KNbO 3 , is studied by using first-principles calculation. Three types of domain walls with permissible walls located at crystallographic planes, including uncharged 180°, 120°, and 90° domain walls, are selected for simulation. The formation energy, intrinsic energy barrier of domain-wall motion, and the electronic configuration are systematically analyzed. We discover that the formation energy is associated with the variation of Nb–O hybridization at the domain wall, while the intrinsic energy barrier of the domain-wall motion depends on the dynamical change of Nb–O hybridization along the transition path. Therefore, we propose that the Nb–O hybridization plays a critical role in the formation and motion of domain walls in niobate-based ferroelectrics.},

The simultaneous responses of the b -axis electric polarization ( P b ) and dielectric anomaly ( ε b ) against magnetic stimuli along the c -axis are revealed. In addition, both the ferroelectric transition and dielectric anomaly shift from the magnetic Néel temperature T N ∼ 8.5 K toward the low temperature under increasing H applied along the c -axis, providing clear evidence for the magnetism-driven ferroelectricity. The observed off diagonal linear ME effect is in accordance with the prediction based on ME tensor analysis for the magnetic space group Pb ′ cn . Consequently, our results may allow an interesting opportunity to further exploration of intriguing phenomena and physics of ferrotoroidicity in this linear-ME compound CoSe 2 O 5 due to the existence of the off diagonal term in the ME tensor, similar to the case for LiCoPO 4 .},

The magnetic nanoparticle (MNP)-elastomer composite can be stretched during experiments, and macroscopic deformations cause rearrangement of the iron oxide particles on the nanoscale. Polarized neutrons can be used to nondestructively probe the arrangement of magnetic nanoparticles before and after stretching, so that the relationship between applied stress and nanoscale magnetization can be interrogated. We find that stretching the MNP-elastomer composite past a certain threshold dramatically changes the structural and magnetic morphology of the system. The unstretched sample is modeled well by ∼40 nm clusters of ∼7 nm particles arranged in a hard sphere packing with a “volume fraction” parameter of 0.3. After the sample is stretched 3× its original size, however, the scattering data can be modeled by smaller, 16 nm clusters with a higher volume fraction of 0.4.

Although the pressure-induced structural phase transitions of PbI 2 have been investigated for several decades, the detailed crystalline structure of PbI 2 at high pressure is still elusive because of lacking in situ x-ray diffraction (XRD) studies. In this report, in situ Raman spectra and XRD patterns of 2H-PbI 2 under pressure have been investigated in a diamond-anvil cell. Both Raman spectra and XRD patterns provide consistent evidence for two structural phase transitions upon compression at approximately 0.58 and 2.6 GPa. The XRD patterns suggest that the complete pressure-driven phase transition sequence of PbI 2 up to 20 GPa is two-dimensional hexagonal 2H- P 3 ¯ m 1 →polytype 4H- P 3 m 1→three-dimensional (3D) orthorhombic Pnma .

  abstract     = {The role of dopants on deformation and mechanical properties of 4H silicon carbide (4H-SiC) is proposed by using nanoindentation. It is found that the hardness, elastic modulus, and fracture toughness of 4H-SiC substrate wafers all decrease on the order of vanadium (V) doping, undoping, and nitrogen (N) doping. For all three types of 4H-SiC, basal plane dislocations (BPDs), threading edge dislocations, and cracks are formed during the nanoindentation. Polymorph transitions from 4H-SiC to amorphous SiC and 3C-SiC are found as the penetration depth of the indent increases from the subsurface to the deeper region. N doping is found to weaken the bond strength of 4H-SiC, which enhances the glide and piling up of BPDs in nanoindentated N-doped 4H-SiC. In contrast, V doping effectively hinders the glide of BPDs, which accumulates a high-stress field and facilitates the polymorph transition from 4H-SiC to 3C-SiC and amorphous SiC. The insight on the effects of dopants on the deformation and mechanical properties of 4H-SiC may help the design of the processing of differently doped 4H-SiC substrate wafers.},

Multi-probe Hall device measurements show one order increase in the sheet electron concentration after Ohmic-metal formation compared with that before formation, indicating that high-density doping takes place in the AlGaN/GaN heterostructure under the Ohmic-metal. However, after Ohmic-metal removal, the increased sheet electron concentration returns to the value before formation. Moreover, we formed Ni/Au Schottky contacts on the AlGaN/GaN heterostructures before Ohmic-metal formation and after Ohmic-metal removal, and confirmed that the characteristics are almost the same. These results indicate that donors do not exist after Ohmic-metal removal, suggesting that, although high-density doping takes place, high-density donors are not formed under the Ohmic-metal. The high-density doping without high-density donors could be attributed to polarization doping, playing a significant role in Ohmic contact formation.},

  abstract     = {Erbium (Er) doped GaN (Er:GaN) bulk crystals are promising as an optical gain material for high energy lasers. Other than the preferred configuration of Er 3+ occupying the Ga site with four nearest neighbor N atoms (Er Ga ), Er can also form a complex with a defect (Er Ga -DX) in Er:GaN. A set of Er:GaN semi-bulk crystals were grown by hydride vapor phase epitaxy (HVPE) at different growth temperatures to allow the determination of the formation energies, E F , of Er optical centers in Er:GaN. Photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra near 1.5 μ m pumped by a near band edge excitation (λ exc = 375 nm) and by a resonant excitation (λ exc = 980 nm) were measured, which yielded two different formation energies of E F = 2.8 eV and 3.3 eV, corresponding to the formation of Er Ga -DX and Er Ga in Er:GaN, respectively. As a gain medium, the formation of Er Ga -DX in Er:GaN would not only reduce the pumping efficiency of Er optical centers but also increase the optical loss. Our results provide useful insights into possible strategies for enhancing the fraction of Er Ga in Er:GaN and, hence, the pumping efficiency, paving the way for achieving optical gain and lasing in Er:GaN.},

It is found that introducing ozone during the film growth significantly inhibits the formation of oxygen vacancies and the occurrence of Sn 2+ ions. The amount of oxygen vacancies decreases consistently with the increase of the ozone content, which further increases the in-plane lattice constant along with the relief of the in-plane compressive strain. More importantly, the reduction of oxygen vacancies gives rise to the augment of the threading dislocation density in the BLSO films, leading to the deterioration of carrier mobility. These findings demonstrate that the existence of Sn 2+ ions does not apparently suppress the electron mobility in BLSO films, and the presence of oxygen vacancies is beneficial for reducing the density of threading dislocations, facilitating the mobility enhancement. All these findings would be beneficial for understanding the role of oxygen vacancy in carrier transport properties and for further optimizing the mobility of BLSO films.},

The analysis of transient and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements revealed that the presence of the Si-rich SiN layer leads to a decrease in the deep-level surface traps by mitigating the formation of Ga–O bonds. This results in a suppressed current collapse from 11\% to 5\% as well as a decreased knee voltage ( V knee ). The current gain cutoff frequency and the maximum oscillation frequency of the devices with the Si-rich SiN layer exhibit the values of 74 and 140 GHz, respectively. Moreover, load-pull measurements at 30 GHz show that the devices containing the Si-rich SiN deliver excellent output power density of 8.7 W/mm at V ds = 28 V and high power-added efficiency up to 48\% at V ds = 10 V. The enhanced power performance of HEMTs using Si-rich SiN interlayer passivation is attributed to the reduced V knee , the suppressed current collapse, and the improved drain current.},

  abstract     = {Diffusion-driven coarsening of droplets is a classical subject in statistical physics, yet coarsening kinetics in confined systems have received little attention. We report here on the coarsening of droplets in thin (50–200 nm) films of phase-separated barium borosilicate glasses. In this ultra-confined geometry where at most one droplet is observed within the film thickness, droplets grow like a power-law of time with an exponent about 0.17 significantly smaller than that of the one of Ostwald ripening ( 1 / 3 ) characteristic of bulk coarsening. We complement these experimental results with two-dimensional Cahn–Hilliard numerical simulations of diffusion, where a wider range of parameters can be varied. In simulations, we recover a slow coarsening behavior in ultra-confined geometry. We explain the anomalous scaling exponent of simulations by ultraconfined geometry, which imposes a different scaling with time of the radius of a droplet and the distance between droplets. In the experimental system, diffusive transport also becomes less efficient with time compared to the bulk case with an additional change of geometry compared to simulations. Flattening of droplets with time is indeed observed, which we attribute to strong variations of the diffusion coefficient with the local matrix composition. We finally propose a simple model assuming a spatial localization of the diffusion paths to account for this effect.},

This adhesion is suggested to be induced by a liquid-like layer on a bulk metallic glass surface, which has a high diffusion coefficient of 6.9 × 10 −11 m 2 ⋅s −1 , even at a relatively low temperature of 263 K. By investigating the dynamics for this liquid-like layer, a special fractional Stokes–Einstein relationship was found.

When the WGM cavity is optically driven in one direction, the time-reversal symmetry for light transmission is broken due to the unidirectional photon–phonon coupling. We show that the signal light is either transmitted or completely absorbed depending on whether it propagates in the same or opposite direction as the strong pump laser. The perfect absorption can be interpreted as a phase transition in a parity–time–symmetric Hamiltonian with the balanced gain and loss.

  abstract     = {We report a transparent ultrathin Ag nanomesh electrode fabricated by nanosphere lithography combined with a dielectric wetting layer, which is simple and cost-effective. Compared with the continuous ultrathin film Ag electrode, the nanomesh electrode exhibits a higher figure of merit (FOM = T 10 /Rs, T is the transmittance and Rs is the sheet resistance) of 3.01 × 10 −3 Ω −1 , which is due to the retained high electrical conductivity and nanopores as optical windows. The maximum luminance and current efficiency enhancement of organic light emitting devices (OLEDs) with an ultrathin Ag nanomesh electrode are up to 56.2\% and 41.4\% compared to that of conventional devices with an ITO anode. It is worth noting that the ultrathin Ag nanomesh electrode has been proved able to resolve the emission intensity roll-off of OLEDs with dual metal electrodes as the enlargement of viewing angle due to the redistribution of the light emission direction derived from strong scattering. More light emission at larger angles is of great value for lighting panel applications.},

  abstract     = {There is a continuing need for the development of cost-effective and sustainable mid-infrared light sources for applications such as gas sensing and infrared beacons. A natural replacement for the conventional incandescent sources still widely used in such applications is semiconductor LEDs, but to achieve emission at long wavelengths requires the realization of devices with narrow effective bandgaps, inherently leading to relatively poor internal and external quantum efficiencies. Recently, the technological potential of graphene-based incandescent emitters has been recognized, in part due to the ability of graphene to sustain extremely large current densities. Here, we introduce a simple architecture, consisting of a back-reflector behind a multilayer graphene filament, which we use to produce emitters with wall-plug-efficiencies comparable to state-of-the art semiconductor cascade LEDs. Coupled with the potential for high-speed modulation, resulting from the low thermal mass, our results demonstrate the feasibility of creating practicable infrared sources.},

  abstract     = {Terahertz resonances are capable of relaxing through multiphonon scattering because of the long lifetimes of excited vibrational states compared with the periods of lattice vibrations of a crystal. In this study, we examine the temperature-dependent frequency shifts in the frequency ranges of 20–90 and 200–600 cm −1 of thiamin crystals containing hydrated ions and provide evidence for multiphonon scattering. One-, two-, and three-phonon scattering are clearly observed in the form of discrete linear temperature coefficients of vibrational frequencies. Higher transition frequencies tend to cause more phonon scattering in the frequency range of 20–90 cm −1 , while higher transition frequencies tend to cause less phonon scattering in the frequency range of 200–600 cm −1 . The characteristic temperature parameter of the effective phonon taking part in the scattering processes is estimated to be 44.6 K, which is shared by different vibrational transitions, and the corresponding characteristic frequency is estimated to be 31.0 cm −1 . Highly accurate solid-state first-principles calculations incorporating relativistic effects and dispersion corrections are performed, and the results show that the characteristic frequency is close to the lower limit of the calculated optical phonon frequencies, lying between the lowest two. The ratio of the vibrational transition frequency to the characteristic frequency is 1.6 for single-phonon scattering, 2.0 and 2.2 for two-phonon scattering, and 2.5 for three-phonon scattering in the frequency range of 20–90 cm −1 . In the frequency range of 200–600 cm −1 , the ratio is much higher than that in the frequency range of 20–90 cm −1 and is 9.4 to 16.4.},

The responsivity, elevated shot noise, flicker noise, and dynamic source-drain resistance for homodyne and heterodyne detection are characterized and analyzed at different local terahertz (LO) power levels. With a LO power of only −3.9 dBm, the detector offers a conversion loss less than 28 dB and a noise-equivalent power (NEP) about −132 dBm/Hz. A threshold LO power about −5 dBm is identified above which the shot noise becomes the dominant noise source, and the intermediate-frequency response is strongly suppressed. The elevated noise and the saturation in responsivity are found to be closely related to the strong direct-current homodyne current and the charge modulation/accumulation by the LO signal. Possible solutions are discussed to further reduce the NEP and the conversion loss.},

  abstract     = {For short wave infrared (SWIR) sensing, InGaAs is the leading technology combining high carrier mobility, high homogeneity, and complete control over the n -to- p doping. In the meanwhile, numerous alternative materials have tried to compete with InGaAs. Among them, colloidal nanocrystals with narrow bandgap can address the current issue in designing cost-effective sensors for the SWIR range. Rather than putting these two materials against each other, we design here a synergistic duo in which HgTe nanocrystals are used to broaden the spectral range of InGaAs while lifting the lattice matching constraints. We propose a diode geometry where a p -type HgTe NC array is coupled with n -type InGaAs wires, which are used as high mobility ( μ &gt; 1000 cm 2 V −1 s −1 ) minority carrier extractors. This approach also demonstrates that Van der Waals heterostructures are not limited to graphene-like materials, and that bulk-like III–V semiconductors can also be light sensitized by colloidal nanoparticles. This work paves the way toward further synergies between epitaxially grown and colloidally grown semiconductors for infrared detection.},

  abstract     = {The recent thrust in ultrafast magnetization dynamics aims at extending spintronic functionalities to terahertz frequencies. Deterministic manipulation of magnetization at the corresponding ultrashort timescales requires minute control not only over the magnetization itself but also the reservoirs it is interacting with. Although the various intricate couplings between spins, phonons, and electrons—all of which are susceptible to ultrashort laser pulses—lead to many (often nonlinear) coupling routes, magnetization-dynamical nonlinearities have remained largely underexplored. In this Perspective, we highlight recent advances and foresee future developments in the rapidly evolving field of nonlinear magnetization dynamics. Given the elementary character of coherent excitations, we put particular emphasis on their nonlinearities. We briefly review theoretical aspects and assess excitation mechanisms to reach the nonlinear regime of magnetic excitations in a broad class of magnetic materials, such as ferromagnets, antiferromagnets, and ferrimagnets. We present an overview of the groundbreaking experiments that showcase the unique insights provided by magnetic nonlinearities. We conclude by discussing open challenges and opportunities that underpin the potential of nonlinear magnetization dynamics for the advancement of spintronics and cavity quantum electrodynamics with spin waves at terahertz frequencies.},

Here, we develop an electrical approach to contactless quantification of aqueous microfluidic flow. We found that the electric potential generated by the ubiquitous contact electrification of a microfluidic flow with fluidic channel walls is interrogatable by using a probe electrode at a distance over centimeters from the microfluidic flow, and the measured voltage response demonstrates linear relationship to the microfluidic flow rate with a resolution of sub-microliter per minute (in a 1-Hz bandwidth), providing an ideal, high-precision contactless flow transduction pathway.

In this work, we systematically optimized the measurement parameters for microwave sensing. The system noise is analyzed, and 1/ f noise is suppressed by introducing a differential algorithm. The gain of avalanche photodiode and the gating window of the pulsed fluorescence is optimized to further suppress the noise floor. The decoherence of spin is characterized by varying the duration of the laser and microwave. The minimal detectable power on a standard microstrip is characterized with sampling time down to 1 ms, showing flat frequency dependence.

  abstract     = {Superconducting qubits have emerged as a potentially foundational platform technology for addressing complex computational problems deemed intractable with classical computing. Despite recent advances enabling multiqubit designs that exhibit coherence lifetimes on the order of hundreds of μ s, material quality and interfacial structures continue to curb device performance. Two-level system defects in the thin superconducting film and adjacent dielectric regions introduce stochastic noise and dissipate electromagnetic energy at the cryogenic operating temperatures. In this study, we utilize time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry to understand the role specific fabrication procedures play in introducing such dissipation mechanisms in these complex systems. We interrogated Nb thin films and transmon qubit structures fabricated through slight modifications in the processing and vacuum conditions. We find that when the Nb film is sputtered onto the Si substrate, oxide and silicide regions are generated at various interfaces. We also observe that impurity species, such as niobium hydrides and carbides, are incorporated within the niobium layer during the subsequent lithographic patterning steps. The formation of these resistive compounds likely impacts the superconducting properties of the Nb thin film. Additionally, we observe the presence of halogen species distributed throughout the patterned thin films. We conclude by hypothesizing the source of such impurities in these structures in an effort to intelligently fabricate superconducting qubits and extend coherence times moving forward.},

An established generation scheme is based on single photons impinging on a beam splitter. Here, we experimentally demonstrate quantum random number generation solely based on the symmetric emission profile of a dipole aligned orthogonal to the laboratory frame. The demonstration builds on defect centers in hexagonal boron nitride that emit photons in random directions within the dipole emission profile and benefits from the ability to manipulate and align the emission directionality. We prove the randomness in correlated photon detection events making use of the NIST randomness test suite and show that the randomness remains for two independently emitting defect centers. The scheme can be extended to random number generation by coherent single photons with potential applications in solid-state based quantum communication at room temperature.},

Electrical transport properties of Cu-doped samples were systemically controlled using this mechanism. At the same time, thermal conductivities of the Cu-doped samples were reduced by the enhancement of point defect phonon scattering due to the Cu atoms. Compared to that of pristine samples, the dimensionless thermoelectric figure of merit (“ ZT ”) of 0.98 at 323 K for the Cu-doped sample was increased by more than 92\% owing to these synergetic effects. Furthermore, the shift of maximum ZT to room temperature provides advantages for enlarging the applications of thermoelectric effects at room temperature.},

  abstract     = {Variations in the wind direction over time mean that it is essential to improve the directional adaptability of wind energy harvesters (WEHs) based on wind-induced vibration (WIV) to expand their application potential. Several multi-directional WIV WEHs have been reported in the literature but most of them are not omnidirectional. In particular, no mathematical model has been proposed for omnidirectional WIV WEHs to date. In this Letter, an in-plane omnidirectional piezoelectric WEH with a cylindrical shell, acting as a bluff body and supported by internal piezoelectric composite beams, is proposed. It is deduced that the omnidirectionality of wind energy harvesting can be enhanced by improving the isotropies of the aerodynamic force, stiffness, and electromechanical conversion. For a WEH with three semicircular-shaped supporting beams, a mathematical model suitable for arbitrary wind directions in the horizontal plane was derived. Simulations show that the WEH&#39;s stiffness and electromechanical conversion are approximately isotropic. Simulations and experiments demonstrate that the wind direction&#39;s effect on the total power is small. The ratio of the experimental minimum to maximum total power is 0.88 at 9 m/s, verifying that the device is an in-plane omnidirectional harvester. An omnidirectionality index including contributions from all directions is proposed with the value of 0.86 at 9 m/s for the prototype. The proposed device configuration and design method may serve as a reference for the development of omnidirectional WIV WEHs.},

  abstract     = {Direct ionizing damage and indirect secondary electron damage play important parts in the cell death under ion beam radiation. Depending on the real-time time-dependent density functional theory, we study the physical and chemical properties of the normal (α-) and mutant DNA (λ-DNA) in the process of low energy proton irradiation. The mutation of base pair causes the change in local chemical environment of DNA molecule and further changes the charge density of trajectory, proton–DNA interaction energy, force and track for moving proton, energy deposition, and the secondary electron evolution. The layered discrete charge in the intruding direction results in a spatial insensitivity of the electrons on the base pair to the energetic ion. The abnormal energy deposition for λ-DNA is ascribed to the mutation of the charge density and the nucleus–nucleus interaction potential. A more stable bond is formed between the mutant base pairs for λ-DNA, and there exists a flow of secondary electrons on the phosphate backbone under the ion beam radiation, resulting in a subsequent indirect chemical damage. These results provide an understanding for the central role of the physical states in radiation-induced cell death and a theoretical reference to improve the success rate of ion beam radiotherapy.},

Multiple scattering of a coherent wave in a random medium determines the transport procedure. Brownian motions of scatterers perturb each propagation trajectory and form dynamic speckle patterns in the backscattered direction. In this study, we applied the random matrix theory to investigate the eigenvalue density of the backscattered intensity matrix. We find that the dynamic speckle patterns can be utilized to decouple the single and multiple backscattered components. The Wishart random matrix of the multiple scattering component is well described by the Marčenko–Pastur law, while the single scattering part has a low-rank characteristic. We, therefore, propose a strategy for estimating the first and second order moments of single and multiple scattering components, respectively, based on the Marčenko–Pastur law and trace analysis. Electric field Monte Carlo simulation and in vivo experiments demonstrate its potential applications in hidden absorbing object detection and blood flow imaging. Our method can be applied to other coherent domain elastic scattering phenomena for wide-field propagation of microwave, ultrasound, etc.},

The single-event burnout (SEB) failure is thermal runaway from second breakdown, initiated by impact ionization and terminated with mesoplasma formation, at the center of the P-pillar/N+ substrate interface. We also demonstrate that the SEB performance of this SiC SJ DMOSFET is insensitive to the pillar width but sensitive to the strike location with ion strike at the P-pillar causing SEB at a lower blocking voltage than at the N-pillar. Compared to commercially available 1.2 kV blocking-rated non-SJ DMOSFETs, which have been demonstrated to survive SEB up to 525 V, the SJ DMOSFET increases SEB survival threshold voltage (V SEB ) by a factor of 2.2, making it close to 1200 V, while the on-resistance is increased by only 11\%. Using our recently developed figure of merit (FoM), which considers the trade-off between V SEB and on-state performance, we find that the SiC SJ DMOSFET achieves a FoM that is 14 times better, making it superior to conventional 1.2 kV SiC DMOSFETs for long-term radiation-tolerant operation in space applications.},

Here, we have developed an experimental method that allows concurrently the in situ thermal conductivity measurement and the real-time internal structure observation of a single one-dimensional (1D) material using scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) in a scanning electron microscope. In this method, the two ends of the 1D nanomaterial are bonded on a tungsten probe and a suspended platinum nanofilm, respectively. The platinum nanofilm serves simultaneously as a heater and a resistance thermometer, ensuring highly sensitive thermal measurements. The platinum nanofilm is fabricated on the edge of the silicon wafer so that the electron beam can transmit through the 1D material and be detected by the STEM detector, which caters for real-time observation of the inner nanostructure. Using this method, we in situ measured the thermal conductivities of two cup-stacked carbon nanotubes and concurrently observed the internal hollow structures. We found that the sample with more structural disorders had a lower thermal conductivity. Our measurement method can pave the way to the sample-by-sample elucidation of the structure–property relationship for 1D materials.},

Here, we fabricated and studied van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures of 2D magnet Fe 3 GeTe 2 (FGT) and 2D semiconductor MoS 2 . With reflectance magnetic circular dichroism, we found that the coercive field of MoS 2 -covered FGT reduces compared with uncovered FGT, agreeing well with our first-principles calculations. With its strong spin–orbit coupling (SOC), MoS 2 effectively alters the crystal field of the adjacent FGT and its magnetic anisotropy. Furthermore, an unconventional two-step hysteresis loop emerges in MoS 2 /FGT as a result of the superposition of two regions of FGT: at the interface and away from the interface. Our experimental elucidation of the SOC proximity effect that MoS 2 exerts on FGT provides fundamental understanding for the rational development of 2D magnet/semiconductor heterostructures.},

The memristive device with high uniformity is now urgently needed to ensure them be really integrated in a neuromorphic chip. Here, we first report the realization of artificial synapse networks based on the SiO x /TiO x memristive crossbar array. Compared with the one of the SiO x memristors, the coefficient of variation in the high resistance state and the low resistance state of the SiO x /TiO x memristor can be reduced by 64.2\% and 37.6\%, respectively. It is found that the improved uniformity of the SiO x /TiO x memristive device is related to the thicker and permanent conductance pathway in a TiO x layer, which can localize the position of conductive pathway in the SiO x layer. The disconnection and formation of conductive pathway occur mainly in the thin SiO x layer, leading to a substantial improvement in the switching uniformity. The SiO x /TiO x memristive crossbar array shows a stable and controllable operation characteristic, which enables the large-scale implementation of biological function, including spike-duration-dependent plasticity, spike-timing-dependent plasticity, and spike-number-dependent plasticity as well as paired-pulse facilitation tunability of conductance. Specifically, the visual learning capability can be trained through tuning the conductance of the unit device. The highly efficient learning capability of our SiO x /TiO x artificial synapse for neuromorphic systems shows great potential application in the AI (artificial intelligence) period.},

Contrary to the common belief on the mm2 macrosymmetry, we find that the mm2 macrosymmetry significantly underestimates the electromechanical coupling of the ZXt 45 ° -cut transverse extension specimen by about 10\%. We show that the underestimated electromechanical coupling can be corrected by assigning a lower symmetry of 2 , i.e., an average monoclinic symmetry. The validity of the newly assigned macrosymmetry and the presence of non-regular phases presumably responsible for the apparent loss of mirror symmetry are confirmed by radial strain and thermally stimulated depolarization measurements, respectively.},

The figure of merit of d 31 × g 31 of the 0.25PIN-0.43PMN-0.32PT single crystal was enhanced to be 29.3 × 10 −12 m 2 /N by ACP, which is 1.9 times and 8.9 times as much as that of the 0.25PIN-0.43PMN-0.32PT single crystal and the commercial PZT5H ceramic by direct current poling (DCP), respectively. The piezoelectric unimorph of the 0.25PIN-0.43PMN-0.32PT single crystal by ACP produced the open circuit voltage of 67 Vp and the maximum power of 0.74 mW under on-resonance condition, which were 1.5 times and 1.8 times as much as the 0.25PIN-0.43PMN-0.32PT single crystal unimorph by DCP. Moreover, these were almost 2.4 times more voltage and 5.7 times more power than the PZT5H ceramic unimorph. Even under the off resonance condition, the piezoelectric unimorph of the 0.25PIN-0.43PMN-0.32PT single crystal by DCP and ACP produced 4.4 times and 8.0 times maximum output power as much as the PZT5H ceramic unimorph. ACP is a potential way to further enhance the output voltage and power of the 0.25PIN-0.43PMN-0.32PT single crystal unimorph for energy harvesting.},

While based on the data obtained from high-resolution x-ray diffraction and scanning transmission electron microscopy analysis, the average structure of the PMN- x PT films is metrically cubic, micro-Raman polarimetry measurements indicate the tetragonal-like ferroelectric phase with marked preference for the polarization perpendicular to the film for all three compositions. The results of the Raman scattering analysis are supported by electromechanical properties of the samples, which clearly show that the films have a locally non-centrosymmetric structure. Furthermore, only a gradual enhancement of the electrical properties from PMN-25PT to PMN-40PT is observed, which is attributed to small tetragonal distortions that are highly similar for all three compositions.},

Here, we experimentally and numerically explore how silicon substrates—long considered to be mere supporting structures for CMOS-compatible materials—can be exploited to improve optical absorption in the mid- to far-infrared spectral ranges, thus reducing the energy requirement for all-optical switching of magnetization. We show that infrared illumination of the metal through a 500 μ m-thick silicon substrate actually deposits more energy in the metal film (by a factor of almost 3) compared to the conventional approach of illuminating the metal directly. Our results reveal that silicon substrates can actually play a crucial role in the efficient optical delivery of energy to functional materials and will find application in a wide range of experiments and technologies involving mid- and far-infrared light.},

  abstract     = {Grain boundary diffusion (GBD) is an effective approach for improving the coercivity of Nd-Fe-B magnets with less heavy rare earth consumption. However, it generally only works well for thin magnets since the infiltration depth of diffusion source is limited. Here, a GBD approach that mainly diffuses the source from the edge and corner areas of the magnet, named selected area GBD (SAGBD), is proposed for treating thick magnets. After diffusing Pr-Tb-Al-Cu alloy by SAGBD, the coercivity of a 12-mm thick magnet was increased from 1070 to 1675 kA/m. By this approach, the coercivity enhancement with 1 wt.\% Tb was 465 kA·m −1 , 1.6 times as much as that by diffusion from two easy magnetization planes. For achieving a coercivity enhancement of ∼600 kA/m, the thickness of treated magnet was increased by 4 mm. Although the diffusion from six planes can further increase the coercivity, SAGBD leads to high efficient use of Tb and less reduction of remanence. The microstructure characterizations and micromagnetic simulation demonstrated that the edges and corners are magnetic “weak” areas of the magnet, and SAGBD can effectively hinder the nucleation of reversed domains in these places and the rapid reversal propagation in whole magnet. The present approach is important for the high-efficient use of the diffusion source and the fabrication of large-size Nd-Fe-B products with high stability.},

Magnetic ground domains in Fe 3 Sn 2 disks turn from stripes to vortices after decreasing the disk thickness or temperature as the easy-plane anisotropy wins the competition with the uniaxial magnetocrystalline anisotropy. Topological transformations from charge Q = − 1 / 2 vortices at a zero field to Q = − 1 skyrmion-like configurations at a high out-of-plane field were identified in cooperation with micromagnetic simulations.

  abstract     = {Using an ultrashort laser pulse, we explore ab initio the spin dynamics of Gd x (FeCo) 1 − x at femtosecond time scales. Optical excitations are found to drive charges from Fe majority d -states to unoccupied Gd f -minority states with f -electron character excited occupation lagging behind that of the d -electron character, leading to substantial demagnetization of both species while leaving the global moment almost unchanged. For x &gt; 0.33, this results in the creation of an ultrafast ferromagnetic (FM) transient by the end of the laser pulse with the Gd demagnetization rate slower than that of Fe. For all concentrations, the Gd moments begin to rotate from their ground state orientations developing in-plane moments of between 0.2 and 0.5 μ B . Thus, the ultrafast spin dynamics of the material captures three important ingredients of all optical switching that occurs at much later (picosecond) times: (i) the development of a FM transient, (ii) the different rates of demagnetization of Fe and Gd, and (iii) the breaking of the collinear symmetry of the ground state. Furthermore, several predictions are made about the behavior of Fe–Gd alloys that can be experimentally tested and can lead to a spin-filtering device.},

  abstract     = {ZnO and SnO 2 are wide bandgap semiconductors, which have great potential for UV detectors, light emitting diodes, and other optoelectronic devices. The performance of these devices is significantly affected by exciton binding energies of oxides. Although bandgaps of ZnO and SnO 2 are similar, their exciton binding energies differ by a large amount, because it was reported experimentally that the exciton binding energy of SnO 2 is 130 meV, which is higher than that of ZnO with 60 meV. On the other hand, because ZnO has higher ionicity and a large overlap of electrons and hole wavefunctions, it is expected that it should have larger exciton binding energy than that of SnO 2 [Dvorak et al. , Phys. Rev. Lett. 110 , 016402 (2013)]. Therefore, there is a controversy for relative magnitudes of the exciton binding energy between SnO 2 and ZnO. Here, based on accurate GW + Bethe–Salpeter equation calculations, we clarify that the exciton binding energy of SnO 2 is less than that of ZnO, following the general rule; therefore, more experimental study should be carried out to verify our predictions. We expect that this fundamental understanding of the relative magnitude of exciton binding energies will be useful for prospective applications of ZnO and SnO 2 in optoelectronic devices.},

  abstract     = {A cost-effective fabrication process is developed to improve the power performance of AlGaN/GaN High Electron Mobility Transistors (HEMTs). This process uses nitrogen ion (N + ) implantation to form multiple parallel nanoribbons on AlGaN/GaN heterostructures, with a thin buffer layer (AlGaN/GaN NR-HEMTs). The stopping and range of ions in matter simulations of the N + implantation combined with measured current-field characteristics reveal a good electrical isolation beneath the two-dimensional electron gas, resulting in substantial increase in the breakdown field of the NR-HEMTs, when compared to conventional AlGaN/GaN HEMTs. The fabricated AlGaN/GaN NR-HEMTs performed (i) an ON/OFF current ratio more than two orders of magnitude larger and (ii) a buffer leakage current more than one order of magnitude weaker than that of the conventional AlGaN/GaN HEMTs. The on-resistance, R ON , and series resistance, R S , of AlGaN/GaN NR-HEMTs are both reduced by one order of magnitude when compared to those of the conventional AlGaN/GaN HEMTs. These have boosted the drive current density by up to 435\%. Furthermore, we have found that the architecture of the AlGaN/GaN NR-HEMTs reduces the destructive impact of electron traps in the device. An optimized AlGaN/GaN NR-HEMT exhibited a better electrostatic integrity, a subthreshold slope of ∼210 mV/dec instead of 730 mV/dec for a conventional GaN HEMT. A higher linearity in the transconductance, g m , of NR-HEMTs is observed, twice of that of a conventional GaN HEMT. These results demonstrate the great interest of developed process technology of NR-HEMTs for high-power switching applications.},

  abstract     = {Traditional infrared semiconductors with direct narrow bandgaps, such as HgCdTe, InGaAs, and lead salts (PbS, PbSe, and PbTe), have been commercialized for decades in various infrared technologies, such as night vision, military communication, and health monitoring. However, traditional infrared (specifically middle- and long-wave infrared) semiconductors suffer from serious noise generation via thermal excitation and external current bias. Although thermal infrared detectors can operate at room temperature, their response speed is very slow, typically on the order of milliseconds or worse, which limits their applications. Herein, we reinvent a classical lead salt semiconductor (PbS) as a room temperature, high speed, and high-detectivity infrared detector. The detection is operated via the self-driven (no bias voltage necessary) photothermoelectric (PTE) effect with a response time reaching 500 ns (limited by the measurement setup)—three orders of magnitude faster than commercial PTE and photoconductive PbS detectors. Furthermore, the physical principle of hot-carrier-dominated heat energy conversion is proposed to understand the unconventional ultrafast response behavior. Combined with high sensitivity at room temperature (noise equivalent power 0.3 pW Hz −1/2 ) and broadband detection range (0.4–2.3 μ m), this hot carrier makes the traditional commercial semiconductor PbS applicable to a class of infrared detection applications.},

  abstract     = {Low direct-current (DC) conductivity is one of the most desired characteristics for crosslinked polyethylene (XLPE) as a high-voltage DC cable insulation material. In this Letter, a correlation between the DC conductivity and cross-linking characteristics of XLPE-polystyrene (PS) composites at 50 °C was studied. Experimental results show that by adjusting the cross-linking structure, different trap distribution characteristics for XLPE-PS composites were realized. With the increase in the cross-linking agent content, DC conductivities of XLPE-PS composites tend to decrease, and the introduced average trap depth increases correspondingly. An increase of 0.07 eV for average charge trap depth in XLPE-PS composites could be acquired in the test range. It is considered that the increase in the average trap depth reduces the carrier mobility, contributing to the reduction of DC conductivity for XLPE-PS composites. Thus, the DC conductivity and average trap depth of XLPE composites show a strong relevance. The results suggest that the interaction between PS particles and the matrix introduced by cross-linking plays a dominant role in determining the charge conduction for XLPE-PS composites.},

In this work, the degeneracy of the valence bands is manipulated by alloying CaCd 2 Sb 2 with CaMg 2 Sb 2 . It is found that the Γ( p xy ) band and the Γ( p z ) band were effectively converged in CaCd 1.5 Mg 0.5 Sb 2 . By further doping Ag at the Cd site, the carrier concentration can be maintained when the alloying concentration varies. The room-temperature Seebeck coefficient increased from ∼150 μ V K −1 in CaCd 2 Sb 2 to ∼190 μ V K −1 in CaCd 1.5 Mg 0.5 Sb 2 when the carrier concentration was maintained at ∼2.5 × 10 19 cm −3 . In addition, Cd/Mg substitutional point defects with substantial atomic mass difference induced significant phonon scattering; thus, a lattice thermal conductivity as low as ∼0.5 W m −1 K −1 was achieved at 750 K. Eventually, a peak zT value of ∼1.3 was realized in CaCd 1.494 Ag 0.006 Mg 0.5 Sb 2 .},

Through photon-energy dependent measurements, the surface state near the Fermi level was detected. By determining the band dispersions, we found that the surface state is topological trivial. Around the surface Brillouin zone center, the surface bands disperse linear-like, forming a band crossing (zero energy gap) point at about 0.2 eV below the Fermi level. In Ta 3 SiTe 6 &#39;s rectangular surface Brillouin zone, the surface bands only cross the Fermi level along one axis, forming two hole-like Fermi pockets near surface Brillouin zone boundaries. Although the observed surface state is not topological, we proposed that its anisotropic Fermi surface topography could be potentially useful for future applications.},

Similarly, exposing these layers to 0.6 Torr O 2 results in a 26\%, 22\%, and &lt;5\% increase in R s . This suggests that adatoms on Cu and Co surfaces considerably disturb the surface potential, leading to diffuse electron scattering and a resulting resistance increase while these effects are negligible for Rh. A similarly small resistivity increase Δ ρ / ρ &lt; 7\% is measured during air exposure of 10-nm-thick epitaxial layers of electronegative metals including Ru, Rh, Ir, W, and Mo, while Δ ρ / ρ increases to 11\%–36\% for more electropositive metals including Cu, Ag, Co, Ni, and Nb. The Δ ρ for Ni, Co, and Nb is larger than what is expected for a complete transition from specular to diffuse surface scattering, indicating a breakdown of the semiclassical Fuchs–Sondheimer model, which needs to be replaced by a two-dimensional conductor description. The measured inverse correlation between electronegativity and Δ ρ / ρ suggests that the magnitude of the surface potential perturbation is the primary parameter affecting electron surface scattering in thin metal layers. More specifically, the charge transfer from electropositive metal surfaces to adatoms perturbs the surface potential and causes electron surface scattering and a resistance increase. Conversely, electronegative metals facilitate smooth surface potentials with specular electron reflection and a minimized resistance increase. They are, therefore, promising as conductors for highly scaled interconnect lines.},

Arbitrary and broadband spatial polarization processing is a key pursuit for vector beam generation, modulation, and detection. Here, we introduce black dye into liquid crystals to form a dichroic medium and imprint high-resolution patterns into the medium via photopatterning. Continuous cylindrical and binary vector beams are freely generated. Switching between a vector beam generator and a high-transmittance homeotropic state can be realized due to the electro-optical tunability of liquid crystals. On the basis of a radial vector beam generator array, the polarization distribution is characterized by calculating the darkest line of each generator. This strategy provides a platform for arbitrary spatial polarization processing and may bring more possibilities for polarization imaging, structured light generation, and materials characterization.},

  abstract     = {Laser ionized liquid has been considered as a promising broadband terahertz (THz) source recently. The ponderomotive force induced dipole model can be used to describe the mechanism of THz generation, implying that the lateral THz emission is stronger than the forward emission. Thus, we systemically investigate the lateral THz emission from laser induced plasma in liquid water line. THz energy about 4.4-times of that from the forward emission is achieved from the lateral emission scheme. Results on the angular distribution of coherent THz radiation indicate that the maximal THz radiation falls between 120° and 150° with respect to the pump laser propagation direction. Moreover, dependence of collected THz energy on the relative position between laser focus and the water line shows a counterintuitive “two peaks” trend, which can be explained by the impact of cylindrical water surface on the divergence angle of the generated THz wave. Therefore, the enhancement in THz energy can be attributed to the high-efficiency lateral collection scheme and the tradeoff between the THz wave converging effect of the cylindrical surface and the absorption in water. Our work helps to further optimize the coupling efficiency of generated THz wave out of liquid samples.},

To address this, low-precision DNN implementations based on IMC (in-memory computing) approaches utilizing NVM (non-volatile memory) devices have been explored recently. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate a dual-configuration XNOR (exclusive NOR) IMC bitcell. The bitcell is realized using fabricated 1T-1R SiO x RRAM (resistive random access memory) arrays. We have analyzed the trade-off in terms of circuit-overhead, energy, and latency for both IMC bitcell configurations. Furthermore, we demonstrate the functionality of the proposed IMC bitcells with mobilenet architecture based BNNs (binarized neural networks). The network is trained on VWW (visual wake words) and CIFAR-10 datasets, leading to an inference accuracy of ≈ 80.3\% and ≈ 84.9\%, respectively.

  abstract     = {Memristors based on oxide tunnel junctions are promising candidates for energy efficient neuromorphic computing. However, the low power sensing of the nonvolatile resistive state is an important challenge. We report the optically induced sensing of the resistive state of a memristor based on a La 0.7 Sr 0.3 MnO 3 /BaTiO 3 /In 2 O 3 :SnO 2 (90:10) heterostructure with a 3 nm thick BaTiO 3 ferroelectric barrier. The nonvolatile memristive response originates from the modulation of an interfacial Schottky barrier at the La 0.7 Sr 0.3 MnO 3 /BaTiO 3 interface, yielding robust intermediate memristive states. The Schottky barrier produces a photovoltaic response when illuminated with a 3.3 eV UV LED, which depends on the state. The open circuit voltage V oc correlates linearly with the resistance of each state, enabling active sensing of the memristive state at light power densities as low as 20 mW/cm 2 and temperatures up to 100 K. This opens up avenues for the efficient and minimally invasive readout of the memory states in hybrid devices.},

  abstract     = {Field-effect transistor (FET)-based biosensors have demonstrated highly sensitive label-free detection of a plethora of biomolecules as next-generation binding assays. While the dose–response curve of affinity-based binding assays generally has a nonlinear shape, any distortion contributed by the FET transducers has not been well understood. In this paper, we show that the signal transduction of FET sensors plays an important role in shaping their dose–response curves when operating in the nonlinear screening regime. We have found that the nonlinearity arising from the counterion screening in the electrical double layer could distort the relationship between the device flatband voltage shift and the analyte concentrations in (1) lowering its half-maximal response concentration as well as the sensitive detection range and (2) expanding its dynamic range. Negligence of such nonlinearity would introduce errors in the extracted affinity properties of the analyte–receptor pair. This work provides useful guidelines for designing FET-based binding assays and interpreting their measurement data.},

  abstract     = {A two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in (Al, Ga) N/GaN heterojunction (AlGaN/GaN) is a key factor that affects the performance of GaN-based high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) devices. Previous studies have shown that the ferroelectric polarization can effectively control the density of the 2DEG at the AlGaN/GaN interface; however, the correlation between two-dimensional distribution of ferroelectric polarization (i.e., ferroelectric domains) and its ability to confine the 2DEG is yet to be investigated. In this work, ferroelectric domain-induced modulation of the 2DEG in the AlGaN/GaN heterostructure was characterized using microscopic as well as local transport measurement techniques. The results suggest direct evidence for effective ferroelectric domain engineering in GaN HEMTs, as predicted by theoretical calculations. Additionally, a prototype device was fabricated, where gating was realized by utilizing the polarization of the ferroelectric domain. Considering the nonvolatile and reconfigurable advantages of a ferroelectric domain, the E-mode, D-mode, and even multi-channel output characteristics were realized in the same device by artificially engineered ferroelectric domain structures. These results offer a promising solution for the contradiction between the 2DEG density and gate controllability in GaN HEMTs, thereby showing a great potential of GaN radio frequency devices with further scaled gate lengths down to a few nanometers in the future.},

The fine control of the NiO x film enables the external quantum efficiencies of the PQLEDs to increase from 1.5\% to 9.7\%, and the lifetime of T 50 at 400 cd/m 2 is prolonged by about 13 times with the cooperation of dual HIL. The improved performance of PQLEDs is attributed to the achievement of favorable carrier transport balance and effective radiative recombination in the emission layer. We highlight the critical role of carriers balance via the HIL engineering on both the efficiency and stability of PQLEDs.},

The existence of coherently coupled weak resonances (CCWRs) makes it difficult to achieve optimal broadband sound absorption, especially in the presence of complex and aperiodic components. Here, we present and experimentally implement a machine learning-assisted subwavelength sound absorber with CCWRs using an improved Gauss–Bayesian model, which exhibits flexible, high-efficient, and broadband properties at low frequencies ( 0.9) from 229 to 457 Hz. The optimal configuration of sound spectrum characteristics and the unit cell structure can be confirmed flexibly. Good agreement between numerical and experimental results verifies the effectiveness of the proposed method. To further exhibit broadband and multiparameter optimization, a nine-unit sound absorber (27 parameters) is numerically simulated and shown to achieve high acoustic absorption and a relatively broad bandwidth (44.8\%). Our work lifts the restrictions on analytic models of complex and aperiodic components with coherent coupling effects, paving the way for combining machine learning with the optimal design of metamaterials.},

In this work, we have studied structural transformation from a three-dimensional amorphous phase of non-interacting Se chains into a 1D vdW crystal using x-ray absorption spectroscopy. The crystallization process and establishment of vdW interaction are accompanied by elongation and weakening of covalent Se-Se bonds. We have found a unique signature in the x-ray absorption near-edge structure spectrum that is associated with vdW bonds and can be used to identify the formation of the latter. We believe that a similar approach can be used to study other 1D vdW solids, such as transition-metal trichalcogenides, and particularly stress the usefulness of x-ray absorption spectroscopy to identify vdW bonds.},

  abstract     = {Organic materials have attracted considerable attention for thermoelectric (TE) applications. Given their potential as wearable power generators, there is an urgent need to develop organic TE materials that possess superior electronic properties as well as excellent mechanical and environmental stability. Here, we develop paper-based TE materials using the poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene): polystyrenesulfonate (PEDOT:PSS), graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs), and a starch-based biopolymer as a binder for GNPs. The device fabrication consists of spraying the biopolymer/GNP ink onto the cellulose paper followed by spraying the PEDOT:PSS solution. Further enhancement of TE properties was obtained by adding an ionic liquid (IL), bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt to the PEDOT:PSS solution. Upon addition of the IL, the electrical conductivity of as-fabricated PEDOT:PSS films increased nearly two orders of magnitude. The electrical conductivity increases with GNPs&#39; content due to formation of an effective electrical percolation network. Interestingly, incorporating GNPs simultaneously improves the Seebeck coefficient. Raman measurements suggest that the concurrent enhancement of the Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity might be related to the chemical bonding between the conducting polymer chains and the filler. In addition, these composites display remarkable flexibility at various bending angles and environmental stability without losing their original conductivity after three months of exposure to ambient conditions.},

  abstract     = {The flexoelectric effect corresponds to the linear variation of the electric polarization of a material subjected to a strain gradient (i.e., during its mechanical bending). Unlike piezoelectricity, it also exists in non-centrosymmetric materials. Furthermore, due to the gradient term, its magnitude can increase as the size of the system decreases. Thanks to this effect, nanoscale systems could be used to harvest thermal vibration energy to power a microdevice. These could be multi-wall carbon nanotubes since they are known to bend easily in an elastic manner. However, it is very challenging to experimentally measure the flexoelectric behavior of a single multi-wall carbon nanotube due to its small size (less than 50 nm in diameter), to the low level of induced charges, and to the need to vary the imposed stress. To progress in this direction, a six-degree-of-freedom robot with a fiber tip is used inside a dual-beam microscope to pick up few single carbon nanotubes from a tangle and connect them to the fiber tip. After ion-soldering the two tips, each carbon nanotube is dynamically bent several times while monitoring the brightness of the bending area and its effective radius of curvature. This allowed us to demonstrate qualitatively the flexoelectric effect at the level of a single multi-wall carbon nanotube.},

Thanks to the merit of the SC-LNO thin film, our memristor reveals excellent uniformity and reproducibility with low cycle-to-cycle variation (down to 1.82\% for I peak and 2.94\% for V valley ).

  abstract     = {We investigate local THz field generation using spintronic THz emitters to enhance the resolution for micrometer-sized imaging. Far-field imaging with wavelengths above 100 μ m limits the resolution to this order of magnitude. By using optical laser pulses as a pump, THz field generation can be confined to the area of laser beam focusing. The divergence of the generated THz beam due to laser beam focusing requires the imaged object to be close to the generation spot at a distance below the THz field wavelength. We generate THz-radiation by fs-laser pulses in CoFeB/Pt heterostructures, based on spin currents, and detect them by commercial low-temperature grown-GaAs (LT-GaAs) Auston switches. The spatial resolution of THz radiation is determined by applying a 2D scanning technique with motorized stages allowing step sizes in the sub-micrometer range. Within the near-field limit, we achieve spatial resolution in the dimensions of the laser spot size on the micrometer scale. For this purpose, a gold test pattern is evaporated on the spintronic emitter separated by a 300 nm SiO 2 spacer layer. Moving these structures with respect to the femtosecond laser spot, which generates THz radiation, allows for resolution determination. The knife-edge method yields a full-width half-maximum beam diameter of 4.9 ± 0.4 μ m at 1 THz ⁠ . The possibility to deposit spintronic emitter heterostructures on simple glass substrates makes them attractive candidates for near-field imaging in many imaging applications.},

  abstract     = {The synergistic effect of the carrier velocity and density is studied to understand chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) in helical spin-filtering devices. Unlike most previous theories that emphasize the asymmetry between the transmitted spin-related electron densities, we reveal two types of dynamics for the spin polarization: (i) spin conversion dynamics between spin-up and spin-down electrons and (ii) spin-dependent transport dynamics leading to different propagation velocities of spin-up and spin-down electrons. The former dominate in the high-bias-voltage regime by electron tunneling, while the latter dominate in the low-bias-voltage regime by polaron transport. Our theory reproduces well the recently observed extreme spin polarization under a certain bias voltage in a helical spin-filtering device, and it provides a general microscopic perspective for reconsidering CISS.},

Resistance oscillations with a MTJ barrier thickness of 0.3 nm were significantly enhanced compared to those of a Fe/MgO/Fe(001) MTJ, resulting in a large TMR oscillation peak-to-valley difference of 125\% at RT. The differential conductance ( dI/dV ) spectra were symmetric with bias polarity, and the spectrum in the parallel magnetization state at low temperature demonstrates significant peaks within broad local minima at |V| = 0.2–0.6 V, indicating improved barrier interfaces by the Mg 4 Al-O x barrier. This study demonstrates that TMR ratios in Fe(001)-MTJs can still be improved.},

The linear terahertz linear component of the pulse induces adiabatic intra-band evolution, serving to link an arbitrary point k 0 to one of the high symmetry K points over a single pulse cycle. The circularly polarized component induces interband transitions at one of the two inequivalent K points that, due to the linear pulse, results at full cycle in laser excited charges at the desired k-vector k 0 and not at the high symmetry K point. We, thus, theoretically predict a generalized form of the spin-valley locking in dichalcogenides, opening the way to the preparation of arbitrary momenta and spin specified excited states at ultrafast time scales.},

  abstract     = {Zinc antimonide (ZnSb) and its solid solution with CdSb are well-known p-type thermoelectric materials. Electrical transport properties of doped ZnSb exhibit certain anomalies: (a) non-monotonic changes in the electrical properties with temperature and (b) occurrence of a reversible hysteresis loop in electrical transport data when thermally cycled. The objective of this study was to investigate the underlying cause of these behaviors. Ag-doped compositions of (Zn 0.625 Cd 0.375 ) 1−δ Ag δ Sb (δ = 0, 0.02, and 0.04) solid solutions have been prepared by melt-synthesis—rapid compaction—annealing process. Measurement of the electrical conductivity ( ⁠ σ ⁠ ), Seebeck coefficient ( ⁠ S ⁠ ), and Hall coefficient ( ⁠ R H ⁠ ) (room temperature to 673 K) displayed the characteristic hysteresis behavior on thermal cycling along with the unusual rise in the charge carrier concentration ( n ) around 500 K. Aside from that, it was found that cooling rates dramatically influence room temperature properties. Analysis of synchrotron-based x-ray diffraction data by Rietveld refinement indicates that Ag-doping results in the formation of Zn vacancies [Vzn]. Also, a sharp drop in the concentration of Zn vacancies, [Vzn] around 550 K was observed and could be correlated with the changes in n values. This correlation between changes in [Vzn] and n has been used to explain the observed electrical anomalies, which are a consequence of the repeated annihilation and creation of Zn vacancies with temperature changes.},

The nonlinear coefficient n 2 is found to be independent of Sn or Fe doping, and the maximum value of n 2 is about 4 × 10 −19 m 2 /W when the photon energy is near E g /2. However, we observe that Fe doping can significantly enhance the γ value in the range of 540–600 nm (near E g /2) while doping has negligible impact on γ for wavelength larger than 620 nm. Femtosecond pump-probe measurements show that Fe doping induced a fast (∼50 ps) carrier decay process after photo excitation, which could be attributed to the Fe induced deep trap states. We obtain three-photon figures of merit that allow operational intensities up to 100 GW/cm 2 .

The estimated film thicknesses corresponded with those determined using scanning electron microscopy. The optical constants of the films were found to be significantly dependent on their respective atomic compositions, which shows a transition from the semiconducting to the insulating phase in BN films in response to the deposition conditions. Ion bombardment during the film growth induced an increase in the refractive index along with an increase in the amount of the sp 3 phase.

Thermoelectric-based temperature sensing, cooling as well as energy harvesting could be useful methods to reach reliable device performance with stable operating temperatures. For these applications, complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS)-compatible and application ready thin films are needed and have to be optimized. In this work, we investigate the power factor of different phosphorous-doped silicon germanium (SiGe) films fabricated in a 300 mm CMOS-compatible cleanroom. For the thermoelectric characterization, we used a custom-built setup to determine the Seebeck coefficient and sheet resistance. For sample preparation, we used low pressure chemical vapor deposition with in situ doping and subsequent rapid thermal annealing on 300 mm wafers. Thin film properties, such as film thickness (12–250 nm), elemental composition, crystallinity, and microstructure, are studied via spectroscopic ellipsometry, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction, atomic force microscopy, and TEM. The SiGe-based thin films vary in the ratio of Si to Ge to P and doping concentrations. A power factor of 0.52 mW/m K 2 could be reached by doping variation. Our results show that SiGe is a very attractive CMOS-compatible material on the 300 mm wafer level and is immediately ready for production of thermoelectric embedded applications.},

The epitaxial buffer layers for the growing GaAs 1−x Bi x layer were prepared with either a compressive strain (as it is commonly done) or a tensile strain: The latter case has been proven to be a strategy that allows us to obtain a better crystalline quality [Tisbi et al. , Phys. Rev. Appl. 14 , 014028 (2020)]. A characteristic, well defined anisotropy signal below 2.5 eV is demonstrated to be connected to the presence of Bi and, in particular, to the strain produced in the sub-surface region by the voluminous Bi atoms. The amplitude of this signal directly relates to the Bi quantity, while its sign gives information about the local clustering/ordering of Bi atoms in the grown sample. We conclude that the detailed interpretation of RAS signatures and the knowledge of their origin offer the opportunity to utilize this technique to follow in real time the GaAsBi growth either in MBE or in metal organic vapor phase epitaxy processes.},

Such quantum states of MnBi 2 Te 4 have been intensively studied mainly in atomically thin exfoliated samples, yet thin film samples with critically tuned Fermi level would be indispensable for further pursuit of topological functionality in MnBi 2 Te 4 and related heterointerfaces. Here, we report on fabrication of an Sb-doped MnBi 2 Te 4 thin film by molecular beam epitaxy and their transport properties. The Sb-substitution induces the change in the carrier type and the subsequent increase in resistivity, demonstrating the tuning of the Fermi level ( E F ) across the bulk bandgap and the phase change to the topologically nontrivial phase. The E F is further finely controlled in a field-effect transistor device. We observe the enhancement of the anomalous Hall conductivity at the charge neutral point, confirming the opening of the magnetic exchange gap in surface Dirac states. The precise control of the band structure and the Fermi level in the thin-film form will lead to exploring exotic phenomena based on intrinsic magnetic topological insulators.},

The needed refractive index field is fulfilled just by slightly varying the local thickness of plates. The generated focusing effect has a broad band from 5 to 100 kHz and shows robustness against changes on structural shapes and thicknesses of the lens. This work provides insight to study nontrivial gravitational phenomena analogically using conventional solid structures and may suggest a possible route to regulate elastic waves arbitrarily.},

We analyze plasmonic structures composed of rectangular apertures rotating in 2D space with given rates, which couple to specific plasmon trajectories. We experimentally demonstrate the control of plasmonic propagation through premeditated design of the gratings, which interact with linear, spin, and orbital angular momentum of light. We show that these trajectories can be selected purely through momenta modulation with numerous degrees of freedom for a given structure geometry. Moreover, it is shown that the symmetry of the final plasmonic distribution is defined by selecting specific rotation rates, and that it can be different from the original grating symmetry.},

  abstract     = {In nonlinear optics, significant effort is concentrated on improving the strength and efficiency of interactions; however, experimentally investigating nonlinear materials is a complex, time-consuming, and costly investment. Moreover, it is often challenging to isolate, study, and optimize material parameters in an experiment due to complexities in the growth process. Recently, epsilon-near-zero materials have received a great deal of attention as promising nonlinear optical materials, but like many up-and-coming materials, the ability to explore and optimize their properties has been challenging. Here, we establish a framework to rapidly evaluate the performance of nonlinear epsilon-near-zero materials for both inter- and intraband effects in silico , requiring only an energy–momentum (E– k ) diagram, linear optical properties, and experimental conditions. Measured nonlinear reflection and transmission in gallium-doped zinc oxide films are compared to the numerical framework for both intra- and interband excitation to verify accuracy across wavelength and irradiance while two figures of merit (FoMs) are introduced to quickly evaluate the performance of films without a full numerical framework. This capability is used to predict the performance of highly doped gallium nitride, cadmium oxide, zinc oxide, and indium tin oxide films, and efficient intra- and interband operation conditions are identified. Through this numerical framework and the FoMs, the exploration of unstudied epsilon-near-zero materials is enabled without the need for a nonlinear experiment, thereby accelerating the search for more efficient nonlinear materials and excitation conditions.},

This Perspective specifically focuses on applications of thermal management strategies of electronics, especially power electronics.

In this paper, we study a compact high-yield and high-angular-fluence neutron source particularly suitable for high-energy neutron applications utilizing the breakup reaction of laser-driven deuterons in a 9 Be converter. The neutron generation scaling from such a reaction is used to guide the choice and optimization of the acceleration process for bulk ions in a low density CD 2 foam. In particular, the collisionless shock acceleration mechanism is exploited with proper choice in the laser and target parameter space to accelerate these ions toward energies above the temperature of the distribution. Particle-in-cell and Monte Carlo simulations are coupled here to investigate this concept and possible adverse effects as well as the contribution from the surface ions accelerated and the optimal converter design. The simulation results indicated that our design can be a practical approach to increase both the neutron yield and angular fluence of laser-driven neutron sources, reaching &gt;10 11 neutron/pulse (or &gt;10 8 neutron/J) and &gt;10 11 neutron/sr (or &gt;10 8 neutron/sr/J) with present-day kJ-class high-power lasers.

Herein, we report CrTe-based ferromagnetic semi-metals as an exceptional example showing both desirable magnetic entropy change (−Δ S M ) and promising thermoelectric figure of merit ( ZT ) near room temperature. A proper amount (9 mol.\%) of Cr deficiency is found to stabilize the hexagonal structure of CrTe. Cr 0.91 Te displays a maximum −Δ S M value of ∼2.4 J/Kg·K under an applied magnetic field of 5 T around its Curie temperature ( T C ) of 332 K and a strikingly large ZT value of 1.2 × 10 −2 at 300 K (two to four orders of magnitude larger than any other ferromagnetic compounds reported so far). The exceptional thermoelectric performance in such a semi-metal is believed to originate from the inherently strong electron–phonon–spin interactions: magnon-drag effect mediated Seebeck coefficient enhancement and phonon–spin coupling induced thermal conductivity reduction. The introduction of antiferromagnetic CrSb not only systematically decreases T C of Cr 0.91 Te down to or even below room temperature but also boosts its thermoelectromagnetic properties. Specifically, Cr 0.91 Te 0.9 Sb 0.1 obtains a maximum −Δ S M value of ∼2.6 J/Kg·K @ 5 T around T C = 315 K and a ZT value of 2.0 × 10 −2 at 300 K, which represent 8\% and 75\% improvement over pristine Cr 0.91 Te, respectively.

  abstract     = {Paraelectric-ferroelectric-antiferroelectric (PE-FE-AFE) phase transitions induced by external stimulus (temperature, electric field, and hydrostatic pressure) usually produce exotic performances in functional ceramics. This Letter reports an isothermal phase transition in (Pb 0.95 Ba 0.05 )ZrO 3 ceramics in the proximity of separated PE-FE and FE-AFE phase boundaries as extended waiting time. Through an isothermal process, PE ( Pm 3 ¯ m )-to-FE ( R3cH ) and FE-to-AFE ( Pbam ) phase transformations occur within several minutes (with different transition degrees). This is in contrast to the wide recognition of ultrafast and time-independent ferroelectric transitions. In situ Raman spectra analysis unveils the sluggish growth of FE and AFE phases out of the corresponding parent matrix. Finally, the Landau theory analysis is proposed to explain the isothermal phase transition among PE-FE-AFE phases. This work will refresh the wisdom of phase transitions in functional ceramics.},

  abstract     = {SnSe 2 has been of great interest as the n-type semiconductor exhibits high thermoelectric (TE) performance. Because material&#39;s thermoelectric properties are highly anisotropic, controlling the crystallographic orientation in the microstructure is one of the key factors for enhancing the TE performance. However, reports of SnSe 2 with preferred crystallographic orientation have been limited due to the difficulty in fabrication. As a solution for this challenge, in this study, we report solution-processed fabrication of textured SnSe 2 thin films. Following heat treatment optimization, the thin films possessed exceptionally strong crystallographic orientation order in the a–b plane, as demonstrated with x-ray diffraction analyses. Moreover, controlled defect formation through processing conditions realizes high electron concentrations of an order of ∼10 20 cm −3 . In particular, we demonstrate that the microstructure of the SnSe 2 thin films determined their electronic transport properties, where the electron mobility increases with stronger crystallographic orientation. Finally, the thin film with the optimal structure exhibits the enhanced thermoelectric power factor of 3.69 μ W cm −1 K −2 . Our findings will offer a way to enhance the thermoelectric and electronic properties of highly anisotropic materials.},

  abstract     = {Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is a well-known water retention agent in biomedical products, the hydration efficiency of which is affected by its molecular weight. Using a broadband dielectric spectroscopy (100 MHz–18 THz), the hydration state of PEG aqueous solutions with various molecular weights was quantitatively evaluated. As the molecular weight increases, the restriction strength of hydration water increases in potency, while the number of hydration water molecules decreases. Owing to the opposite changes in hydration number and restriction strength, the measured collective hydrogen bond (HB) strength shows negligible molecular weight dependence. PEG with larger Mw produces a more heterogenous HB network. The internal folding and twining caused by the growth of the PEG chain obstruct the proper exposure of hydrophilic part of the monomer producing less hydration waters. The evaluation result supports an application of PEGs with low molecular weight in contact lens package solutions.},

  abstract     = {Ternary bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells have energy offsets between multiple donors and acceptors. In such bi-continuous percolating films, electron carriers mainly transport in acceptor materials, and hole carriers typically transport in donor materials. Changing the third component of additional donors or acceptors is a common method to fine-tune the transport properties in ternary BHJs. Experimentally, although there are some empirical guidelines for the mobility evaluation, a clear charge transporting model has still not been fully established in multi-component BHJ films. Herein, we observed a general regularity about charge transport that the charge carriers have higher possibilities to transport in polymeric materials even if only low dosage ( 0.15 eV). This work provides a perspective for fine tuning the charge transport property in high-performance ternary organic solar cells.},

In addition, the density functional theory was adopted to establish calculation models and illustrate why single NV color centers prepared by FsLDW have narrower linewidths compared to those of the ion implantation method.

Herein, we fabricated a Pt/hBN/WSe 2 MIS low-dimensional capacitor, followed by UV/ozone-induced oxidation to form a WO X layer, which is an electron-withdrawing agent. Capacitance–voltage (C–V) characteristics before and after p-doping of the WSe 2 layer were compared for different durations of UV/ozone treatments. The C–V behaviors in the pristine condition exhibited ambipolar transport characteristics at both high and low frequencies because of co-existence of electron and hole carriers, which are advantageous for next-generation complementary MIS architectures. When WSe 2 was p-doped, a typical p-type C–V curve with a high-frequency inversion region was observed, because the minority carriers (electrons) were unavailable. The frequency dispersions and ratios of the current to pristine hole concentrations as well as holes to electrons at different p-doping concentrations were analyzed. Finally, the controllability of the charge-transfer doping method was confirmed by chemically removing the WO X layer. The understanding of controllable and damage-free doping mechanisms in ambipolar vdW semiconductors is expected to help enhance electronic device performances at the atomic thickness.},

In the nonmagnetic state, a strongly anisotropic band structure was observed, in agreement with its anticipated one-dimensional crystal geometry. Based on Wannier functions, we found that the four electrons of the 5 d Os atom form a low-spin S = 1 state, with a large crystal field between the d x z / y z and d xy orbitals, corresponding to a strong Jahn–Teller distortion ( ⁠ Q 3 &lt; 0 ⁠ ). As a consequence, the magnetic properties are mainly contributed by the d x z / y z states. Furthermore, when a Mott gap develops after the introduction of the Hubbard U and Hund coupling J , we found that the staggered spin order is the most likely magnetic state, namely, spins arranged as (↑-↓-↑-↓) with π wavevector along the chain. In addition, the energy differences between various spin states are small, suggesting a weak magnetic exchange coupling along the chain.

Crystal structure analysis revealed that the obtained (Bi,K)TiO 3 films had a polar-axis orientation attributable to the matching of the in-plane lattice with the SrRuO 3 underlayer. Large coherent displacement of A-site ions along the polar direction observed by transmission electron microscopy may have induced the large tetragonal distortion of c / a = 1.046. The dielectric constant was about 100 and was almost frequency independent in the range of 10 3 –10 5 Hz, while the dielectric loss, tan δ , was below 5\%. Well-saturated ferroelectric polarization−electric field ( P − E ) hysteresis loops were observed, and the remanent polarization ( P r ) was 84 μ C/cm 2 . In addition, the effective piezoelectric constant, d 33,eff. , was estimated to be 85 pm/V by time-resolved x-ray diffraction measured under an applied electric field.

Similar to transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), TMTCs often host charge density waves (CDWs) and superconductivity, but unlike TMDCs, atomic chains in the crystal structure give rise to quasi one-dimensional (quasi 1D) conduction. ZrTe 3 features the CDW below T CDW = 63 K and filamentary superconductivity below 2 K that can be enhanced by pressure or chemical substitution. Here, we report the presence of mixed valent Zr 2+ and Zr 4+ atoms in ZrTe 3 crystals that are reduced by doping in ZrTe 3− x Se x and Zr 1− y Hf y Te 3 . Superconductivity is enhanced via disorder in Te2-Te3 atomic chains that are associated with CDW formation. Hf substitution on the Zr atomic site enhances T CDW due to unperturbed Te2-Te3 chain periodicity and enhanced electron-phonon coupling. Weak electronic correlations in ZrTe 3− x Se x are likely governed by the lattice contraction effects.},

  abstract     = {Rare earth (RE)–transition metal (TM) ferrimagnetic thin films have attracted significant interest for their broad range of functionalities associated with the reduced net magnetization. Here, we study the magnetic properties of Tb-based RE–TM ferrimagnetic [Tb x (FeCo) 1−x ] thin films. We find that the Tb concentration at which the magnetic moments of the RE- and TM- sublattices compensate increases with decreasing film thickness when the films are grown on Pt underlayers. For the thinnest TbFeCo films (1.5 nm-thick), the magnetic compensation is not observed at room temperature, suggesting that the Tb atoms do not contribute to the magnetization. In these thin films, the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) increases when a thin Co layer is inserted, while it drops to zero when a thin Tb layer is inserted. Such contrasting behavior reveals that the PMA originates from the Pt/Co interface. The Tb concentration at which magnetic compensation occurs decreases when the underlayer is changed from Pt to Ta. We infer that Tb becomes magnetically inactive due to intermixing with the Pt underlayer, causing the reduction in PMA.},

Despite progress in several fields of physics and engineering, the realization of artificial neural networks, which combine high operating speeds with fast and low-energy adaptability, remains a challenge. Here, we demonstrate an opto-magnetic neural network capable of learning and classification of digitized 3 × 3 characters exploiting local storage in the magnetic material. Using picosecond laser pulses, we find that micrometer sized synapses absorb well below 100 picojoule per synapse per laser pulse, with favorable scaling to smaller spatial dimensions. We, thus, managed to combine the speed and low-dissipation of optical networks with the low-energy adaptability and non-volatility of magnetism, providing a promising approach to fast and energy-efficient neuromorphic computing.},

Here, we report the realization of PMA in the W buffered CoFeB/MgO stack by inserting a thin Zr dusting layer between CoFeB and MgO layers. An ultra-high thermal stability of PMA in the W/CoFeB/Zr/MgO stack is observed, which is robust upon annealing at 600 °C. The establishment of PMA in W/CoFeB/Zr/MgO is due to the formation of an interface layer between CoFeB and MgO doped with oxidized Zr. After annealing at 540 °C, the magnetic interfacial anisotropy density reaches 3.08 erg/cm 2 , which is much higher than those in previous reports. The results suggest that the W/CoFeB/Zr/MgO stack with extra high annealing stability is a potential candidate to achieving the practical application of spin-logic device that is compatible with the mature CMOS integrated techniques.},

Our calculated results suggest that the MTJ has a giant tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) as large as 10 10\% and a near perfect (100\%) spin injection efficiency (SIE).

Two different reset modes (progressive reset and abrupt reset) of RRAM have been observed previously, the former showing good uniformity but small switching window, while the latter having large switching window but poor stability and high power consumption. To overcome these limitations, an approach was proposed to control the formation and fracture of conductive filaments with interface engineering, specifically by adding a SiO 2 limiting layer and MoS 2 quantum dots (QDs). Modified with a SiO 2 /MoS 2 QD hybrid structure, the Al 2 O 3 -based RRAM transforms from progressive reset mode to abrupt reset mode. The insertion not only expands the switching window by more than 100 times with excellent readability but also dramatically reduces the power consumption (&lt;5 μ W), accompanied by extremely high uniformity and reliability, which demonstrates significant potential for nonvolatile memory application. Meanwhile, the design viewpoint of combining functional layers with quantum dots provides an excellent strategy for enhancing RRAM performance in the future.},

This yields detailed information about anharmonic processes in the crystal. For the two dominant phonon modes for each of the two Raman-active phonon mode symmetries ( ⁠ A 1 g and E g ), model calculations are performed in order to quantify the contributions of different decay mechanisms. It is shown that our experimental data can be well described by the applied theoretical models. The determined coefficients of cubic and quartic decay for both, phonon energy and linewidth, are compared with those from hexagonal GaN and AlN as well as with those from α -Al 2 O 3 . We observe that for the two selected phonon modes of α -Ga 2 O 3 , the shifts of frequency and broadening under temperature variation are significantly smaller than in GaN and AlN, but similar to α -Al 2 O 3 .},

As the central Al content increases, hole mobility decreases monotonically with two different decreasing slopes in the two Al-content ranges divided at ∼40\%. Tensile strain relaxation is observed when the Al content is higher than ∼40\%, resulting in the increase in overall polarization gradient and, hence, hole concentration. Although the variation of the alloy scattering strength of hole in AlGaN can support the smaller decreasing slope of hole mobility in the Al-content range of &gt;40\%, other factors, such as piezoelectric scattering and bound charge distribution, may need to be considered for a complete interpretation.

Importantly, heavily electron doped SnSe single crystals (∼10 19 cm −3 ) can be obtained by Ce-doping through the Bridgeman method. The electrical conductivity of as-grown SnSe crystals evolves from thermally activated behavior to the metallic one when the electron concentrations are increased from 10 16 to 10 19 cm −3 . Remarkably, the power-factor and electronic quality factor of heavily electron Ce-doped SnSe crystals can reach 1.59 and 0.44 μ W cm −1 K −2 at 300 K, respectively, which is one of the best thermoelectric n-type SnSe.

A sample with depth-dependent material properties introduces a phase velocity dispersion in SAW propagation. Dispersion was measured by a differential technique, which helped to isolate the thermally induced dispersion and eliminate the contributions of other possible sources of dispersion. The dispersion curves were measured at several time instants, which allowed evaluation of the following parameters: thermal diffusivity, temperature dependence of the shear modulus, and the temperature magnitude. The inverse problem was solved by fitting the experimental dispersion curves into the theoretical ones by means of differential evolution techniques.},

The dynamic process behind the improvement is interpreted by an assumptive leakage-assisted electrochemical mechanism. In addition to improved retention, analog switching with a large dynamic range, superior linearity and symmetry, and low variation has been achieved using identical voltage pulses. Based on the experimental data, a nearly ideal recognition accuracy of 98\% has been demonstrated by simulations using the handwritten digit data sets.

  abstract     = {A hybrid acoustic cloaking, composed of binary splitting metasurfaces (BSMs) and near-zero-index metamaterials (NZIMs), is proposed in this paper. The BSMs form acoustic cloaking to make the incident waves diffract around the obstacle, while NZIMs can straightly transfer the incident waves to the input layer of BSMs and control the emergent waves from the output layer of BSMs to propagate along the original incident direction. Due to the tunneling effect, NZIMs compensate for the extra phase from the wave diffraction and improve the efficiency of the acoustic cloaking. As BSMs and NZIMs consist of Helmholtz cavities and cylinders, respectively, the hybrid acoustic cloaking is simple in structure and easy to fabricate with only two-unit cell types per period. Additionally, an optimization method is applied to combine all layers of hybrid acoustic cloaking and realize a better cloaking effect. Using such a way, the normalized efficiency of transmitted waves through the hybrid acoustic cloaking can reach up to 97.2\%, and scattered waves are strongly suppressed. For experimental demonstration, the actual sound field of emergent waves of acoustic cloaking is visualized with schlieren photography, where the cloaking effect is physically validated. This study simplifies the design of acoustic cloaking and provides further expansibility for wavefront transformations.},

We explore stable surface structures with a nanometer scale by the density-functional calculations combined with Bayesian optimization and reach a single structure with satisfactorily low mixing enthalpy among hundreds of thousand possible candidate structures. We find that the obtained structure is free from any postulated high symmetry previously introduced by human intuition, satisfies an electron counting rule locally, and shows a complex adsorbate arrangement, reflecting characteristics of nitride semiconductors. The proposed scheme toward a high-resolution surface phase diagram contributes to a more precise design of GaN epitaxial growth conditions, especially the ratio of Ga and H partial pressures.},

The response of the platinum film to an intense terahertz pulse is similar to the optically induced one and can be described by a two-temperature model with a 20\% larger electron–phonon coupling for the terahertz-driven dynamics compared to the optically induced one, ascribed to an additional nonthermal electron–phonon coupling contribution. Surprisingly, gold films exhibit a much smaller terahertz pulse-induced reflectivity change and with a sign opposite to the optical case. We explain this remarkable observation with field emission of electrons due to Fowler–Nordheim tunneling, enabled in samples with thicknesses below the structural percolation threshold, where nanostructuring promotes near-field enhancement. Our results provide a fundamental insight into the ultrafast processes relevant to modern electro- and magneto-optical applications.},

A dichroic mirror coating on the pump side recycles both luminescence and re-scattered pump light to improve efficacy. As a result, we demonstrated a transmissive LARP converter that achieves 600 lumens with 4.3 W of the blue pump power at an ambient temperature of 25 °C. Due to the strong cavity effect of the highly scattering substrate, a corresponding peak luminance of greater than 700 Cd/mm 2 was observed. At 80 °C ambient, the converter can still achieve greater than 500 lumens and peak luminance exceeding 500 Cd/mm 2 . Simulations based on the optical diffusion approximation are generally in good agreement with data, although they overpredict luminous flux, suggesting the dichroic coating was not optimal and further performance improvements may be achievable.},

The RH sensing experiments showed that the transmission spectra initially blue-shifted as the RH levels increased from 18.5\% to 72.4\% RH, and the sensitivity was −86 pm/\% RH because the effective refractive index of Nb 2 CT X changes, whereas the transmission spectra exhibited a red shift in the RH range of 72.4\%–95.4\% RH with a high sensitivity of 585 pm/\% RH because of the structure of Nb 2 CT X variations.

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 )/Germanium (Ge) heterojunction device with a top gate composed of hexagonal boron nitride and graphene. First, the rectification direction of the device is reversed, and the rectification ratio is modulated from 0.09 to 7.3 by varying the gate voltage from −20 to 20 V. Optoelectronic characterization reveals that the device photoresponsivity and speed can improve by several orders of magnitude when graphene is used as the MoS 2 contact electrode. There is an ambipolar photoresponse behavior in which the photocurrent polarity can be reversed depending on the wavelength of light and gate voltage applied. A conventional positive responsivity of 13.9 A/W is obtained with a 532 nm visible light. In contrast, the device responsivity changes from 33.7 A/W to −128 mA/W as the gate voltage decreases when a 1550 nm infrared light is used. This ambipolar infrared photocurrent is attributed to the competition between the bolometric effect in MoS 2 and photocarrier effect in Ge. In addition, because it has opposite photoresponses at different wavelengths, this device has the potential to be used as a wavelength-distinguishing photodetector. These results offer a strategy for the development of two- and three-dimensional optoelectronic heterostructures.},

Interestingly, exfoliated GaTe displays strong saturable absorption and high negative Kerr nonlinearity in this spectral range. We observed a high nonlinear refraction coefficient, n 2 I , of − ( 7.61 ± 0.07 ) × 10 − 1 cm 2 /GW with near band edge excitation at 700 nm. Additionally, it shows a significant nonlinear absorption coefficient, β ⁠ , of − ( 18.02 ± 0.20 ) × 10 4 cm/GW at an intensity of 40 GW/cm 2 with high modulation depth and low saturation intensity. Transient absorption spectroscopy measurement is also performed to investigate the carrier dynamics of exfoliated GaTe and to identify the physical mechanisms responsible for the optical nonlinearity, such as Pauli blocking. The measured nonlinear optical data of the exfoliated GaTe presented in this Letter will pave the way for potential application in ultrafast photonic devices like optical switching, passive Q-switching, and mode-locking, due to high Kerr nonlinearity and saturable absorption in the femtosecond regime.},

A leading candidate is the negatively charged nitrogen vacancy (NV − ) diamond color center, whose ground spin state can be optically read out, exhibiting long (≈1 ms) coherence times at room temperature. These properties have driven research toward the integration of photonic circuits in the bulk of diamond with the development of techniques allowing fabrication of optical waveguides. In particular, femtosecond laser writing has emerged as a powerful technique, capable of writing light guiding structures with 3D configurations as well as creating NV complexes. In this Perspective, the physical mechanisms behind laser fabrication in diamond will be reviewed.

Discharge emission initiates homogeneously throughout the interelectrode gap with no detectable streamer propagation and then temporally decays in two distinct phases. Plasma emission bands attributed to various electronic transitions are tracked for single discharges in air and N 2 . Spectral filtering of the excited molecular states reveals that the N 2 (C–B) and N 2 (B–A) emission bands evolve in distinct early and late phases, respectively, with a time separation of ∼15–20 ns. Furthermore, significant differences in the temporal dynamics of plasma discharges in air and N 2 are observed. High levels of excited-state atomic oxygen and NO appear after the initial decay of the N 2 (C) state and coincide primarily with the latter phases of plasma evolution in air environments. From temporal traces of discharge emission, the formation and relaxation timescales of the electronically excited states of N 2 are quantified in pure N 2 and air environments with sub-nanosecond resolution.

Here, we describe the production of arrays of divacancy centers in 4H polytype SiC (4H-SiC) by femtosecond laser irradiation and subsequent thermal annealing. We optically characterized these divacancy centers by photoluminescence (PL) confocal mapping using a custom-built confocal microscope. The created divacancy centers show a bright stable emission that depends on the pulse energy of the femtosecond laser. PL spectra of the divacancy centers were collected using micro-Raman spectroscopy at the low temperature of 4.2 K and room temperature. The effect of thermal annealing was studied at various temperatures from 500 °C to 1000 °C and showed that the maximum divacancy center PL intensity was achieved at 800 °C. These and the aforementioned measurements show that the femtosecond laser writing method enables divacancy centers to be accurately positioned in 4H-SiC.},

  abstract     = {We report on the analysis and design of atomically thin graphene resonant nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) that can be engineered to exhibit anharmonicity in the quantum regime. Analysis of graphene two-dimensional (2D) NEMS resonators suggests that with device lateral size scaled down to ∼10–30 nm, restoring force due to the third-order (Duffing) stiffness in graphene NEMS can rise to equal or even exceed the force of linear stiffness, enabling strongly nonlinear NEMS resonators with anharmonic potential energy that produces sufficient deviation from a quantum harmonic spectrum, which is necessary toward realizing NEMS qubits. Furthermore, the calculations provide device design guidelines and scaling of anharmonicity in graphene NEMS to facilitate future fabrication of graphene NEMS qubits with the desired nonlinear dynamical characteristics and performance. The results in this work shall help open possibilities for engineering a new type of qubits based on 2D resonant NEMS, which may offer a much more miniaturized, densely packed, and scalable qubit platform, supplementing today&#39;s mainstream technologies such as superconducting and trapped ion qubits.},

  abstract     = {Biological matter is attracting increasing attention because it shows innovative features that have found several applications in technology, from highly sensitive sensors for medical treatments to devices for energy harvesting. Furthermore, most of its phenomenology remains unclear, thus giving hints for speculative investigations. In this Letter, we explore the possibility to use a well-known photosensitive protein, the Reaction Center of Rhodobacter sphaeroides , to build up an electrical pH sensor, i.e., a device able to change its resistance depending on the pH of the solution in which it crystalizes. By using a microscopic model previously tested on analog proteins, we investigate the electrical response of the reaction center single protein under different conditions of applied bias, showing the feasibility of the bio-rheostat hypothesis. As a matter of fact, the calculated resistance of this protein grows about 100\% when going from a pH = 10 to a pH = 6.5. Moreover, calculations of the current voltage characteristics well agree with available experiments performed with current atomic force microscopy under neutral conditions. All findings are in qualitative agreement with the known role of pH in biochemical activities of reaction center and similar proteins, therefore supporting a proof-of-concept for the development of innovative electron devices based on biomaterials.},

Here, we introduce another absorption loss dimension, conductivity loss, by nano-carbon powders through the carburizing process to ameliorate these metamaterial absorbers; the mechanism based on electromagnetic simulation is also sufficiently demonstrated. Then, we establish a carburizing channel in the Ba 4 Sm 9.33 Ti 18 O 54 ceramics with an appropriate dielectric constant (&lt;80) for verification, and the microwave absorbance can be double improved. Correspondingly, the period is only 1/2 that of the pure ceramic-based one.

The ultra-wide bandgap and low dark current make 4HCB an important candidate for this application. Detectors with two electrode configurations, i.e., sandwiched electrode (SWE) and interdigital electrode (IDE), are fabricated based on 4HCB single crystals and measured under the illumination of 254 nm-UV light. Apparently, the IDE detector exhibits a responsivity R of 14 000 μ A W −1 at a bias voltage of 1000 V, which is 2000 times higher than that of the SWE detector, due to its enhanced photoconductive gain by the surface layer edge states. To explore the possibility for the space UV detection applications in the radiation environment, the effect of neutron radiation on 4HCB detector performance is revealed. The point defects introduced by fast neutrons, mainly H vacancies, dominate the variation of the Fermi energy level and electric properties; however, this effect on photodetection is limited when the neutron flux is below 10 13 n cm −2 .},

The CPGE current in the Bi 2 O 2 Se nanoplate reached 100 nA/W, which is far beyond what has been found in other two-dimensional (2D) materials, e.g., Bi 2 Se 3 , WSe 2 , and Sb 2 Te 3 , as well as some 2D electron systems such as Al x Ga 1- x N/GaN heterostructures, indicating the large spin–orbit coupling (SOC) in inclined Bi 2 O 2 Se. To tune the strength of the SOC, an ionic liquid gate was applied to the Bi 2 O 2 Se nanoplate. The significant increase in the CPGE current that appeared with the application of the positive gate voltage indicates that the gate can further break spatial inversion symmetry, leading to enhanced SOC. Unlike the in-plane Bi 2 O 2 Se, the bottom surface of which has electrostatic interactions with the mica substrate and hence is naturally asymmetric with the top surface, the inclined-grown nanoplate has two Bi 2 O 2 Se-air interfaces. Therefore, the large CPGE current in the inclined Bi 2 O 2 Se shows that strong SOC is intrinsic to the Bi 2 O 2 Se lattice instead of the interfaces, and Bi 2 O 2 Se is a prospective material in the application of spintronic devices.},

However, the simultaneous demands on vibration isolation, low base temperature, precise nano-positioning, and optical access make the construction of a cryo-SNOM a daunting task. Adding to the overhead space required for a cryo-SNOM is the atomic force microscopy control, which predominantly utilizes a laser-based detection scheme for determining the cantilever tapping motion. In this work, we provide an alternative and straightforward route to performing s-SNOM using metal-coated Akiyama probes, where the cantilever tapping motion is detected through a piezoelectric signal. We show that the Akiyama-based cryo-SNOM attains high spatial resolution, good near-field contrast, and is able to perform imaging with a significantly more compact system compared to other cryo-SNOM implementations. Our results firmly establish the potential of s-SNOM based on self-sensing piezo-probes, which can easily accommodate far-infrared wavelengths and high magnetic fields in the future.},

Here, we synthesized small platinum nanoparticles directly onto a mechanical tester and used a modified nanomanipulator to enhance load resolution to the nanonewton scale. We demonstrated the in situ compression of an 11.5-nm platinum nanoparticle with simultaneous high-resolution measurements of load and particle morphology. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed on similarly sized particles to achieve complementary measurements of load and morphology, along with atomic resolution of dislocations. The experimental and simulation results revealed comparable values for the critical resolved shear stress for failure, 1.28 and 1.15 GPa, respectively. Overall, this investigation demonstrated the promise of, and some initial results from, the combination of atomistic simulations and in situ experiments with an unprecedented combination of high spatial resolution and high load resolution to understand the behavior of metal nanoparticles under compression.},

Though investigated from different angles, a factor that is real device-relevant and clearly deserves more attention has largely been overlooked by previous research, namely, the fe-HfO 2 /dielectric interface. Here, we investigate the electronic structures of several typical interfaces formed between ultrathin fe-HfO 2 and oxide dielectrics in the sub-3-nm region. We find that interface formation introduces strong depolarizing fields in fe-HfO 2 , which is detrimental for ferroelectric polarization but can be a merit if tamed for tunneling devices, as recently demonstrated. Asymmetric oxygen distribution-induced polarity, intertwined with ferroelectric polarization or not, is also investigated as a relevant interfacial effect in the real device. Though considered detrimental from certain aspects, such as inducing build-in field (independent of ferroelectric polarization) and exacerbating depolarization (intertwined with ferroelectric polarization), it can be partly balanced out by other effects, such as annealing (extrinsic) and polarity-induced defect formation (intrinsic). This work provides insights into ferroelectric-HfO 2 /dielectric interfaces and some useful implications for the development of devices.},

As compared to a short strip under the same voltage activation, the long relaxed strip is subjected to a less electric field and, thus, undergoes less active strain. Here, we developed a flexible ladder frame to reinforce and divide the long DEA in a bowtie series. When being pulled, the ladder frame unbuckled; it, in turn, helped to pre-stretch tautly the DEA membrane. Interestingly, its flanges enhance force transmissions, acting like tensioning cables for a suspension bridge. Hence, the maximum isometric stress of this bowtie series was 24\% higher than the short pure-shear one and 6.5 times the long uniaxial one. With 2.2 times enhanced dielectric strength across a taut DEA membrane, the bowtie series generated an isotonic strain 3.2 times that a long non-reinforced and relaxed DEA did. Hence, the reinforced DEAs can provide a more forceful drive for bio-inspired robots.},

Our results show that with appropriate compressive stress in the [100]-crystal direction, the magnitude of depolarization field of the crystal can be increased to close to the R-O phase transformation field, enabling the application of higher ac drive field.

  abstract     = {It has been reported that the HfO x -based metal–ferroelectric–insulator–semiconductor (MFIS) stack is one of the most feasible structures for memory applications in ferroelectric devices. In addition, in MFIS stacks, the formation of a high-quality thin insulator is considered to be a crucial process, because it determines the device performance and reliability. In this study, the effects of different SiO 2 thin interfacial layers (ILs) formed by chemical oxidation and atomic layer deposition (ALD) on the ferroelectricity of HfO x were investigated in MFIS stacks. Notably, the IL formation method affected the crystallization temperature of HfO x ferroelectricity. In particular, the chemical oxide IL sample was sufficiently crystallized only at an RTA temperature greater than 800 °C, whereas the ALD oxide IL sample began to undergo a complete ferroelectric phase transition from a low temperature (600 °C). The x-ray analysis verified that the IL formation method affected the initial film state of the HfO x layer by modulating the Hf-O bonding states, resulting in a different temperature dependence for ferroelectricity formation during the subsequent crystallization annealing stage. Consequently, it was confirmed that stable polarization (2P r &gt; 30 μ C/cm 2 ) could be obtained over a wide temperature range (600–800 °C) through IL material engineering; this could facilitate the integration of HfO x -based ferroelectric devices in terms of the heat budget and the application of ferroelectric devices as commercial devices.},

Depending on particle size and temperature, nanoparticle magnetization relaxation time constants span from nanoseconds to seconds. In solution, relaxation occurs via coupled Brownian and Néel relaxation mechanisms. Even though their coexistence complicates analysis, the presence of two timescales presents opportunities for more direct control of magnetization behavior if the two processes can be understood, isolated, and tuned. Using high frequency coils and sample temperature tunability, we demonstrate unambiguous determination of the specific relaxation processes for iron oxide nanoparticles using both time and frequency domain techniques. Furthermore, we study the evolution of the fast dynamics at ≈ 10 ns timescales, for magnetic field amplitudes relevant to MPI.},

  abstract     = {Spintronic rf detectors are efficient nanoscale counterparts to conventional semiconductor-based components for energy harvesting and wireless communication at low input power. Here, we report on the optimization of the rectified output dc voltage using magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) with strong perpendicular anisotropy of both the polarizing and free layers. The magnetization of the polarizing layer is fixed out-of-plane, while the free layer thickness is adjusted so that its magnetization orientation changes from in-plane to out-of-plane. Rectification dc output voltages in the mV range are obtained for moderate rf source powers with a signal-to-noise ratio of 26–39 dB for P rf = −25 dBm and a sensitivity ε of 300 mV/mW. The rectified signal shows a strong dependence on MTJ dimensions: it increases by a factor of 5–6 when reducing the diameter from 180 to 50 nm. Furthermore, this enhancement can be doubled when reducing the free layer thickness from 1.8 to 1.6 nm. This size-related enhancement is attributed to several jointly acting effects: the amplitude of the spin transfer torque that depends inversely on the diameter, the effective anisotropy that depends on the thickness of the excited layer, and the tunneling magneto-resistance ratio that for the devices studied here depends on diameter. The obtained results indicate that the geometry of the MTJ can be used to design spintronic based rf detectors with optimized sensitivity.},

In this work, SAF free layer pMTJs (SAF-pMTJs) were designed and fabricated, in which a Ru/Ta bilayer spacer is used to form the SAF structure. We first characterized the magnetization dynamics of the SAF free layer by using ferromagnetic resonance and found that the Gilbert damping constant of the SAF free layer is around 0.019. Then, in device level studies that span from 900 nm down to 200 nm lateral size, we observed a transition of the SAF free layer from a preferred antiparallel to parallel magnetic configuration at small device sizes, which can be explained by the increased dipole interaction. The impact of the operating current was also investigated. We report an extraordinarily strong dependence, up to 144.1 kOe per A/ μ m 2 , of the offset field on the applied current, suggesting an electric-field modulation on the interlayer exchange coupling of the SAF free layer. These results will be instructive to improve the understanding of material properties and device performance of SAF-pMTJs for ultrafast, ultralow-power consumption spintronic devices.},

This abnormal transverse current cannot be understood by the conventional anomalous Hall effect (e.g., Berry curvature, skew scattering, and side jump), which widely exists in ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic materials. Moreover, the efficiency of the transverse current generation therein can be as large as 18.4\% at low temperatures; this is an order of magnitude larger than the anomalous Hall angle in conventional ferromagnetic materials, such as Fe or Fe-based alloys. Furthermore, using the Boltzmann transport equation and a tight-binding model, we conclude that the asymmetric group velocities on the Fermi surface are the origin of this crystal-induced transverse current in γ -FeMn. Additionally, with a systematic discussion, we show that this unusual effect is not dependent on specific materials but is universal in any crystal with anisotropic symmetry.},

Here, we explore the heat-induced magnetization dynamics in the ferrimagnet at different points in the H-T phase diagram. For magnetic field strengths high enough to promote a state with non-collinear magnetizations of the sublattices, the dynamics occurs on a sub-ns timescale, governed by the effective spin–lattice interaction throughout the whole Brillouin zone of the spin excitations. When the field is low and the magnetizations are collinear, the heating alone is not sufficient to initiate the dynamics. In that case, the dynamics can only start after the magnetizations experience an initial kick, which occurs on the timescale of the spin–lattice interaction in the center of the Brillouin zone, leading to a substantial delay of the response of the spins to the thermal excitation.},

  abstract     = {Surface passivation using aminopropyl-functionalized siloxane is proposed via a post-synthesis ligand exchange reaction. The near-unity photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) is explained by more efficient surface passivation, which is confirmed by transient PL measurements. Alternatively, the siloxane can be introduced during the hot-injection synthesis, and a thicker SiO 2 shell structure is formed on the surface of nanocrystals (NCs), which leads to agglomeration and degrades optical properties. The low-temperature ligand exchange reaction lends precision process control; thereby, an optimized PLQY of 99\% is achieved. Moreover, the emission wavelength of the siloxane passivated CsPbBr 3 can be modulated via halide exchange for highly saturated and stable green emissions. The stability of these NCs is first ascribed to the siloxane moiety. Siloxane passivated CsPbI 3 NCs were also prepared with bright red emission. A wide color gamut of 134.9\% National Television System Committee or 100.7\% Rec. 2020 is realized using blue light-emitting diodes together with green and red perovskite NCs. We stress the effect of Cs vacancy repair via the ligand exchange and the essentially monolayer thickness of the ligand shell to ascribe the high performance of these NCs.},

Finite-element method simulations reveal that the quality factor of the transmission spectrum can reach values on the order of 10 7 , which can be finetuned by varying either waveguide width or phononic crystal groove depth. The Fano line shape dip, which appears around 25 kHz, red-shifts linearly with respect to the waveguide width at a rate of 308 Hz/mm. The quality factor exhibits a two order of magnitude drop for 0.01 mm waveguide width detuning from the optimal value. In comparison, three orders of magnitude decrease are observed for the same variation from the optimal value of the surface phononic crystal groove depth. Fano-like line shape is preserved when thermo-viscous losses are taken into account, where tunability with geometrical factors is still possible. Fine-tuning of either the dip frequency or quality factor can be utilized in demanding applications such as measurement of distance and concentrations of fluid mixtures with ultra high sensitivity.},

The centimeter-sized 2D perovskite (PMA) 2 PbI 4 single crystal and the corresponding x-ray detector were fabricated. The Cu ion implanted device exhibits an excellent sensitivity of 283 μ C Gy air −1 cm −2 , the significantly enhanced mobility-lifetime ( μ τ) product of 8.05 × 10 −3 cm 2 V −1 , and the lowest detectable dose rate of 2.13 μ Gy air s −1 . Experimental observation combined with the DFT calculations shows that the improvement in Cu ion implanted x-ray detection is ascribed to the enhanced photoinduced charge carrier density and μ τ product, and the increased carrier dissociation capability associated deeply with the decreased binding energy of exciton in the inorganic layer quasi-quantum well. The incorporation of the Cu interstitials by high-energy Cu ion implantation is able to introduce the donor and acceptor states with additional charge transfer channeling, resulting in the decreased exciton binding energy and fast dissociation of the exciton and the quick carrier extraction. Cu ion implantation regulating the dissociation of charge carriers in low-dimensional perovskites will motivate the application for 2D perovskite in high-performance x-ray detectors.},

Understanding AuSn–Au 5 Sn eutectic interfaces is essential for processing the Au-20Sn solder. Here, we studied the δ-AuSn/ξ′-Au 5 Sn eutectic interfaces at different deformation sates by electron backscattered diffraction analysis, high resolution transmission electron microscope, and first-principles density-function theory (DFT) calculations. We observed three orientation relationships and corresponding interfaces. One is thermally preferred during casting, and the other two are formed during the hot rolling process. Crystallographic analysis and DFT calculations suggest that the dominant orientation relationship is attributed to the small lattice mismatch and the low interface formation energy. These results provide insights for understanding the interface effect on microstructure evolution of ingot Au-20Sn alloys during severe plastic deformation.},

Marangoni flow driven by a gradient in surface tension is an essential internal flow mechanism, whose characteristics in evaporating water drops remain elusive in the literature. Here, by employing infrared thermography and particle image velocimetry, we show that the manifestation of Marangoni flow as a convective cell at the liquid–vapor interface results in a nonaxisymmetric internal flow field. Eventually, during evaporation, the flow transitions to a buoyancy-dominated regime, where an axisymmetric toroidal flow is observed. This transition marks a reversal in the flow along with an order of magnitude decrease in velocity. We corroborate this experimentally observed transition using previously reported analytical and scaling frameworks. Finally, we present hitherto unreported features correlating the three aspects of evaporating water drops, viz., contact line dynamics, thermal field, and internal flow field, which are generally investigated independently.},

Herein, a continuous-wave operation of an electrically driven laser device using a Ga-incorporated n-type ZnO microwire, MgO nanofilm, and p-type GaAs substrate is demonstrated. The device can enable a single-mode lasing peaking at 820 nm and a narrow linewidth of about 0.4 nm, and the quality factor Q is evaluated to 2000. The presence of a distinct threshold, sharp linewidth reduction, and polarized coherent illumination provides conclusive evidence for achieving lasing oscillation. Relative polaritonic features are further proofed; thus, single-mode lasing feature should be ascribed to the exciton–polariton. The results can enable a workable avenue to realize near-infrared micro-/nanolaser diodes for high-efficiency coherent light sources, which are no longer limited by conventional narrow-bandgap semiconductors.},

Solving this optimization problem involved improving two different objective functions, one for cloaking and the other for stress concentration. As an optimizer, the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy was adopted to find the optimal level set functions, which express the design configurations with clearly delineated boundaries. Optimized cloak-concentrators reproduce outer displacements as if nothing is present despite the presence of a system concentrating stress on an interior domain. We also present demonstrations of topology optimized configurations for mechanical unfeelability concentrators that perform robustly under loads at any location around the system and under the cloaked region of arbitrary Young&#39;s modulus.

This perspective gives a feel for the unique possibilities offered by conducting domain walls, in future forms of agile electronics. Indeed, it is imagined that domain walls and domain wall junctions might eventually allow for entire nanoscale circuits (devices and their interconnects) to be created in one instant, for one purpose, only to be wiped clean and rewritten in a different form, for a different purpose, in the next instant.
