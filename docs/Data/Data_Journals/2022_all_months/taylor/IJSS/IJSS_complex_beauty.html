  abstract     = {A networked control system (NCS), which integrates various physical components by utilising communication networks, is a complex intelligent control system with high flexibility and reliability. It has been widely applied in various areas, such as power grids, intelligent transportation, and smart manufacturing. However, compared with traditional control systems, NCSs expose more extra vulnerabilities with the openness of communication networks, leading to long-term concerns for the security of NCSs against cyber attacks. This paper gives a survey in detail on recent developments on the security of NCSs subject to deception attacks from the two domains of information technology (IT) and system control, respectively. First, several security incidents reported in recent years are reviewed and a couple of prevailing cyber attacks are analysed. Besides, the results on IT security with respect to the protection-detection-reaction model are summarised. Then, from the domain of system control, the security issues on attack design, attack detection, secure state estimation and resilient control are surveyed in depth. Furthermore, several novel security topics from the combination of IT and system control are also discussed. Finally, several future research directions are presented on this topic.},

  abstract     = {Lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA), as a well-known point-of-care testing (POCT) technique, is of vital significance in a variety of application scenarios due to the advantages of convenience and high efficiency. With rapid development of computational intelligence (CI), algorithms have played an important role in enhancing LFIA performance, and it is necessary to summary how algorithms can assist LFIA improvement for providing experiences. However, most existing works on LFIA are from biochemical field which pay more attention to material and reagent. Therefore, in this paper, a systematical survey is proposed to review works on applying mathematical tools to promote LFIA development. Particularly, a novel two-level taxonomy is designed for a better inspection, including LFIA-oriented mathematical modelling, CI-assisted post-processing and quantification in LFIA, and each level is further subdivided for in-depth understanding. In addition, from a higher viewpoint, outlooks of jointly developing POCT with other state-of-the-art techniques are presented from perspectives of implementation principle, technical approach and algorithm application. Moreover, this survey aims to highlight that applying CI methods is competent for boosting POCT development, so as to raise attentions from more areas like information science, extend deeper researches and inspire more interdisciplinary works.},

In this paper, a new key performance indicator (KPI) oriented nonlinear process monitoring and operating performance assessment method is proposed based on the improved Hessian locally linear embedding (HLLE), in view of the problems of strong nonlinearity, high dimension and information redundancy in actual industrial process data. Firstly, in order to characterise the similarities of samples in both temporal and spatial dimensions, a new measurement, based on Finite Markov theory, is defined to replace the Euclidean distance in traditional HLLE. Secondly, by mining the relationships between process variables and the key performance indicator, the KPI oriented feature extraction method is developed. On this basis, the monitoring statistics is constructed and the corresponding control limit is determined for the real-time fault detection. After that, a new operating performance assessment approach based on sliding window Kullback–Leibler divergence is put forward to facilitate maintenance or adjustments. Finally, the proposed method is applied to the hot strip mill process, and the results show the effectiveness.},

Stability analysis of MPC with a limited horizon but without terminal weight is a well-known challenging problem. We define a new value function based on an auxiliary one-step optimisation related to stage cost, namely optimal one-step value function (OSVF). It is shown that a finite horizon MPC can be made to be asymptotically stable if OSVF is a (local) control Lyapunov function (CLF). More specifically, by exploiting the CLF property of OSFV to construct a contractive terminal set, a new stabilising MPC algorithm (CMPC) is proposed. We show that CMPC is recursively feasible and guarantees stability under the condition that OSVF is a CLF. Checking this condition and estimation of the maximal terminal set are discussed. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed stability condition and corresponding CMPC algorithm.},

Third, by considering the impact of DoS attacks and event-triggered mechanisms at the same time, the system is modelled as a switching model. Then, by constructing a suitable piecewise Lyapunov functional, sufficient conditions are derived to ensure the exponential stability of the system with H ∞ performance.

  abstract     = {One of the great challenges to control theory is to design controllers for the increasing size of uncertain large-scale systems. Such problems arise in many real-word applications and the systems are too large and too complex to be centralised controlled. For these reasons, the complex system is split into several interconnected subsystems and it is controlled in a decentralized fashion. In this article, a novel, original approach to the control of large-scale uncertain linear discrete-time systems by a decentralised controller is presented. In the existing references, such systems are divided into two groups: complex systems with strong or weak interactions. However, the new proposed approach depends on whether the system is stable or not. The design procedure consists of two steps: In the first step, the dynamic properties of the closed-loop decentralised controlled subsystems are determined in such a way that the stability, robustness, and performance of the closed-loop subsystems and the entire system are guaranteed. In the second step, a decentralised control algorithm must be designed that ensures the required properties of the subsystems that have been obtained in the first step. The advantage of this approach is that the decentralized controller design is performed on the subsystem level.},

The introduction of weights leads to our research being more complex and challenging. Firstly, for the case of one reverse edge, there are two completely opposite conclusions about the effect of adding one reverse edge on the convergence rate under certain conditions, which is dependent on whether the end node of the reverse edge is the root node of the chain graph or not. Subsequently, we discuss the relative positions of two reverse edges in three cases and obtain the convergence rate of the whole network is determined by the ranges, the relative positions of these two reverse edges, and the sizes and distribution of weights in the directed weighted graph. Moreover, as the number of reverse edges increases, we overcome the complex relationships among multiple reverse edges and establish similar theories. Finally, some numerical examples are given to illustrate our main theorems. Our results generalise the results from unweighted directed graph to a weighted directed graph.},

To overcome these challenges, the paper aims to solve a model-free optimal output regulation problem for achieving optimal output tracking control; solving an optimal output regulation problem is equivalent to solving a linear quadratic regulation (LQR) problem and a constrained static optimisation problem. The state reconstruction is first given to represent the system state in terms of the input and output sequences. A data-driven value iteration (VI) algorithm is then proposed to iteratively approximate the solution to the discrete-time algebraic Riccati equation (ARE) of the corresponding LQR problem on the basis of input and output data. Next, based on the iterative solutions with respect to the ARE, a model-free solution is provided for the corresponding constrained static optimisation problem. Finally, an alternative reference system equivalent to the original reference system is established to avoid the requirement of having the knowledge of the reference system dynamics and the reference state. A numerical example is employed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.},

Further, sufficient conditions are given for the co-design of the switched output-based fuzzy controller and the secure ETM.

  abstract     = {A controlled discrete-time stochastic process is proposed as a model for the state of a machine. In the proposed model, normal and random wear of the machine are considered. The random wear of the machine during a time unit can be either a discrete or a continuous random variable. The objective is to find a control policy that maximises the profits generated by the machine over its useful lifetime. In this problem, the optimiser must decide whether to do or not to do the maintenance work on the machine at each time unit. The significance of the paper is that the final time in the optimal control problem is a random variable denoting the first time the machine must be replaced. To obtain the optimal control, one can try to solve the dynamic programming equation, which reduces to a difference or an integral equation, satisfied by the value function. Finally, particular cases are solved exactly, or approximately, and explicitly to demonstrate and validate the proposed model.},

A dual-channel event-triggered transmission scheme is proposed to determine whether the data packets should be released or not. Two 1-norm-based event-trigger conditions are designed for the sensor-controller channel and controller-actuator channel, respectively. The condition of the system remaining positivity with the designed event-trigger conditions and feedback control law is provided. By using the Lyapunov method and matrix decomposition technique, a sufficient criterion ensuring the closed loop system to be asymptotically stable is proposed. For the linearisation purpose, the control gain is delicately decomposed into a nonnegative component and a non-positive component. Zeno behaviour of the designed event-triggered transmission of sampled data packets is further rigorously proved to be excluded. An example of water pollution control system is provided to show the effectiveness of the obtained results.},

The DoS attack, occurring in a random way, is considered on the sensor-to-filter channel. The try-once-discard (TOD) protocol is employed to reduce the transmitted data and alleviate the burdens of shared communication networks, such that only one sensor node is granted to transmit the measurement data at each time instant.

  abstract     = {The indefinite linear quadratic (ILQ) optimal control problem has many important applications in financial, economic systems, etc., which has been widely researched in stochastic systems and descriptor systems, etc. However, for ILQ problem of rectangular descriptor Markov jump systems (DMJSs), because there are impulses simultaneously in descriptor subsystems and at the switching time, it is theoretically difficult to research and there is no result yet. This paper discusses the ILQ optimal control problem for continuous-time linear rectangular DMJSs. Firstly, under some rank conditions and inequality conditions, the ILQ problem for rectangular DMJSs can be equivalently transformed into standard LQ problem for Markov jump systems (MJSs) by using elementary linear algebra method. Then based on the LQ theory of MJSs, the solvable sufficient condition of the ILQ problem for rectangular DMJSs and the non-negative optimal cost value are obtained. The optimal control can be synthesised as state feedback, and the resulting optimal closed-loop system has the stochastically stable solution. In addition, with some rank inequality assumptions, the differential subsystem of the resulting optimal closed-loop system can be ensured to have a unique solution. Finally, two numerical examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the methods proposed in this paper.},

An effective impulsive control strategy is utilised to guarantee that the leader-following consensus can be achieved exponentially. Particularly, several sufficient criteria regarding LFEC are derived by exploring the Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional and the linear matrix inequality technique. Additionally, the definition of the average impulsive interval is embedded into our developed results, which makes the results to be less conservative than those utilising the maximum and minimum impulsive intervals. At last, by the demonstration of numerical simulation results, the developed results are proven to be effective for achieving the LFEC of DTMASs.},

The dwell-flee relations obtained are in terms of certain smooth functions of the eigenvalues and (generalised) eigenvectors of the subsystem matrices. The results are extended to a special class of symmetric bilinear systems. The results are also extended to a multimodal planar linear switched system in which the switching is governed by an undirected star graph, where the internal node corresponds to a Hurwitz stable (unstable, respectively) subsystem and all the leaves correspond to unstable (Hurwitz stable, respectively) subsystems.

This scheme attempts to remove some existing obstacles against exploiting MPC in industrial applications, such as (i) risk and cost of a new controller replacement, (ii) difficulties of attaining a precise open-loop model of an industrial system and (iii) high computational burden of MPC methods. To this end, tube conservatism and calculation burden are reduced using the transient response of the error dynamics. Thus the feasible region of the MPC is enlarged and its computation time is reduced. To reduce modelling difficulties, the investigated approach does not require the open-loop model dynamics of the system and utilises the closed-loop model instead. On the other hand, it allows the existing inner-loop controller to remain unchanged without any manipulations, which results in eliminating a new controller replacement risk and cost. Additionally, for the proposed control method, robust stability and recursive feasibility are guaranteed without terminal gradients. Finally, an illustrative example is carried out in the simulation results to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

To simplify the design process of the controller, a dead zone-based model of saturation is implemented and neural networks are used to approximate uncertain nonlinear functions and to construct an observer to cope with difficulties raised by the presence of immeasurable state variables. By applying the backstepping technique, a smooth tracking controller with adaptive law is proposed to ensure all the signals in the closed-loop system are semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded.

  abstract     = {This paper presents an optimised tracking control scheme based on reinforcement learning (RL) for a class of second-order nonlinear systems with unknown dynamics. Different from the first-order dynamic system control, the second-order case is required to synchronously steer two variables of position and velocity, hence it makes this optimised control more challenging to accomplish. To achieve the optimised control, first, neural network (NN) is employed to approximate the solution of Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB), and then an RL is performed by constructing both critic and actor based on the NN approximation. Since the RL training laws are derived from the negative gradient of a simple positive function generated in accordance with the partial derivative of HJB equation, it can make the control algorithm significantly simple to compare with the existing optimal control methods. Meanwhile, it can also release the condition of persistence excitation and compensate for the nonlinear uncertainty. Finally, the proposed adaptive control method can guarantee the desired results that are demonstrated by theorem, proof and simulation.},

  abstract     = {Control of time-varying systems has become increasingly popular in recent years, as various domains such as aviation, automobile and manufacturing industries require a quick and precise response in the presence of uncertainties. Adaptive control, a popular strategy is used to control systems with unknown or time-varying properties. Classic adaptive control is insufficient to cope with time-varying parameters to produce desired results with minimal parametric error. Furthermore, for these strategies to work, identification model must be initialised closer to the plant. Else the transient response of the plant is likely to grow unbounded. This paper mainly concentrates on employing adaptive control for a type of linear time-invariant (LTI) and linear time-varying (LTV) systems. The time variations in LTV plant parameters are either slow, rapid or fast. This research in turn proposes a two-stage adaptive scheme which swiftly determines the compact region in which plant parameters reside. This method in turn ensures atleast one model to be initialised closer to the plant which significantly reduces parametric estimation error. The uniform boundedness of identification error, tracking error as well as the parametric error of LTI and LTV systems, are deduced. Sufficient examples are also considered to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed two-stage scheme.},

Here, the spatially varying diffusion coefficients can be same or distinct. To stabilise the system, we first use an invertible backstepping transformation to convert an original dynamics into a target dynamics with new manipulable inputs and perturbations. Then, we employ the sliding-mode algorithm to design this discontinuous controller to suppress disturbances. In this case, we obtain the combined backstepping/sliding-mode controller of the original dynamics. By using the fractional Halanay&#39;s inequality, the delay-independent stability condition is obtained for the asymptotic stabilisation of the delayed target system and therefore of the delayed original system under the combined controller. Fractional numerical examples are given to verify the efficiency of the proposed synthesis.},

As the model&#39;s order grows larger, simulation, analysis, design, and control become more challenging. For one-dimensional and two-dimensional models, Enns&#39; weighted (i.e. frequency and time) model reduction procedures result in an unstable reduced-order model. For one-dimensional reduced-order systems, researchers devised a number of frequency-weighted stability-preserving solutions; nevertheless, these solutions result in significant approximation errors. However, to the best of the authors&#39; knowledge, no time-weighted stability-preserving model reduction framework is available in the literature for the discrete-time one-dimensional and two-dimensional systems. In this research, two-dimensional models are separated into two sub-models (i.e. two cascaded one-dimensional models) and reduced using time-weighted Gramians utilising minimal rank-decomposition. The approach applies to both one-dimensional and two-dimensional models. For one-dimensional and two-dimensional models, the suggested methodology additionally gives a priori error-bounds expressions.

  abstract     = {Redundancy resolution is a critical issue to achieve accurate kinematic control for manipulators. End-effectors of manipulators can track desired paths well with suitable resolved joint variables. In some manipulation applications such as selecting insertion paths to thrill through a set of points, it requires the distal link of a manipulator to translate along such fixed point and then perform manipulation tasks. The point is known as remote centre of motion (RCM) to constrain motion planning and kinematic control of manipulators. Together with its end-effector finishing path tracking tasks, the redundancy resolution of a manipulators has to maintain RCM to produce reliable resolved joint angles. However, current existing redundancy resolution schemes on manipulators based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) mainly are focusing on unrestricted motion without RCM constraints considered. In this paper, an RNN-based approach is proposed to solve the redundancy resolution issue with RCM constraints, developing a new general dynamic optimisation formulation containing the RCM constraints. Theoretical analysis shows the theoretical derivation and convergence of the proposed RNN for redundancy resolution of manipulators with RCM constraints. Simulation results further demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method in end-effector path tracking control under RCM constraints based on an industrial redundant manipulator system.},

A new dynamic ETM (DETM) is devised to conserve network resources, which contains an additive internal dynamic variable (IDV), a multiplicative adaptively adjusting variable, a time-varying weighting matrix and several flexible scalars. The MPC problem is formulated as a ‘min–max’ optimisation problem (OP), where a hard constraint and robust positive invariant set on the predictive state/IDV are considered simultaneously. By resorting to a Lyapunov-like function that depends on the IDV, we put forward an auxiliary OP with matrix-inequality-based constraints. By the feasible solutions of such an auxiliary OP, the feedback gain matrix is designed which ensures the asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system. Two examples are presented to demonstrate the validity of the devised DETM and the DETM-based MPC algorithm. The study verifies that the devised DETM has advantages over an existing counterpart in conserving network resources while achieving the desired performance.},

On this basis, a distributed model-free adaptive predictive control (DMFAPC) algorithm is constructed by the use of consensus errors and the robustness analysis is conducted in the presence of disturbances. Further, the results are modified by using measured outputs to replace the system outputs, and thus a measured output-based DMFAPC is presented to deal with the omnipresent measurement noises in practical applications. The two proposed DMFAPC methods are data driven since no mechanistic model information is required wherein. And thus, no unmodelled dynamics affects the consensus performance. Instead, they can improve the control performance by utilising additional predictive information. The two proposed DMFAPC methods are verified using numerical simulations.},

  abstract     = {In this study, an optimal and robust fractional order PID (FOPID) controller design approach is suggested for Smith predictor based FOPID (SP-FOPID) control system design. This new design approach considers continued fraction expansion (CFE) based approximate models in the optimal design task of FOPID controllers, and this approach preserves the design optimality in control applications. For this purpose, an inverse controller loop shaping design methodology is performed in order to approximate the frequency response of a Bode’s ideal loop reference model, and robust performance CFE based FOPID controller models are obtained by solving a multi-objective optimisation problem via a genetic algorithm. Thus, the suggested algorithm can deal with several controller realisation concerns in the design task of FOPID controllers and overcome real-world controller performance issues related with model approximation errors and signal saturation boundaries of electronic hardware. Illustrative design examples demonstrate that the suggested design scheme can preserve design optimality and improve practical control performance in practice.},

The main mathematical tool is semi-tensor product of matrices, which is used to convert the dynamics of DPBCNs into an equivalent algebraic state space representation (ASSR). Based on the ASSR of DPBCNs, the constrained sampled-data transition probability matrix is constructed. Then, new criteria are proposed for the finite-time constrained reachability of DPBCNs under uniform SDC. By virtue of finite-time constrained reachability, a procedure is established to design state feedback sampled-data stabilisers for DPBCNs.

Firstly, an augmented vector containing two double integral terms is introduced into the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF). In this case, a binary quadratic function with discrete and neutral delay arises in the time derivative. To gain the negativity condition of such function, by taking full advantage of the idea of partial differential of the binary quadratic function and Taylor&#39;s formula, a relaxed binary quadratic function negative-determination lemma with two adjustable parameters is proposed, which contains the existing lemmas as its special cases and shows the great potential of reducing conservatism for the case where the tangent slope at the endpoint is far from zero. Then, based on the improved lemma, more relaxing stability criteria have been obtained via an augmented LKF. Finally, two classic numerical examples are given to attest the effectiveness and strengths of the obtained stability criteria.},

Criteria of observability and reconstructibility are proposed for linear and affine CA through an extension of the Kalman criterion and for non-linear CA from an extension of the results on observability and reconstructibility of Boolean networks. A method for decentralised observability calculation is presented for non-linear CA in order to reduce the algorithmic complexity.

  abstract     = {This work deals with chaos synchronisation. One of the commonly used methods is the master-slave configuration, where the response of the chaotic receiver (slave) system must converge to the chaotic trajectory of the transmitter (master). The major problem with this configuration is the delay that occurs during the transmission of the drive signal from the master to the slave, which can degrade the synchronisation. The objective of this paper is to propose a solution to the synchronisation problem of nonlinear fractional-order chaotic systems in the presence of a transmission delay at the output and unknown disturbance. The proposed approach consists of combining a fractional high-order sliding mode observer (FHOSMO) and a predictor arranged in a cascade to compensate for the delayed transmission signal from the transmitter to the receiver. The observer permits to estimate the delayed states and the delayed total disturbance (uncertainties and external disturbances) in finite time. These estimates are injected into the predictor to obtain the estimated states at the current time. The finite time convergence of the proposed method is established. The numerical simulations illustrate the theoretical results and the performance of the proposed method. The proposed synchronisation method is compared with other synchronisation methods using the chattering free sliding mode approach such as the fractional first-order sliding mode observer using the continuous function instead of the discontinuous sign function and the fractional second-order sliding mode observer. In addition, a conventional first-order sliding mode observer with the sign function is also considered.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the optimal tracking problem for discrete-time linear systems with multiple delays is studied without system dynamics. It is known that the total state of a system without specific dynamic characteristics is hard to be measured, unless such a system is equipped with massive sensors, which, however, may lead to an increase in cost and complexity for analysing. To deal with this problem and avoid adverse effects caused by using system state information, a new data-driven value iteration (DDVI) algorithm is proposed by considering three factors: past control inputs, system outputs, and external reference trajectories. Before the algorithm is proposed, a transformation is made to the original system according to the characteristics of the time-delay system, so that the time-delay number can be reduced or become a delay-free system. A novel data-driven state equation is derived from the historical data of the three factors, and then, it is adopted to solve the optimal control of multi-delay systems. Further results show that the proposed DDVI algorithm is convergent and the tracking error is asymptotically stable. Finally, simulations are provided to show the effectiveness of the controller.},

  abstract     = {This paper is concerned with the differential privacy-based containment control problem for a class of discrete-time multi-agent systems (MASs) with time-varying topology. The classical containment control implementation relies on the explicit information exchange between agents, which will lead to the possible leakage of agents&#39; private information, especially the initial states. In this paper, to prevent such data disclosure to neighbours inside the MASs and the outside eavesdroppers, uncorrelated noise is injected into the data during information transmission, which will bring about a more complicated scenario to the containment control. Under a milder assumption on the connectivity of the MAS – ‘average graph topology’, by resorting to the Lyapunov stability theory and algebraic graph theory, and utilising stochastic analysis techniques, sufficient conditions are derived to ensure that the discrete-time MAS subjecting to the privacy protection mechanism can achieve bounded containment control . Then, convergence accuracy is studied from the viewpoint of probability. Specially, Markov inequality is first utilised to estimate the lower bound of the probability that followers&#39; states converge to the neighbourhood of the convex hull formed by leaders&#39; states. Besides, differential privacy analysis is carried out to verify the validity of the proposed privacy protection mechanism in protecting the followers&#39; initial states.

By using certain novel Lyapunov–Krasovskii (L–K) functionals in combination with stochastic analysis technique, sufficient conditions have been provided for the existence of desired estimator, guaranteeing both the globally asymptotically mean-square stability and the prescribed L 2 - L ∞ performance simultaneously. Moreover, the estimator gains are obtained by virtue of certain convex optimisation algorithms. Finally, we use an illustrative example to verify the obtained theoretical algorithm.},

In the process of the measurement data transmission, an encoding–decoding mechanism is introduced to improve the security of the network by encrypting the measurement data. The purpose of this paper is to design a proportional–integral-type estimation algorithm such that the estimation error dynamics is exponentially ultimately bounded in mean square. First, a sufficient condition is obtained for the existence of the desired estimator. Then, the parameters of the estimator are obtained by solving certain matrix inequality.

The extended Chebyshev cardinal wavelets as an appropriate class of basis functions are introduced to construct two numerical methods for these problems. To solve these problems, at first, an operational matrix for the Atangana–Baleanu fractional integral of these wavelets is derived. Then, by approximating the fractional derivative of the state variables and control variables in terms of the extended Chebyshev cardinal wavelets, and employing the fractional integral operational matrix of these wavelets and the Lagrange multipliers method, the problems under consideration are converted into systems of algebraic equations, which can be easily solved.

This method is based on linear matrix inequality (LMI) and provides fixed learning gains during time and iteration. Since the convergence of the ILC algorithm may change due to uncertainty in the parameters of a system, and the ILC algorithm is incapable of dealing with iteration-related challenges, it is a major challenge to reject the effect of iteration varying uncertainty. Besides, in the basic ILC algorithm, the initial state is constant in each iteration and consequently always leads to a tracking error. In this paper, first, a convergence condition of the ILC-ISL algorithm is designed based on closed-loop system stability in the iteration domain, and second, a new robust convergence condition is achieved by the LMI approach. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed robust convergence scheme is evaluated through a numerical example and a mechanical system, respectively.},

This paper aims to provide a survey of recent advances in event-triggered security control for NCSs under malicious attacks. First, several typical models on cyber-attacks from the communication layer are elaborated. Second, a number of secure control results reported in the literature are reviewed and in-depth analysis is made on several improved event-triggered strategies resilient to cyber-attacks, including the hybrid-triggered strategy, the adaptive event-triggered strategy, the dynamic event-triggered strategy, the memory-based event-triggered strategy, the switching-like event-triggered strategy, and the stochastic event-triggered strategy. Third, under randomly occurring denial-of-service attacks, an application of part event-triggered secure resilient control to power systems with a load frequency control scheme coordinated electric vehicles is analysed. Finally, several challenging issues on event-triggered control based on cyber-attacks are presented to direct the future research in the field.},

  abstract     = {Dynamic consensus of linear time-invariant multi-agent systems (MASs) using distributed model predictive control under the influence of input delay is addressed in this technical note. Model predictive control (MPC) is well suited to solve the consensus problem with its ability to handle multivariable systems and constraints. However, the increased computational complexity of MPC restricts its area of applications. An attempt to bridge this gap is made by proposing a Laguerre-based MPC design to bring down the computational load and make it viable for implementation. The effect of input delay on consensus is examined and the stability margin of a MAS with input delay is computed using the location of the closed-loop poles. A comparison of the proposed algorithm with conventional MPC establishes its superiority in convergence time, robustness to input delay and smoothness of the trajectories. The effectiveness of the proposed design is validated through the simulation of dynamic consensus on the benchmark problem of platoon configuration of vehicles.

First, by simplifying a drilling riser system as a spring-mass-damping unit with three degrees of freedom, an increment equation of the riser system subject to friction force of seawater and drilling discharge mud is established. Then, by artificially introducing a time-varying delay with given lower and upper bounds into the control channel, a pure delayed H ∞ control scheme is presented to restrain the recoil responses of the riser system. Based on the Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional approach, several new sufficient conditions are derived to design the pure delayed H ∞ controller. Finally, comparative simulation results are given to show the effectiveness and merits of the proposed control scheme. It is demonstrated that to mitigate recoil response of the deepwater riser in the event of emergency disconnection, the proposed pure delayed H ∞ controllers are more economic than the delay-free H ∞ controller.},

  abstract     = {With the developments of wireless data communication and network technology, time-delays are widely found in nowadays&#39; control systems, e.g. networked control systems, mobile robot systems, and multi-agent systems. Predictor-based control is an effective method dealing with long time-delays because it can generally lead to a delay-free closed-loop system by introducing a prediction for future states. Recently, various predictor-based control methods have been developed for numerous control systems subject to different time-delays, which motivates this survey. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the up-to-date results on the predictor-based control of time-delay systems. Firstly, the ordinary differential equation-based approaches for designing and analysing predictor-based controllers are summarised. Secondly, one reports an alternative method of predictor-based control, in which the systems/controllers are understood in the sense of partial differential equations. Next, several integration-free predictor-based controllers are introduced: by abandoning the infinite-dimensional integral terms, the control laws become easier to realise in practice. Hereafter, the paper discusses the real-time implementations and the practical applications of predictor-based control methods to several particular control systems. Finally, this paper suggests some new trends of predictor-based control for future research.},

However, various integral vectors inherited from the Bessel-Legendre inequality bring some challenging issues, such as the construction of suitable augmented Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals (LKFs); high-degree polynomial estimation on the derivative of the chosen LKF. This paper offers an overview of recent developments on these issues. First, an instructive review on the construction of suitable augmented LKFs catering for the use of the Bessel-Legendre inequality is given in detail. Second, an in-depth analysis and insightful understanding of high-degree polynomial inequalities on closed intervals are made.

Radial basis function neural networks (RBFNNs) are employed to adaptively approximate the unknown nonlinearities and changes in system dynamics model due to stochastic failures. By utilising a one-to-one nonlinear mapping, the asymmetric output constraints stochastic system is converted into a system without any constraints. Furthermore, to save the communication resources between controller and actuator, an improved dynamic event-triggered mechanism is developed, which contains threshold parameters and an exponential convergence term. Then, based on the stochastic Lyapunov function method, an event-triggered adaptive fault-tolerant controller is proposed for the considered systems. It is shown that the developed adaptive fault-tolerant controller can guarantee that all the signals remain semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded while the output constraint is satisfied, even if the system is affected by stochastic failures. Eventually, the example results are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control methodology.},

The data communication is regulated by the random access protocol (RAP) for the purpose of avoiding data collisions. The main purpose of this paper is to design an LPV filter such that the resultant filtering error system is asymptotically stable and also satisfies the prescribed l 2 - l ∞ performance in the mean square. Taking into account both the LPV nature and the possible gain perturbations, a parameter-dependent resilient filter is constructed according to the plant dynamics and scheduling behaviour of the RAP. The desired filter gain matrices are obtained by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities. Finally, a simulation example is given to validate the effectiveness and correctness of the filter design scheme.},

Based on the framework of the backstepping algorithm, an observer-based finite-time adaptive tracking control strategy is proposed via the common Lyapunov function approach. The stability analysis process confirms in detail that all the closed-loop signals are bounded under arbitrary switchings and the tracking error can converge to a small neighbourhood of the origin after a finite period of time.

Additionally, with simultaneous actuator and sensor faults, disturbances, the overall performance of the FTC system decreases. To maintain robust stability of closed-loop systems, an unknown input observer fault estimator approach with both state feedback control and sliding mode control is implemented as a solution by solving H ∞ optimisation using a linear matrix inequality (LMI) formulation.

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a dual backstepping variable structure switching control strategy to realise the stable reference signal tracking of bounded uncertain nonlinear system. Compared with the conventional backstepping control scheme, the proposed approach contains double distinct backstepping recursive sequences instead of the single sequence. According to the saturation switching condition, the first backstepping sub-controller is applicable to the saturation switching phase to ensure stability in a large region. The second backstepping sub-controller is applicable to the linear transient phase to shrink the convergence domain further for improving the control performance. The proposed control mechanism consists of double distinct backstepping sub-controllers which are regulated and tuned based on variable structure switching logic. The most significant advantage is that the switching controllers expand the traditional single backstepping variable structure control to double backstepping. This method not only guarantees the tracking error global uniform convergence but also improves the tracking control performance. In addition, this method absorbs both the advantages of backstepping and variable structure to protect the beneficial nonlinear properties in states and suppress the chatting. To evaluate the control performance and tracking effectiveness of the proposed control mechanism, a numerical comparing example is presented and discussed.},

The x-axis is assumed to lie in the east–west direction and the y-axis in the north–south direction. UAVs flying in the ‘+’ formation are divided into 4 main groups: east, west, north, and south. UAVs on the x-axis are driven from the difference in signal strengths of the east group and the west group, and on the y-axis from the difference in signal strengths of the north and south groups respectively. The hybrid controller consists of two discrete modes: (1) formation mode (2) search and track mode. The back-stepping formation controller is derived through Lyapunov stability criteria to make the UAVs fly in ‘+’shape and at a fixed altitude.

  abstract     = {The problem of complete controllability is addressed for a class of switched time-varying impulsive systems under multiple input delays. Several controllability criteria are obtained with the aid of algebraic and geometric tools. Firstly, the explicit expression of solution on every impulsive interval for such systems is derived by mathematical induction and variation of parameters. Then, complete controllability is investigated for the underlying system based on the solution established. Specifically, the new necessary or/and sufficient algebraic controllability conditions are obtained without assuming that all impulse-dependent matrices are non-singular. In addition, the geometric criteria with regard to the constant matrices are further discussed when the considered system reduces to a time-invariant case. Finally, numerical examples are worked out to demonstrate the controllability tests derived in this paper. It is shown that the existence of the delayed term will potentially affect the controllability of the studied system. In contrast to the existing literatures, the criteria derived in this paper removing some constrained assumptions have less conservatism and can be used to verify the controllability of a more general linear hybrid system.},

To avoid wasting resources, the event-triggering scheme is adopted during the data transmission process from the sensors to the estimator where the triggering threshold can be dynamically adjusted. By means of the Lyapunov stability theory, sufficient conditions are provided to ensure that the estimation error dynamics achieves both the asymptotical stability and the l 2 - l ∞ performance. The desired non-fragile estimator gain is parameterised by solving certain matrix inequalities.

Parameter-dependent Lyapunov functions are used to derive both ℋ 2 H 2 H2 and ℋ ∞ H ∞ H∞ discrete-time filter design conditions resulting in a poly-quadratic approach in terms of linear matrix inequalities. A multi-objective H 2 / H ∞ solution is also provided. The proposed conditions have the advantage of recovering the established poly-quadratic concept as a particular case, which was an unresolved problem until the present paper. Moreover, using the addressed approach, it is possible to obtain improved quadratic H 2 and H ∞ filters.

Existing methods require the so-called observer matching condition to be satisfied, rely on the boundedness e variables or exhibit an increased observer order of at least twice the plant order. In this article, a novel observer normal form for strongly observable linear time-invariant multivariable systems is proposed. In contrast to classical normal forms, the proposed approach also takes the unknown inputs into account. The proposed observer normal form allows for the straightforward construction of a higher-order sliding mode observer, which ensures global convergence of the estimation error within finite time even in the presence of unknown bounded inputs. Its application is not restricted to systems which satisfy the aforementioned limitations of already existing unknown input observers. The proposed approach can be exploited for the reconstruction of unknown inputs with bounded derivative and robust state-feedback control, which is shown by means of a tutorial example. Numerical simulations confirm the effectiveness of the presented work.},

Then, using an augmented Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional, a distributed-delay-dependent sector condition, some advanced inequalities and some congruence transformations, sufficient conditions are established under which the state trajectories of the closed-loop systems are bounded and meanwhile, the H ∞ performance can be guaranteed. The anti-windup compensator gain can be explicitly solved by means of linear matrix inequalities. For the case of constant delay, the corresponding result is also presented.

Based on the direct Lyapunov method and a recently appeared factorisation for expressions in the differential mean value theorem, convex modelling and Finsler&#39;s lemma are combined to incorporate restrictions into the analysis. Two generalisations are thus achieved: the inner-loop feedback is allowed to use velocity estimates instead of the real values and the outer-loop feedback becomes fully nonlinear while taking into account the parallel characteristics of mechanisms. Moreover, both the observer and the controller design conditions are linear matrix inequalities, which can be efficiently solved via commercially available software.

The research on it is significant in the view of wide applications in practice. In this paper, taking an uncertain 3-degree of freedom PUM with a free first joint as a benchmark example, we discuss its position control issue. Specifically, an integrated control method is developed, including the nonlinear model prediction control (NMPC) based on an improved particle swarm optimisation (PSO) algorithm and the discrete-time fast terminal sliding mode (FTSM) control. The PSO-based NMPC is proposed for planning discrete trajectories of the active joint angles in real time, along which the manipulator end-point can reach the desired position. Then the discrete-time FTSM controllers are designed to keep the active joints tracking the discrete trajectories, where the uncertainties related to the active links/joints are estimated by time delay estimation method. Besides, the influence of the uncertainties related to the free link/joint on the system can be made up by the NMPC in real time. It is confirmed via simulations that the above method can achieve the accurate positioning of such an uncertain manipulator.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates model order reduction (MOR) methods of discrete-time systems via discrete orthogonal polynomials in the time domain. First, this system is expanded under discrete orthogonal polynomials, and the expansion coefficients are computed from a linear equation. Then the reduced-order system is produced by using the orthogonal projection matrix that is defined in terms of the expansion coefficients, which can match the first several expansion coefficients of the original output, and preserve the asymptotic stability and bounded-input/bounded-output (BIBO) stability. We also study the output error between the original system and its reduced-order system. Besides, the MOR method using discrete Walsh functions is proposed for discrete-time systems with inhomogeneous initial conditions. Finally, three numerical examples are given to illustrate the feasibility of the proposed methods.},

Based on the Lyapunov function with a new looped-functional, the stability condition is derived by using a bidirectional fragmentation of a sampling interval from t k t k tk to t k + 1 t k + 1 tk+1 , which is divided into two sides forward and backward directions based on time t . For the bidirectional regions, the new looped functional is constructed by taking into account relations between states defined at the fragmented time and the sampling time.

In this paper, a solution is presented by proposing a disturbance observer-based adaptive nonlinear model predictive control scheme for a class of nonlinear MIMO systems. Our scheme requires the state and parameterdependent state-space model to linearise the nonlinear system along the prediction horizon. To cope with the unknown system uncertainty, the multiple estimation model and the concept of second-level adaptation [Pandey, V. K., Kar, I., &amp; Mahanta, C. (2014).

To ensure the boundedness of the estimated parameter, a projection-based adaptive law [Hovakimyan, N., &amp; Cao, C. (2010). L1 adaptive control theory: Guaranteed robustness with fast adaptation. SIAM.] is used. Using a twin-rotor MIMO system (TRMS), the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm has been verified. Simulation and real-time results show that the proposed control algorithm performs better than the existing control algorithm in the presence of unknown external disturbance and parameter uncertainties.},

If the robot&#39;s operating environment is underwater, the problem becomes even more complicated due to its three-dimensional nature and the communication restrictions. In this paper, we propose an algorithm appropriate for target searching in unknown underwater environments. The proposed method considers a homogeneous decentralised multi-robot coordination scheme applied from a single-robot configuration to a large swarm. In this model, simple agents (SA) form smart swarms (SS), despite SA do not need to have a strong ability to transmit search and location information, and the SS can efficiently perform search tasks in unknown environments. Specifically, when a swarm performs a search task, agents only search according to the simple strategy and share mapping information within their communication range, enhancing search efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and that search time reduces proportionally by increasing the number of robots comprising the swarm, while the repetition search rate does not increase with the expansion of the swarm size. We believe that our SS architecture provides insights into the future application of swarm intelligence.},

The presence of affine terms makes switched systems have multiple switched equilibria and brings further difficulties in the stability analysis, control synthesis and avoiding Zeno behaviours compared with the non-affine switched systems. To overcome these difficulties, first, a convex combination approach is employed to acquire a set of attainable equilibria limited by the system matrix, the delay term matrix, and affine terms. Second, a mode-dependent event-triggered mechanism with sampled-data information is established, which not only ignores Zeno behaviour but also effectively reduces network resource waste. An input-to-state practical stability criterion is proposed for the closed-loop system by converting the event-triggered control system into a time-delay system and introducing a less conservative time-dependent Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional. Moreover, a sampled-data switching law and a set of executable controllers are also co-designed. Finally, an application example of the flyback DC–DC converter demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed result.},

To estimate the virtual leader&#39;s state, we devise an adaptive event-triggered observer for leaders. In that case, followers are required to converge to the convex combinations of the leaders&#39; outputs. Similarly, another observer is designed for followers to estimate the state information of the convex hull. With the TVF shapes and local sampled information of the designed observers, two distributed event-based protocols are proposed for leaders and followers based on the output regulation framework. Continuous communications are not required for either control laws updating or triggering functions and it is proved that Zeno behaviour is strictly excluded for each agent. Finally, a simulation example is provided to demonstrate the practicability of the theoretical results.},

The state estimates are generated from measurements collected by multiple sensing nodes whose information are transmitted via communication networks under scheduling of the Round-Robin protocol. The purpose of the addressed problem is to design an optimal state estimation algorithm in the sense of least mean square with an unknown initial condition in the existence of possible data missing. By resorting to the batch form technique, the optimal filter is proposed by minimising the estimation error covariance in the sense of matrix trace subject to the unbiasedness constraint. Then, a recursive computational algorithm is exploited for the optimal filter to facilitate practical realisation. Finally, simulations are carried out to demonstrate that the proposed method can be utilised to handle missing measurements in the multi-sensor systems when the initial states are unavailable, which outperforms the Kalman filter especially in the initial stage.},

Based on this approach, a sufficient condition with less conservatism is established to guarantee that the closed-loop system is regular, impulse-free, exponentially stable in mean square and extended dissipative. Determining the parametric matrices of the controller via the obtained sufficient condition is difficult, since some parametric matrices factor between two nonsquare matrices. A dynamical output feedback control scheme is proposed by utilising a vital result which is proposed inspired by Projection lemma. It is worth noting that no conservatism is introduced in controller design due to the sufficiency and necessity of this result.

The agents can receive the information from their neighbours, and only some agents, not all agents, can obtain the reference trajectory. Firstly, the distributed MIMO MFAC-based consensus tracking strategy for each follower agent with fixed communication topology is proposed. The proof of tracking convergence for this control strategy indicates that each agent can follow the reference trajectory. Then, we prove the MFAC-based consensus tracking scheme can be also applied to the MASs with switching topologies. Compared with prior work, the main features of this paper are that the dynamic models of agents are built only using real-time input/output data, and the MFAC-based consensus strategy can be utilised for MIMO MASs with switching topologies.

Links to numerous established numerical differentiation algorithms like the Savitzky-Golay filters are discussed. Recent tuning approaches that are reviewed facilitate a parametrization for a good estimation accuracy without relying on trial-and-error approaches, which is essential for industrial applications. The use of these guidelines is demonstrated using two concrete examples: Identification of system parameters from noisy measurements and numerical inversion of the dynamics of analogue anti-aliasing filters. Moreover, an extensive literature survey with various applications of these methods by the control community in all engineering areas is presented. The problems solved include, but are not limited to, parameter estimation, state reconstruction, feedback control, fault diagnosis, anomaly detection, fault-tolerant control, and model-free control.

Two distinct characteristics of this study are that the considered system suffers from the input-quantised actuator, and the system states are expected to converge to zero in prescribed finite time. To address these, a time-scale transformation, that can change the original stabilisation into the finite-time stabilisation of the transformed one, is first introduced. Then, under the new framework of equivalent transformation, a quantised state feedback controller that achieves of the performance requirements is developed with the aid of the recursive technique. Finally, simulation results of a unicycle-type mobile robot are provided to confirm the efficacy of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {The application of neural networks can present some limitations for the control of strongly nonlinear systems. In this paper, a new control scheme based on a neural multicontroller (NMC) is proposed. Indeed, the developed strategy considers a set of local neural controllers which adapt their parameters thanks to an online adaptation algorithm. The instantaneous choice of the adequate local controller is based on a switching mechanism. The advantages of the proposed method are (1) to avoid the computational complexity issues due to the search for an optimal adapting rate when a single neural controller is used, and in presence of strongly nonlinear systems, and (2) to improve the control law by selecting the suitable controller which generates the most valid control law satisfying the desired closed-loop performances. Numerical examples are illustrated to evaluate the performance of the proposed control scheme compared to the classical one. An application of the new strategy on a chemical reactor model validates satisfactory results.},

Through model transformation, the consensus problems of MASs are transformed into the stability problems of the corresponding error systems. By using algebraic graph theory and Lyapunov stability theory, some sufficient criteria for MASs to achieve consensus are obtained.

However, the membership degree of an object in hypersoft sets is 0 or 1. In order to express this situation in the range ( 0 , 1 ) ( 0 , 1 ) (0, 1) , many mathematical models have been constructed by considering hypersoft sets together with fuzzy sets and their derivatives. However, these mathematical models require the decision-maker to express the membership degrees. It is a very difficult task for a decision-maker to determine a value in ( 0 , 1 ) and the probability of an error is very high. For this reason, the concepts relational hypersoft membership degree and inverse relational hypersoft membership degree, which are given less dependent on decision-makers, are proposed in this paper. Moreover, two decision-making algorithms are given to use these concepts in an environment of uncertainty. Finally, the decision-making process for the given algorithms is analysed.},

First, the robust trajectory tracking is achieved by controlling the tracking error to zero. The specific implementation strategy is to construct an augmented system including the tracking error and then transform the robust tracking control problem into an optimal control problem by selecting a suitable cost function. Then, a neural network identifier is built to reconstruct the unknown dynamics and a policy iteration algorithm is adopted by using a critic neural network. In this way, the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation can be solved.

The above approaches are applied to a CE150 helicopter with abrupt and intermittent faults on sensors. The innovations of this paper are as follows: (i) The nonlinear and slow–fast time-scales are described by a united continuous-time fuzzy singularly perturbed model, and based-it a FFD is designed, which can avoid the incomplete decoupling problem caused by decomposition methods; (ii) The sensor faults are expressed by the superimposed faults on state variables when the continuous-time fuzzy singularly perturbed model is constructed, which is less conservative than existing methods; (iii) In the FFD design, the first-order derivative model of the estimate function for sensor faults is established, and it is combined with a fuzzy observer, which can improve the detection accuracy of the FFD; (iv) H ∞ control technology is introduced into the FFD design process to suppress external disturbances.},

  abstract     = {This paper examines the control design for parameter-dependent input-delay linear parameter-varying (LPV) systems with saturation constraints. A linear differential inclusion approach is implemented to formulate the saturation nonlinearity. Subsequently, a gain-scheduled dynamic output-feedback controller is structured to conform to the saturation representation. By means of a Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional, sufficient delay-dependent conditions are derived for the analysis and feedback control synthesis of the closed-loop system in the presence of uncertainties and exogenous disturbances. Disturbance rejection objectives following an induced L 2 -norm and an L 2 − L ∞ norm formulation are examined. Estimation of the domain of attraction with the parametrisation of the admissible LPV controllers is presented. Three different optimisation objectives with respect to disturbance rejection, disturbance tolerance, and domain of attraction expansion are formulated. The proposed design methodology is examined in the context of the air-fuel ratio (AFR) regulation in a spark ignition (SI) engine with a speed-dependent delay and model parameters in the presence of canister purge disturbances and AFR dynamics uncertainty. The injector is restricted in the amount of fuel it can deliver to the cylinder. The three-way catalytic converter&#39;s performance in terms of oxygen storage and emission reduction is taken into consideration. Closed-loop simulation results are provided to validate the methodology.},

The model for denial-of-service attacks (DoS-As) in networked control systems, which mainly destroy the control channel and occur aperiodically with an unknown attack strategy, is constructed. An adaptive event-triggered mechanism (AETM) is introduced to reduce unimportant communication transmissions in a network provided adaptive varying threshold while maintaining satisfactory system performance. By using the Lyapunov function approach, linear matrix inequality (LMI)-based sufficient conditions are obtained to ensure the exponential stability and satisfying the prescribed performance index of the closed-loop systems under DoS-As. Moreover, the feasibility of the jointly developed schemes for the control gain and event-triggered parameters is calculated using the presented LMIs. The potentiality of the proposed scheme is validated using a numerical example.},

First, neural networks (NNs) are applied to approximate unknown nonlinear functions, and an NNs switched state observer is designed to estimate unmeasured system states. Then, the dynamic surface control technique is used to avoid the influence of explosion of complexity. In addition, the problem of output constraints is solved by introducing the barrier Lyapunov functions. Based on the Lyapunov stability theory, all signals in the switched closed-loop system can be verified to be uniformly ultimately bounded under the proposed control method. Moreover, the system output can track the target trajectory well within a small bounded error.

In order to guarantee the convergence performance of such ILC systems, this paper designs an input filter at the actuator side for estimating the controller updated input. Specifically, a P-type learning controller is considered firstly, and then a mathematical model is developed to describe the transmission processes of both measured output data and updated input data with the effect of those noises. On the basis of state augmentation, these two data transmission processes are further combined with the controller learning process to build a filtering model. Finally, according to this filtering model and the orthogonality projection theory, the optimal input filter in the sense of linear minimum variance is designed in front of actuators. The convergence performance of the filtering error covariance matrix is analysed theoretically. Furthermore, because the input filter is designed only with the controller learning process and the two data transmission processes, the convergence performance of any system with the considered controller can be improved by driving with the filtered input.

The controller design method we propose is established by combining two controller design schemes: high-order repetitive control (HORC) and model reference control (MRC). Here, the HORC is used to suppress uncertain periodic disturbances significantly and the MRC is used to track time-varying references without introducing new transient responses. The stability analysis of the resulting closed-loop system is provided and describes how admissible learning gains are determined to achieve stability and a desirable convergence rate. The efficacy of the proposed control method is demonstrated via numerical simulations where the performance of the resulting HO-RMRC is compared with those of the HORC and the MRC as standalone controllers. It is evident that the HO-RMRC outperforms the HORC and the MRC in simultaneously achieving perfect reference tracking and disturbance cancellation/attenuation.},

Based on the generalised progressive hybrid censoring (GPHC) sample, the maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs), and the asymptotic conﬁdence intervals of unknown parameters and the reliability function of the system are obtained by using the numerical procedure and asymptotic normality theory of MLEs, respectively. The Bayesian estimates under squared error loss are derived using the Tierney–Kadane’s (T–K) method. Furthermore, the Bayesian credible intervals are constructed based on Metropolis–Hastings method.

First, IMP and asymptotic TTC are re-formulated and explicated. Second, TTC under internal models of trajectory and disturbance is classified in terms of tracking error bias into bounded; nonzero steady-state; zero steady-state; unbounded (tracking failure). Third, TTC attainability and tracking error biases are examined via asymptotic convergence analysis. In particular, bounded TTC is attainable if trajectory and disturbance are essentially bounded; zero/nonzero-steady-state TTC is attainable if trajectory and disturbance t → ∞ limits are well-defined so that the Laplace ultimate value theorem holds; zero-steady-state TTC is realisable if internal models exactly reflect all unstable modes of trajectory and disturbance. Fourth, when internal models are subject to mismatches and sampled-data approximates, several interesting convergence facts are revealed. More specifically, for addressing zero-steady-state TTC to periodic trajectory and disturbance, stabilisation may be insufficient; for addressing TTC under sampled-data internal models, unknown convergence features are claimed. Finally, TTC controller parametrisation via pole assignment stabilisation is scrutinised under static output and state feedback. Numerical examples are included to illustrate the main results.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we solve the trajectory tracking control problem of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) with actuator faults and model uncertainties. In order to achieve the output tracking with prescribed transient performance, we develop a novel tan-type barrier Lyapunov function (BLF)-based funnel tracking control strategy to constrain the position tracking error of the AUV within prespecified performance funnels. Furthermore, to maintain the predesigned transient tracking performance of the AUV when the actuator fault occurs, an event-triggered adaptive fuzzy fault-tolerant control (FTC) scheme is proposed to compensate actuator faults. Meanwhile, to handle the uncertainties caused by the system model, fuzzy logic systems (FLSs) are adopted to approximate the unknown hydrodynamic parameters and actuator fault parameters. Different from the existing results, the communication burden and the excess wear from the controller to the actuators are reduced utilising the event-triggered mechanism. By using the theory of Lyapunov stability, it is proven that all the signals of the closed-loop system are semiglobally uniformly bounded. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by a simulation example.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the problem of designing distributed state estimation solutions for a network of interconnected systems modelled by linear time-varying (LTV) dynamics in a discrete-time framework. The problem is formulated as a classical optimal estimation problem, for the global system, subject to a given sparsity constraint on the filter gain, which reflects the distributed nature of the network. Two methods are presented, both of them able to compute a sequence of well-performing stabilising gains. Moreover, both methods are validated by resorting to simulations of: (i) a randomly generated synthetic LTV system; and (ii) a large-scale nonlinear network of interconnected tanks. One of the proposed methods relies on a computationally efficient solution, thus it is computed very rapidly. The other achieves better performance, but it is computationally more expensive and requires that a window of the future dynamics of the system is known. When implemented to a nonlinear network, approximated by an LTV system, the proposed methods are able to compute well-performing gains that stabilise the estimation error dynamics. Both algorithms are scalable, being adequate for implementation in large-scale networks.},

It is assumed that the only available information concerning the main jump process comes from a detector, so that the jump and detector processes can be modelled as a hidden Markov model. Initially, it is considered that the system&#39;s dynamic matrix is subject to parametric uncertainties. By assuming a full row rank condition for the output matrix and employing a clusterisation technique for the state space of the hidden Markov model, it is derived a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) that guarantees robust stability in the mean-square sense of the closed-loop system, as well as a bound on its H 2 norm. It is also shown that this design technique is linked to the bounded real lemma, so that a new set of LMIs conditions can be obtained for the ‘pure’ H ∞ control problem, which can be extended to cover the robust polytopic case. The paper is concluded with an illustrative example.},

In order to save the bandwidth resources, a new event-triggering mechanism (ETM), called torus-event-triggering mechanism (TETM), is utilised for data transmission. Compared with the traditional ETMs, the TETM has two thresholds, which will not only discard the sampling data smaller than the lower threshold but also hold back the packet larger than the upper threshold. The main purpose of this paper is to design a time-varying distributed fusion filter such that: (1) the probability of the filtering error falling in a given ellipsoid domain is greater than a specified value and (2) the ellipsoidal set is minimised in the sense of matrix norm at each time point. To achieve the above-mentioned purpose, sufficient conditions are given to obtain the global fusion with the help of the recursive linear matrix inequality technique. The desired local filter parameters are then computed by solving an optimisation problem with some inequality constraints. Finally, a numerical simulation is given to illustrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed distributed fusion strategy.},

Furthermore, considering that the amount of information needs to be transmitted is decided by the coupling relationship, missing information rate is assumed to be node- and coupling dependent. By introducing another nonhomogeneous Markov chain with transition probability matrix depending on coupling mode, the asynchronous synchronisation controller is designed, which can describe complex asynchronous switch phenomenon between system and controller modes and covers mode-dependent controller and mode-independent one as two special cases. Three sufficient conditions respectively guaranteeing the global synchronisation and the H ∞ global synchronisation of the addressed networks are obtained, and then the asynchronous synchronisation controller design method is proposed.

  abstract     = {Input saturation is very important for the analysis and design of control system. Ignoring the input saturation will have an adverse effect on the control system, and even cause the control system to be unstable. In practice, almost all the control systems are affected by input saturation, involving switched systems, multi-agent systems, robot systems and spacecraft rendezvous systems, etc. In the past few decades, a large number of research results have been obtained on input saturation. This paper attempts to give an overview through a bibliometric analysis based on the publications related to input saturation which were published from 2010 to 2020 and retrieved from the Science Citation Index Expanded database. We give a detailed discussion based on countries, institutions, research areas, journals, authors and author keywords. The main results show that Automatica takes the leading position among the top 10 academic journals, followed by International Journal of Robust and Nonlinear Control and IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control . China ranks a leading position in this field, followed by the United States and France. Harbin Institute of Technology has the topmost total articles, citations and h-index. The future research works are highlighted and we summarise the conclusion in end.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers the problem of the semi-global asymptotic stabilisation of fractional-order (FO) linear systems subject to actuator saturation by output feedback. To solve the problem, a family of observer-based linear output feedback laws, parameterised in a positive scalar, is proposed by means of the low gain feedback design technique. The design applies to FO linear systems that are stabilisable and detectable, but not exponentially unstable. For such an FO system under the proposed observer-based linear low gain output feedback, the peak value of the control input for a given initial condition can be made arbitrarily small to avoid actuator saturation by decreasing the value of the parameter towards zero and thus semi-global asymptotic stabilisation is achieved. To obtain these results, we establish the properties of low gain feedback, derive asymptotic expansions and the bounds of high-order derivatives of the Mittag-Leffler (ML) functions to estimate the state responses of FO linear systems, and explicitly construct a Hermitian matrix to satisfy a linear matrix inequality (LMI) stability condition for FO linear systems. The results in this paper extend the corresponding results for integer-order (IO) linear systems.},

The convergence analysis theorem is deduced mathematically. Further, using similar steps, event-triggered PD-type ILC and event-triggered PID-type ILC are proposed.

  abstract     = {Model structure selection for nonlinear system identification has been widely studied over the last 30 years due to its great importance. There are many methods in the literature to deal with structure selection, although these methods have their specific benefits, they face some difficulties in selecting the structure for a parsimonious model. In this paper, two methods based on the Randomised Model Structure Selection (RaMSS) approach are introduced in order to deal with the structure selection problem. The first one is the Randomised Model Structure Selection with Error Reduction Ratio (RaMSS-ERR) that uses the error reduction ratio as a filter for the terms analysis, improving the convergence, and the second one is the Randomised Model Structure Selection with Genetic Inheritance (RaMSS-EGI) that uses a genetic inheritance in order to get a faster convergence. The methods were applied to benchmark models and the results are encouraging. Applications to systems with a large candidate regressor set and to a continuous stirred-tank reactor are also carried out. The results show that the proposed method may be used to identify both linear and nonlinear model structures with a reduced number of iterations, computational time, and number of explored models.},

The existing literature about decentralised robust control by adaptive critic designs (ACDs) is mostly time-triggered which requires extensive communication and computation. To extend the ACD framework and save the communication and computational resources, the event-triggered decentralised control using ACDs is investigated. First, we utilise a series of auxiliary subsystems to restructure the interconnected systems in a distributed way, so as to transform the robust control problem into the corresponding optimal control problem. Then, adaptive critic designs with event-triggering mechanism are investigated to solve the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equations via local policy iteration algorithm. The single-critic networks are employed to achieve the approximation of optimal value functions. The Lyapunov stability proof ensures the asymptotic stability of the whole system and the uniform ultimate boundedness of the critic neural networks. Finally, an interconnected plant is employed to demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed method.},

By this method, a PID controller is designed to ensure the Hurwitz stability of a time-delay system with any order of transfer function. First, the possible range of the derivative part that makes the system stable is obtained. Then, the stability region is found by applying the Hermite–Biehler theorem. It is shown that this theorem can be extended to quasi-polynomials functions in the form of ψ ( ν , e ν ) to find the stability region of systems with time delay under certain conditions. Using this, the proposed approach can guarantee specified gain and phase margins for time-delay systems; therefore, it is very beneficial and advantageous for the control of practical plants.

By combining backstepping control design with the finite-time control technique, a novel adaptive fuzzy tracking control is developed, which can accelerate the convergence speed and improve the robustness of the PMSM servo systems. Moreover, the asymptotic tracking control can be achieved with the aid of a scaling function.

The objectiveness of this paper is to investigate security weakness of DW-based detection for GRAs. Firstly, unlike replaying history data from replay attacks, data accuracy compromised by GRAs is analysed, where their characteristics are similar to that compromised by replay attacks, and the current data are distorted by typical GRAs such as injection, replacement and scaling attacks. Secondly, considering the corresponding hidden Markov models of different types of GRAs, the stealthiness is quantified by auto covariance of residuals and cross covariance between residuals and watermarking signals. It is found that if both auto and cross covariance keep unchanged or increase along with watermarking intensity increasing, GRAs cannot be detected effectively. Thirdly, after DW-based detection is invalid for GRAs, it is proved that the stability of closed-loop systems for open-loop unstable dynamics will be destroyed, or the admissible system state bounds can be crossed within a finite time. Finally, experiments are operated on a networked inverted pendulum platform, and experimental results confirm security weakness of DW-based detection for GRAs.},

  abstract     = {This paper develops a novel self-discipline predictive control (SPC) scheme to compensate the missing control inputs of networked control systems (NCS) under arbitrary bounded packet dropouts. Since no feedback measurements are available when there are packet dropouts, the key idea of SPC scheme is that one can adjust its controller gains only based on the latest received state measurement rather than waiting the next available measurement. Then, the future controller gains are predicted by using input delay approach while input to state stability (ISS) is arrived under Lypunov–Krasovskii method and switched system framework. In what follows, the SPC scheme based on the predicted controller gains are used to update the control inputs during packet dropout intervals. A main advantage of this work lies in that the proposed SPC scheme realises a self-stabilisation with only limited feedback measurements under large-scale packet dropouts. At last, simulations on path following control of autonomous vehicles are carried out to show the validity of the proposed SPC scheme.},

  abstract     = {This article presents an adaptive fuzzy asymptotic tracking control method for switched nonlinear systems with state constraints. The fuzzy logic systems are employed to dispose the lumped unknown dynamics. The state constraints are addressed with the aid of the barrier Lyapunov function. Moreover, drawing support from some well-defined smooth functions, the asymptotic tracking controller is recursively constructed based on backstepping technique. Through Lyapunov analysis and the common Lyapunov function method, it is shown that the system output tracking error asymptotically converges to zero and all system signals are bounded under the switching signal. Finally, the validity of the developed scheme is elucidated by simulation example.},

  abstract     = {Bio-inspired optimisation algorithms have recently attracted much attention in the control community. Most of these algorithms mimic particular behaviours of some animal species in such a way that allows solving optimisation problems. The present paper aims at applying three metaheuristic methods for optimising fuzzy logic controllers used for quadrotor attitude stabilisation. The investigated methods are particle swarm optimisation (PSO), BAT algorithm and cuckoo search (CS). These methods are applied to find the best output distribution of singleton membership functions of the fuzzy controllers. The quadrotor control requires measured responses, therefore, three objective functions are considered: integral squared error, integral time-weighted absolute error and integral time-squared error. These metrics allow performance comparison of the controllers in terms of tracking errors and speed of convergence. The simulation results indicate that BAT algorithm demonstrated higher performance than both PSO and CS. Furthermore, BAT algorithm is capable of offering 50\% less computation time than CS and 10\% less time than PSO. In terms of fitness, BAT algorithm achieved an average of 5\% better fitness than PSO and 15\% better than CS. According to these results, the BAT-based fuzzy controller exhibits superior performance compared with other algorithms to stabilise the quadrotor.},

The randomness of trial length is modelled as a discrete stochastic sequence. Firstly, we study the output controllability of the control system over a finite time interval. It is shown that the control system is completely controllable if and only if the input–output coupling matrix (IOCM) is full-row rank. Secondly, we propose an intermittent learning scheme with state feedback. It is strictly proved that under appropriate constraints on the learning gain and the IOCM, the ILC system with RVTL has full learning ability if and only if the probability that the trial length is equal to the desired one is greater than zero. There must exist state feedback such that the ILC process is monotonically convergent. Meanwhile, we illustrate that the proposed convergence conditions can ensure the almost sure convergence property of system output.

The density-aware exploration means how a team of agents (robots) cover a given domain, reflecting a priority of areas of interest represented by a density distribution, rather than simply following a preset of uniform patterns. To achieve the density-aware multi-agent exploration, the optimal transport theory that quantifies a distance between two density distributions is employed as a tool, which also serves as a means of similarity measure. Energy constraints for a multi-agent system are then incorporated into the OT-based density-aware multi-agent exploration scheme. The proposed method is developed targeting a decentralised control to cope with more realistic scenarios such as communication range limits between agents. To measure the exploration efficiency, the upper bound of the similarity measure is proposed, which is computationally tractable. The developed multi-agent exploration scheme is applicable to a time-varying distribution as well, where a spatio-temporal evolution of the given reference distribution is desired.

  abstract     = {Most control systems require a fairly accurate model of dynamic system to design or implement a controller. When system dynamics change, the dynamic model must undergo online or offline re-estimation. The online model estimation algorithms in the time domain, especially for large models in presence of sensor noise, model uncertainty and external disturbance are almost inaccurate and unstable. In this paper, based on the dynamic model characteristics a novel online robust meta-heuristic adaptive Bi Conjugate Gradient Stabilized (Bi-CGSTAB) algorithm is proposed to estimate the model parameters and attitude simultaneously. First, the model is estimated iteratively using the output of attitude estimation from the Kalman filter algorithm, and the attitude is estimated by the output of estimated model from the least square method. The estimation method focuses on the solving algorithm of the matrix equations of the model estimation. The online robust meta-heuristic adaptive Bi-CGSTAB method uses the information of previous iteration in the current iteration to set the solving-steps toward the local optimums. This method leads to a broader and more intelligent search in the Krylov subspace of answers. The numerical results show a higher performance, robustness and more accurate model estimation than the other stated methods in the paper. 50\%},

Secondly, controllers for the step backward HOFA models are designed, which result in constant linear closed-loop systems with arbitrarily assignable eigenstructures. The related problem of feasibility is also discussed. The well-known discrete-time feedback linearisable systems and strict-feedback systems are shown to be equivalent to both the step forward and step backward HOFA models. Finally, a generalised step backward HOFA model containing control vectors of different time instants is proposed and investigated and demonstrated with a type of proposed pseudo feed-forward systems.

In this regard, the multiple-model methodology has been beneficial over the past couple of decades. However, the application of this methodology requires proven indirect model reference adaptive control. Such a gap exists in the case of discrete-time linear time-invariant systems with unknown parameters. The principal contribution of this paper is to fill this void by arriving at proof of global stability of discrete-time adaptive systems that use the prediction error rather than the control error to update the parameters of the prediction model. This proof is based on the theory of Lyapunov and the properties of square-summable sequences. An analysis of the available literature reveals that such a result is not available even for linear time-invariant systems. Therefore, the proof is first provided for adaptive systems with a single prediction model wherein the transfer function of the plant has an arbitrary relative degree. Subsequently, this proof is extended to the case of multiple prediction models in the context of multiple-model methodology with second-level adaptation. Two parameter update algorithms are considered. Simulation studies are included to demonstrate the improvement in transient performance.},

First, a nominal fixed-time controller is originally designed based on the bi-limit homogeneous method. The nominal fixed-time controller can guarantee the position and velocity tracking errors converge to zero in fixed time in the absence of lumped disturbance. Then, a new type of fixed-time disturbance observer is introduced to estimate the lumped disturbance in fixed time. Finally, a robust fixed-time controller is developed by integrating the nominal fixed-time controller with the fixed-time disturbance observer. The robust fixed-time controller can guarantee the position and velocity tracking errors converge to zero in fixed time even in the presence of lumped disturbance. Benefiting from the feedforward disturbance compensation, the robust fixed-time controller has the strong robustness and excellent disturbance attenuation capability. Numerical simulations and comparisons demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed control approach.},

It is desired to regulate large angular orientation, suppress the flexible link’s transverse vibrations and compensate the boundary disturbance simultaneously. The amount of elastic boundary vibration has remained within the constraint range. By considering novel Barrier-Integral Lyapunov functional in order to prevent the amount of boundary deflection from violating the constraints and avoiding any simplifications, in the presence of external boundary disturbance, proper control feedbacks and boundary disturbance observer are adopted in order to reach control objectives and to compensate external boundary disturbance effects simultaneously. By choosing proper boundary feedback, system states are proven to be uniform ultimate bounded and converge exponentially toward a small neighbourhood of zero.

  abstract     = {This paper presents a prescribed performance control for MIMO stochastic discrete-time nonlinear systems in a strict-feedback form using a set of noisy measurements. The prescribed performance control is proposed as follows. Transforming the un-constrained states into the constrained states, the proposed prescribed performance control with state constraints is designed based on the approach of backstepping control and the Lyapunov function without using approximate approaches. The nonlinear uncertainty is approximated as the fuzzy logic system based on the simplified extended single input rule modules to reduce the number of the fuzzy IF–THEN rules. The estimator to take the estimates for the unmeasurable states and the adjustable parameters is in a simplified structure designed. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is indicated through the simulation experiment of a simple numerical system.},

In order to make full use of the limited network bandwidth caused by sensor energy constraint, a transmission channel assignment method is established, and a weighted try-once-discard (WTOD) protocol is employed for each channel. A WTOD protocol-dependent periodic controller is designed to ensure that the slave periodic NNs can synchronise with the master one.

  abstract     = {Tracking control of general dynamical systems in high-order fully actuated (HOFA) system representation is solved. For the case of tracking a constant or slow time-varying signal in the presence of constant or slow time-varying disturbances, a generalised PID control scheme is proposed, which realises asymptotical tracking to a prescribed signal and also guarantees that the state derivatives of certain orders converge to the origin. For the case that the signal to be tracked is generated by a reference model, a model reference tracking (MRT) controller is presented, which relies on the solution to a type of generalised Sylvester matrix equations and guarantees the desired asymptotical tracking requirement. Due to the full-actuation property of the HOFA models, closed-loop systems under both control schemes are constant and linear. Furthermore, based on a general parametric solution to the type of Sylvester matrix equations and a general parametric eigenstructure assignment result, simple and complete parameterisation of the two types of control designs are provided, and feasibility conditions in terms of the system initial values for sub-fully actuated systems are also derived. An illustrative example is presented to demonstrate the application of the proposed approaches and their effects.},

In this sense, the multi-robot coordination evolves from a distance formation control to a power-based dispersion strategy. Thus, with the use of feedback through RSSI levels, the heading angle between the agents and the differences of its orientation angles, the control law becomes decentralised, avoiding the need of distance sensors. The result applies to a group of robots with a directed spanning tree topology, with root in the leader and the rest of followers are formed with respect to a unique local leader. The approach considers distinct radiation patterns found in Bluetooth or WiFi communication devices. As the approach ensures the convergence to desired values of RSSI, then a connectivity between the wireless nodes can be adjusted to maintain a desired communication data rate and wireless coverage by the robots posture. Simulations and real-time experiments illustrate the performance of the system.},

By introducing a subsystem that can be linearised as a linear system, controller gains can be solved by the pole placement method. Compared with the existing techniques, the proposed method can achieve a transient performance like a linear system with the pole placement method instead of constraining the system in a predefined performance range. Meanwhile, the proposed method does not change the structure of adaptive backstepping controllers, which preserves the advantages of the original backstepping design and avoids increasing the computing effort for the control system. In addition, the applications of the proposed method are demonstrated by three examples, including a 2nd-order nonlinear system, a 3rd-order nonlinear system, and a single-link robot arm. The corresponding simulations are conducted, and the simulation results are illustrated and analysed. Moreover, comparative simulations are conducted to verify the proposed method.},

Then, a decentralised fault-tolerant tracking controller is designed for the considered interconnected time delay systems using both backstepping control procedures and a dynamic event triggering mechanism, which has the smaller event trigger frequency by comparing the traditional static event-triggered control scheme, such that the tracking error signals converge to a small neighbourhood near the origin and all the signals of the closed-loop system are globally bounded.

Optimal filter gains with optimal parameters are designed to obtain a local minimum upper bound of filtering error covariance matrix, where optimal filter gains include an optimal Kalman filter gain for each sensor node and optimal multi-consensus filter gains for state estimates of its neighbour nodes. Our proposed DKF has a low computational cost because the calculation of cross-covariance matrices between estimates of sensor nodes is avoided.

Second, with the aid of a reformulated Lipschitz property, the nonlinear error dynamics are converted into a linear parameter varying (LPV) networked system model. Third, based on this model, the finite-frequency H _ / L ∞ index is used to measure the worst-case fault sensitivity performance and the H _ norm from unknown disturbance to residual is used to measure disturbance robustness performance. Next, a residual evaluation and a dynamic threshold are synthesised based on the L ∞ norm. Furthermore, sufficient conditions of the FDO design are derived and transformed by a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs).

  abstract     = {In this paper, the problem of asynchronous sliding mode control (SMC) is addressed for discrete-time singular Markovian jump systems (DSMJSs) with external disturbances and randomly occurring nonlinearities. Moreover, the states of DSMJSs are unavailable for measurement, and the synchronisation between the controller and the system modes is not surely ensured. Our attention is mainly focused on solving the control problem by proposing an observer-based adaptive sliding mode controller for such a class of complex systems. First, a non-fragile observer is designed not only to estimate the system states but also to relax the multiplicative gain variations and to construct an appropriate mode-dependent sliding mode surface function. Then, by assuming that the bounds of nonlinear terms are unknown, an adaptive SMC control law is synthesised to drive the system trajectories onto the specified sliding surface and completely compensate for the influences of the external disturbances and fluctuations of the controller and observer gains. Sufficient conditions are established to ensure that the closed-loop system is stochastically admissible with a γ level of the mixed H ∞ /passive performance, and to provide the observer and controller gain matrices. Finally, to numerically substantiate the efficacy of the proposed control scheme, two examples are given.},

  abstract     = {In real systems, control inputs are often constrained, and the constrained controllability problems are far more difficult to deal with than the unconstrained controllability ones. In this paper, we consider the constrained controllability problem of discrete-time bilinear systems. Specifically, we study the bounds of the control inputs for the systems to be controllable. Our approach is to first prove constrained near-controllability of a special class of bilinear system and then use constrained near-controllability to approximate constrained controllability of general bilinear systems. Based on this approach, we derive conditions for constrained controllability of the systems, where the upper bound of the control inputs can be easily computed. Algorithms and examples are provided to demonstrate the results of this paper.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we present a speed regulator for a force-driven cart-pole system. The proposed controller allows bringing the pole towards its upright position, while the cart moves asymptotically at desired constant speed, recovering the position regulation when we assign a desired constant position of the cart. The main motivation for addressing speed regulation is to broaden the scope of control of underactuated mechanical systems, because so far, the control of this class of mechanical systems has been focused primarily on position regulation; and therefore, there is few information and results available on broader control objectives, such as speed regulation. In particular, we design a speed regulator for the cart-pole system, as this system is one of the more representative test benches of underactuated mechanical system found in many automatic control research laboratories. Another novelty is the introduction of an alternative energy shaping approach for the velocity control design of a class of underactuated mechanical systems. A complete asymptotic stability analysis based on the Lyapunov theory and the Barbashin–Krasovskii theorem is presented. Local asymptotic stability is concluded. Simulation results upon a force-driven cart-pole model illustrate the performance of the proposed controller.},

However, the inherently complexitiy of slack matrices has not been considered until now, which is an open problem. In this paper, novel flexible polynomial-based functions (FPFs) are proposed by constructing flexible polynomials. Not only the inherently complex dimensions of the slack matrices but also higher-order time delays and zero components in the existing works are relaxed. Benefitting from FPFs, two representative stability criteria are, respectively, obtained for linear delay systems. According to the two stability conditions, all permutations and combinations of flexible vectors in FPFs can be freely chosen.

Firstly, a discrete-time disturbance estimator design with immersion and invariance (I&amp;I) approach is presented for the n-degrees of freedom (DOF) fully actuated mechanical systems. Then, a discrete-time combined feedback linearising and backstepping control is established that this controller uses the estimated disturbance information. Global asymptotic stability of the estimator and local asymptotic stability of the entire closed-loop system in an arbitrarily large compact set are shown utilising the Lyapunov stability theory. In order to show the effectiveness of the proposed composite observer-based discrete-time control method, it is applied to the 3-DOF robotic manipulator. Performance of proposed direct discrete-time combined feedback linearising and backstepping controller with discrete-time I&amp;I observer is compared with a direct discrete-time conventional second-order sliding mode controller with another discrete-time nonlinear disturbance observer via simulations. The superior performance of the proposed method is demonstrated with simulation results.},

The contribution of this study is to improve switching controller robustness at the switching instances and also guarantee the L 1 L 1 L1 –gain performance of the positive systems. Positive systems are widespread; most of the biological, economic systems, disease, etc., have nonnegative variables belonging to this class of systems. Positive Systems modelling encounters different types of uncertainties; therefore, stability analysis and stabilisation of uncertain SPLSs are crucial in analysing positive systems. The stability of the SPLSs can be guarantee by using multiple copositive Lyapunov functions with the Dwell Time (DT) strategy. The stability of the SPLS has been investigated under synchronous and asynchronous switching modes. The so-called asynchronous switching means that the switches between the candidate controllers and system modes are asynchronous. Also, the L 1 –gain performance of the system is derived. Finally, two illustrative examples are provided to demonstrate the proposed scheme’s effectiveness compared with the foremost existing solutions.},

Since it is directly aimed at a nonlinear nonaffine system, an iterative dynamic linearisation method is employed to transfer it to a linear data model. Then, the QC-DDILC method is developed by the use of optimisation technique for the learning control law and the parameter updating law, respectively, where the quantised output from the E-DM is used. Since the direct output measurement of the system is unavailable, the linear data model is also acted as an iterative predictive model to estimate the system outputs utilised as the compensator in the consequent QC-DDILC. The proposed QC-DDILC is a data-driven method without relying on any explicit mechanism model information. The convergence analysis is conducted by using the mathematical tools of contraction mapping and induction. Simulations verify the theoretical results.},

The main purpose of the paper is to determine the membership degrees between parameters and objects by minimising the effectiveness of the decision maker, and thus to build an impressive decision-making approach. For this, the concepts ‘Bipolar Relational Membership Function’ and ‘NOT Bipolar Relational Membership Function’ are defined and some important properties are given. Thanks to these proposed concepts, it is ensured that the decision maker is asked to express only firm judgments as 0 and 1, and the membership degrees between ( 0 , 1 ) can be determined.

Then, the output feedback control approach, in the backstepping framework and the event-triggered mechanism, is presented. It contains the adaptive backstepping control and the approximately optimal control via adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) technology, and the computation cost and transmission load are reduced while guaranteeing that the performance index of the system is approximately minimised.

Firstly, the Gauss Error Function is introduced to solve the difficulty arising from the saturation nonlinearity. Meanwhile, to overcome the problem of calculating explosion caused by the repeated differentiation of the virtual control signals, a finite-time command filter with a compensation mechanism is developed. Combining the neural networks&#39; approximation ability and the backstepping technique, an adaptive neural finite-time control strategy is proposed for the considered system by constructing the time-varying barrier Lyapunov function. Under the proposed control strategy, it is guaranteed that all signals are bounded in a sense of mean square, the output of the system can track the reference signal within a finite time and all states will not violate the constraints. Furthermore, the stability of the closed-loop system is analysed based on the stochastic finite-time stability theory.

However, for large-scale (high-order) systems, these well-established FO techniques become rigorous and lead to an infeasible solution. To overcome this issue, this paper proposes a three-fold control policy. The first step finds the optimal reduced-order (low-order) model using Big-Bang, Big-Crunch (BB–BC) optimisation algorithm. Based on the obtained reduced model, the control structure is formulated in the internal model control (IMC) framework. The controller acquires a PID form followed by an additional term and FO integrator. Unlike the FO-PID controller which demands five tuning parameters, the proposed controller requires only two tuning parameters whose evaluation is done on the basis of user specified gain crossover frequency and phase margin. To substantiate the design approach, a detailed simulation study has been carried out, in which the problems of tracking control, disturbance rejection, and time-delay compensation are illustrated.},

The optimal switching point plays a key role in preventing a possible collision due to a ‘mis-timed’ change of manoeuvre, in case the obstacle shows unanticipated motion. Moreover, it also ensures that tracking is resumed at a point which minimises tracking error under the said deviation from the desired path.

Moreover, the human user teleoperates all the six coordinates of the former robot arm and two coordinates of the latter robot arm, i.e. the teleoperator can move the treatment tool on the plane given by the workpiece surface. Furthermore, a force sensor attached to the treatment tool is used to automatically attain the desired pressure between the tool and the workpiece and to automatically keep the tool orientation orthogonal to the workpiece surface. In addition, to assist the human user during the teleoperation, several constraints are defined for both robot arms in order to avoid exceeding the allowed workspace, e.g. to avoid collisions with other objects in the environment. The theory used in this work to develop the bimanual robot control relies on sliding mode control and task prioritisation.

In the infinite-time output regulation case, the solution is in essence a nonlinear state feedback dependent on a well-known Riccati algebraic equation. In the sub-fully actuated system case, the feasibility of the controller is investigated and guaranteed by properly characterising a ball restriction area of the system initial values.

For reducing the energy consumption and data amount, we propose a topology optimisation and an iterative parameter identification method for estimating the common model factors in WSN. The former method optimises the decentralised topology such that all the leaf nodes in a community connect to the head node directly. A circle topology is built to enable the remote leaf nodes to link to the head node through two adjoining relay nodes to reduce the whole communication distance and power consumption. Based on the optimised topology, an iterative identification method is proposed to minimise the information capacity by transmitting the processed results instead of raw data to reduce the data amount for calculation and storage. Then, we prove the consensus and convergence of the proposed identification method. Finally, two simulations verify the effectiveness of the proposed method and the comparative results present the data reduction for the on-board calculation, communication, and storage in the practical use of WSN.},

  abstract     = {If a dynamic system has active constraints on the state vector and they are known, then taking them into account during modeling is often advantageous. Unfortunately, in the constrained discrete-time state-space estimation, the state equality constraint is defined for a parameter matrix and not on a parameter vector as commonly found in regression problems. To address this problem, firstly, we show how to rewrite the state equality constraints as equality constraints on the state matrices to be estimated. Then, we vectorise the matricial least squares problem defined for modeling state-space systems such that any method from the equality-constrained least squares framework may be employed. Both time-invariant and time-varying cases are considered as well as the case where the state equality constraint is not exactly known.},
