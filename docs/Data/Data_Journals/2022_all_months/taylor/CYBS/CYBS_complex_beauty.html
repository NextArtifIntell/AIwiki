  abstract     = {Wireless Sensors Network (WSN) face various challenges such as localization, security issues, deployment of node, clustering, and data aggregation. In addition, certain technological issues in WSN such as spatial distribution, higher energy utilization, small memory, bandwidth, and so on are also noticed. The proposed protocol comprises of four various stages such as (1) user registration, (2) remedy, (3) attack prediction, and (4) reloading. Initially, a new Modified Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) model is introduced to ensure the secure communication. Moreover, the implemented approach also focuses on the attack prediction phase, where the Optimized Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model is exploited for detecting the Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack. Here, the training of RNN is carried out by Shark Smell Optimization with Opposition Learning and Mutation Process (SSOL-MP) via tuning the optimal weights. At the end, analysis is done for validating the enhancement of the suggested model.},

As being one of the most promising technology in today’s world, P2P systems exploit computation, bandwidth and other resources at the edge of the Internet, with the lower cost of building and maintenance. In the past, a lot of research has been done to improve the reliability of P2P systems focusing on paradigms like- routing strategies, reliable file exchange, resource location and placement, security. However, not much effort has been focused on studying their overall reliability incorporating essential failure causes altogether. In this research work, the authors have designed a mathematical model for a P2P network using Markov Process to holistically determine the availability, reliability and MTTF (Mean time to failure) and examined the most vulnerable components in the system whose failure rates can be controlled to achieve a more reliable network. In such networks, performance is affected to some degree due to failure or disturbance in any component.},

And, terroristic events being a topic of national importance, receives enormous response from the citizens. Unfortunately, miscreants with anti-national agendas incite the large available audience on these platforms against the country by inducing anti-national content amid terrorist attacks. The social media platforms being of informal use are commonly observed to have users opinionating using multiple languages in same sentence called code-mixing. The over-arching goal of research done is to identify anti-national code-mix textual content on YouTube in the form of comments on terrorism-related videos. We collected YouTube comments on videos related to terroristic events in Kashmir region of India, which consisted of code-mix comments in Hindi (native language of India) and English languages. The paper presents a novel deep-learning-based transformer model HE-CM-BERT, i.e. Hindi-English code-mix BERT, where we extend the vocabulary of pre-trained multilingual BERT with code-mix vocabulary extracted from the collected data to automate the detection of anti-national code-mix text. The comparative analysis of the proposed model with the state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning models depicts that it outperforms the existing ones.},

Accordingly, we develop an AHC framework based on clusters clustering along with an innovative similarity criterion that performs clustering through ensemble approaches. The proposed algorithm consists of three main steps. In the first step, a group of single AHC methods are combined to detect relationships between samples and as well as the formation of initial clusters. The similarity of the samples is calculated using an innovative similarity criterion based on the clusters created. In the second step, all the initial clusters created by different methods are re-clustered to form hyper-clusters. After clusters clustering, each sample is assigned to a hyper-cluster with maximum similarity to create the final clusters in the third step. The comprehensive experimental study has been performed to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm based on several benchmark datasets from the UCI machine learning repository. The results clearly show that the proposed ensemble AHC-based framework performs better than the state-of-the-art methods.},

Whether it is from worms, Trojan horses, or ransomware, malware analysis and detection techniques have undoubtedly a vital role in protecting the cyber world. Due to the limitations and time-consuming nature of other static and dynamic analysis strategies, researchers have looked into image processing-based malware analysis and detection methodologies in the recent past. The executables are converted to grayscale or color images, and image processing techniques are being used to classify them into benign and malicious categories and across their corresponding families. This paper presents a detailed study on malware executable images and their effectiveness in detecting and classifying malicious samples, focusing on different executable to image conversion strategies, feature engineering approaches, and the classification models in use. A detailed insight on the performance overview and future perspective of various image-based malware detection methods is also presented.},

Deep learning-based methods for computer vision tasks, such as image segmentation, can effectively be applied to remote sensing data for generating water body maps of large cities, aiding managerial entities, urban planners and policymakers. The robustness of these models to erroneous pixel level training class labels has not been studied in water body segmentation context. Label noise is commonly experienced in classification tasks and may hinder the performance. We collected and densely labeled Sentinel-2 images over Dhaka, one of the most densely populated and flood prone megacities in the world. We synthetically injected four types of label noise viz., i) Gaussian noise, ii) translation, ii) rotation, and iv) mirroring. Our primary objective is to observe and quantitatively analyze the effects of label noise on remote sensing data-driven deep learning models for water body segmentation. Our results show that salt and pepper noise (injected artificially using Gaussian noise) of only 50% can cause a massive 48.55% drop in Intersection-over-Union score. The consequences of learning from training data with different magnitudes and settings of label noise have been explored.},

The dynamic model of a translational oscillator with rotational actuator is generated through Euler-Lagrange analysis. This model undergoes approximate linearization around a temporary operating point that is recomputed at each time-step of the control method. The linearization relies on Taylor series expansion and on the computation of the associated Jacobian matrices. For the linearized state-space model of the system, a stabilizing optimal (H-infinity) feedback controller is designed. This controller stands for the solution to the nonlinear optimal control problem under model uncertainty and external perturbations. To compute the controller’s feedback gains, an algebraic Riccati equation is repetitively solved at each iteration of the control algorithm. The stability properties of the control method are proven through Lyapunov analysis. Finally, to implement state estimation-based control without the need to measure the entire state vector of the TORA the H-infinity Kalman Filter is used as a robust state estimator.},

Several research findings identify knowledge sharing as a means for an organization to improve its competitiveness. Knowledge sharing can be defined in a variety of ways, but it essentially refers to the exchange of knowledge from an information giver to an information receiver. This is a purposeful activity that adds value to the client organization, particularly in IT system that employs Agile methodology. For the scope of this paper, we are going to consider only Agile knowledge transfer in IT projects that occurs in two angles: business knowledge transfers from client to consultant; and IT technical knowledge transfers from consultant to client. However, when interdisciplinary teams are involved in Agile IT projects, the knowledge transfer mentioned before remains inefficient once the knowledge loss persists throughout the project life cycle. The conversion of conceptual knowledge, which only exists in the brains and minds of individuals, into explicit knowledge is essential for organizations to gain and maintain competitive advantages over its competitor. This study proposes an alternative conceptual framework to address conceptual knowledge transfer in IT projects that use Agile methodology.},

  abstract     = {The entire manufacturing spectrum is transforming with the advent of Industry 4.0. The features of Set of Experience Knowledge Structure (SOEKS) and Decisional DNA (DDNA) were utilized for developing Virtual Engineering Objects (VEO), Virtual Engineering Process (VEP) and Virtual Engineering Factory (VEF), which in turn facilitate the creation of smart factories. In this study, DDNA based Machine Monitoring for Total Maintenance in Industry 4.0 framework is demonstrated. The concept of VEO is used for the Tool and Equipment Monitoring, while for the Plants Operations Monitoring and Quality Monitoring, VEP and VEF are employed. Query extraction feature of DDNA is exploited for Adaptive Control. This study shows that Machine Efficiency (ME) can be monitored along with analysis of machine KPI’s like breakdown time, setting time, and other losses. Moreover, reports can be generated efficiency-wise, breakdown-wise, operator-wise. The data of these reports is used to predict and make future decisions related to machine maintenance.},

The NK-DNA is a promising knowledge representation approach for acquiring, storing, sharing, and reusing knowledge among machines and computing systems. We introduce the decision tree-based generative method for knowledge extraction and representation to make the NK-DNA more explainable. We examine our approach through an initial case study. The experiment results show that the proposed method can transform the implicit knowledge stored in the NK-DNA into explicitly represented decision trees bringing fair interpretability to neural network-based intelligent systems.},

This system comprises of three primary modules, each of which has been developed to cater to a need for digital knowledge capture for smart manufacturing in the areas of product design, production planning, and inspection planning. Manufacturing Capability Analysis and Process Planning (MCAPP) module is an important module of the SVPD system, and it involves the provision of manufacturing knowledge to experts working on product development at the early stages of the product lifecycle. In this research, we firstly describe the structure and working mechanism of the SVPD system’s MCAPP module. This is followed by validation of the MCAPP module’s Manufacturing Process Planning (MPP) sub-module against the key performance indicators (KPIs) by using our threading tap case study. Our results verify the feasibility of our approach and show how manufacturing knowledge relating to features and functions can be used to enhance the manufacturing process across similar products during the early stages of product development. An analysis of the basic concepts and methods of implementation show that this is an expert system capable of supporting smart manufacturing which can play a vital role in the establishment of Industry 4.0.},

In this study, we proposed a blockchain-based architecture for the e-commerce sector where data mining technology is used to detect fraudulent users by generating precise and effective rules, and smart contracts are used for enforcement and functionality management within the blockchain network. Our data mining approach yielded a competitive accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-measure of over 99% compared to the state-of-the-art. High performing rules are further tested for ten simulated cycles under completely unseen data to test their rigidity in a real-time scenario. Details analysis of delineation (if any) in rule antecedents has also been analyzed for these cycles. Tested and selected rules are stored in smart contracts deployed within blockchain network for security and immutability. For ensuring strict order criteria maintenance, better return policy, authentic review and scam avoidance, two smart contracts have been written which implement seller reputation mechanism and authentic review maintenance while safeguarding the seller from intentional defaming too. Altogether, the goal of this study is to establish a balance between all the parties within an e-commerce platform so that everyone&#39;s right is protected, money is safe and resources are not exploited.},

Such a role has been often called collective intelligence, which is commonly considered as a group of members acting as single unit can outperform any single individual (even an expert). Arguably, the main objective of collective intelligence is to maximize the ability of a collective of members that is not shown by members acting individually. However, not all collectives are intelligent, an intelligent collective is characterized by diversity, independence, decentralization, and aggregation. In this paper, we present recent research results on the use of collective intelligence in social networks. Then, a framework for collective intelligence in social networks with these characterizations is also introduced.

  abstract     = {Over the last few years, the amount of available information has increased exponentially in all professional fields, including the medical field. Modern-day patients have access to a wealth of medical information, whether it be from brochures, newspapers, television campaigns, or internet documents. To facilitate and accelerate the search for medical information, more precise systems have been implemented, such as visual question-and-answer systems. A visual question-and-answer system is designed to provide direct and precise answers to questions asked in natural language. In this context, we propose an optimal deep neural network model based on an adaptive optimization algorithm, which takes medical images and natural language questions as input, then provides precise answers as output. Our model starts by classifying medical questions following an embedding phase. We then use a deep learning model for visual and textual feature extraction and emergence. In this paper, we aim to maximize the accuracy rate and minimize the number of epochs in order to accelerate the process. This is a multi-objective optimization problem. The selection of deep learning model parameters, such as epoch number and batch size, is an essential step in improving the model, thus, we use an adaptive genetic algorithm to determine the optimal deep learning parameters. Finally, we propose a dense layer for answer retrieval. To evaluate our model, we used the ImageCLEF 2019 VQA data set. Our model outperforms existing visual question-and-answer systems and offers a significantly higher retrieval accuracy rate.},

  abstract     = {Cognition in computer sciences refers to the ability of a system to learn at scale, reason with purpose, and naturally interact with humans and other smart systems, such as humans do. To enhance intelligence, as well as to introduce cognitive functions into machines, recent studies have brought humans into the loop, turning the system into a human–AI hybrid. To effectively integrate and manipulate hybrid knowledge, suitable technologies and guidelines are required to sustain the human–AI interface so that communication can occur. However, traditional Knowledge Management (KM) and Knowledge Engineering (KE) approaches encounter problems when dealing with cutting-edge technologies, imposing impediments for the use of traditional methods in cognitive systems (CS). This paper presents a brief overview of the Smart Knowledge Engineering for Cognitive Systems (SKECS), which is based on methods, technologies, and procedures that bring innovations to the fields of KE, KM, and CS. The goal is to bridge the gap in the hybrid cognitive interface by the combination of experience-based knowledge representation with the use of emerging technologies such as deep learning, context-aware indexing/retrieval, active learning with a human-in-the-loop, and stream reasoning. In this work Set of Experience Knowledge Structure (SOEKS) and Decision DNA (DDNA) is extended to the visual domain and utilized for knowledge capture, representation, reuse, and evolution. These technologies are examined throughout the layers of SKECS for applications in knowledge acquisition, formalization, storage/retrieval, learning, and reasoning, with the final goal of achieving knowledge augmentation (wisdom) in CS. Features of the SKECS and their practical implementation is discussed through a case study—the Cognitive Vision Platform for Hazard Control (CVP-HC)—suggesting that methods, techniques and procedures comprising the SKECS are suitable for advancing systems toward augmented cognition.},

Recent studies showed the efficacy of hybridized machine learning (ML)-based models in predicting flood susceptibility. The quality of this prediction depends on the presence or absence of label noise in the training data collected from real world flood inundation maps. However, no study has been conducted to explore the effects of label noise in ML based spatial FSM. In the present study, we have explored the effects of four different random class label noises on the regression performances and model complexities of both standalone and hybridized ML based FSM. We also explored the optimal hyperparameter values of different hybridized ML and reported the robustness of each model in the presence and absence of label noise. The hybridized ML models showed greater efficacy in modeling spatial flood susceptibility in both cases.},

However, the most recent generation of systems dominated by sensing supported context-awareness integrating a variety of data sources and with a higher expectation of personalized services delivered at the right time, place and in the right form, are not well supported. Developers need more guidance and support to pinpoint those valuable contexts and to work out ways of detecting them and activating the right services associated with these contexts. Our community has reported on various systems they created however not much is emerging in a way of a methodology, a standard, a transferable body of advice and guidance which can help teams next time they need to develop a new system. In this article we explain a couple of complementary methodologies which we have tried and tested through development of different context-aware projects. We argue these are of practical usefulness and provide an initial valid point of discussion for our community to create evolved versions of these which can be tested more widely to identify good practice in the area.},

There are no studies to predict the competency of job applicants based on dimensional values such as level of knowledge, self-motivation, self-concern and role perception. This study proposes a prediction model that uses AI (Artificial Intelligence), this includes a quantitative mathematical model that identifies the level of personnel competency to optimize job performance. The model verifies the discrete and continuous relationship between competency dimensions and their synergetic effects. Four AI algorithms are used to train a data set that contains 362 data elements, consisting of two optimized combinations of dimensional values in step 1, and 360 data elements that are derived from the dimensional relationship that produces the synergetic effects. The proposed model predicts the competence of job applicants and compares this competence with the value gives optimized job performance to optimize the selection of human resources.},

In this approach DWT decomposition is applied to the image which allows a very fine adjustment during the insertion. An SVD is then applied to the three subbands LL, LH and HL, which allows storing the maximum energy of the image in a minimum of singular values. A combination of the three resulting singular value matrices is then performed for watermark integration. The proposed approach ensures data integrity, confidentiality when sharing data, and robustness to several conventional attacks.},

  abstract     = {Multi-criteria group decision making (MCGDM) is an important part of decision science and widely applied in several fields. To cope with the vagueness and ambiguity of the human evaluation in the MCGDM process, interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy set (IVIFS) theory is introduced. In this study, the AHP method whose traditional form is frequently used in MCGDM problems is improved in the IVIF environment. Since the aim of AHP is to choose the most suitable criterion/alternative by making a rank from the most important to the least important, the improved IVIF-AHP method is based on the ranking functions. Some existing score and accuracy functions are analyzed and it is seen that these functions have some limitations to rank IVIF numbers. So, new score and accuracy functions of IVIFS are developed to overcome their limitations and these new functions are integrated into the IVIF-AHP method. The comparative results show that the improved IVIF-AHP method gives a consistent ranking for the criteria. Moreover, the proposed method steps are illustrated with a case study about prioritizing some technical and soft skills over industrial engineering and electrical engineering.},

  abstract     = {Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly morbid and lethal disease with poor prognosis. Their emergent properties such as cellular heterogeneity, therapy resistance, and self-renewal are largely attributed to the interactions between a subset of their population known as glioblastoma-derived stem cells (GSCs) and their microenvironment. Identifying causal patterns in the developmental trajectories between GSCs and the mature, well-differentiated GBM phenotypes remains a challenging problem in oncology. The paper presents a blueprint of complex systems approaches to infer attractor dynamics from the single-cell gene expression datasets of pediatric GBM and adult GSCs. These algorithms include Waddington landscape reconstruction, GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks), and fractal dimension analysis. Here I show, a R o ¨ ssler-like strange attractor with a fractal dimension of roughly 1.7 emerged in all n = 12 patients’ GAN-reconstructed patterns. The findings suggest a strange attractor may be driving the complex dynamics and adaptive behaviors of GBM in signaling state-space.},

In this paper, the main objective is to tackle the load forecasting problem with the intention of enhancing the prediction performance by combining and testing different multi-modal deep learning approaches and architectures in order to process and relate information from multiple modalities. The benefits of using multi-modality instead of one modality, applied to the time series modeling problem of short-term load forecasting is therefore investigated. The models are trained and evaluated using the hourly temperature and electrical consumption in addition to auto-regressive variables as the first modality. The day type characteristic, such as: weekends, week days, bank holidays, religious holidays etc., may be considered as a second modality. The approach liability is tested by comparing the empirical results of different Deep architectures namely: Stacked Denoising Auto- Encoders (SDAEs) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), with multiple and single modalities where processing the same task of one day ahead load forecasting.},

The magnetic bearing system for pump impeller consists of two pairs of magnetic coils, one pair at each end of the impeller. These coils are injected by the required control currents to produce the necessary magnetic field for correctly suspending the axial motions of impeller in both horizontal and vertical planes. The adaptive backstepping control algorithm has been established by following a rigorous Lyapunov-based stability analysis, to prove the asymptotic convergence of errors in the presence of unknown external uncertainty. The setting of design parameters for the adaptive controller is another issue which has been solved by suggesting particle swarm optimization to tune the design parameters of adaptive controller toward optimal performance. The computer simulation showed that the optimal adaptive controller could successfully and quickly suspend the impeller for both regulation and tracking scenarios irrespective to all initial deviations of rotating shaft under exerted disturbance. Also, the developed adaptive laws of proposed adaptive controller could estimate the uncertainty without drift, which ensures the asymptotic convergence of errors.},

Details of the proposed strategies for both the rectifier and inverter stages of the IMC are presented. Thus, a rectifier control strategy based on voltage-oriented control using space vector modulation is proposed. In addition, the control objective of the direct power control (DPC) inverter is the regulation of the active powers of the PMSG according to references established on the basis of the maximum power point tracker (MPPT) of the wind turbine, and also a good tracking of the output reactive power to its reference ensures unit power factor (UPF). A numerical simulation investigation is conducted to investigate the fast-dynamic performance of the proposed control systems during the wind speed variation. The obtained results in simulation are then complemented with tests in laboratory environment, the DPC control system is implemented on a dSpace DS1104 real time board. Selective experimental results are presented using a laboratory prototype of the wind energy conversion system to demonstrate the resulting improvements of the developed system. The results achieved have been clearly responded to the follow-up of references even under fluctuating wind conditions, and show promising relevance of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Renewable energy or alternative energy is extracted through renewable resources. These are considered as an alternative from conventional fossil fuel-based sources because conventional energy sources are depleting rapidly and raised concerns over increasing environmental impacts. Among many renewable sources, solar energy has a substantial part to meet the increased energy demand with reduced environmental effects. Solar irradiance and temperature are key factors upon which photovoltaic (PV) power generation depends but its optimum operating point gets affected by variation in the above-mentioned environmental factors. Finding the optimum operating point is a challenge due to the nonlinear solar behavior and varying nature of environmental conditions. To overcome these challenges, maximum power point (MPP) searching algorithms are exploited to get optimum power from the PV energy system. Maximum power point tracking (MPPT) behavior is different for various weather conditions, for instance, partial shading (PS), and uniform irradiance (UI) conditions. Numerous MPPT methods came to be used to find the optimum power. This work deals with the development of a novel technique for MPP finding of a PV system on the basis of the Water Cycle Algorithm (WCA) under PS conditions. It turns out to be good in terms of exploration and exploitation. Thus, it has the capability to avoid getting stuck in local minima (LM) and to find the global maxima (GM). The performance of the WCA technique is examined on four different types of P-V patterns for UI, PS and fast changing environmental conditions through MATLAB simulation and experimental setup. The findings of WCA are compared with the previous well-known soft computing methods such as PSO, ACS, DFO, and conventional method P&amp;O to evaluate performance. The outcomes reveal that the WCA algorithm overtakes P&amp;O from the perspective of robustness, accuracy, efficiency, and stability, as well as PSO in respect of converging speed and efficiency.},

The second approach is a simple P-type iterative learning fuzzy control scheme to solve the trajectory tracking problem for MIMO nonlinear systems. The control design is applicable to deal with a class of nonlinear systems without satisfying the global Lipschitz continuity condition, for which a fuzzy logic term is added to cope with unknown parameters. In addition, the swarm optimization algorithm is used to design the optimum iterative learning fuzzy control (ILFC). Using Lyapunov theory, the asymptotic stability of the closed loop system is guaranteed over the whole finite time.

  abstract     = {A collaborative mobile robot has been developed for tea plucking in narrow terrain tea gardens. The robot executes stable side-by-side motions and carries most of the load of the tea harvesting machine. The robot is controlled with adjustable autonomy so that the human can provide a supervisory role and adjust the optimal height and forward speed of the cutting tool. During tea plucking, the robot can autonomously detect the tree rows and avoid colliding with the trees. The experimental results show that the proposed collaborative robot can stably co-work with humans and significantly improve working efficiency and comfort.},
