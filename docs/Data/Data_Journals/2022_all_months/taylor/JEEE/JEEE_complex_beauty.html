  abstract     = {Breeding tits in the family Paridae let out a hissing call when encountering nest predators, which is thought to be acoustic Batesian mimicry. The antipredator effect of the hissing call of Paridae has only been confirmed in several studies. To identify whether the hissing call of Japanese tits () affects the feeding behavior of the nest predator Swinhoe’s striped squirrel (), we played back white noise, the call of Oriental turtle doves (), and the hissing call of Japanese tits to squirrels. The squirrels responded differently to the three types of sounds played back. The proportion of squirrels that still fed while the hissing call of tits being played (26.1\%) was significantly lower than that when white noise (91.3\%) and the call of doves (85.7\%) being played. The alert time of feeding squirrels to the hissing call of tits was also significantly longer than that to white noise and the call of doves. Our study suggests that the hissing call of tits can change the feeding behavior of the nest predator squirrel, which may reduce nest predation in cavity birds.},

  abstract     = {Resource selection analyses based on detection data are widely used to parametrize resistance surfaces used to identify ecological corridors. To successfully parametrize resistance, it is crucial to decouple resident and disperser behaviours yet to date connectivity studies using detection data have not addressed this issue. Here, we decoupled data of resident and dispersing wolves by analysing detection data collected within a natural corridor crossing a human dominated plain in Italy. To decouple residents and dispersers, we ran a Kernel Density analysis to investigate whether clusters of wolf detection points characterized by sharply higher points’ density exist and checked whether the areas outlined by these clusters (core areas) hold specific characteristics. Habitat selection analysis was then performed to compare the intensity of habitat selection carried out by putative residents and dispersers. We identified a high-density cluster of 30 detection points outlining a small core area stably located in the central part of the park. The dramatic differences of the R and the AUC of the habitat selection models performed inside (R = 0.506; AUC = 0.952) and outside (R = 0.037; AUC = 0.643) the core area corroborated the hypothesis that the core area effectively encloses detection points belonging to residents. Our results show that through simple space use analyses it is possible to roughly discriminate between detection points belonging to resident-behaving and disperser-behaving individuals and that habitat selection models separately performed on these data have extremely different results with strong possible effects on resistance surfaces parametrized from these models.},

  abstract     = {Fish are significant predators of amphibian larvae in streams and larvae can detect these predators through both visual and olfactory cues. The ability to effectively recognize these cues may depend on the evolutionary history of predator and prey such that recently introduced predators may not be recognized as readily as those that have consistently coexisted with the prey species. As such, the relatively recent introduction of rainbow trout () into Southern Appalachian headwater streams where the black-bellied salamander ( and brook trout () naturally coexist has raised concern. The objective of this study was to determine whether black-bellied salamander larvae respond to cues from introduced rainbow trout. To evaluate this, salamander activity metrics (general activity and number of movements) were recorded before and after exposure to either native trout predator cue (brook), introduced trout predator cue (rainbow), or conditioned tap water (control). Larvae were collected from different stream reaches based on their cooccurrence with brook trout only, rainbow trout only, rainbow and brook trout, or no trout predators. Larvae that co-occur with trout reduced their activity when exposed to brook trout predator cue, but their response to rainbow trout predator cue depended on their previous co-occurrence. A follow-up test to determine the influence of alarm cue on predator response indicated that the alarm cue enhanced the response to the rainbow trout predator.},

These three localities represented a gradient of vegetation cover (Kmehin &lt; Shivta Dunes &lt; Shivta Flats) and thus of predation risk. Furthermore, two populations were in sand dunes (Kmehin and Shivta Dunes) and the other in sandy flats. We expected individuals from the same population to show the similar latency, and to differ from that of the other localities. We collected five individuals from Kmehin, 10 in Shivta Dunes, and 12 in Shivta Flats. We tested their latency 3 times in two different contexts (a lit chamber, and the same chamber darked). We found latency to be repeatable in both contexts. Using a generalized linear mixed model, we found support for an interaction between context and site and sex and site. Kmehin individuals had much longer latency in the light than all other combinations, and males had much longer latency in the first period. This supports the hypothesis that different locations can have consistent population phenotypes. We discuss how this effect may be caused by different quantities of predators or different numbers of bold individuals within each population.},

  abstract     = {Males often broadcast conspicuous signals from within mixed-species aggregations to attract mates. In addition to attracting females, however, these displays expose signalers to eavesdropping predators and parasites. For individuals in mixed-species aggregations, the balance between attracting mates and avoiding eavesdroppers is influenced both by the attractiveness of their calls and by the calling activity of conspecific and heterospecific neighbors. Through a process termed “collateral damage”, frogs signaling near heterospecific neighbors that are highly attractive to eavesdroppers can experience drastically increased parasitism compared to those signaling next to conspecifics. Here, we investigate whether the intensity of this collateral damage is influenced by the density of, or the call types produced by, heterospecific neighbors. In phonotaxis trials using hourglass treefrogs as the focal species and túngara frogs as the attractive heterospecific neighbor, we found no differences in the number of parasites attracted to hourglass treefrog calls played adjacent to simple versus complex túngara calls. By contrast, a higher density of neighboring túngara frogs decreased the collateral damage suffered by hourglass treefrogs by approximately 40\%. Our results demonstrate that the density of nearby heterospecifics can modulate parasitism risk due to collateral damage in mixed-species aggregations. Thus, our conception of the dilution of eavesdropper risks with increasing group size may need to be augmented to include the effects of multiple prey or host types.● Heterospecific call type does not change collateral damage on hourglass treefrogs● However, parasitism decreases when calling next to high densities of heterospecifics},

We investigated activity patterns of a guild of mesocarnivores (red fox, Pallas’s cat and beech marten) and their prey (Siberian marmot, Daurian pika, Brandt vole, Mongolian gerbil and Mongolian silver vole) using 21 camera traps (effort = 1155 camera days) in Central Mongolia from 25st of May to 20th August 2019. Activity patterns of mesocarnivores were cathemeral (i.e. no difference between diurnal, nocturnal and crepuscular detections, although activity peaked at sunrise). Among prey, the Siberian marmot and the Daurian pika were diurnal, whereas the Mongolian gerbil and the Mongolian silver vole were not generally crepuscular. Beech marten, the smallest mesocarnivore species, was temporally segregated from the other (and larger) mesocarnivore species. Temporal segregation between mesocarnivores and prey was evident between the following pairs: red fox vs Brandt’s vole and Mongolian gerbil; Pallas’s cat vs Siberian marmot, Brandt’s vole and Mongolian gerbil; and beech marten vs Siberian marmot, Daurian pika and the Mongolian silver vole. Activity overlap between mesocarnivores and prey ranged considerably. Activity overlap between the beech marten and prey was lower than that of the other mesocarnivores. Temporal overlap among mesocarnivores and between mesocarnivores and prey seemed to be related to species-specific traits, while also being mediated by local prey abundance. We suggest future surveys should be stratified based on habitat and on the target species, while also integrating different survey methods (e.g. camera traps and live trapping of small mammals).},

  abstract     = {Although habitat fragmentation is widely reported to affect species survival and distribution, its effect in terms of host-parasite interactions in small mammal communities is poorly studied yet. Using information collected from carcasses of 34 road-kill and two preyed-upon individuals, we present the first comprehensive study dealing with the relationship between habitat fragmentation and the presence of different ectoparasite species infecting a small population inhabiting the Apennine ridge. We predicted that the probability to find individuals infested by parasites would be lower in highly fragmented areas because of the trade-off effects over both mammal and ectoparasite communities. Our findings showed that the most frequent ectoparasites were the squirrel fleas and hard ticks . Males showed higher presence of ectoparasites than females, probably because of different behaviour in space use and higher hormone levels, which may compromise host’s resistance to infection. As to the relationship with habitat fragmentation, we did not find support that individuals in highly fragmented areas would be less susceptible to infestation because of lower red squirrel relative density. The presence of highly suitable habitat patches in fragmented habitats may have favoured the presence of squirrels, hence promoting transmission among specimens. Similarly, we did not find support that habitat fragmentation would have reduced the likelihood of generalist ectoparasites transmission among squirrels. This finding may be explained by the increasing tolerance of generalist ectoparasites towards habitat fragmentation because of the presence of species (e.g., roe deer ) able to better exploit ecotonal areas. We believe that our research provides interesting preliminary results on ectoparasites infesting red squirrels in the Apennine area, and of the potential impact which habitat fragmentation may have on them. Nevertheless, the effect of habitat fragmentation over parasite communities is still poorly considered, and further researches are needed.},

However, such effects are usually expected to be contingent on a spatiotemporal co-occurrence of defended and undefended species. Associational resistance may emerge in communities of larval anurans where tadpoles of different species share a generalized morphology but vary in chemical defences. In Europe, the marsh frog reproduces in fish-containing habitats that earlier in the season can be used by the common toad , a species with chemically defended larvae. In a mesocosm experiment, we investigated if the associational protection against predation provided by the defended species could be strong enough to last even after the defended prey metamorphose and leave the system. We expected that the higher abundances (both absolute and relative) of chemically defended in the tadpole assemblage exposed to predation by the common carp prior to the occurrence of tadpoles would be related to the increased later survival of in the presence of the same fish. The tadpoles of were highly vulnerable to predation during a 2-week cohabitation with fish. We found no relationship between the survival of and the absolute density or relative proportion of .

  abstract     = {Behavioral repeatability greatly affects the capacity of an individual to respond to varying environments. When multiple behaviors within individuals are repeatable and correlated across time or across contexts, it is termed a behavioral syndrome. However, not all behaviors exhibit the same level of repeatability, and relatively few studies have examined repeatability in amphibians. We examined the repeatability of foraging behavior in the Eastern Red-backed salamander (), a color-polymorphic terrestrial salamander, following a simulated predation attempt. We tested several hypotheses: (1) Simulated predation would negatively affect foraging, increasing latency to feed and decreasing the number of prey items eaten in a fixed time period compared to a control group; (2) Because striped color morphs of are more aggressive, striped individuals would exhibit “bold” behavior by resuming foraging sooner and consuming more prey; and (3) Foraging behavior would be more repeatable for males. We found that the predation treatment inhibited foraging behavior, although neither morphs nor sexes differed in either forging metric. The number of prey eaten was repeatable for all groups of salamanders. Latency to feed, however, was not repeatable for control salamanders. Simulated predation induced repeatable latencies, but when morphs and sexes were analyzed separately, only unstriped and male salamanders were repeatable, suggesting characteristics of these groups related to behavioral syndromes drive this response. We speculate that the greater repeatability of the unstriped morph’s latency to feed may result from more frequent encounters with predators in the leaf litter matrix while foraging. Striped salamanders from the source population, in turn, exhibit greater territorial success, and thus may experience more variation in encounters with predators and conspecifics over the course of their lifespans. Our results illustrate the need to carefully define the behavior and subset of the population to be tested when studying behavioral repeatability or behavioral syndromes.},

Fruit resources were significantly more available in the 2012 dry season than the 2012 rainy and 2013 dry seasons. Overall, foraging and moving were the main activities, and fruits and exudates were the principal food items consumed. During the rainy season, the common marmosets devoted more time to eating fruits, increased the niche breadth and food source revisitation frequency, and used the forest’s middle-strata more often. When we compared between-year data, we found that common marmosets rested more frequently, fed more often on invertebrates and had a broader niche breadth in the 2012 dry season than in the 2013 dry season. The availability of specific fruit resources and invertebrates appeared to influence study group activity budget and diet. Variation in food availability may have reduced diet niche breadth and stratum use. Our study confirms the well-established flexibility of common marmosets, and demonstrates key aspects of their foraging strategy to survive in modified habitats.},

  abstract     = {Performance of vocal signals, such as birdsong, may be a subject to trade-offs among acoustic traits that limit the signal outcomes. Trilled songs in which syllables are repeated in rapid succession present males with a performance challenge resulting in a trade-off between trill rate (rate of repetition) and frequency bandwidth (range of frequency). Individuals of a species might differ in ability to produce high-performance songs that are close to a performance limit. It was suggested that high-performance songs might honestly reveal a high-quality singer, and both males and females might use those songs to detect high-quality singers. To test further this performance hypothesis, I asked whether the usage of song types depended on their performance in the Pale-legged leaf-warbler (), a species with individual repertoires of up to 11 trilled song types. I analyzed 125 song types ( = 25 males) taken from both spontaneous singing and singing elicited by conspecific playback. Songs showed the same performance trade-off between trill rate and frequency bandwidth as found in other passerines. Individuals did not differ relative to one another in their average vocal performance. Males did not preferentially use either high- or low-performance song types in response to playback-simulated territorial intrusion. They also did not modulate the performance of the same song type to signal aggression. Besides, song performance did not differ between predominant song types and all other song types. Since the predominant song type of a given male usually the only one that used in spontaneous singing, a receiver presumably cannot obtain information about the male’s performance ability from his spontaneous singing. Overall, my results did not confirm the role of vocal performance in male–male interaction.},

  abstract     = {Primates spend their daytime engaged in four non-overlapping, time-consuming, biologically relevant activities, namely, feeding, moving, resting, and socializing. The present study addressed two issues relevant to socio-ecological theory and life-history theory: how do individuals re-schedule the time allocated to these activity categories when they live in ecologically relaxed settings, where they are food-provisioned, live under benign weather conditions, and are predator-free? How do individuals trade the different activity categories against each other in a relatively time constraint-free setting? We predicted that feeding and moving times should decrease and resting and socializing times should increase. We also explored the relation of feeding time to resting time and social time to see which activity category is more dispensable when feeding time increases. Here we analyzed the activity time budgets of a group of geladas, and a group of mandrills, housed in captivity in similarly vegetated and large-sized enclosures, and exposed to identical temperate-zone climate conditions, and compared them to time budget data available for wild groups of geladas and baboons. We found that they displayed activity budgets that largely matched those reported for wild groups of geladas and baboons, except moving time that decreased, but in geladas solely. We also found a tighter negative relation of feeding to resting time than to social time. These findings indicate that freeing individuals in a captive setting from the time constraints and pressing demands faced by their wild counterparts does not necessarily cause a significant re-scheduling of their activity time budgets. They also support the “social glue” hypothesis, as an increase of feeding time is associated with a significant decrease in resting, not social, time. The notion of a captivity-typical versus wild-typical profile of activity time budgets appears unsupported given the remarkable overlapping of time budget scores across settings and the huge inter-populational, intergroup, and intragroup variation reported.},

Since it is known that ants act as a disturbing factor on plant assemblages of grasslands, our hypothesis was that vegetation structures suffer from some stressors that affect, in this plant association, the dominant plant structure. We compared the plant assemblages observed in the plots of the anthills with the control grassland assemblages using a diversity/dominance diagram. We recorded 63 plant taxa. The average number of plant species was found to be significantly lower in anthill plots than in control grassland plots. In anthill plots, dominant plant species ( and ) have been found to be different from control grassland plots ( and ). Anthill plant assemblages were found to be significantly different (One-way PERMANOVA) and poorer in terms of species richness, less diversified, and with a reduced species turnover than control grassland plots. Whittaker plot analysis seems to show that the plant assemblages of the control, with greater evenness, emphasize a stressed condition in anthill plant assemblages. Non-metric multidimensional scaling shows a set of species strictly linked to anthills. Our data seem to confirm the role of ants as a stressor in the plant assemblage structures of Mediterranean urban grasslands. However, our results also show that the peculiar ant nest conditions may favor plant species less represented in the grasslands (i.e. ) or even absent in this plant assemblage (i.e. and ), thus increasing the overall local plant diversity.},

Anurans exhibit a great diversity of defensive behaviours and interact with the widest range of predators of any vertebrates. However, there are few systematic and experimental studies of anuran defensive behaviours, which are generally opportunistic. Here, we deploy a range of methods to investigate various facets of anuran defensive behaviour using the cane toad as a model organism. This originally Amazonian anuran is now widely distributed across the globe and has caused several predators to decline at introduction sites where this species is not native, a direct result of its anti-predation defenses. First, we compiled previously published data on anuran predation events to assess the relationship between predator/anuran size and predator size and type. We then performed a systematic experiment to test the hypothesis that there is an ontogenetic variation in cane toad behavioural defense displays, as well as a variation in these displays between males and females. In total, we tested 173 individuals including juveniles, adult males and adult females. We show that the size and type of the predator is related to the size of the anuran as prey and that this, in turn, has led to the adoption of different predation-avoiding behavioural defensive strategies during ontogeny. Our results also indicate that both the sex and the size of anurans influence the adoption of defensive strategies.},

  abstract     = {The emergent field of animal linguistics applies linguistics tools to animal data in order to investigate potential linguistic-like properties of their communication. One of these tools is the “Urgency Principle”, a pragmatic principle stating that in an alarm sequence, calls providing information about the nature or location of a threat must come before those that do not. This theoretical principle has helped understand the alarm system of putty-nosed monkeys, but whether it is relevant for animal communication systems more generally remains to be tested. Moreover, while animal communication systems can convey information via a large set of encoding mechanisms, the Urgency Principle was developed for only one encoding mechanism, call ordering. Here, we propose to extend this principle to other encoding mechanisms and empirically test this with the alarm call system of black-fronted titi monkeys (). We investigated how information about the context of emission unfolded with the emission of successive calls. Specifically, we analysed how contextual parameters influenced the gradual sequential organization of the first 50 calls in the sequence, using methods borrowed from computational linguistics and random forest algorithms. We hypothesized that, if the extended Urgency Principle reflected the sequential organization of titi monkey alarm call sequences, mechanisms encoding urgent information about the predatory situation should appear before encoding mechanisms that do not. Results supported the hypothesis that mechanisms encoding for urgent information relating to a predator event consistently appeared before mechanisms encoding for less-urgent social information. Our study suggests that the extended Urgency Principle applies more generally to animal communication, demonstrating that conceptual tools from linguistics can successfully be used to study nonhuman communication systems.},

  abstract     = {In several species of non-human primates, non-agonistic vocal exchanges can be seen as a primitive form of conversation, as they respect basic temporal rules (i.e. turn-taking, overlap avoidance), the same as those that guide human conversations. Conversational rules have recently been suggested in captive great ape species, yet the only study investigating vocal turn-taking in wild great apes did not find any evidence of such vocal roles. Whether the environmental conditions (captivity versus free ranging) or the social organisation of a given species shape temporally ruled vocal exchanges remain open questions. Here, we investigated general calling patterns of peaceful vocal exchanges in a wild bonobo community. This pilot study revealed that wild bonobos respect the fundamental temporal rules of vocal turn-taking, namely the avoidance of overlapping and the presence of short call-intervals between interlocutors on the order of 2 sec, corroborating findings from captive bonobos. Despite the limited sample size, our finding suggests that vocal exchanges appear context-dependent but neither age nor sex seem to influence their occurrence. While further studies are needed to confirm these observations, this study helps to fill a major gap in research on the vocal communication of wild great apes, paving the way for more extensive comparative studies, representing a further step towards a better understanding of how vocal turn-taking arose in humans.},

In Rapid (&lt; 1 sec, RFM) and Delayed (1–5 sec, DFM) Facial Mimicry the expression emitted by an individual (trigger) is perceived and replicated by an observer. The occurrence of mimicry phenomena has been demonstrated almost exclusively in the play domain. Here, we aim at evaluating the presence of RFM/DFM during playful interactions between infant bonobos (), one of the most playful primate species. We video-recorded 435 play sessions between five infants (&lt; 48 months of age) belonging to the bonobo colony hosted at the Wilhelma Zoo (Germany). Via a frame-by-frame video-analysis, we demonstrated the presence of both RFM and DFM. These two phenomena were enhanced by face-to-face interactions between playmates. Hence, the access to others’ faces allows the player to perceive, decode and replicate signals, thus promoting a mutual intersubjective engagement with the partner. The occurrence of DFM suggests that in bonobos, as in chimpanzees, such mirror event is present just starting from infancy. The less automaticity characterizing DFM compared to RFM could be due to the involvement of more complex and time-demanding cognitive processes. Neither RFM nor DFM increased the duration of play sessions. Probably, the mimicry phenomena in infant bonobos are not recruited for manipulating the sessions, which are highly balanced and fair, but possibly for sharing the playful mood between interacting subjects thus increasing their level of familiarity and affiliation.},

Moreover, the different sensory modalities are initially processed separately by the brain but eventually share neural pathways for communication: a redundancy that might ensure proper signal transfer. Only a few primate species have been studied so far, including rhesus, long-tailed macaques, squirrel monkeys, marmosets, and humans.

  abstract     = {Until recently, human nonverbal vocalisations such as cries, laughs, screams, moans, and groans have received relatively little attention in the human behavioural sciences. Yet these vocal signals are ubiquitous in human social interactions across diverse cultures and may represent a missing link between relatively fixed nonhuman animal vocalisations and highly flexible human speech. Here, we review converging empirical evidence that the acoustic structure (“forms”) of these affective vocal sounds in humans reflect their evolved biological and social “functions”. Human nonverbal vocalisations thus largely parallel the form-function mapping found in the affective calls of other animals, such as play vocalisations, distress cries, and aggressive roars, pointing to a homologous nonverbal vocal communication system shared across mammals, including humans. We aim to illustrate how this form-function approach can provide a solid framework for making predictions, including about cross-species and cross-cultural universals or variations in the production and perception of nonverbal vocalisations. Despite preliminary evidence that key features of human vocalisations may indeed be universal and develop reliably across distinct cultures, including small-scale societies, we emphasise the important role of vocal control in their production among humans. Unlike most other terrestrial mammals including nonhuman primates, people can flexibly manipulate vocalisations, from conversational laughter and fake pleasure moans to exaggerated roar-like threat displays. We discuss how human vocalisations may thus represent the cradle of vocal control, a precursor of human speech articulation, providing important insight into the origins of speech. Finally, we describe how ground-breaking parametric synthesis technologies are now allowing researchers to create highly naturalistic, yet fully experimentally controlled vocal stimuli to directly test hypotheses about form and function in nonverbal vocalisations, opening the way for a new era of voice sciences.},

In contrast to great apes, this latter communicative gestural system has been poorly investigated in monkeys.

According to these collective findings, which are congruent with the ones reported in great apes, it is thus not excluded that features of gestural communication shared between humans, great apes and baboons, may have played a critical role in the phylogenetic roots of language and dated back, not to the Hominidae evolution, but rather to their much older catarrhine common ancestor 25–40 million years ago.},

  abstract     = {This paper reviews the advances made in the study of olfactory communication in New World primates (Platyrrhini) made since the last major review in 2006, particularly the findings on scent-marking. Relatively few papers specifically addressed this topic, and some others include pertinent information collected during studies addressing other research questions. The majority of papers stems from research on callitrichids and night monkeys. Results of the latter studies refute my earlier hypothesis on a link between sex-biased scent marking and the relative importance of paternal care, but emphasize the need for using sexual selection as a theoretical framework for analyzing olfactory communication. The only two papers that examined scent marking in the context of territoriality and intergroup relations rejected a territorial function, but this remains a debated issue. I suggest to exploit the quasi-experimental condition created by habitat fragmentation to address this question. Portable Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) devices have been employed for the first time to examine the chemical composition of scent-gland secretions of wild New World primates. Expanding this technology to examine scent marks in situ and how their chemical profile and thus information content changes after deposition will be a promising approach for the future. Finally, I propose to integrate the theoretical framework developed by Carthey and co-workerson the role of microbes for the mediation of olfactory communication into studies of New World primate scent marking.},

  abstract     = {Over the last 30 years, most research on non-human primate gestural communication has been produced by psychologists, which has shaped the questions asked and the methods used. These researchers have drawn on concepts from philosophy, linguistics, anthropology, and ethology, but despite these broad influences the field has neglected to situate gestures into the socio-ecological context in which the diverse species, individuals, and social-units exist. In this review, we present current knowledge about great ape gestural communication in terms of repertoires, meanings, and development. We fold this into a conversation about variation in other types of ape social behaviour to identify areas for future research on variation in gestural communication. Given the large variation in socio-ecological factors across species and social-units (and the individuals within these groups), we may expect to find different preferences for specific gesture types; different needs for communicating specific meanings; and different rates of encountering specific contexts. New tools, such as machine-learning based automated movement tracking, may allow us to uncover potential variation in the speed and form of gesture actions or parts of gesture actions. New multi-group multi-generational datasets provide the opportunity to apply analyses, such as Bayesian modelling, which allows us to examine these rich behavioural landscapes. Together, by expanding our questions and our methods, researchers may finally be able to study great ape gestures from the perspective of the apes themselves and explore what this gestural communication system reveals about apes’ thinking and experience of their world.},

Intersubjectivity has often been lauded as one of the defining features that separates the social minds and existence of humans and non-human animals. Despite the apparently profound importance of inter-subjectivity for the socio-cognitive functioning of our species, we know surprisingly little about its evolution, nor how its evolution relates to the evolution of other related phenomena, such as empathy. In this review, we embrace the “bottom-up” perspective to consider recent theoretical and empirical advances in the fields of non-human animal cognition and emotion and what they can tell us about how complex socio-emotional capacities evolve. In particular, we focus on great ape species. Given their close phylogenetic relationship to us, great apes (the non-human, extant hominids) offer a unique lens to identify which of our capacities may be evolutionarily derived or phylogenetically shared.},

  abstract     = {The complexity of primates’ singing behavior has long gathered the attention of researchers interested in understanding the selective pressures underpinning the evolution of language. Among these pressures, a link between territoriality, pair-living, and singing displays has been suggested. Historically, singing primates have been found in a few taxa that are not closely related to each other, and, in the last years, their phylogeny has dramatically changed. Hence, we aimed at understanding if the dogmatic association between territorial behavior and a monogamous social structure still holds in the light of current research. Moreover, singing behavior has often been considered a whole, but animals can perform different singing forms depending on how many individuals call simultaneously. Currently, it is unclear to which extent these singing forms are widespread among these primate groups. Given that there is no unique definition for a “song”, “solo”, “duet”, and “chorus”, we envisioned some of the most used descriptions. We then formulated some new definitions that we followed in our review of the presence/absence of these different forms of song organization among singing primates’ taxa. In particular, we suggested that tarsier species that are typically considered non-singers may indeed sing, and we pointed out that non-duetting gibbons may perform duet interactions. We found that, besides duets, chorusing behavior and solo songs are essential features of primates’ communication, but their study is still in a descriptive phase. Moreover, while territorial behavior seems to be conserved in these singing taxa, we highlighted that the monogamous social structure is not the rule. Pair-living plus multi-females groups displaying singing behavior are common too. We suggest that ending to consider these taxa as uniform in their sociality and vocal behavior might be a significant turning point to unravel the different selective pressures that influenced the emergence and organization of such peculiar vocal behavior.},

Moving appendage may divert a predator’s attention away from the body, allowing the prey to escape. Decapod crustaceans, particularly anomuran and brachyuran crabs, have been well studied in terms of autotomy; however, no studies have focused on post-autotomy limb behaviour. We first found post-autotomy limb movement in decapod crustaceans using the porcellanid crab . Porcellanid crabs possess large chelipeds. The porcellanid crab autotomizes the cheliped readily when a predator crab grasps it by the cheliped, enabling it to escape. Our laboratory observations revealed that autotomized chelipeds of moved voluntarily: they repeated closing and stretching movements of the chela and remaining parts on the propodus-carpus joint. The number of strokes (a single sequential closing and stretching movement) and the total stroke duration of the chelipeds were about 28 times and 17 sec on average, respectively. Post-autotomy cheliped movement may further improve the anti-predator defence efficacy of large chelipeds with a hair-trigger autotomy response in porcellanid crabs.},

In general, frogs are not selective predators, but may vary in their capture mode along a continuum between active and passive foraging. In the present study, we assessed the diet of two bromeliad-breeding frogs of the genus (= ) through taxonomic and functional identification (trophic guilds). We innovate in use of trophic guilds of frogs’ preys and use the phytophagous consumption as proxy for favoring bromeliads by frogs. We also assessed the potential relationship between the size of the frogs and that of the prey they ingest, whether consumption rates varied seasonally, and the foraging mode. The results indicated a diet composed predominantly of phytophagous arthropods for both species ( and ). Most of the arthropods consumed belonged to the orders Hemiptera, Diptera and Hymenoptera. We found no significant differences among the number of arthropods ingested in the rainy and in the dry seasons in either species, nor significant relationship found between the frog size and corresponding prey ingested by individual frogs. The foraging mode of frogs was restricted only to vegetative parts of bromeliads and they did not feed on any potential pollinators. Taken together, these results suggested that frogs may favor the host bromeliad and suggest a potential trophic cascade among frogs, bromeliads, and phytophagous arthropods.},

Since the introduction of the fox squirrel in 1904, there have been local extinctions of gray squirrels in parks and natural areas in urban and suburban locations. Little research has focused on the coexistence of these two species with no work with an in-depth focus on their behavior. The objective of this study was to observe the daily activity of gray and fox squirrels in areas where they coexist and those they occupy alone to determine if the presence of the fox squirrel is negatively impacting the behavior of the gray squirrel. Focal animal observations were conducted using the instantaneous sampling method in three habitat types: coexistence, gray squirrel only, and fox squirrel only. Daily activity related to self-maintenance, communication, feeding, and the location in which the animals were observed were recorded within 15-min observations of individual squirrels. There was no negative impact from the fox squirrels; however, there were behavioral similarities among the species when coexisting which suggests niche overlap. An overlap in the use of space and time in shared habitats can be detrimental to the already declining population of gray squirrels in urban and suburban habitats, particularly in times when environmental conditions are less than ideal and resources are less abundant.},

We quantified predator’s stay time, return time and size-specific kills of the prey. The egret spent a similar amount of total time foraging in the three patches; however, it spent more time per-visit in pools containing large-bodied fish and also returned to those pools soonest after leaving to forage elsewhere, suggesting that the predators employ a time management strategy to maximize energetic returns. Furthermore, the egret preferentially killed larger individuals. Such size-selective predation can shift the prey size structure in the landscape and influence the dynamics of species interactions and eventually the structure of the communities.},

Here we studied altitudinal variation in mean body size, age, and growth rate in through 16 sites at different altitudes in the eastern Tibetan Plateau. Our results revealed that mean body size decreased as altitude increased in each sex, which fails to obey Bergmann’s rule, but supports the converse Bergmann’s rule. Frogs at lower altitudes tended to grow faster than individuals of the same species at higher altitudes. Conversely, age of adults did not significantly increase as altitude increased. Therefore, we suggest that lower growth rate limits the mean individual body size at the altitudes, explaining why this species follows the converse Bergmann’s rule. The effect of age cannot be ignored because decreasing body length with increasing altitudes is not significant when removing the effect of age.},

Competitive environments provide the conditions for adjusting reproductive decisions in order to compensate for the negative impacts of competition between individuals, thus maintaining reproductive fitness. This research aimed to test the effect of perceived competition risks for mate choice and their consequences in the reproductive effort of females of the annual killifish induced throughout an audience effect. First, I evaluated the female mate choice using a classic dichotomous preference study based on male size, showing that the females do not show a significant preference for males of any size in a scenario without perceived competition; however, females turn selective under competition risk, choosing the large males. I then evaluated the reproductive effort of females through embryo production without an audience for 10 days, and next with an audience of females for two periods of 10 days. Results showed that females produced significantly more embryos when they perceived a risk of competition. Also, females turn selective under risk of competition, probably due to an increased parental investment expressed by the reduction of the female-male encounters and breeding rate, the increased reproductive effort and the time spent searching a mate. Females that mate with larger males may gain access to more benefits derived from his social status, as best territories and high-quality sites for the spawn, thus increasing the probabilities of survival for the females and their offspring. I propose that, as a life-history strategy to preserve individual fitness, the direction of the sexual selection is modified by the perceived competition risk, and that competition is not necessarily related with the high-cost investments; in fact, it may also have, beneficial effects for the individual female reproductive success.},

  abstract     = {The behavioural repertory for has not been previously reported in literature. Therefore, this study aimed to describe the repertory of behaviours for juvenile , under laboratory conditions. An ethogram was used to categorize activities into seven main behavioural acts; foraging, eating, grooming, locomotion, quiescence (inactive), prolonged agonism and non-agonistic contact. Juvenile daily behaviour (n = 12) were continuously recorded over 72 hr and the time durations for each behavioural act were determined from viewing video footage (n = 864 hr). Activities over 24 hr were derived from percent daily proportions of each behavioural act. Overall, juvenile crabs spent most of their time foraging (54.8\%) and resting (quiescence; 25.4\%), while they performed eating (11.1\%), grooming (5.3\%), locomotion (2.6\%) and displayed agonism (0.8\%) to a lesser extent. Diurnal differences between light and dark phases were significant for foraging, quiescence and eating (  0.05). High occurrences of non-agonistic contact were similarly observed for light (101 events) and dark (93 events) phases, reflecting a gregarious nature for the juvenile stage of . This behavioural repertory represents the first ethological description reported for the species.},

  abstract     = {The moon phase affects the ecology and vocal activity of nightjars (Caprimulgidae). However, some studies have found contradictory results regarding the impact of the moon phase on the vocal activity of nightjars. To increase our knowledge on this topic, we monitored the vocal behavior of two Neotropical nigthjars, the Little nightjar () and the Common pauraque (), over 5 lunar cycles in the Brazilian Pantanal. We tested the relationships between the moon phase and daily vocal output (number of calls uttered) and the proportions of calling activity at dusk, midnight, and dawn. Our results suggest that moonlight stimulated the vocal output of both species, since it was between 6 and 8 times higher during full moon nights than during new moon nights. Likewise, the proportion of calling activity at midnight was significantly higher during full moon nights. In contrast, the proportion of calling activity of both species was higher at dawn during new moon nights than under the full moon. The calling activity of the Common pauraque was also higher at dusk during new moon nights. These findings might be partly related to the much lower vocal output at midnight during full moon nights and therefore higher proportions of vocal activity at dusk and at dawn under new moon scenarios. This is the first study comparing the vocal behavior of two Neotropical nightjars over different moon phases and shows that the impact of moonlight may differ between species and at a daily scale when analyzing the periods with the highest and lowest illumination. The consequences of the increase in vocal output under moonlight are unknown and should be assessed.},

  abstract     = {In the classic theory of sexual roles, females are more careful in their choice of a mate because their reproductive investment is relatively higher. However, increasing evidence shows that males can also be choosy. Mate choice can be based on physical characteristics, such as body size and color ornaments, which have been documented as factors that also influence the maintenance of polymorphism. Here, we experimentally tested whether males of the annual killifish preferentially choose females according to variations in ocelli number on the base of the caudal fin, or according to body size, in classical dual decision experiments. We demonstrated that there is a strong preference of the males of for females with greater numbers of ocelli on the base of the caudal fin (females with 5–7 versus 1–2 ocelli) and for females of larger body size. We also tested whether female body size or number of ocelli are linked to higher fecundity or increased egg size, quantifying the number of embryos produced by the females of each experimental group and measuring the size of their eggs. Our results revealed that large females with more ocelli produced more and larger eggs than large females with fewer ocelli, and than small females regardless of the number of ocelli. These results may suggest that males of that choose large-sized females can mate with genetic quality in parameters directly related to biological success, such as higher egg production of large-sized eggs. This is probably related to a higher hatching percentage, and larger subsequent larvae with rapid growth rates. We therefore propose that large body size and high number of ocelli on the base of the caudal fin in females could have evolved through male mate choice.},

  abstract     = {It was long assumed that only humans can distinguish the living from the dead. Renewed interest in this question over the last decade has led several authors to assert that non-human primates are also aware of death. We investigate this issue by comparing the behaviours of monkeys and great apes toward helpless conspecifics, basing our analysis on published reports. We first examine the behaviours of mothers towards the body of their dead offspring. They may carry the corpse for days or more before abandoning it. They groom, inspect and protect it, sometimes allowing group members to explore it, and rare cases of cannibalism have been reported. No significant difference is observed in the way that monkeys and great apes treat the bodies of infants. We then examine responses to collapsed (still able to move and react) and inanimate (unresponsive or dead) conspecifics. Monkeys and great apes guard, care for and inspect their helpless partners, and also manipulate and mobilise them. Through these actions, individuals may inform themselves about the state of their partners, test their responsiveness and/or attempt to rouse them. It appears that only chimpanzees and gorillas show violent action such as display behaviours and the rough treatment of bodies. They can also make distress calls, and periods of “stunned silence” sometimes occur in chimpanzees, indicating that they are experiencing intense emotion. Finally, we argue that while both monkeys and great apes detect body dysfunction through the victims’ inability to wake up and move, only great apes can understand that something serious has happened. The signs of emotional disturbance reported in them indicate that they may believe that inanimate conspecifics have entered a state of “dormancy”, meaning that they are unlikely to regain wakefulness. However, there is no evidence that any non-human primates are aware of mortality.},
