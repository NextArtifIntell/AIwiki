  abstract     = {Reinforcement learning holds considerable promise to help address sequential decision-making problems, in which Q-learning is one of the most used algorithms. However, Q-learning suffers from overestimation errors, especially when action values in the same state are similar. To reduce such damages, we introduce an internal supplemental action measurement based on the variation of the expected state values between a state transition, which can measure the action causing the state transition. For the reason that the internal supplemental action measurement can increase or decrease the action values according to the action performance, it can increase the gap of the action values, thus reducing the sensitivity to the overestimation error. The experimental results in the Markov chain and the video games demonstrate the performance advantage of applying the internal supplemental action measurement, in which the mean evaluating scores with the internal supplemental action measurement are 131.6% in SpaceInvaders , 187.9% in Seaquest , and 176.6% in Asterix respectively of that without the internal supplemental action measurement.},

In order to support the application of the IoT (Internet of Things) and make use of these image data to get perfect image reasonably and efficiently, it is necessary to fuse these sensed data, therefore the multiple-sensors’ image aggregation becomes a key technology. In this paper, novel FNN-based machine deep learning approach for image aggregation in application of the IoT is proposed. When this approach is done, dynamic learning from eigenvalue transition example can improve traditional learning approach based on static eigenvalue of example. And the neural network is used to be demonstrated its unique superiority of image understanding. FNN-based machine deep learning approach can learn from dynamic eigenvalues, the change of data can be learned and the varieties of the eigenvalue can be understood and remembered. The relative experiments have shown the designed approach for image aggregation is fast and effective, and it can be adapted for the many image applications of the IoT.},

This paper introduces a domain-model-based Bayesian network and related solutions to solve this problem. Our solutions make it easier to add new domains while ensure high accuracy like a flexible brain.

  abstract     = {As applications of neural networks increase in our daily lives, their practicality and accuracy become more of a challenge as they are applied to approximate more complicated functions typically composed of different dependent or independent views. While the complexity of the functions and the number of views to be approximated or simulated increases, the task becomes more complicated and more difficult in that it may eventually jeopardise the classifier’s accuracy and make the results unreliable. This paper surveys an improved active learning method called Enhanced Multi-Learner (EML) to facilitate the approximation or simulation of complex functions via neural networks by distributing the complexities of the task under simulation among an array of learners where each network is responsible for learning a specific view. We experimented with EML realisations through neural networks to solve complex problems where traditional methods did not provide adequate results. These experimental studies were conducted in three different domains and are summarised here. Legacy solutions were also provided in each experiment, and the results were compared. The experimental results indicate the superiority of EML base neural networks in dealing with sophisticated pattern recognition problems.},

However, the collected datasets used for the analysis and prediction of the helpfulness of online reviews often contain some missing attribute values, such as reviewer background and rating information. In related literatures, many studies have either used the case deletion approach to remove the data containing missing values or considered the imputation of missing values by the mean/mode method. However, none of them consider the direct handling approach without missing value imputation for online review datasets by decision tree-related techniques. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the suitability of different types of approaches to solve the incomplete dataset problem of online reviews. Specifically, for missing value imputation, several supervised learning techniques including MICE, KNN, SVM, and CART are examined. Moreover, for the direct handling approach without missing value imputation, CART is also performed for this task. The experimental results based on the TripAdvisor dataset for review helpfulness prediction show that the approach where incomplete online review datasets are handled directly without imputation by CART significantly outperforms the other approaches, including case deletion and missing value imputation approaches.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, breast cancer is one of the leading causes of women’s death in the world. If breast cancer is detected at the initial stages, it can ensure long-term survival. Numerous methods have been proposed for the early prediction of such cancer. However, efforts are still ongoing, given the importance of the problem. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are a prevalent machine learning algorithm, which is very popular for prediction and classification problems. In this paper, an Intelligent Ensemble Classification method based on Multi-Layer Perceptron neural network (IEC-MLP) is proposed for breast cancer diagnosis. The proposed method consists of two stages: parameters optimisation and ensemble classification. In the first stage, the MLP Neural Network (MLP-NN) parameters, including optimal features, hidden layers, hidden nodes and weights, are optimised with the help of an Evolutionary Algorithm (EA), aiming at maximising the classification accuracy. In the second stage, an ensemble classification algorithm of MLP-NN with optimised parameters is applied to classify the patients. Our proposed IEC-MLP method not only reduces the complexity of MLP-NN and effectively selects the optimal subset of features but also minimises the misclassification cost. The classification results have been evaluated using the IEC-MLP over different breast cancer datasets, and the prediction results have been auspicious (98.74% accuracy on the WBCD dataset). It is noteworthy that the proposed method outperforms the GAANN and CAFS algorithms and other state-of-the-art classifiers. In addition, IEC-MLP is also capable of being employed in diagnosing other cancer types.},

  abstract     = {In dynamic environments, external events might occur and modify the environment without consent of intelligent agents. Plans of the agents might hence be disrupted and, worse, the agents might end up in dead-end states and no longer be able to achieve their goals. Hence, the agents should monitor the environment during plan execution and if they encounter a dangerous situation they should (reactively) act to escape from it. In this paper, we introduce the notion of dangerous states that the agent might encounter during its plan execution in dynamic environments. We present a method for computing lower bound of dangerousness of a state after applying a sequence of actions. That method is leveraged in identifying situations in which the agent has to start acting to avoid danger. We present two types of such behaviour – purely reactive and proactive (eliminating the source of danger). The introduced concepts for planning with dangerous states are implemented and tested in two scenarios – a simple RPG-like game, called Dark Dungeon, and a platform game inspired by the Perestroika video game. The results show that reasoning with dangerous states achieves better success rate (reaching the goals) than naive planning or rule-based techniques.},

PRF is used to avoid the limitations of the traditional RF approach, which is a human-in-the-loop process. Although the pseudo-relevance feedback set contains noise, PRF can perform retrieval reasonably effectively. For implementing PRF, the Rocchio algorithm has been considered reasonably effective and is a well-established baseline method. However, it simply treats all of the top k feedback images as being equally similar to the query. Therefore, we present a block-based PRF approach for improving image retrieval performance. In this approach, images in the positive and negative feedback sets are further divided into predefined blocks, each of which contains one to several images, and blocks containing higher- or lower-ranked images will be assigned higher or lower weights, respectively. Experiments using the NUS-WIDE-LITE and Caltech 256 datasets and two different feature representations consistently show that the proposed approach using 30 blocks outperforms the baseline PRF in terms of P@10, P@20, and P@50. Furthermore, we show that a system that incorporates the user’s feedback allows the 30-block-based PRF approach to perform even better.},

  abstract     = {The diagnosis of thyroid via appropriate interpretation of thyroid data is the vital classification issue. Only little contributions are made so far in the automatic diagnosis of thyroid disease. In order to solve Thyroid disorder this paper intends to propose a new thyroid diagnosis model, utilising two-phases includes Feature Extraction and Classification. In the first phase, two sorts of features are extracted that include image features like neighbourhood-based and gradient features, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to extract the data features as well. Subsequently, two sorts of classification processes are performed. Specifically, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used for image classification by extracting deep features. Neural Network (NN) is used for classifying the disease by obtaining both the image and data features as the input. Finally, both the classified results (CNN and NN) are combined to increase the accuracy rate of diagnosis. Further, as the main aim of this work is to increase the accuracy rate, this paper aims to trigger the optimisation concept. The convolutional layer of CNN is optimally selected, and while classifying under NN the given features should be the optimal one. Hence, the required features are optimally selected. For these optimisations, a new modified algorithm is proposed in this work namely Worst Fitness-based Cuckoo Search (WF-CS) which is the modified form of Cuckoo Search Algorithm (CS). Finally, the performance of proposed WF-CS is compared over other conventional methods like Conventional CS, Genetic Algorithm (GA), FireFly (FF), Artificial Bee Colony (ABC), and Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) and proves the superiority of proposed work in detecting the presence of thyroid.},

  abstract     = {In the past two decades, human categorisation research has achieved significant progress via the rigorous and systematic study of concepts in terms of category structures and their families. The importance of these structure families stems from evidence suggesting that learning and categorisation performance are not only limited by low- and high-level generalisation mechanisms but by the inherent nature of the environmental and mental stimuli entertained by observers during the concept learning process. In this paper, we propose a new direction for concept learning and categorisation research based on several dual paradigmatic tensions that hinge on the inherent nature of the components of stimuli, limitations of the innate abilities of the observer to process such components, and the relationship between the two. The tensions range from the various possible properties and constraints of the dimensions underlying categories of object stimuli to various notions of supervised learning capable of significantly altering concept learnability. The substantial extant literature on concept learning research indicates that rigorous empirical investigations targeting these tensions are either non-existent or, at best, severely lacking despite their ecological significance. We shall argue that future theory building about concept learning should attempt to resolve these tensions and that without the proper empirical and theoretical focus on them, concept learning research will fail to achieve its ultimate goals anytime soon.},

The problem has been addressed, making new algorithms and selecting the fittest classifier for a given dataset. The latter approach combined with feature selection and pre-processing form up a new paradigm known as Full Model Selection. This paradigm is like a black box whose input is a dataset, and as an output, a precise classification model is obtained. Despite that, full model selection is not the first alternative with the larger datasets of nowadays. We propose the use of MapReduce to deal with huge datasets, a bio-inspired optimisation algorithm and the use of a novel algorithm based on fuzzy classification rules as a proxy model to guide the optimisation process. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to propose a classification algorithm based on fuzzy rules as a proxy model.

  abstract     = {Given the challenge of gathering labelled training data for machine learning tasks, active learning has become popular. This paper focuses on the beginning of unsupervised active learning, where there are no labelled data at all. The aim of this zero initialised unsupervised active learning is to select the most informative examples – even from an imbalanced dataset – to be labelled manually. Our solution with proposed selection strategy, called Optimally Balanced Entropy-Based Sampling (OBEBS) reaches a balanced training set at each step to avoid imbalanced problems. Two theorems of the optimal solution for selection strategy are also presented and proved in the paper. At the beginning of the active learning, there is not enough information for supervised machine learning method, thus our selection strategy is based on unsupervised learning (clustering). The cluster membership likelihoods of the items are essential for the algorithm to connect the clusters and the classes, i.e., to find assignment between them. For the best assignment, the Hungarian algorithm is used, and single, multi, and adaptive assignment variants of OBEBS method are developed. Based on generated and real images datasets of handwritten digits, the experimental results show that our method surpasses the state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {PSO is a remarkable tool for solving several optimisation problems, like global optimisation and many real-life problems. It generally explores global optimal solution via exploiting the particle – swarm’s memory. Its limited properties on objective function’s continuity along with the search space and its potentiality in adapting dynamic environment make the PSO an important meta-heuristic method. PSO has an inherent tendency of trapping at local optimum which affects the convergence prematurely, when trying to solve difficult problems. This work proposed a modified version of PSO called as FPSO, where frequency-wave-sound is employed to exit from any encountered local optimum; if it is not the optimal solution. This FPSO mimics the characteristics of the waves by using three parameters, namely amplitude, frequency and wavelength . FPSO is then compared and analysed with other renowned algorithms like conventional PSO, Grey Wolf Optimisation (GOW), Multi-Verse Optimiser (MVO), Moth-Flame Optimisation (SL-PSO), Sine Cosine Algorithm (PPSO) and Butterfly Optimisation Algorithm (BOA) on 23 bench marking test bed functions. The performance is evaluated using various measures including trajectory, search history, average fitness solution and best optimisation-solution. The obtained results show that the FPSO algorithm beats other metaheuristic algorithms and confirmed its better performance on 2-dimensional test functions.},

  abstract     = {Internet of Things (IoT) is a new revolution of the Internet. However, the IoT network of physical devices and objects is often vulnerable to attacks like Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS). The proposed attack detection system makes the interlinking of Development and Operations (DevOps) as it makes the relationship between development and IT operations. For this, the proposed system includes (i) Proposed Feature Extraction and (ii) Classification. The data from each application are processed under the initial stage of feature extraction, where the statistical and higher-order statistical features are concatenated. Subsequently, the extracted features are subjected to a classification process, where it determines the presence of attacks. For the classification process, this paper intends to deploy the optimised Deep Belief Network (DBN), in which the activation function is optimally tuned. A new hybrid algorithm termed Firefly Alpha Evaluated Grey Wolf Optimisation (FAE-GWO) algorithm is proposed, which is the combination of Firefly (FF) and Grey Wolf Optimisation (GWO). Finally, the performance of the proposed system model is compared over other conventional works in terms of certain performance measures.},

  abstract     = {Transportation is a significant issue due to providing people to participate in human activities. Due to an increase in population, the need for transportation has also been increased. Therefore, more traffic is visible on streets that produce more issues related to mobility like noise pollution, air pollution, and accidents. This study pays attention to an impressive transit network design in urban areas. Because of the NP-hard nature of this problem, a shark smell optimisation (SSO) algorithm based on fuzzy logic is employed. A developed system is utilised to produce, optimise, and analyse frequencies and routes of transit in the level of a network. Its target is maximising the direct travellers per unit length, i.e., subject to route length, direct traveller density, and nonlinear rate constraints (a route length ratio to the shortest road interval between the beginning and destination). Since designing an urban transport network issue is in heterogeneous environments is involved, this article provides a new method for lowering the feasible urban travel time, the urban traffic, and the feasible urban travel cost using a well-known SSO algorithm. According to the results, the proposed method has higher efficiency compared to the previous methods. In addition, the results showed that the proposed technique offers fewer transfers and travel time.},

This paper introduces a novel effective and light-weighted network based on Separable Pyramid Module (SPM) to achieve competitive accuracy and inference speed with fewer parameters and computation. Our proposed SPM unit utilises factorised convolution and dilated convolution in the form of a feature pyramid to build a bottleneck structure, which extracts local and context information in a simple but effective way. Experiments on Cityscapes and Camvid datasets demonstrate our superior trade-off between speed and precision. Without pre-training or any additional processing, our SPMNet achieves 71.22% mIoU on Cityscapes test set at the speed of 94 FPS on a single GTX 1080Ti GPU card.},

Currently, the Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) of the Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) is becoming a hotspot research. AUVs have, only recently, received more attention and underwater platforms continue to dominate the research. To ensure the success of an accurate AUV localisation mission, the problem of drift on the estimated trajectory must be overcome. In order to improve the positioning accuracy of the AUV localisation, a new filter referred to as the Adaptive Smooth Variable Structure Filter (ASVSF) based SLAM positioning algorithm is proposed. To verify the improvement of this filter, the combined SVSF and the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) are presented. Experimental results based on dataset for underwater SLAM algorithm show the accuracy and stability of the ASVSF AUV localisation position. Several experiments were tested under real-life conditions with an autonomous underwater vehicle based on different filters. The results of these filters have been compared based on Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and in terms of localisation and map building errors. It is shown that the adaptive SVSF-SLAM strategy obtains the best performance compared to other algorithms.},

For the equity asset class in particular, while the securities selection part is relatively a straightforward procedure, the weight allocation part is more debatable and it has traditionally been identified with the equal-weighted allocation strategy. In this paper, we examine security’s own return-based weight allocation strategy for trend following investing and find that this strategy generates superior returns to several well-established weight allocation schemes. In particular, if the true return of the holding period is used ex ante for weight allocation, it is found that this strategy can generate absolutely huge excess returns. Motivated by this finding, we investigate the efficacy of machine learning techniques for regression of securities’ returns to improve the weight calculation in this framework. Empirical results indicate that deep learning provides the means of regression with which largest excess return gains are possible. In particular, it is demonstrated that the return-based weight allocation strategy defined by our proposed deep learning architecture produces substantial abnormal returns outperforming all other broadly recognised weight allocation schemes compared in this paper.},

Therefore, balancing the dataset becomes an imperative sub-task. Investigation of state-of-the-art approaches reveals that there is a need for a systematic study of class imbalance handling strategies to design an intelligent and capable system to detect the fraudulent transaction. This work aims to provide a comparative study of different class imbalance handling methods. To compare the effectiveness and efficiency of different class imbalance approaches in conjunction with state-of-the-art classification approaches, we have performed an extensive experimental study. We compared these methods on many performance indicators such as Precision, Recall, K-fold Cross-validation, AUC-ROC curve and execution time. In this study, we found that the Oversampling followed by Undersampling methods performs well for ensemble classification models such as AdaBoost, XGBoost and Random Forest.},

In this paper, a strict two-sided matching based on multi-attribute interval-valued preference ordinal information is discussed. As a generalised decision model, the strict two-sided matching adequately considers the requirement of satisfaction degree of two-sided agents. Firstly, the ranking method of probability degree is introduced to deal with the information of various interval numbers. Then, in the case of multiple attributes, we propose two methods for strict two-sided matching problem. The one is to aggregate multi-attribute satisfaction degree and then construct the decision model. The another is to separately deal with the interval-valued preference ordinal information of each attribute and then design the corresponding model. Finally, in the context of Internet finance, we adopt an example of the venture capital two-sided matching problem to illustrate our proposed methods and confirm the effectiveness.},

This paper attempts to study the effectiveness of text representation schemes on the text classification task, such as aggressive text detection, a special case of Hate speech from social media. Aggression levels are categorized into three predefined classes, namely: ‘Non-aggressive’ (NAG), ‘Overtly Aggressive’ (OAG), and ‘Covertly Aggressive’ (CAG). Various text representation schemes based on BoW techniques, word embedding, contextual word embedding, sentence embedding on traditional classifiers, and deep neural models are compared on a text classification problem. The weighted F 1 score is used as a primary evaluation metric. The results show that text representation using Googles’ universal sentence encoder (USE) performs better than word embedding and BoW techniques on traditional classifiers, such as SVM, while pre-trained word embedding models perform better on classifiers based on the deep neural models on the English dataset. Recent pre-trained transfer learning models like Elmo, ULMFi, and BERT are fine-tuned for the aggression classification task. However, results are not at par with the pre-trained word embedding model. Overall, word embedding using pre-trained fastText vectors produces the best weighted F 1 -score than Word2Vec and Glove. On the Hindi dataset, BoW techniques perform better than word embeddings on traditional classifiers such as SVM. In contrast, pre-trained word embedding models perform better on classifiers based on the deep neural nets. Statistical significance tests are employed to ensure the significance of the classification results. Deep neural models are more robust against the bias induced by the training dataset.

  abstract     = {Describing video content using natural language is an important part of video understanding. It needs to not only understand the spatial information on video, but also capture the motion information. Meanwhile, video captioning is a cross-modal problem between vision and language. Traditional video captioning methods follow the encoder-decoder framework that transfers the video to sentence. But the semantic alignment from sentence to video is ignored. Hence, finding a discriminative visual representation as well as narrowing the semantic gap between video and text has great influence on generating accurate sentences. In this paper, we propose an approach based on multi-feature fusion refine network (MFRN) , which can not only capture the spatial information and motion information by exploiting multi-feature fusion, but also can get better semantic aligning of different models by designing a refiner to explore the sentence to video stream. The main novelties and advantages of our method are: (1) multi-feature fusion : Both two-dimension convolutional neural networks and three-dimension convolutional neural networks pre-trained on ImageNet and Kinetic respectively are used to construct spatial information and motion information, and then fused to get better visual representation. (2) Sematic alignment refiner : the refiner is designed to restrain the decoder and reproduce the video features to narrow semantic gap between different modal. Experiments on two widely used datasets demonstrate our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of BLEU@4, METEOR, ROUGE and CIDEr metrics.},

  abstract     = {Audio files are frequent targets of malicious users who seek illegal profit trading with fake-quality content. For increasing the confidence in the integrity of audio files, the detection of fake-quality content is an important task. This paper proposes a method for detecting Advanced Audio Coding (AAC) compression on suspicious WAV files, in which the variance of the Modified Discrete Cosine Transform (MDCT) characterises four compression bitrates: uncompressed, 64 kbps, 128 kbps, and 256 kbps. This scheme takes advantage of the reduction of the variance of the high-frequency MDCT coefficients in compressed signals. Data obtained from MDCT coefficients generate a high-dimensional feature space. Hence, Principal Component Analysis, followed by Linear Discriminant Analysis, is used for projecting the high-dimensional data onto a lower-dimensional space. Besides, six supervised learning algorithms are compared for classifying four compression bitrates. The experiments show that using audio samples with 20 seconds and 1024 MDCT coefficients, an accuracy of 93% is reached with a Bayesian classifier. Collaterally, the detection between uncompressed and compressed signals attains an accuracy of 97% with Multinomial Logistic Regression. In conclusion, the proposed approach can detect previous AAC compression and can be potentially used when it is unfeasible to recover the suspicious signal completely.},

  abstract     = {Sensor nodes encompass the capability of controlling and monitoring the environment by measuring the factors, like temperature, pressure, and humidity. Ensuring secure routing in the network is an important and significant task in the wireless sensor network (WSN). Even though various routing protocols are adopted in the network, providing security and maintaining the energy is still a challenging issue in the research community. Thus, an effective particle-based spider monkey optimisation (P-SMO) algorithm is proposed in this research to select the optimal route to manage secure communication in WSNs. Accordingly, the network is simulated and the cluster heads (CHs) are chosen based on the efficient learning automata-based cell clustering algorithm (ELACCA) such that the routing path is established based on the chosen CHs. Thus, the proposed P-SMO algorithm establishes the secure routing path based on the factors, such as energy, delay, consistency factor, and trust. The proposed P-SMO algorithm is the integration of particle swarm optimisation (PSO) and spider monkey optimisation (SMO) algorithm in such a way that the optimal routes are defined effectively. The analysis of the proposed routing protocol proved the effective performance with the maximal number of nodes alive, coverage, energy balancing index, and the average remaining energy of 67, 93.407%, 0.7555, and 0.3402 J, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Clustering of data streams has become very popular in recent times, owing to rapid rise of real-time streaming utilities that produce large amounts of data at varying inter-arrival rates. We propose AnyClus , a framework for anytime clustering of data streams. AnyClus uses a proposed variant of R-tree, AnyRTree , to capture the incoming stream objects arriving at variable rate, and to index them in the form of micro-clusters of hierarchical fashion. The leaf-level micro-clusters produced are aggregated and stored in a logarithmic tilted-time window framework (TTWF). Our extensive experimental analysis shows (i) the capability of AnyClus in handling variable stream speeds (upto 250k objects/second); (ii) its ability to produce micro-clusters of high purity (≈1) and compactness; (iii) effectiveness of AnyRTree in handling noise, capturing concept drift and preservation of spatial locality in the indexing of micro-clusters, when compared to the existing methods. We also propose a parallel framework, Any-MP-Clus , for anytime clustering of multiport data streams over commodity clusters. Any-MP-Clus uses AnyRTree at each computing node of the cluster (for each stream-port) and maintains the aggregated micro-clusters in TTWF. The experimental results on datasets of billions scale show that Any-MP-Clus is scalable, eﬃcient and produces clustering of higher quality.},

The weight of each item is determined, and the preference similarities between the active user and other users are computed. The preference similarity means that how the users’ preferences are similar on positive ratings and negative ratings. According to the preference similarities, the candidate neighbourhood of the active user is determined. A method to compute overall assessment value is designed, the overall assessment value of each user in the candidate neighbourhood is computed, and users with the smallest overall assessment values are selected as the active user’s nearest neighbours. Finally, the most frequent item recommendation method (MFIR) is used to provide top- N recommendations to the active user.

The proposed hybridisation approach has been applied to five classical versions and two state-of-the-art variants of DE and tested against 28 well-known benchmark functions with different dimensions, each type of which highlights a different set of characteristics and provides a baseline measurement to validate the performance of the algorithms. In order to further test the proposal, the four outstanding algorithms in the state of the art have also been included in the comparisons.

  abstract     = {Mean-field variational inference, built on fully factorisations, can be efficiently solved; however, it ignores the dependencies between latent variables, resulting in lower performance. To address this, the copula variational inference (CVI) method is proposed by using the well-established copulas to effectively capture posterior dependencies, leading to better approximations. However, it suffers from a computational issue, where the optimisation for big models with massive latent variables is quite time-consuming. This is mainly caused by the expensive sampling when forming noisy Monte Carlo gradients in CVI. For CVI speedup, in this paper we propose a novel fast CVI (abbr. FCVI). In FCVI, we derive the gradient of CVI objective by an expectation of the mean-field factorisation. Therefore, we can achieve a much efficient sampling from the D -dimensional mean-field factorisation, enabling to reduce the sampling complexity from O ( D 2 ) to O ( D ) . To evaluate FCVI, we compare it against baseline methods on modelling performance and runtime. Experimental results demonstrate that FCVI is on a par with CVI, but runs much faster.},

Furthermore, because of the scarcity of blood donors, blood assignment by blood banks requires meticulous planning and solid issuing policy. The multiple components of a blood banking system contribute to the complexity of maintaining an efficient structure for such a system. One particular aspect relates to the stochastic nature of the demand for blood units. This paper implements a mathematical model for a blood bank system in South Africa and additionally explores the possible implementation of a hybrid global optimisation metaheuristic approach for the efficient assignment of blood products in the blood bank system. The approximate optimisation method used is the hybridisation of the symbiotic organism search (SOS) algorithm and a pre-processing ecosystem services (PES) techniques. In order to show the practicability of the model and evaluate the accuracy and robustness of the newly proposed hybrid algorithm, several numerical computations were performed using synthetically generated datasets that fall within the initial blood volume bounds of 500 to 20, 000. The experimental results indicate that the hybrid symbiotic organisms search ecosystem services optimisation algorithm offers better solutions for blood allocation under a dynamic environment than does the standard symbiotic organism search algorithm and other previously proposed hybrid versions of the SOS methods.},

In this study, a feed-forward deep neural network algorithm (FFDNN) is proposed for software effort estimation. The algorithm relies on a binary-search-based method for finding hyperparameters. FFDNN outperforms five comparison algorithms in the experiment that uses two performance parameters. The results of the study suggest that: 1) Employing traditional methods such as grid and random search increases tuning time remarkably. Instead, sophisticated parameter search methods compatible with the structure of regression method should be developed; 2) The performance of SEE is enhanced when associated hyperparameter search method is devised according to the essentials of chosen deep learning approach; 3) Deep learning models achieve in competitive CPU time compared to the tree-based regression methods such as CART_DE8.},

We performed a systematic mapping study to quantitatively analyse these contributions about agent mining. We determined that most of the publications were in the field of data mining using agent systems to collect or mine the data. Some used data mining solutions to improve agent behaviour, and very few publications integrated both agent and mining approaches. In the latter case, most were published in the last few years, which highlights the advances in research integrating agents and mining approaches.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, in research introducing an advanced driver assistance system for improving driving is considered as the trending one. In this research, concentrate more on proposing lane detection model and assist in driving. This work develops a lane detection model through the deep learning scheme. The proposed scheme has two major phases, such as image transformation and lane detection. Initially, the proposed method obtains the multiple-lane images and transforms the image and this image transformation helps in classifier training. For detecting the lane from the bird’s view image, this work considers the Deep Convolution Neural Network (DCNN) classifier. A novel optimisation algorithm, namely Earth Worm-Crow Search Algorithm (EW-CSA), is developed in this work to assist the DCNN classifier with the optimal weights. The proposed algorithm is developed by modifying the Earth Worm Optimisation algorithm (EWA) with the properties of the Crow Search Algorithm (CSA). The proposed system is compared with other existing methods, in which the proposed method offers maximum sensitivity 0.9925, the detection accuracy of 0.99512, and specificity of 0.995.},

  abstract     = {The issue of class imbalance and its consequences over the conventional learning models is a well-investigated topic, as it highly influences performances of real-life classification tasks. Amongst the available solutions, Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) imprints efficacy in balancing the data through synthetic minority instance generation. However, SMOTE suffers from the drawback of redundant data generation owing to uniform oversampling rate in regard to which, SMOTE with a customised oversampling rate has been investigated recently. In parallel to this, ensemble learning approaches are quite effective in improving prediction abilities of a set of weak classifiers through adaptive-weighted training. However, it does not account the imbalanced nature of the data during training. Through this paper, Correlation-based Oversampling aided Cost Sensitive Ensemble learning (CorrOV-CSEn) is proposed by integrating correlation-based oversampling with the AdaBoost ensemble learning model. The correlation-based oversampling entails to define a customised oversampling rate and a suitable oversampling zone while a misclassification ratio-based cost-function is introduced in the AdaBoost model to administer adaptive learning of imbalanced cases. CorrOV-CSEn is evaluated against 13 state-of-the-art methods by using 8 simulation datasets. The experimental results establish CorrOV-CSEn to be effective than the state-of-the-art methods in resolving the concerned issues.},

  abstract     = {Recent theories developing broad notions of context and its effects on inference are becoming increasingly important in fields as diverse as cognitive psychology, information science and quantum information theory and computing. Here we introduce a novel and general approach to the characterisation of contextuality using the techniques of Chu spaces and Channel Theory viewed as general theories of information flow. This involves introducing three essential components into the formulism: events, conditions and measurement systems. Incorporating these factors in relationship to conditional probabilities leads to information flows both in the setting of Chu spaces and Channel Theory. The latter provides a representation of semantic content using local logics from which conditionals can be derived. We employ these features to construct cone-cocone diagrams, commutativity of which enforces inferential coherence. With these we build a scale-free architecture incorporating a Bayesian-like hierarchical structure, in which there is an interpretation of active inference and Markov blankets. We compare this architecture with other theories of contextuality which we briefly review. We also show that this development of ideas conveniently accommodates negative probabilities, leading to the notion of signed information flow, and address how quantum contextuality can be interpreted within this model. Finally, we relate contextuality to the Frame Problem, another way of characterising a fundamental limitation on the observational and inferential capabilities of finite agents.},

  abstract     = {The Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is a process of disambiguating the sense of the text according to its context. Machine translation is one of the challenging task since it requires effective representation of the text to capture semantic relation between Hindi lyrics in English normal language behaviour. This paper focuses on WSD methods to deal with dialects that convert Hindi lyrics to English in its syntactic structure of the words. WSD is a phenomenon for disambiguating the text so that machine would be capable to deduce correct sense of individual given words. WSD is critical for solving natural language tasks such as Machine Translation (MT) and speech processing. The distinguishing proof of significant words in Hindi as the language is not as simple as that of dialects in English. The interpretations of sonnets through the machines are exceptionally essential and deliberate about mind-blowing events. The interpretation of English ballads into other local dialects can turn out to be very straightforward, however, vice-versa is troublesome. This is due to the assortment of structures, classes, and feelings of the local dialects. Various endeavours have been connected far and wide towards the programmed interpretation of ballads from local dialects into English. In this paper, we propose a half breed MT (HBMT) procedure driven by the standard based MT together with measurements based on statistical machine translation (SMT) and rule-based machine translation (RBMT) for WSD in natural script Hindi in English Lyrics. This proposed method improves the semantic and syntactic accuracy of a machine interpretation framework. Finally, the proposed approach result is compared with the machine translation methods such a Google and Microsoft Bing Babylonian and HMT translators provided achieves a better outcome compared to the existing standards.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a collaborative model for the supplier selection for the purchasing activity in the supply chain. The problem addresses a set of firms that try to look for a cost saving configuration to optimise their ordering plans, given a set of suppliers with quantity discounts options. Possible collaborations between firms, modelled as a coalition formation, can be beneficial in the sense that the gathering of their orders generates a cost minimisation regarding the stand-alone situation. We propose the mathematical formulation of firms’ collaborative ordering modelled as a cost-dependent assignment problem. The collaborative scenario is viewed as a two independent steps: the first step is based on game-theoretic approach to model possible coalitions of firms and to generate stable coalition structures according to the core concept. Once coalitions are formed, the second step consists mainly on the genetic algorithm is trigged to assign coalitions to shared suppliers. The assignment problem is solved using a specifically designed hybrid genetic algorithm. Experiments, driven on a large test-bed, highlight the effectiveness of the collaboration in handling the ordering activity within the supply chain and the usefulness of hybrid genetic algorithm in solving such supplier selection problems. We show that in all cases the collaborative scenario is more profitable regarding the stand-alone position. The obtained results show that the hybrid genetic algorithm is able to generate good quality solutions in a reasonable run time regarding Cplex results.},

However, this strategy is relatively simple and has low discrimination in similar interactions. To solve this drawback, the spatial relation between skeletons and objects is proposed to model the interaction pattern and improve the detection accuracy. First, the skeleton-object interaction pattern image is extracted for each interaction proposal. Second, a deep neural network is applied to learn the interaction features from these images. Finally, the interaction feature is added to the human-object interaction detection network by a multistream structure. In the experiments, we evaluate the proposed method on the HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets.

  abstract     = {Due to exponential growth in demand for radio spectrum for wireless communication networking, the radio spectrum has become over-crowded. The fixed spectrum allocation policy of the radio spectrum leads to inefficient utilisation of the available spectrum, which diverted the attention of researchers towards different intelligent techniques to access the spectrum dynamically and efficiently. The concept of Cognitive Radio (CR) has been considered as a promising technology to solve the problem of spectrum scarcity through the utilisation of various unutilised spectrum bands. In a future network deployment, multiple radio access networks may coexist having different characteristics. Hence, it becomes a challenge for CR networks to select the optimal network out of available networks. For efficient realisation, CRs requires intelligent spectrum management techniques for Dynamic Spectrum Management (DSM). Till now, there does not exist a literature survey that addresses the spectrum management with machine learning techniques in an intelligent manner. Hence, this paper presents the detailed classification and comprehensive survey of various machine learning techniques for intelligent spectrum management with their paradigms of optimisation for cognitive radio networks. The paper also provides new directions and open issues for the research community to work further in CR networks.},
