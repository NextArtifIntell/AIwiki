  abstract     = {Finding a good compiler autotuning methodology, particularly for selecting the right set of optimisations and finding the best ordering of these optimisations for a given code fragment has been a long-standing problem. As the rapid development of machine learning techniques, tackling the problem of compiler autotuning using machine learning or deep learning has become increasingly common in recent years. There have been many deep learning models proposed to solve problems, such as predicting the optimal heterogeneous mapping or thread-coarsening factor; however, very few have revisited the problem of optimisation phase tuning. In this paper, we intend to revisit and tackle the problem using deep learning techniques. Unfortunately, the problem is too complex to be addressed in its full scope. We present a new problem, called reduced O3 subsequence labelling – a reduced O3 subsequence is defined as a subsequence of O3 optimisation passes that contains no useless passes, which is a simplified problem and expected to be a stepping stone towards solving the optimisation phase tuning problem. We formulated the problem and attempted to solve the problem by using genetic algorithms. We believe that with mature deep learning techniques, a machine learning model that predicts the reduced O3 subsequences or even the best O3 subsequence for a given code fragment could be developed and used to prune the search space of the problem of the optimisation phase tuning, thereby shortening the tuning process and also providing more effective tuning results.},

A non-rigid 3D reconstruction and high-precision correction method for motion pose are studied in this paper. A non-rigid imaging model is designed to obtain 3D moving images. According to the frame difference and morphological processing, the background of image is separated and denoised. Combined with motion analysis, 3D motion pose features are extracted as identification of non-rigid 3D motion error actions in a hybrid Convolution Neural Network-Hidden Markov Model to train the correction coefficients, which are used to adjust the pose in 3D motion reconstruction and realise correction. Experimental results show that this method has high precision reconstruction and correction of non-rigid 3D motion pose.},

However, it does not guarantee safety property of the learned policy. This paper integrates barrier certificates into actor-critic-based reinforcement learning methods in a feedback-driven framework to learn safe policies for dynamical systems. The safe reinforcement learning framework is composed of two interactive parts: Learner and Verifier . Learner trains the policy to satisfy goal-reaching and safety properties. Since the policy is trained on training datasets, the two properties may not be retained on the whole system. Verifier validates the learned policy on the whole system. If the validation fails, Verifier returns the counterexamples to Learner for retraining the policy in the next iteration. We implement a safe policy learning tool SRLBC and evaluate its performance on three control tasks. Experimental results show that SRLBC achieves safety with no more than 0.5× time overhead compared to the baseline reinforcement learning method, showing the feasibility and effectiveness of our framework.},

Despite the great success of GCN, it performs weakly under some application conditions, such as a multiple layers model or severely limited labeled nodes. In this paper, we propose a structural reinforcement-based graph convolutional network (SRGCN), which contains two essential techniques: structural reinforcement and semantic alignment. The model&#39;s core is to learn and reinforce structural information for nodes from both feature and graph perspectives and then expect the extracted semantic mappings to be similar by semantic alignment technique. The main advantage of SRGCN is structural reinforcement, i.e. the model improves the propagation of features in the graph by reinforcing the structural semantics. This method will alleviate the problems of over-smoothing and over-fitting. We evaluate the model on three standard datasets with node clustering tasks, and the experimental results demonstrate that SRGCN can outperform relative state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines.},

In this paper, we used a hybrid features extracting approach based on texture, morphological, Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT), Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM), entropy, Elliptic Fourier Descriptors (EFDs), RICA, and sparse filtering methods. Various machine learning techniques have been employed to detect breast cancer, viz. Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees (DT), k-Nearest Neighbour, and Naïve Bayes classifiers. The RICA-based feature set using SVM RBF has resulted in total accuracy of (94.88%), and ROC AUC = 0.9914. The hybrid features using RICA have been computed with other combinatorial logics. Moreover, the highest performance to detect BC based on the fusion of features was obtained with RICA with Textural features using SVM Gaussian kernel and yielded a total accuracy of (97.55%), and ROC AUC = 0.9976. The hybrid features with RICA were found to yield the highest detection performance. It is revealed that the new feature-extracting approach can be useful for the early detection of breast cancer by physicians to decrease the overall mortality rate. The methods will be very useful for treatment modification to achieve better clinical outcomes.},

Given the growing usage of network anomaly detection and the implications of hybrid anomalies, we propose several heterogeneous anomaly types and provide an unsupervised approach for the automated mapping of network threats. Initial findings on publicly available intrusion datasets support the existence of four unique heterogeneous anomaly types, providing unique insight regarding the next generation of network anomaly detection systems.},

The IoT routing dataset is then augmented into larger volumes using ADASYN, which is also used to solve the class imbalance problems. A deep learning hybrid model based on a Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network and adaptive Mayfly Optimization Algorithm (LAMOA) was presented for the classification of IoT attacks. The adaptive MOA adjusts the weights in the various layers of the LSTM network and the Fully Connected Layer with SoftMax Classification. As part of the validation process, the proposed model was also compared with benchmark datasets NSL-KDD, BoT-IoT, and IoT-23. Using benchmark datasets, LAMOA achieved 99.94% accuracy for multiclassifications, 99.92% accuracy for binary classifications, and 98.42% accuracy for real-time datasets. Compared to other models, our proposed model significantly improves the accuracy of each attack&#39;s classification by 5–10%.},

However, automatically assessing aesthetic quality of an image is a challenging task, because image aesthetic is affected by various factors, and the criteria for judging the aesthetic of images with diverse semantic information are different. To this end, a Semantic-Aware Multi-task convolution neural network (SAM-CNN) for evaluating image aesthetic quality is proposed in this paper. The network can fuse intermediate features of different layers at different scales in CNN to obtain a more comprehensive and accurate aesthetic expression, under the joint supervision of image aesthetic quality assessment task and semantic classification task in a multi-task learning manner. Besides, by applying the attention mechanism, semantic information with a large receptive field extracted from deep layers is utilised to guide the network to focus on the key parts of features to be fused, to improve the effectiveness of feature fusion. Experimental results on the AVA dataset and Photo.net dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed SAM-CNN.},

This paper proposes a novel semantic segmentation network for lane detection that includes IBN-Net, an attention module, and an encoder-decoder structure called IAED. IBN-Net improves the modelling and generalisation capability with little computational complexity. The attention module can better capture context information and improve the performance of the network. We evaluated the performance of the proposed method, which improved by 6.3% over ResNet34 on the TuSimple datasets. Tests on the CULane datasets showed that our method is at least 3% better than existing methods. Experimental results showed that the proposed method has strong robustness under complex conditions such as insufficient illumination and shadow occlusion.},

The word representation features and contextual relationships extracted by current text similarity computation methods are insufficient, and too many factors increase the computational complexity. Re-LSTM, a weighted word embedding long and short-term memory network, has therefore been proposed as a text similarity computing model. The two-gate mechanism of Re-LSTM neurons is built on the foundation of the conventional LSTM model and is intended to minimise the parameters and computation to some level. The hidden features and state information of the layer above each gate are considered for extracting more implicit features. By fully utilising the feature word and its domain association, the feature word’s position, and the word frequency information, the TF-IDF method and the χ ²-C algorithm may effectively improve the representation of the weights on the words. The Attention mechanism is used in Re-LSTM to combine dependencies and feature word weights for deeper text semantic mining. The experimental results demonstrate that the Re-LSTM model outperforms baselines in terms of precision, recall, accuracy, and F1 values, all of which reach above 85% when applied to the QQPC and ATEC datasets.},

  abstract     = {Manifold learning is an important class of methods for nonlinear dimensionality reduction. Among them, the LLE optimisation goal is to maintain the relationship between local neighbourhoods in the original embedding manifold to reduce dimensionality, and NPE is a linear approximation to LLE. However, these two algorithms only consider maintaining the neighbour relationship of samples in low-dimensional space and ignore the global features between non-neighbour samples, such as the face shooting angle. Therefore, in order to simultaneously consider the nearest neighbour structure and global features of samples in nonlinear dimensionality reduction, it can be linearly calculated. This work provides a novel linear dimensionality reduction approach named non-neighbour and neighbour preserving embedding (NNNPE). First, we rewrite the objective function of the algorithm LLE based on the principle of our novel algorithm. Second, we introduce the linear mapping to the objective function. Finally, the mapping matrix is calculated by the method of the fast learning Mahalanobis metric. The experimental results show that the method proposed in this paper is effective.},

  abstract     = {The cross-domain sequential recommendation aims to predict the next item based on a sequence of recorded user behaviours in multiple domains. We propose a novel Cross-domain Sequential Recommendation approach with Graph-Collaborative Filtering (CsrGCF) to alleviate the sparsity issue of user-interaction data. Specifically, we design time-aware and relation-aware graph attention mechanisms with collaborative filtering to exploit high-order behaviour patterns of users for promising results in both domains. Time-aware Graph Attention mechanism (TGAT) is designed to learn the inter-domain sequence-level representation of items. Relationship-aware Graph Attention mechanism (RGAT) is proposed to learn collaborative items&#39; and users&#39; feature representations. Moreover, to simultaneously improve the recommendation performance in the two domains, a Cross-domain Feature Bidirectional Transfer module (CFBT) is proposed, transferring user&#39;s common sharing features in both domains and retaining user&#39;s domain-specific features in a specific domain. Finally, cross-domain and sequential information jointly recommend the next items that users like. We conduct extensive experiments on two real-world datasets that show that CsrGCF outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines in terms of Recall and MRR. These demonstrate the necessity of exploiting high-order behaviour patterns of users for a cross-domain sequential recommendation. Meanwhile, retaining domain-specific features is an important step in the process of cross-domain feature bidirectional transferring.},

  abstract     = {Morphological segmentation is a basic task in agglutinative language information processing, dividing words into the smallest semantic unit morphemes. There are two types of morphological segmentation: canonical segmentation and surface segmentation. As a typical agglutinative language, Uyghur usually uses statistical-based methods in canonical segmentation, which relies on the artificial extraction of features. In surface segmentation, the artificial feature extraction process is avoided by using the neural network. However, to date, no model can provide both segmentation results in Uyghur without adding features. In addition, morphological segmentation is usually regarded as a sequence annotation task, so label imbalance easily occurs in datasets. Given the above situation, this paper proposes an improved labelling scheme that joins morphological boundary labels and voice harmony labels for the two kinds of segmentation simultaneously. Then, a convolution network and attention mechanism are added to capture local and global features, respectively. Finally, morphological segmentation is regarded as a sequence labeling task of character sequences. Due to the problem of label proportion imbalance and noise in the dataset, a focal loss function with label smoothing is used. The experimental results show that the F1 values of canonical segmentation and surface segmentation achieve the best results.},

However, some empathetic dialogue generation models only specialise in commonsense and neglect emotion, which can only get a one-sided understanding of the user&#39;s situation and makes the model unable to express emotion better. In this paper, we propose a novel affective feature knowledge interactive model named AFKI, to enhance response generation performance, which enriches conversation history to obtain emotional interactive context by leveraging fine-grained emotional features and commonsense knowledge. Furthermore, we utilise an emotional interactive context encoder to learn higher-level affective interaction information and distill the emotional state feature to guide the empathetic response generation. The emotional features are to well capture the subtle differences of the user&#39;s emotional expression, and the commonsense knowledge improves the representation of affective information on generated responses. Extensive experiments on the empathetic conversation task demonstrate that our model generates multiple responses with higher emotion accuracy and stronger empathetic ability compared with baseline model approaches for empathetic response generation.},

To tackle the fickle ocean environment, we propose a novel scheme to extract and identify the fingerprint feature of communication satellite signals. K -means clustering algorithm is utilised to optimise the conventional Smooth Pseudo Wigner-Ville Distribution (SPWVD), which makes the final result of SPWVD closer to the feature of the original data and improves the accuracy of signal fingerprinting. Basing on the improved SPWVD, the singular value entropy is calculated by time-frequency analysis. Then, the entropy of diagonal slices is generated by the ameliorated bispectrum method which is enhanced by using the fractional low-order covariance method. Consequently, a two-dimensional signal fingerprint feature vector can be calculated. For the fingerprint feature recognition, the XGBoost classifier which is more efficient in machine learning classification is employed. Finally, we simulate the Iridium satellite signal for experiments with MATLAB. The experimental result shows the superiority of the improved SPWVD method and the improved bispectrum method, which proves the scheme&#39;s feasibility.},

Here we introduce AMGNET, a multi-scale graph neural network model based on Encoder-Process-Decoder structure for flow field prediction. Our model employs message passing of graph neural networks at different mesh graph scales. Our method has significantly lower prediction errors than the GCN baseline on several complex fluid prediction tasks, such as airfoil flow and cylinder flow.

To overcome the difficulties, this research presents a novel network named PDNet. It employs the multi-task learning approach to combine the point regression and density map regression. PDNet includes a backbone to extract multi-scale features, a Dilated Feature Fusion module (DFF), a Density Map Attention module (DMA), a density map branch and a point branch. Aims of DFF is to address the difficulties of small targets and scale variations by establishing relationships between targets and their surroundings. DMA is created to address the challenges of complicated backgrounds, allowing the PDNet to focus on the target&#39;s location. In addition, the density map branch and point branch are designed for density maps regression and point regression, respectively.

Recently solving text classification problems with graph neural network (GNN) has received increasing attention. However, current graph-based studies ignore the hidden information in text syntax and sequence structure, and it is difficult to use the model directly for processing new documents because the text graph is built based on the whole corpus including the test set. To address the above problems, we propose a text classification model based on long short-term memory network (LSTM) and graph attention network (GAT). The model builds a separate graph based on the syntactic structure of each document, generates word embeddings with contextual information using LSTM, then learns the inductive representation of words by GAT, and finally fuses all the nodes in the graph together into the document embedding. Experimental results on four datasets show that our model outperforms existing text classification methods with faster convergence and less memory consumption than other graph-based methods. In addition, our model shows a more notable improvement when using less training data. Our model proves the importance of text syntax and sequence information for classification results.},

However, the conventional ABE approaches resulted in poor security performance against various attacks in the IoT environment. So, in this paper, the LWC-ABE method is proposed to enhance the security performance against various attacks in the IoT environment. The proposed LWC-ABE contains only multiple trusted authority environments, which is a bottleneck in IoT servers and IoT devices. The proposed LWC-ABE method supports high expressiveness, access policy updates, large attribute domains, and white box traceability properties. The simulation results shows that the proposed LWC-ABE resulted in reduced encryption and decryption times for multi users, different message sizes scenarios as compared to conventional approaches. The numerical outcomes of the proposed method are much better based on performance of encryption and decryption times as 0.000835 and 0.000310 respectively.},

  abstract     = {Alzheimer’s, or so-called dementia, is one of the types of diseases that affects brain cells and causes memory loss, difficulty in thinking, and forgetfulness. Thus far, there is no effective treatment for AD, but treatment could be helpful in impeding the progression of the disease. Therefore, early AD diagnosis is effective in limiting the disease from progressing to advanced and dangerous stages. Physicians and radiologists face difficulties in diagnosing healthy nerve cells from soft tissue, and it requires substantial expertise and a long time to decipher the MRI images. Thus, artificial intelligence techniques can play a key role in diagnosing MRI images for early detection of AD. In this study, four proposed systems with different methodologies and materials for tracking the stages of AD development are presented. The first proposed system is to classify a data set using artificial neural networks (ANNs) and feed-forward neural networks (FFNN) based on the features extracted in a hybrid manner by using a combination of Local Binary Pattern (LBP), Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), and Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) algorithms. The second proposed system is to classify the data set using two deep learning models – ResNet-18 and AlexNet – that are pre-trained based on deep feature map extraction. The third proposed system is to diagnose the data set using a hybrid technology between ResNet-18 and AlexNet models to extract feature maps and machine learning (SVM) to classify feature maps. The fourth proposed system diagnoses the data set using ANN and FFNN algorithms based on the hybrid features of ResNet-18 and AlexNet deep learning models and traditional algorithms (LBP, DWT, and GLCM). All the proposed techniques achieved superior results in the diagnosis of MRI images for early detection of AD. The FFNN algorithms based on the hybrid features extracted by ResNet-18 with features extracted using traditional algorithms achieved an accuracy of 99.8%, precision of 99.9%, sensitivity of 99.75%, specificity of 100%, and AUC of 99.94%.},

However, the optimisation of energy saving control for thermal comfort is not an easy task due to the complex dynamics of HVAC systems, the dynamics of thermal comfort and the trade-off between energy saving and thermal comfort. To solve the above problem, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based thermal comfort control method in multi-zone residential HVAC. In this paper, firstly we design a SVR-DNN model, consisting of Support Vector Regression and a Deep Neural Network to predict thermal comfort value. Then, we apply Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) based on the output of the SVR-DNN model to achieve an optimal HVAC thermal comfort control strategy. This method can minimise energy consumption while satisfying occupants&#39; thermal comfort. The experimental results show that our method can improve thermal comfort prediction performance by 20.5% compared with DNN; compared with deep Q-network (DQN), energy consumption and thermal comfort violation can be reduced by 3.52% and 64.37% respectively.},

A novel model-based method, using a Dual Extended Kalman Filtering algorithm (DEKF) and Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN), is proposed to estimate and correct lithium-ion batteries. The results of acceptable SOC estimation are achieved using the DEKF to estimate the battery SOC and simultaneously update model parameters online, while the SOC estimation error is in real-time predicted by the trained BPNN. To further reduce the SOC estimation error, the SOC estimated by the DEKF is corrected by adding the predicted estimation error. The SOC estimation results between the original DEKF and BPNN-based updated DEKF methods under the Federal Urban Driving Schedule (FUDS), the Dynamic Stress Test (DST), the Beijing Dynamic Stress Test (BJDST) and the US06 Highway Driving Schedule are compared. Experimental results show that the SOC error reduces considerably after correcting the estimated SOC. The corrected SOC Root-Mean Square Errors (RMSEs) decrease by an average of seven times compared with the case of no correction. The constant current discharge test verifies the generality and robustness of the proposed method. The modification to the SOC estimation results using ordinary EKF under the above four sophisticated dynamic tests verifies the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) is a powerful emerging deep learning technique for learning graph data. However, there are still some challenges for GCN. For example, the model is shallow; the performance is poor when labelled nodes are severely scarce. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Semantic Aligned Graph Convolutional Network (MSAGCN), which contains two fundamental operations: multi-angle aggregation and semantic alignment, to resolve two challenges simultaneously. The core of MSAGCN is the aggregation of nodes that belong to the same class from three perspectives: nodes, features, and graph structure, and expects the obtained node features to be mapped nearby. Specifically, multi-angle aggregation is applied to extract features from three angles of the labelled nodes, and semantic alignment is utilised to align the semantics in the extracted features to enhance the similar content from different angles. In this way, the problem of over-smoothing and over-fitting for GCN can be alleviated. We perform the node clustering task on three citation datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines.},

To address this problem, a method that combines word2vec, a topic-based TF-IDF algorithm, and an improved convolutional neural network is proposed in this paper, which is named WTL-CNN. Firstly, word2vec is used to convert text data into word vectors. Secondly, an improved TF-IDF algorithm is proposed to weight word vectors. The improved TF-IDF algorithm introduces LDA topic generation model to enhance the topic semantic information of TF-IDF values. Thirdly, according to the location distribution law of important features of news texts, the location information is converted into weights and integrated into the pooling process convolutional neural network to further improve the accuracy of classification. At last, WTL-CNN has been evaluated and compared with seven contrast models on datasets THUCNews and SogouCS under the environment of TensorFlow. The experimental results show that the precision rate, recall rate and F1 value of WTL-CNN model reach 95.76%, 93.43%, 94.98% respectively on the THUCNews, and reach 94.61%, 93.43%, 94.01 respectively on the SogouCS.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) is an emerging distributed machine learning technique. However, when dealing with heterogeneous data, a shared global model cannot generalise all devices&#39; local data. Furthermore, the FL training process necessitates frequent parameter communication, which interferes with the limited bandwidth and unstable connections of participating devices. These two issues have a significant impact on FL&#39;s effectiveness and efficiency. In this paper, an enhanced communication-efficient personalised FL technique, FedGB, is proposed. Different from existing approaches, FedGB believes that only interacting common information from training results on different devices can improve local personalised training results more effectively. FedGB dynamically selects the backbone structures in the local models to represent the dynamically determined backbone information (common features) in the global model for aggregation. Only interacting common features between different nodes reduce the impact of heterogeneous data to a certain extent. The dynamic adaptive sub-model selection avoids the impact of manually setting the scale of sub-model. FedGB can thus reduce communication overheads while maintaining inference accuracy. The results obtained in a variety of experimental settings show that FedGB can effectively improve communication efficiency and inference accuracy.},

In our work, we propose a multimodal differential privacy protection framework. Firstly, we use multimodal representation learning to fuse different modalities and map them to the same subspace. Then based on this representation, we use the Local Differential Privacy (LDP) mechanism to protect data. We propose two protection methods for low-dimensional and high-dimensional fusion tensors respectively. The former is based on Binary Encoding, and the latter is based on multi-dimensional Fourier Transform. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose LDP-based methods for the representation learning of multimodal fusion. Experimental results demonstrate the flexibility of our framework where both approaches show efficient performance as well as high data utility.},

In this paper, we firstly utilise the principal component analysis algorithm to reduce the influence of noisy data on feature maps. Then, we propose an improved Leaky-Squeeze-and-Excitation block to evaluate the contribution of each output feature map using the channel attention mechanism. Finally, we effectively remove lower contribution channels without reducing the model performance as much as possible. Extensive experimental results show that our proposed method achieves significant improvements over the state-of-the-art in terms of FLOPs and parameters reduction with similar accuracies. For example, with VGG-16-baseline, our proposed method reduces parameters by 83.3% and FLOPs by 66.3%, with only a loss of 0.13% in top-5 accuracy. Furthermore, it effectively balances pruning efficiency and prediction accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Drastic hog price fluctuations have a great impact on the welfare of hog farmers, people&#39;s living standards, and the macroeconomy. To stabilise the hog price, hog price forecasting has become an increasingly hot issue in the research literature. Existing papers have neglected the benefits of decomposition and instead directly utilise models to predict hog prices by capturing raw data. Motivated by this issue, the authors introduce a new robust forecasting approach for hog prices that combines ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and multilong short-term memory neural networks (Multi-LSTMs). First, EEMD decomposes the volatile raw sequence into several smoother subsequences. Second, the decomposed subsequences are predicted separately using a parallel structure model consisting of several LSTMs. Finally, the fuse function combines all the subresults to yield the final result. The empirical results suggest that the proposed method only has minor errors and proves the effectiveness and reliability in experiments on real datasets (2.55207, 4.816, and 0.332 on MAE, MAPE and RMSLE, respectively). Reliable forecasting of hog prices is beneficial to farmers and people to allow optimisation of their production and booking rates and to moderate the adverse effects of potential shocks.},

First, the text is vectorised using the Glove model in the embedding layer. Then, the vector text is sent to the Multiscale Convolutional Neural Network (MCNN) and the Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory network (Bi-LSTM) respectively. The Bi-LSTM layer is also designed in the present work with use of mixed attention to extract deeper semantic features.

To address these three issues, we propose a new locally adaptive k-nearest centroid neighbour classification based on the average distance (AD-LAKNCN) in this paper. First, the k neighbours of the query based on the nearest centroid neighbour (NCN) are found, and the discrimination classes with different k values are derived from the number and distribution of each class of neighbours considered in the query. Then, based on the distribution information in the discrimination class for each k, the adaptive k and the final classification result are obtained.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we deal with the problem of similarity search about crowdedness for participatory-sensing buses for urban transportation. Similarity search is usually applied for measuring similarities in heterogeneous information networks. However, many models implement similarity search in a global setting, without taking object attributes into consideration. OCP, a novel OLAP-based crowdedness perception, is an attribute-enriched and meta-path-based model with machine learning to capture similarity based on the object connectivity, visibility and features. A set of common crowdedness attribute dimensions are defined across different types of objects, which can be obtained from the participatory passenger’s sensor data through deep-neural-network-based posture recognition. Accordingly, an object can be described as a series of node vectors from different dimensions. In such framework, OLAP is applied in analysing multiple resolutions and improving efficiency of similarity search. In addition, our data sources are based on participatory-sensing instead of using vehicle GPS systems. As more data be collected through participatory-sensing, more accurate crowdedness for a bus can be estimated. The experiment results further demonstrate the efficiency of our analytical approaches.},

  abstract     = {Anomaly detection of multi-dimensional time-series data is a key research area, and the analysis of control, switching, and other state signals (i.e., industrial state quantity time series) is of particular importance to the operational sciences. When only the limited values of industrial state quantities are taken in the discrete set, there is no continuous change trend, making it difficult to achieve good results when applying analogue anomaly detection methods directly. In this study, assuming a correlation between the time series of state and analogue quantities in industrial systems, a model for anomaly detection in state quantity time-series data is built through a correlation supported by long short-term memory, and the model is verified using real physical process data. These results demonstrate that the proposed method is superior to extant industrial time-series models. Thus far, no studies focusing on the anomaly detection of two-state quantity time-series outliers have been performed. We believe that the research problem addressed herein and the proposed method contribute an interesting design methodology for the anomaly detection of time-series data in IIoT.},

We wanted to investigate what types of self-introduced technical debt exist in open-source blockchain software systems, and how these technical debts are distributed. We have selected six most popular blockchain software projects from GitHub. Then the code comments from these software projects were extracted and manually labelled. Finally, the code comments were statistically analysed. We propose a new type of technical debt, resource debt, which is explicitly identified by the framework developers and requires special attention in subsequent production systems. Six types of technical debt are prevalent and there is not any algorithm debt. In addition, we find that the code comments containing technical debt are not entirely determined by task tags. SATD is prevalent in blockchain projects. There is more significant variability between different application software projects for different technical debts. The results of the study imply that for detecting SATD, deep semantic discovery models should be used, such as pre-trained models.},

  abstract     = {Data deduplication can solve the problem of resource wastage caused by duplicated data. However, due to the limited resources of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, applying data deduplication to IoT scenarios is challenging. Existing data deduplication frameworks for the IoT are prone to inefficiency or trust crises due to the random allocation of edge computing nodes. Furthermore, side-channel attacks remain a risk. In addition, after IoT devices store data in the cloud through data deduplication, they cannot share their data efficiently. In this paper, we propose a secure and efficient data deduplication framework for the IoT based on edge computing and blockchain technologies. In this scheme, we propose a model based on parallel use of three-layer and two-layer architectures and introduce the RAndom REsponse (RARE) scheme to resist side-channel attacks. We also design a label tree to realise one-to-many data-sharing, which improves efficiency and meets the needs of the IoT. In addition, we use blockchain to resist collusion attacks. Experiments were conducted to demonstrate that our framework has advantages over similar schemes in terms of communication cost, security and efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Model incremental updating enhances the initial model by analysing discrepancy parts of the system to improve the model&#39;s adaptability for new scenarios. These discrepancy components originate from the deviation between the increasing business process operational state and the outdated original planning model. Considerable domain-specific knowledge is required to determine the threshold points for selecting appropriate activities, but process analysts rarely know each scenario&#39;s domain knowledge. Moreover, most analytical processes only focussed on the control flow level. Aiming at these issues, this paper proposes a Hybrid Behavioural and Resource Trusted intervals Updating algorithm (BI&amp;RI Updating) for model enhancement based on control level and resource level of online event streams. First, analyse the reference model to construct multi-perspective trusted interval constraints in the offline stage. From a control-flow perspective, the behavioural relationships between activities are researched using a deep clustering approach. Moreover, from a data-flow standpoint, resource co-occurrence relationships are analysed based on association rules. Next, the incremental update algorithm in online scenarios is proposed to update the model by filtering the event streams and iteratively optimising the trusted intervals. Finally, the proposed algorithm is implemented based on the PM4PY framework and evaluated using real logs with both outcome model quality and execution efficiency. The results show that the algorithm can execute quickly and improve the quality of the model even in a non-ideal state where the logs contain noise.},

  abstract     = {Against the backdrop of the booming supply chain finance and logistics industry, Logistics 4.0 has emerged. However, the financing capacity of today&#39;s logistics companies is still unable to respond to the needs of the rapid development of the supply chain. On the one hand, the problem of logistics companies’ lack of existing high-value collateral in supply chain finance has led to a clutter of their credit data and difficulty in verifying their creditworthiness. On the other hand, the massive access to logistics companies’ business information can also lead to privacy leaks. At the same time, the transparency feature of blockchain is used to solve the financing dilemma of many industries in supply chain finance. On this basis, we propose a blockchain-based financing scheme (BFS) for logistics company. BFS utilises more efficient and interpretative smart contract technology, as well as improved privacy information query and invocation algorithms, to realise automatic control of entity node privacy information flow and significantly simplifying the steps and lowering the thresholds to financing for logistics companies, while protecting the privacy of their data. After extensive simulation testing, BFS can run supply chain blocks at a stable transaction throughput of around 280 RPS, with data transfers that meet the financing needs of logistics companies, providing a higher and more stable performance than the native Hyperledger Fabric.},

The experiment adopts the deep learning framework Tensorflow, which combines 10 4 × 10 4 size GCN with an attention mechanism for training.

Here, we design an attC site prediction algorithm based on a combination optimisation strategy. Based on the structural features of attC sites, the prediction algorithm realises the high-precision prediction of the recombination frequencies between sites and the screening of the top 20 important features that play a role in recombination, which are effective for improving the design method of attC sites. The algorithm has better portability and higher prediction accuracy compared with the existing advanced algorithms, among which the Pearson correlation coefficient is 0.87, explained variance score is 0.73, root mean square error is 0.006 and mean absolute error is 0.041.

Previous approaches realised extraction by constructing different networks, but they did not fully exploit the original information of the data, which led to low extraction precision. Moreover, the extraction precision will also be decreased when the model is attacked by adversarial samples. To address the above problems, a new model CL-ECPE is proposed in this article to improve the extraction precision through contrastive learning. First, contrastive sets are constructed by adversarial samples. The contrastive sets are used as the raw data of adversarial training and the test data of the pilot experiment. Then, adversarial training is used to get contrastive features according to the training target. The acquisition of contrastive features can improve extraction precision. Experimental results on the benchmark emotion cause corpus show our method outperforms the state-of-the-art method by over 12.49%, as well as demonstrates the strong robustness of CL-ECPE.},

  abstract     = {Individuals use Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) to secure, reliable communication networks as a viable route of transmission. Platooning uses Inter-Vehicular Communication to supervise a group of vehicles (IVC). The information communicated, especially acceleration, location, and speed, can then be used to respond by longitudinal control legislation. Platoons require help between those vehicles to improve fuel efficiency, security, and various crises associated with driver errors. Despite these advances, the communication network must govern vehicles unprotected from adequate threat vectors, which malicious attacks might exploit. Considering that connected cars between trusts could increase security, whereas all active automobiles can develop and spread legitimate, accurate, and recognized information within the network. So, considering badmouth, this work proposes a unique node centric weight-based trust management algorithm (NC-WTM). By quickly recognising and deleting fraudulent vehicles and their generated messages, the NC-WTM (node-centric weighted trust management) technique improves aggregate platoon security. The NC-WTM beats the robust and privacy-preserving reputation management scheme (RPRep) and the attack resistant trust management scheme (ART) trust designs regarding accuracy, recall, and F-score. Metrics, such as precision results of 78%, recall of 69.3%, F-score of 60.4%, and accuracy of 89%, are achieved and optimised in this trust model.

  abstract     = {Aspect-level sentiment classification, a significant task of fine-grained sentiment analysis, aims to identify the sentimental information expressed in each aspect of a given sentence The existing methods combine global features and local structures to  obtain good classification results. However, the introduction of global features will bring noise and reduce the classification accuracy. To solve this problem, a new method is proposed, named GP-GCN. In our proposed method, the global feature is further simplified to reduce the noise . The local structures and global features obtained by orthogonal feature projection are introduced into aspect-level sentiment classification. First, the simplified global feature structures of text are built. Through orthogonal projection, GCN not only weakens the dependency of the graph node in updating process but also reduces the dependency between node and corpus. Next, syntactic dependency structure and sentence sequence information are utilised to mine the local dependency structure of sentences. A percentage-based multi-headed attention mechanism is proposed to measure the critical output of GCN, which can better represent sentences for given aspects. Finally, location coding is input to simulate aspect-specific representations between each aspect and its context such that the text becomes more discriminative in sentiment classification. The experimental results show that the proposed method effectively improves the accuracy of text sentiment classification.},

Deep neural network can not effectively use the feature information between different levels. The accuracy of image semantic segmentation is damaged. To solve this problem, we present an image semantic segmentation with hierarchical feature fusion based on deep neural network (ISHF). It can be widely used in image perception and recognition of various living and industrial backgrounds. This algorithm uses convolution structure to extract the shallow low-level features with pixel level and the deep semantic features with image level, fully obtaining the hidden feature information in the shallow low-level features and deep semantic features. Then, after thinning the shallow low-level feature information by up-sampling operation, all feature information is merged and fused. Finally, the image semantic segmentation of hierarchical feature fusion is realised. Experimental results shows that our proposed method not only get better performance of image semantic segmentation, but also achieve faster running speed than SegNet, PSPNet, and DeepLabV3.},

Many researchers claimed they employed the Generative Adversarial Nets (GAN) to alleviate this issue by feeding reward signals from a discriminator to update the LM (generator). However, some researchers argued that GAN did not work by evaluating the generated texts with a quality-diversity metric such as Bleu versus self-Bleu, and language model score versus reverse language model score. Unfortunately, these two-dimension metrics are not reliable. Furthermore, the existing methods only assessed the final generated texts, thus neglecting the dynamic evaluating the adversarial learning process. Different from the above-mentioned methods, we adopted the most recent metric functions, which measure the distributional discrepancy between real and generated text. Besides that, we design a comprehensive experiment to investigate the performance during the learning process. First, we evaluate a language model with two functions and identify a large discrepancy. Then, several methods with the detected discrepancy signal to improve the generator were tried. Experimenting with two language GANs on two benchmark datasets, we found that the distributional discrepancy increases with more adversarial learning rounds. Our research provides convicted evidence that the language GANs fail.},

  abstract     = {Authentication mechanisms are at the forefront of defending the world from various types of cybercrime. Steganography can serve as an authentication solution through the use of a digital signature embedded in a carrier object to ensure the integrity of the object and simultaneously lighten the burden of metadata management. Nevertheless, despite being generally imperceptible to human sensory systems, any degree of steganographic distortion might be inadmissible in fidelity-sensitive situations such as forensic science, legal proceedings, medical diagnosis and military reconnaissance. This has led to the development of reversible steganography. A fundamental element of reversible steganography is predictive analytics, for which powerful neural network models have been effectively deployed. Another core element is reversible steganographic coding. Contemporary coding is based primarily on heuristics, which offers a shortcut towards sufficient, but not necessarily optimal, capacity–distortion performance. While attempts have been made to realise automatic coding with neural networks, perfect reversibility is unattainable via such learning machinery. Instead of relying on heuristics and machine learning, we aim to derive optimal coding by means of mathematical optimisation. In this study, we formulate reversible steganographic coding as a nonlinear discrete optimisation problem with a logarithmic capacity constraint and a quadratic distortion objective. Linearisation techniques are developed to enable iterative mixed-integer linear programming. Experimental results validate the near-optimality of the proposed optimisation algorithm when benchmarked against a brute-force method.},

  abstract     = {Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) is a new method for extracting, learning, and inferencing graph data that builds an embedded representation of the target node by aggregating information from neighbouring nodes. GCN is decisive for node classification and link prediction tasks in recent research. Although the existing GCN performs well, we argue that the current design ignores the potential features of the node. In addition, the presence of features with low correlation to nodes can likewise limit the learning ability of the model. Due to the above two problems, we propose Feature Recommendation Strategy (FRS) for Graph Convolutional Network in this paper. The core of FRS is to employ a principled approach to capture both node-to-node and node-to-feature relationships for encoding, then recommending the maximum possible features of nodes and replacing low-correlation features, and finally using GCN for learning of features. We perform a node clustering task on three citation network datasets and experimentally demonstrate that FRS can improve learning on challenging tasks relative to state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines.},

However, malicious users inject fake user profiles to destroy the security and reliability of the recommender systems, which is called shilling attacks. Therefore, it is crucial to improve the recommendation technique against shilling attacks. Malicious users use a single method to perform shilling attacks. Intuitively, fusing multiple criteria to construct CFR can effectively resist shilling attacks. A novel CFR is proposed against shilling attacks (called CFR-F ). In our approach, a similar interest users’ resource set is obtained first by integrating users’ dynamic interest model and social tags. Then, a similar interest user resource set is selected according to a strategy that selects preference influence weight based on user background. Our experimental results show that our approach can recommend accurate information resources and has a lower Mean Absolute Error ( MAE ) and Average Prediction Shift ( APS ) than traditional techniques by 50% and 20%, respectively.},

In the feature vectorisation stage, the pre-training model Bert is utilised to vectorise the keywords and content, and a random initialisation is used for the grammar. In addition, the fluency is also taken into account based on the speech speed. The overall holistic score is obtained by fusing the four scores using the random forest regressor.

In this paper, a novel anomaly detection model is proposed for multimodal WSN data flows. First, the temporal features and modal correlation features extracted from each sensor node are fused into one vector representation, then it is further aggregated with the spatial features represented the spatial position relationship of the nodes; finally,the current time-series data of WSN nodes are predicted, and abnormal states are identified according to the fusion features. The simulation results obtained on a public dataset show that the proposed approach can significantly improve upon existing methods interms of robustness, and its F1 score reaches 0.90, which is 14.2% higher than that of the graph convolution network (GCN) with longshort-term memory (LSTM).},

In this paper, we use two populations in the lower-level search. The first population maintains non-dominance and diversity in the lower-level objective space and provides the second population with convergence pressure from the lower level. The second population selects the upper-level non-dominated solutions that are not dominated by the first population in the lower-level objective space, which make the second population maintain the non-dominance at both upper and lower levels. Besides, to improve the search efficiency, we set up the upper-level mating pool to generate the upper-level vectors of offsprings near the upper-level vectors of the better individuals in the current population. To balance convergence and diversity, the selection operator of  a decomposition based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm is adopted.

  abstract     = {In order to resist malicious attacks and improve recommendation accuracy, this paper proposes a collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm based on fuzzy subjective trust based on the subjectivity and fuzziness of trust. Firstly, the trust matrix is constructed by calculating the trust degree between users based on fuzzy subjective trust model and set of trusted users. Then, based on the traditional collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm, the user hybrid recommendation matrix is obtained through user similarity matrix and trust matrix to form recommendations for target users. Experimental results show that this method can effectively improve the resistance to malicious attacks and improve the accuracy of the recommendation system.},

  abstract     = {How to find the critical nodes in the network structure quickly and accurately is a topic of network science. Various algorithms for critical nodes already exist, of which, however, some are with high time complexity and the rest are limited in application range. To solve this problem, an algorithm, referred to as Vital Node Searcher (VNS), is proposed, which discovers critical nodes from a network based on deep reinforcement learning. The VNS method first takes advantage of the Graph Embedding to downscale the feature information of the target network, and then uses the deep Q network method to extract the critical node sequence. A Long-Short Term network module is designed and applied to fully exploit historical information that is contained in the sequence data. Moreover, a duelling Q network module is developed to enhance the precision of prediction. Both in terms of time complexity and performance, the VNS method is superior compared with other methods, which are validated by experiments of real world datasets. Moreover, VNS method has strong generalisation performance and can be applied to different types of critical node problems. The VNS method performed experiments on four datasets and obtained ANC scores that outperformed the other models respectively. The experiment results demonstrated that the VNS method had a stable and effective performance on finding out the critical node sequence.},

The paper presents a novel graph algorithm comprising three stages to acquire a time constrained shortest path between any two nodes on the map. In the first stage, the undirected graph is transformed into a directed graph (DT graph) by deleting edges that must not be included in any of the time constrained shortest paths. A variant DT tree with the destination as the root and the source as the leaf is then constructed from the DT graph in the second stage. By finding the minimal difference value between leaves and the root of the variant DT tree, we can eventually obtain a time constrained shortest path from the variant DT tree in the third stage. Experimental results show that our algorithm not only requires less running time than some classical graph algorithms but also can work immediately in the first stage without knowing the information of both the destination and a specific time constraint.},

When encountering a newly developed project with insufficient training data, CPDP can be used to build defect predictors using other projects. However, CPDP does not take into account the prior knowledge of the target items and the class imbalance in the source item data. In this paper, we design an active learning selection algorithm for cross-project defect prediction to alleviate the above problems. First, we use clustering and active learning algorithms to filter and label some representative data from the target items and use these data as prior knowledge to guide the selection of source items. Then, the active learning algorithm is used to filter representative data from the source items. Finally, the balanced cross-item dataset is constructed using the active learning algorithm, and the defect prediction model is built. In this article, we selected 10 open-source projects by using common defect prediction models, active learning algorithms, and common evaluation metrics. The results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively filter the data, solve the class imbalance problem in cross-project data, and improve the defect prediction performance.},

  abstract     = {The search space of large-scale multi-objective optimization problems (LSMOPs) is huge because of the hundreds or even thousands of decision variables involved. It is very challenging to design efficient algorithms for LSMOPs to search the whole space effectively and balance the convergence and diversity at the same time. In this paper, to tackle this challenge, we develop a new algorithm based on a weighted optimization framework with two effective strategies. The weighted optimization framework transforms an LSMOP into multiple small-scale multi-objective optimization problems based on a problem transformation mechanism to reduce the dimensionality of the search space effectively. To further improve its effectiveness, we firstly propose a centerline symmetry strategy to select reference solutions to transform the LSMOPs. It takes not only some non-dominated solutions but also their centerline symmetric points as the reference solutions, which can enhance the population diversity to avoid the algorithm falling into local minima. Then, a new double-line transformation function is designed to expand the search range of the transformed problem to further improve the convergence and diversity. With the two strategies, more widely distributed potential search areas are provided and the optimal solutions can be found easier. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm, numerical experiments on widely used benchmarks are executed and the statistical results show that our proposed algorithm is more competitive and performs better than the other state-of-the-art algorithms for solving LSMOPs.},

Carrying out the Internet of Vehicles secure authentication before interaction of information is an important part of ensuring the security foundation. Therefore, this article designs a safe and reliable Internet of Vehicles authentication and key agreement schemeassisted by blockchain. This article uses a multi-TA network model to improve the efficiency of authentication. Because of the rapid movement of vehicles, it will continue to appear cross-RSU and TA certification. Considering the disadvantages of most centralised authentication protocols using a single TA, this paper uses the multi-TA model to improve the efficiency of authentication. By usingblockchain technology to store the authentication information of vehicles, the cross-domain authentication of vehicles and the protection of user privacy information can be well realised. At the same time, in order to reduce the time of vehicle authentication, this scheme uses a lightweight calculation operation to complete the whole process of authentication. Through security analysis and results of Proverif simulation, the security of the solution is well proved, our scheme can resist various common attacks. Compared with some existing Internet of Vehicles security authentication protocols, the proposed scheme has a lower cost of computation, communication, and storage.},

Regarding semantics loss in image event recognition, this paper first proposes a WordNet-based optimization algorithm for concept semantics similarity and describes the semantics relations between different concepts by taking account of such following four impact factors in the WordNet tree as concept semantics distance, concept node depth, concept node density and concept semantics overlap ratio. On that basis, an image event recognition algorithm (CS-IER) based on concept score is proposed, while multi-view learning is applied to fuse concept score and inter-conceptual semantics relations. However, if a higher erroneous concept score is given using CNN, multi-view learning will also augment the concept score approximate to its erroneous concept semantics, thereby leading to the distortion of image representation information. To address this problem, CNN is used to extract channel information to obtain the local features of the image, and it is further fused with the optimized concept score features, so as to form the final image representation information and complete the image event recognition. In experiments, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm on three datasets is verified.},

The effect of malicious traffic detection based on neural networks is promising. Still, the slow computation brings some difficulties to deploying AI-based detection systems on edge servers. Time Convolutional Network (TCN) is a high-speed neural network suitable for massively parallel computation. In this paper, we propose Multi-class S-TCN, an improved network supporting multiple classifications based on TCN for the practical needs of IoT scenarios. Besides, we implement a complete IoT traffic security detection procedure based on deep packet inspection and protocol analysis.

Still, they do not present security analyses of smart contracts that may result in substantial threats to the users of the systems. This manuscript presents an in-depth study of twelve publicly available security analysis tools and standard vulnerabilities in smart contracts and reviews. The experimental setup uses a two-step approach for selecting the security analysis tool. The first step identifies the seven tools their proposers or independent researchers have compared, and the second step proposes a new method for selecting tools based on continuous improvement. Our experimental results show security issues in 51.72% of the analysed smart contracts of four Blockchain-based rating/review systems. 6.67% of vulnerable smart contracts exhibit high-level severity threats that raise an alarming condition for the current state of system developments.},

  abstract     = {Metro passenger flow prediction is an essential part of crowd flow forecasting and intelligent transportation management systems. However, two challenges still need to be addressed to achieve a more accurate prediction: (1) accounting for featural dependence instead of considering only the temporal connection and spatial relations; (2) utilising graph structures to address non-European relationships of spatial and featural dependence. To address these challenges, we developed a novel model called the multi-featured spatial-temporal (MFST) and dynamic multi-graph convolutional network (DMGCN) model. Temporal connections are learned from both the local and global information in a time-series sequence using the combination of a time-trend feature mapping block and a gated recurrent unit block. Spatial relation and featural dependence are separately captured by two DMGCN blocks. Each DMGCN block encodes various relationships by constructing multiple graphs consisting of predefined and non-defined topologies. The results of evaluations conducted of the MFST tensor and the DMGCN on the real-world Beijing subway dataset indicate that the prediction performance of the proposed model is superior to that of the existing baselines. The proposed model thus contributes significantly to the improvement of public safety by providing early warnings of large passenger flow and enabling the smart scheduling of resources.},

Major previous works can be classified into two categories: heuristic-based and guided random-search-based workflow scheduling methods. Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is a recently proposed search methodology with great success in AI research on game playing, such as Computer Go. However, researchers found that MCTS also has potential application in many other domains, including combinatorial optimization, task scheduling, planning, and so on. In this paper, we present a new workflow scheduling approach based on MCTS, which is still a rarely explored direction. Several new mechanisms are developed for the major steps in MCTS to improve workflow execution schedules further.

In order to solve the problems that the existing detection methods cannot fully learn the spatio-temporal characteristics of data, the classification accuracy is not high, and the detection time and accuracy are susceptible to the influence of redundant data in the sample. Thus, this paper proposes a network abnormal detection method (PCSS) integrating principal component analysis (PCA) and single-stage headless face detector algorithms (SSH). PCSS applies the PCA algorithm to the data preprocessing to eliminate the interference of redundant data. At the same time, PCSS also combines feature fusion and SSH to enhance the feature extraction of unclear features data, and effectively improve the detection speed and accuracy. Simulation experiments based on IDS2017 and IDS2012 data sets are carried out in this paper. Experimental results show that PCSS is obviously superior to other detection models in detection speed and accuracy, which provides a new method for efficiently detecting traffic attacks.},

We have utilised them to assess software trustworthiness on the basis of attribute decomposition, presented four properties, constructed a software trustworthiness measure (STMBDA for short). In this paper, we extend the set of properties, introduce two new properties, namely non-negativity and proportionality, and perfect substitutability and expectability. We verify the theoretical rationality of STMBDA by demonstrating that it conforms to the new property set and the empirical validity by evaluating the trustworthiness of 23 spacecraft software.

However, feature selection methods using EC cannot get rid of invalid features effectively. A small number of invalid features still exist till the termination of the algorithms. In this paper, a feature selection method using genetic programming (GP) combined with feature ranking (FRFS) is proposed. It is assumed that the more the original features appear in the GP individuals&#39; terminal nodes, the more valuable these features are. To further decrease the number of selected features, FRFS using a multi-criteria fitness function which is named as MFRFS is investigated. Experiments on 15 datasets show that FRFS can obtain higher classification performance with smaller number of features compared with the feature selection method without feature ranking. MFRFS further reduces the number of features while maintaining the classification performance compared with FRFS. Comparisons with five benchmark techniques show that MFRFS can achieve better classification performance.},

  abstract     = {Mobile Crowd Sensing (MCS) typically assigns sensing tasks in the same target area to many participants considering data quality and the diversity of sensing devices. However, participant selection is based on the individual in many research. The efficiency of individual recruitment is low. Individuals need higher transportation costs to go to the task location alone, and the data quality perceived by individuals is difficult to guarantee. This paper proposes a team-based multitask data acquisition scheme under time constraints to address these challenges. The scheme optimised the number of participants, traffic cost, and data quality and designed four team-based multitask allocation algorithms under time constraints in the MCS: T-RandomTeam, T-MostTeam, T-RandomMITeam, and T-MostMITeam. The team size is associated with the number of participants required for the first task or the vehicle capacity to perform the task. We conducted extensive experiments based on a real large-scale dataset to evaluate the four algorithms&#39; performances compared to two baseline algorithms (T-Random and T-most). The efficiency of the four algorithms has been significantly improved by team recruitment. The transportation cost can be multiplicatively reduced by carpooling. Data quality can be improved by at least 2% through reputation screening and team members&#39; communication.},

While transmitting, this study provides several flexible and scalable schemes to manage security issues, which dynamically adjust the framework depending on the rapidly changing IoV topology and speed up the time to synchronise the reconstruction of the system key, and decrease the quantity of phases to resynchronise the system key. Moreover, most research of key management without secure data transmission, we integrate the M-tree key management with secure data transmission to achieve the secure IoV.

Therefore, this paper analyses the reluctance and/or concerns of prosumers regarding smart contracts, and investigates their perception on blockchain within PEMs. The authors present the results of a survey conducted across several European countries addressing the implementation of automated trading systems and analysing the adoption of smart contracts. Considering that the main survey outcomes are related to the regulation and legislation uncertainty around blockchain usage, this paper explores also the fit of smart contracts from a legal perspective. Additionally, a set of recommendations to be used as the basis for the design and development of PEMs is delivered, aiming to adopt blockchain and smart contracts.

By traffic event reporting, traffic efficiency can be significantly improved. However, people usually lack the motivation for reporting traffic events or driving violations, because once the identity of the reporter is leaked, he or she may be tracked by malicious attackers or be retaliated by violators. However, if the reporter is anonymous, it is difficult to guarantee the accuracy and authenticity of the reports. In order to solve this contradiction, a mechanism that combines certificateless message authentication and blockchain incentives is proposed in this paper. A certificateless message signature algorithm is designed to provide the anonymity and non-repudiation for traffic-related message reporters. Simultaneously, an adaptive t -threshold multi-signature mechanism is introduced in our scheme. Similar to crowdsourcing, it requires multiple participants to witness the authenticity of the message together. Aggregation signature verification improves message authentication efficiency. A trust currency called TCoin is introduced to motivate reporters&#39; enthusiasm for participation in intelligent transportation. The security analysis and simulation results show that our scheme is secure and effective in the intelligent transportation system.},

Currently, the traffic conditions are either synthesised by tools (e.g. using mathematical models) or created manually (using domain knowledge), which cannot reflect the realistic, region-specific conditions or will require extensive labour works. In this article, we propose an automatic methodology to model the real-world traffic conditions captured by the sensor data and to reproduce the modeled traffic in the digital twin. We have built the tools based on the methodology and use the KITTI dataset to validate the effectiveness of the tools. To recreate the region-specific traffic, we present the results of capturing, modelling, and recreating the two-wheeler traffic condition on the Southeast Asia road.

First of all, this paper studies the failure mechanism, vibration mechanism and signal characteristics of common failures of rolling bearings, combined with sensor technology, summarises and designs various bearing failures and failure signal detection models. Secondly, the deep neural network algorithm is used for the interference situation of rolling bearing vibration signal and the process of data re-analysis.

  abstract     = {With the development of deep learning, neural networks are widely used in various fields, and the improved model performance also introduces a considerable number of parameters and computations. Model quantisation is a technique that turns floating-point computing into low-specific-point computing, which can effectively reduce model computation strength, parameter size, and memory consumption but often bring a considerable loss of accuracy. This paper mainly addresses the problem where the distribution of parameters is too concentrated during quantisation aware training (QAT). In the QAT process, we use a piecewise function to statistics the parameter distributions and simulate the effect of quantisation noise in each round of training, based on the statistical results. Experimental results show that by quantising the Transformer network, we lose less precision and significantly reduce the storage cost of the model; compared with the full precision LSTM network, our model has higher accuracy under the condition of a similar storage cost. Meanwhile, compared with other quantisation methods on language modelling task, our approach is more accurate. We validated the effectiveness of our policy on the WikiText-103 and PENN Treebank datasets. The experiments show that our method extremely compresses the storage cost and maintains high model performance.},

  abstract     = {The liver ultrasound standard planes (LUSP) have significant diagnostic significance during ultrasonic liver diagnosis. However, the location and acquisition of LUSP could be a time-consuming and complicated mission and requires the relevant operator to have comprehensive knowledge of ultrasound diagnosis. Therefore, this study puts forward an automatic classification approach for eight types of LUSP based on a pre-trained CNN(Convolutional Neural Network). With the comparison to classification methods on the basis of conventional hand-craft characteristics, the method proposed by us can automatically catch the appearance in LUSP and classify the LUSP. The proposed model is consisted of 13 convolutional layers with little 3×3 size kernels and three completely connected layers. To address the limitation of data, we adopt the transfer learning strategy, which pre-trains the weight of convolutional layers and fine-tune the weight of fully connected layers. These extensive experiments show that the accuracy of the suggested method reaches 92.31%, as well as the performance of the suggested means outperforms previous ways, which demonstrates the suitability and effectiveness of CNN to classify LUSP for clinical diagnosis.},

However, the huge number of parameters and calculations in the HPE model have brought big challenges to deploy to resource-constrained mobile devices. Aiming to overcome the challenge, we propose a sparse pruning method (SPM) for the HPE model. First, L1 regularisation is added in the training phase of the original model, and network parameters of the convolution layers (CLs) and batch normalisation layers (BNLs) are sparsely trained to obtain a network structure with sparse weights. We then combine the sparse weights of filters with the scaling parameters of the BNLs to determine their importance. Finally, the structured pruning method is used to prune the sparse filters and corresponding channels. SPM can reduce the number of model parameters and calculations without affecting precision. Promising results indicate that SPM outperforms other advanced pruning methods.},

As an important algorithm of semi-supervised support vector machines (S 3 3 3 VM), transductive support vector machine (TSVM) sometimes  may get worse models trained on both labelled samples and unlabelled samples than those trained only on labelled samples. To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose a safe TSVM (STSVM) based on the infinitesimal annealing algorithm. In the training of TSVM, we adopt the infinitesimal annealing and path following technology to approximate the step size of simulated annealing to balance the contradiction between annealing step and calculation time. During the annealing process, we call CP-step to update TSVM model with pseudo-labelled samples. If the current sample is on the boundary of combinatorial optimisation problem, SJ-step is called and a safety condition is designed to determine whether the sample needs to change its label or not, so as to ensure the TSVM model trained after changing is better than the model got before. The experimental results show that our STSVM algorithm can improve the accuracy of TSVM with a shorter running time, and is safer than the existing safe algorithms.},

With the increased acceptance of Model-Driven Development (MDD) in the safety-critical domain, the SysML language has been broadly used. Increasing complexity results in the formal verification of the SysML models of SC-CPS often faces the so-called state-explosion problem. Moreover, safety analysis is also an important step to ensure the quality of SC-CPS. Thus, this article proposes an integrated SysML modelling and verification approach to cover specification of nominal behaviour and safety. First, an extension of SysML is presented, in which the contract information (i.e. Assume and Guarantee ) is extended for SysML block diagrams and a Safety Profile is proposed to describe safety-related concepts. Second, the transformation from SysML to the compositional verification tool OCRA is given. Third, the safety analysis is achieved by translating the Safety Profile model into FTA (Fault Tree Analysis). Finally, the prototype tools including SysML2OCRA and SafetyProfile2FTA are represented, and the effectiveness of the method proposed in this paper is verified through actual industrial cases.},

MDT applies new technologies of IoT, AI and big data to predict the state of health and offer clinical suggestions. It is crucial to secure medical digital twins through deep understanding of the design of digital twins and applying the new vulnerability tolerant approach. In this paper, we present a new medical digital twin, which systematically combines Haptic-AR navigation and deep learning techniques to achieve virtual replica and cyber–human interaction. We report an innovative study of the cyber–human interaction performance in different scenarios. With the focus on cyber resilience, a new solution of vulnerability tolerant is the must in the real-world MDT scenarios. We propose a novel scheme for recognising and fixing MDT vulnerabilities, in which a new CodeBERT-based neural network is applied to better understand risky code and capture cybersecurity semantics. We develop a prototype of the new MDT and collect several real-world datasets. In the empirical study, a number of well-designed experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of digital twin, cyber–human interaction and vulnerability detection. The results confirm that our new platform works well, can support clinical decision and has great potential in cyber resilience.},

In this paper, we propose a traffic density monitoring system by adding a pseudonym server and a location anonymisation server; the identity information and location information of the vehicles are saved separately. The system can protect both the location privacy of vehicles and the query privacy of users. To prevent dummy locations from being filtered, we calculate the probability distribution of historical location service requests to generate location anonymous sets, which can improve the success rate of anonymity. The location anonymisation server uses the location anonymous set instead of the real location of the vehicle to send to the location-based service provider, which can increase the location privacy security of the vehicle. According to the experimental results of this paper, compared with SimpMaxMinDistds algorithm and MMDS algorithm, our system has better location anonymous set generation efficiency and location privacy protection level.},

On the one hand, a new decision threshold is designed in A-FDP combined with the InterQuartile Range and standard deviation. We select the points larger than the decision threshold as the cluster centres. On the other hand, these cluster centres are made as nodes to construct the connected graphs. These subclusters are merged by finding the connected components of the connected graph.

Moreover, the local search ability and population diversity have not been solved properly. Therefore, an adaptive DE algorithm using fitness distance correlation and a neighbourhood-based strategy (FNADE) is proposed. FNADE introduces the fitness distance correlation (FDC) as the basis for judging the difficulty of the problem, utilises a Voronoi diagram to increase the population diversity for complex multimodal problems and adopts the neighbourhood-based mutation strategy to strengthen the local search capability. FNADE is committed to solving unconstrained single-objective optimisation problems. The proposed algorithm is compared with six advanced DE algorithms in terms of CEC2017 benchmark functions. The experimental results show that the adaptive DE algorithm using FNADE is superior to other DE algorithms with regard to the accuracy and population diversity of the solution.},

Ontology matching technique uses the similarity measure to determine the correspondences between two heterogeneous ontology entities. In order to improve the quality of ontology alignment, it is necessary to combine different kinds of similarity measures, and how to optimize the aggregating weights is called the ontology meta-matching problem. Tin this work, a heuristic evaluating metric on the ontology alignment is presented to evaluate the ontology alignment&#39;s quality, and a mathematical model on ontology meta-matching problem is constructed. Then, an Adaptive Evolutionary Algorithm (AEA) is proposed to effectively solve this problem. In particular, when the elite solution remains unchanged, AEA adaptively activates three independent exploring strategies, which, respectively use the adaptive selection, crossover and mutation operators based on the population diversity metric.

However, most of the KNMF algorithms are developed via a specific kernel function and thus fail to adopt other kinds of kernels. Also, they have to learn pre-image inaccurately that may influence the reliability of the method. To address these problems of KNMF, this paper proposes a novel general kernel-based non-negative matrix factorisation (GKBNNMF) method. It not only avoids pre-image learning but also is suitable for any kernel functions as well. We assume that the mapped basis images fall within the cone spanned by the mapped training data, allowing us to use arbitrary kernel function in the algorithm. The symmetric NMF strategy is exploited on kernel matrix to establish our general kernel NMF model. The proposed algorithm is proven to be convergent. The facial image datasets are selected to evaluate the performance of our method. Compared with some state-of-the-art approaches, the experimental results demonstrate that our proposed is both effective and robust.},

Contrast layers and deconvolutional layers are added to make the difference between the blurred areas and clear areas more prominent.

  abstract     = {Binary translators, which translate the binary executables from one instruction set to another, are useful tools. Indirect branches are one of the key factors that affect the efficiency of binary translators. In the previous research, our lab developed an LLVM-based binary translation framework, called Rabbit . Rabbit introduces novel optimisations: platform-dependent hyperchaining and platform-independent hyperchaining for improving the emulation of the indirect branch instructions. Indirect branch instructions may have several destinations, and these destinations are not known until runtime. Both platform-independent and platform-dependent hyperchaining establish a search table for each indirect branch instruction to record the visited branch destinations at runtime. In this work, we focus on the translation from AArch64 binary to RISC-V binary and further develop the profile-guided optimisation for indirect branch , which collects runtime information, including branch destinations and execution frequency of each destination for each indirect branch instruction, and then use the information to improve hyperchaining (i.e. accelerate the process of finding the branch destination). The profile-guided optimisation can be divided to profile-guided platform-independent hyperchaining and profile-guided platform-dependent hyperchaining . We finally use SPEC CPU 2006 CINT benchmark to evaluate the optimisations. The experiment results indicate that compared with (1) no chaining, (2) platform-independent hyperchaining and (3) platform-dependent hyperchaining, profile-guided platform-independent hyperchaining provides 1.123×, 1.066× and 1.098× speedup respectively. Similarly, profile-guided platform-dependent hyperchaining achieves 1.106×, 1.047× and 1.083× speedup with respect to the above three configurations, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Aiming at the problems of few detecting samples, deformable target sizes and overlapping among targets in the detection of headdresses and seats of Thangka Yidam, we propose an optimised few shot Thangka detection method based on the ResNet and deformable convolution. Firstly, the optimised deep residual network is designed to address the problem of few categories and complicated composition in Thangka images. Then, we replace the 3×3 convolution of the optimised deep residual network with deformable convolution. By introducing the offset of deformable convolution, the receptive field can adapt to the different sizes and shapes of the detection target of Thangka Yidam. Finally, the box regression is achieved through the multi-relation detector, where DT-NMS is proposed to reduce the missed and repeated detection target. Experimental results show that the proposed method has better performance than the SOTA on the COCO dataset. In addition, the AP of 2-way 5-shot on the Thangka dataset is 33.3%, and the AP50 reaches 71.2%, which increases by 4.7% and 5.3%, respectively.},

  abstract     = {When the ambient temperature is low, a large amount of water mist and dust will inevitably appear around the zinc flotation cell, forming haze, which seriously affects the extraction of flotation froth image features. General defogging methods of natural image are difficult to obtain satisfactory results for such industrial haze image. Therefore, we propose a real-time defogging method based on ASM-VoFD (Atmospheric Scattering Model and the Variable-order Fractional Differential). First, the dark pixel ratio is used to detect fog in froth image, which solves the redundant calculation caused by unnecessary defogging operations. Second, the linear transformation of the atmospheric scattering model is used to calculate the initial transmission map, and the gaussian filter is used to optimize the initial transmittance, and the haze-free image is restored with atmospheric light estimation. Finally, a variable order fractional differential operator is used to enhance the edges and texture details of the restored froth image, which solves the problems of blurred edges and low contrast. The experiments show that the algorithm has a good defogging effect on the industrial images, enhance the edges of the image, and can be effectively implemented in O(N) time to meet the application requirements of real-time flotation monitoring.},

Furthermore, various optimisation models with multi-agent systems have been proposed for the single-layer scheduling and communicating, which results in either a high time cost or a difficult multi-target regression. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical-fuzzy bins allocation method and a multi-parameter adjustment values prediction model in the multi-agent collaborative control system. The method intuitively achieves topgallant and hierarchical bins allocation by different fuzzy rule bases. The multi-parameter adjustment values prediction model utilising parallel-multi LSTM(PM-LSTM) is located on the accurate multi-parameter prediction. First, new loading reference standards and an abnormal data procession method are adopted for the dataset collection. Second, the LSTM-1 is used to extract the time-series features in the loading process. Third, a two-dimensional and reconstructed matrix integrates comprehensive features with the feature crossover method. The matrix will be used as inputs to predict the adjustment value of multi parameters by the LSTM-2. Finally, the relationship model among multi parameter values is built and fitted.

  abstract     = {Entity and relation extraction has been widely studied in natural language processing, and some joint methods have been proposed in recent years. However, existing studies still suffer from two problems. Firstly, the token space information has been fully utilized in those studies, while the label space information is underutilized. However, a few preliminary works have proven that the label space information could contribute to this task. Secondly, the performance of relevant entities detection is still unsatisfactory in entity and relation extraction tasks. In this paper, a new model GANCE (Gated and Attentive Network Collaborative Extracting) is proposed to address these problems. Firstly, GANCE exploits the label space information by applying a gating mechanism, which could improve the performance of the relation extraction. Then, two multi-head attention modules are designed to update the token and token-label fusion representation. In this way, the relevant entities detection could be solved. Experimental results demonstrate that GANCE has better accuracy than several competitive approaches in terms of entity recognition and relation extraction on the CoNLL04 dataset at 90.32% and 73.59%, respectively. Moreover, the F1 score of relation extraction increased by 1.24% over existing approaches in the ADE dataset.},

At present, most skeleton-based gait recognition approaches extract gait features from merely joint coordinates. However, the information, e.g. bone and motion, is equally instructive and discriminative for gait recognition. Thus, this paper proposes a novel multi-stream part-fused graph convolutional network, MS-Gait, to fuse part-level information and capture multi-order features from skeleton data. To be specific, we integrate a channel attention learning mechanism into the graph convolutional networks (GCN) to improve the representational power. In addition, part-level information is merged by capturing features from the skeleton graph and its subgraphs concurrently. Finally, a multi-stream strategy is proposed to model joint, bone, and motion dynamics simultaneously, which is proven to effectively improve the recognition accuracy. On the popular CASIA-B dataset, extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can achieve state-of-the-art performance and is robust to confounding variations.},

By introducing the collective intelligent behavior model for unmanned swarms based on the collective Observe–Orient–Decide–Act (OODA) loop, this study constructs a comprehensive evaluation index system that can systematically reflect the overall intelligence of unmanned swarms in complex scenarios. Considering the fuzziness and randomness in the processes of weight calculation and level evaluation, this study proposes a comprehensive evaluation method of the intelligence levels for unmanned swarms based on a group extension cloud model. This method calculates the weights of various evaluation indexes at different layers by adopting the group extension analytic hierarchy process. Moreover, it obtains the comprehensive evaluation conclusion of the intelligence levels for unmanned swarms by adopting the cloud model. Applying the proposed method, this study evaluates two specific types of unmanned aerial vehicle swarms.

However, the agent may get trapped during the exploration, lingering around feckless states that pull the agent away from optimal policies. Thus it&#39;s worth studying how to improve learning strategies by forecasting future states. To solve the problem, an algorithm that predicts behaviour consequences before taking action, referred to as Thinking about Action Consequence (TAC), based on the combination of the current state and the policy, is proposed. Deep reinforcement learning approaches equipped with TAC take advantage of the intrinsic prediction framework of TAC as well as bad consequence experiences to determine whether to continue exploring the current region or to evade the potential undesired state discriminated by TAC and instead turn to explore other areas. Since TAC will modify the future plan according to the execution of the policy and the changes of the environment, considering the consequences enables the agent to carry out a suitable exploration mechanism, leading to better performance. Compared with traditional Deep Q Learning (DQN), Double DQN, Dueling DQN, Prioritised Experience Replay DQN, and Intrinsic Reward (IR) methods with uncertain stimulus exploration, our TAC method shows better performance in Atari and Box2d environments.},

The constriction factor ensures an appropriately controlled transition from exploration into exploitation, leading to an enhanced diversity and appropriate learning rate adjustment throughout the search process. We introduce Gravitational Search Algorithm to enhance the exploratory ability of PSO. An adaptive response strategy is incorporated to activate stagnated particles to curtail the high tendency to get trapped in a local optimum. To verify the efficacy of the improvement strategies, we employ the proposed algorithm in training a Single Layer Feedforward neural network to classify real-world data ranging from binary to multi-class datasets of which our proposed algorithm outperforms the others.},

As the attackers exploit the vulnerabilities of popular third-party components to invade target websites, further improving the classification accuracy of malicious network traffic is the key to improving the performance of  abnormal traffic detection. Existing intrusion detection systems may suffer from incomplete feature extraction and low classification accuracy. Thus, this paper proposes an efficient hybrid parallel deep learning model (HPM) for intrusion detection based on margin learning. First, HPM constructs two parallel CNN architectures and fuses the spatial features obtained through full convolution. Secondly, the temporal information of the fused features is parsed separately using two parallel LSTMs. Finally, the extracted spatial-temporal features are fed into the CosMargin classifier for classification detection after global convolution and global pooling. Besides, this paper proposes an improved traffic feature extraction method, which not only reduces redundant features but also speeds up the convergence speed of the network. In the experiment, our HPM has achieved 99% detection accuracy of each malicious class, ranging from 5%–10% improvement with other models, which demonstrates the superiority of our proposed model.},

Additionally, the study involves arbitrage-free, an essential economics concept, which is not reasonable on data items. To address these problems, this paper provides insights for designing an improved subscription scheme that includes two components: the calculation and the specific validity. On the one hand, the calculation improves the existing scheme by building a new structure that combines different customers&#39; behaviours instead of the separated calculation in the existing scheme, and can steadily set prices for subscriptions to maximise the sellers&#39; profit even in a real market. On the other hand, the specific validity shows the improvement towards arbitrage-free by taking the characteristics of data subscriptions into account.

For the above problems, we construct a fuzzy multi-keyword search scheme based on a two-level tree index, where the first-level tree index stores keyword tags and the second-level stores encrypted file identifiers and counting bloom filters (CBFs). By constructing a two-level tree index, efficient multi-keyword search is realised, and it also has obvious time advantages when performing the single-keyword search. In addition, the proposed scheme supports index updating by introducing the CBF, and it can realise fuzzy search by calculating the inner product between the CBF in index and search trapdoor. At last, the proposed scheme is proved to be semantically secure under the known ciphertext attack model. Theoretical analysis and simulation test indicate that the proposed scheme spends lower computation overhead than other related schemes, especially in the search phase; as the number of matching files or query keywords grows, it costs less time, at around 2–10 ms.},

It is very challenging since a stock usually shows highly stochastic property in price and has complex relationships with other stocks. Most existing approaches cannot jointly take the above two issues into account and thus cannot yield satisfactory prediction result. This paper contributes a new stock movement prediction model, Selective Transfer Learning with Adversarial Training (STLAT). Our STLAT method advances existing solutions in two major aspects: (i) tailoring the pre-trained and fine-tuned method for stock movement prediction and (ii) introducing the data selector module to select the more relevant training samples. More specifically, we pre-train the shared base model using three different tasks. The predictor task is constructed to measure the performance of the shared base model with source domain data and target domain data. The adversarial training task is constructed to improve the generalisation of the shared base model. The data selector task is introduced to select the most relevant and high-quality training samples from stocks in source domain. All three tasks are jointly trained with a loss function. As a result, the pre-trained shared base model can be fine-tuned with the stock data in target domain. To validate our method, we perform the back-testing on the historical data of two public datasets and a newly constructed dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our STLAT method. It outperforms state-of-the-art stock prediction solutions on ACC evaluation of 3.76%, 4.12%, 4.89% on ACL18, KDD17 and CN50, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Accurate granularity estimation of ore images is vital in automatic geometric parameter detecting and composition analysis of ore dressing progress. Machine learning based methods have been widely used in multi-scenario ore granularity estimation. However, the adhesion of coal particles in the images usually results in lower segmentation accuracy. Because much powdery coal fills between blocky ones, making edge contrast between them is not distinct. Currently, the coal granularity estimation is still carried out empirical in nature. We propose a novel method for coal granularity estimation based on a deep neural network called Res-SSD to deal with the problem. Then, to further improve the detection performance, we propose an image enhancement layer for Res-SSD. Since the dust generated during production and transportation will seriously damage the image quality, we first propose an image denoising method based on dust modelling. By investigating imaging characteristics of coal, we second propose the optical balance transformation(OBT), by which the distinguishability of coal in dark zones can be increased. Meanwhile, OBT can also suppress overexposed spots in images. Experimental results show that the proposed method is better than classic and state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy while achieving a comparable speed performance.},

  abstract     = {Predicting impending failure of hard disk drives (HDDs) is crucial to avoid losing essential data and service downtime. However, most HDD failure prediction is being challenged by using labelled data itself to evaluate failure rate, while the fact that HDDs deteriorate gradually cannot be described and exploited suitably. Most works on the Self-Monitoring and Reporting Technology (SMART) system attributes utilize simple and traditional methods from machine learning and statistics to achieve HDD failure prediction. So, we propose a novel two-level prediction model Dab , hard Drive failure prediction based on deep Auto-coder and Big data learning, to exploit SMART data for better online HDD failure prediction, constructing detection sub-models of anomaly and health degree. With better accuracy, better performance, better prediction earnings, and proactive fault tolerance, Dab has reduced false alarm rate (FAR) and maintenance cost, and improved failure detection rate (FDR), reliability and robustness of large-scale storage systems.},

  abstract     = {Traffic forecasting is highly challenging due to its complex spatial and temporal dependencies in the traffic network. Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCN) has been effectively used for traffic forecasting due to its excellent performance in modelling spatial dependencies. In most existing approaches, GCN models spatial dependencies in the traffic network with a fixed adjacency matrix. However, the spatial dependencies change over time in the actual situation. In this paper, we propose a graph learning-based spatial-temporal graph convolutional neural network (GLSTGCN) for traffic forecasting. To capture the dynamic spatial dependencies, we design a graph learning module to learn the dynamic spatial relationships in the traffic network. To save training time and computation resources, we adopt dilated causal convolution networks with a gating mechanism to capture long-term temporal correlations in traffic data. We conducted extensive experiments using two real-world traffic datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed GLSTGCN achieves superior performance than all state-of-art baselines.},

To solve the problem above, this paper presents a Chinese sentiment classification model based on extended sentiment dictionary and organisational structure of comments. First, the sentiment dictionary can be extended by using seven dictionaries, which include the base sentiment dictionary and six additional dictionaries. Then, the sets of rules are constructed, which include inter-sentence rules and organisational structure rules. Finally, comments on three hot topics are crawled and used to make the data sets for sentiment calculation. Accordingly, based on the result of sentiment calculation, sentiment classification is completed.

  abstract     = {Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are capable of achieving data dissemination between them such that exploration of their potential could be performed based on their frequency range. It is considered to be highly difficult for recharging sensor devices under adverse situations. The main drawbacks of WSNs concern to the issue of network lifetime, coverage area, scheduling and data aggregation. In particular, prolonging network lifetime confirms the success together with the energy conservation of sensor nodes, data transmission reliability and scalability of their operation in data aggregation. Clustering schemes are considered to be highly suitable for effectively utilising the resources with lower overhead, such that energy consumption is enhanced for upgrading the network lifespan. In this paper, a Hybrid Modified Artificial Bee Colony and Firefly Algorithm (HMABCFA) -Based Cluster Head Selection is proposed for ensuring energy stabilisation, delay minimisation and inter-node distance reduction for improving the network lifetime. This proposed HMABCFA integrates the benefit of the Firefly optimisation algorithm for generating a new position that which has the capability of replacing the position, which is not updated in the scout bee phase of ABC. This incorporation of Firefly optimisation algorithm into the ABC algorithm prevents the limitations of premature convergence, slow convergence and the possibility of being trapped into the local point of optimality in the clustering process. The modified ABC-based clustering process is phenomenal in improving the feasible dimensions for enhancing the process of exploitation and exploration. The results of the HMABCFA, on an average are confirmed to enhance the network lifetime by 23.21%, energy stability by 19.84% and reduce network latency by 22.88%, compared to the benchmarked approaches.},

  abstract     = {5G-assisted device-to-device (D2D) communication plays an instrumental role in minimizing latency, maximizing resource utilization, improving speed, and boosting system capacity. However, the technology confronts several challenges to realize its enormous potential fully. Security and privacy concerns are at the top of the list that can jeopardize the regular operation of D2D communication by executing various assaults such as free-riding and impersonation. Although several researchers suggested different solutions to these concerns, most are too heavy for resource-constrained devices or are vulnerable to security risks. Consequently, we proposed a lightweight and provably secure D2D communication protocol comprising initialization, device discovery, and link setup phases. The protocol is light in terms of computational overhead and communication latency while verifiably secure through formal security analysis. The protocol relies on a new network function, called D2D Security Management Function (DSMF), located near the devices to facilitate secure communication and improve performance. Moreover, we used deep learning-based UE trust score forecasting to better handle and prioritize communication requests when the network is overloaded. The comparative analysis against state-of-the-art security schemes concerning computational and communication overheads shows that our protocol is a superior alternative for resource-constrained IoT devices wishing to perform D2D communication in a 5G network.},

  abstract     = {Because of the existence of irrelevant, redundant, and noisy attributes in large datasets, the accuracy of a classification model has degraded. Hence, feature selection is a necessary pre-processing stage to select the important features that may considerably increase the efficiency of underlying classification algorithms. As a popular metaheuristic algorithm, particle swarm optimisation has successfully applied to various feature selection approaches. Nevertheless, particle swarm optimisation tends to suffer from immature convergence and low convergence rate. Besides, the imbalance between exploration and exploitation is another key issue that can significantly affect the performance of particle swarm optimisation. In this paper, a conditional opposition-based particle swarm optimisation is proposed and used to develop a wrapper feature selection. Two schemes, namely opposition-based learning and conditional strategy are introduced to enhance the performance of the particle swarm optimisation. Twenty-four benchmark datasets are used to validate the performance of the proposed approach. Furthermore, nine metaheuristics are chosen for performance verification. The findings show the supremacy of the proposed approach not only in obtaining high prediction accuracy but also in small feature sizes.},

Our primary purpose is to improve the recommender performance from multiple metrics, such as precision, recall, diversity, and popularity. The core idea is to re-rank the ranking list using the user&#39;s preference behaviour under different contexts. The re-ranking process is an iterative selection process; each time an optimal item that meets the target criteria is selected from the candidate items and added to the re-ranked list. The selection of items depends on the given context and the user&#39;s interest in that context. User&#39;s preference and interest in contexts are both expressed by probability in our algorithm. In addition, we use a weight parameter to control the influence of contexts and model the contextual personalisation of different users through local personalisation parameters. We verify our algorithm through experiments on the real Movielens 100K dataset and show the performance advantage with the existing algorithm.},

Because of the sparse user–item interaction, cold-start recommendation has been a particularly difficult problem. Some efforts have been made to solve the cold-start problem by using model-agnostic meta-learning on the level of the model and heterogeneous information networks on the level of data. Moreover, using the memory-augmented meta-optimisation method effectively prevents the meta-learning model from entering the local optimum. As a result, this paper proposed memory-augmented meta-learning on meta-path, a new meta-learning method that addresses the cold-start recommendation on the meta-path furthered. The meta-path builds at the data level to enrich the relevant semantic information of the data. To achieve fast adaptation, semantic-specific memory is utilised to conduct the model with semantic parameter initialisation, and the method is optimised by a meta-optimisation method. We put this method to the test using two widely used recommended data set and three cold-start scenarios. The experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed method.},

Hence, efficient key management schemes with lightweight ciphers are essential. Many asymmetric keys or public key mechanisms have been developed. However, they are unsuitable for secure group communications in wireless sensor networks, because sensor nodes are usually devoid of sufficient memory, CPU and bandwidth to deal with complex operations. In addition, only a few group key agreements are integrated into secure data transmissions. Therefore, a key agreement using the hierarchy-based cluster elliptic curve key agreement named HCECKA is proposed in this study to deal with secure data transmissions in wireless sensor networks. The presented security mechanism relies on elliptic curves instead of logarithmic curves, and utilises a lesser key length to accomplish similar security classification than Diffie-Hellman and Rivest Shamir Adleman cryptosystems. Simultaneously, the proposed scheme provides a rapid, efficient and dynamic group key synchronisation technique in plenty of sensor nodes with no need for reorganising the whole system key if members join or leave wireless sensor networks.},

First, when generation satisfies a certain condition, the local optimum is selected using the information of neighbour individual objective values to produce mutation offspring. Then, the heuristic crossover operator is established by using a uniform design method to produce better crossover individuals. Next, an external archive is set for each individual to store the individuals beneficial to the optimisation objective functions. Then, the individual is selected from the external archive to generate mutation offspring. In addition, considering that the performance of DE is determined by parameters, using the relevant information of the objective space function value, the self-adaptive adjustment strategy is adopted for the relevant parameter. Finally, a series of test functions with 5-, 10-, and 15-objectives are performed in the experiments to evaluate the superiority of HMODE/D. The results show that HMODE/D can solve the multi-objective optimisation problem very well.},

Due to the information fragmentation and semantic sparseness of product reviews, it is difficult to capture more comprehensive local information from unstructured texts, which leads to the incorrect extraction of some word pairs. Aimed at the problem, this paper proposes a framework for Attribute-Level Sentiment Element Extraction (ALSEE) towards product reviews. Firstly, a small amount of sample data is selected by random sampling, and multiple features (including part of speech, word distance, dependency relationship and semantic role) which are labelled. The labelled data are used as the training set. Then, the Condition Random Field (CRF) model is applied to extract opinion targets (OT) and opinion words (OW). The self-training strategy is used to achieve the semi-supervised learning of CRF model through iterative training. Finally, target-opinion word pairs with modifying relationship are obtained by dependency parsing. Compared with the existing methods, the proposed framework can effectively extract attribute-level sentiment elements though experimental results.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a new, improved COmmon Software Measurement International Consortium function point (COSMIC FP) method that uses Artificial Neural Network (ANN) architectures based on Taguchi’s Orthogonal Array to estimate software development effort. The minimum magnitude relative error (MRE) to evaluate these architectures considering the cost effect function, the type of data used in the training, testing, and validation of the proposed models, was used. Applying the fuzzification and clustering method to obtain seven different datasets, we would like to achieve excellent reliability and accuracy of the obtained results. Besides examining the influence of four input values, we aim to reduce the risks of potential errors, increase the coverage of a wide range of different projects and increase the efficiency and success of completing many various software projects. The main contributions of our work are as follows: the influence of four input values of the COSMIC FP method on the change of mean (MRE), development of two simple ANN architectures, the attainment of a small number of performed iterations in software effort estimation (less than 7), reduced software effort estimation time, the use of different values of the International Software Benchmarking Standards Group and other datasets used in the experiment.},

  abstract     = {The accuracy of state of charge estimation results will directly affect the performance of battery management system. Due to such, we focus in this article on the SOC estimation of Lithium-Ion batteries based on a fractional second-order RC model with free noninteger differentiation orders. For such an estimation, three Kalman filters are employed: the adaptive extended Kalman filter (AEKF), extended Kalman filter (EKF), and Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF). The Fractional-Order Model (FOM) parameters and differentiation orders are identified by the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm, and a pulsed-discharge test is implemented to verify the accuracy of parameter identification. The output voltage error of the FOM model is much less than that of the Integer-Order Model (IOM). The FOM model has lower root-mean square error (RMSE), the mean absolute error (MAE), and the maximum absolute error (MAXAE) of SOC estimation than the IOM model during the SOC estimation regardless of AEKF, EKF or UKF. Experimental results show that the FOM can simulate the polarisation on effect and charge–discharge characteristics of the battery more realistically, demonstrating that the SOC estimation based on FOM is more accurate and promising than the one based on the IOM when using the same Kalman filters.},

  abstract     = {Currently, the main challenges of the frameworks for healthcare monitoring are as follows: minimising latency, especially for delay-sensitive diseases such as sudden heart disease; identifying health situation in a timely and accurate manner when correlating physiological indicators and context information; reducing the risk of exposure because health data are highly private. In response to the above, this paper proposes a framework for 5G-secure-smart healthcare monitoring (5GSS) to achieve the following goals: fast and accurate identification of context-aware health situation, blockchain-based secure data sharing, and low-latency services for emergent patients. The framework consists of a data acquisition layer, a diagnosis and security layer (edge cloud), and a health service layer. The proposed framework adopts the following key technologies: a 5G-IPv6 communication network, context-aware health situation identification-based similarity measure, and blockchain-based secure data sharing mechanism. Finally, a prototype system has been implemented to monitor hypertensive heart disease, confirming its effectiveness with respect to a real scenario. Combined with the data of 45 patients, the prototype system can identify health situations with an accuracy of 96.34% at a sensitivity of 92.46% and a specificity of 93.62%, while significantly reducing the latency and improving the data sharing security.},

However, to quickly find a suitable one among a huge number of APIs to meet a developer’s requirement is basically a non-trivial issue. Therefore, a high-quality API recommendation system is desirable. Although a number of collaborative filtering methods have been proposed for API recommendation, their recommendation accuracy is limited and needs to be further improved. Based on the neural graph collaborative filtering technique, this paper proposes an API recommendation method that exploits the high-order connectivity between APIs and API users. To evaluate the proposed method, extensive experiments are conducted on a real API dataset and the results show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in API recommendation.},

  abstract     = {Massive regression and forecasting tasks are generally cost-sensitive regression learning problems with asymmetric costs between over-prediction and under-prediction. However, existing classic methods, such as clustering and feature selection, are subject to difficulties in dealing with small datasets. As one of the key challenges, it is difficult to statistically validate the importance of features using traditional algorithms (e.g. the Boruta algorithm) owing to insufficient available data. By leveraging the feature information intra-cluster (item group with similar attributes), we propose an intra-cluster product favoured (ICPF) feature selection algorithm to select the information based on the traditional filtering method (specifically the Boruta algorithm in our study). The experimental results show that the ICPF algorithm significantly reduces the number of dimensions of the selected feature set and improves the performance of cost-sensitive regression learning. The misprediction cost decreased by 33.5% (linear-linear cost function) and 32.4% (quadratic-quadratic cost function) after adopting the ICPF algorithm. In addition, the advantage of the ICPF algorithm is robust to other regression models, such as random forest and XGboost.},

  abstract     = {In cloud storage, public auditing is a more popular data integrity verification technique since it allows users to delegate auditing tasks to a fully trusted third-party auditor (TPA). However, it is difficult to find such a TPA in practical application. Besides, the centralised auditing model makes TPA have to bear burdensome work pressure, which limits the practicability of existing schemes. In this paper, we firstly proposed a blockchain-based generalised shared auditing mechanism BCSA in the cross-user scenario, which aims at achieving available public auditing with a non-fully trusted TPA, and reducing the user&#39;s auditing fees and TPA&#39;s work pressure by allowing data users to share their auditing procedure with others. Furthermore, we initialise a concrete construction BCSAD with Diffie–Hellman protocol for the cross-user auditing scenario with different data. Likewise, we also propose a novel construction BCSAI for the cross-user auditing scenario with identical data, which utilises a password-authenticated key exchange (PAKE) protocol to achieve shared auditing and ciphertext deduplication, reducing data storage and auditing fees for data users and alleviating service pressure on the cloud server and TPA. Security and performance analysis evaluate the practicability of the proposed scheme.},

  abstract     = {Process discovery usually analyses frequent behaviour in event logs to gain an intuitive understanding of processes. However, there are some effective infrequent behaviours that help to improve business processes in real life. Most existing studies either ignore them or treat them as harmful behaviours. To distinguish effective infrequent sequences from noisy activities, this paper proposes an algorithm to analyse the distribution states of activities and the strong transfer relationships between behaviours based on maximum probability paths. The algorithm divides episodic traces into two categories: harmful and useful episodes, namely noisy activities and effective sequences. First, using conditional probability entropy, the infrequent logs are pre-processed to remove individual noisy activities that are extremely irregularly distributed in the traces. Effective sequences are then extracted from the logs based on the state transfer information of the activities. The algorithm is based on a PM4Py implementation and is validated using synthetic and real logs. From the results, the algorithm not only preserves the key structure of the model and reduces noise activity, but also improves the quality of the model.},

Firstly, we crawl multiple data sources on the Internet and preprocess them respectively. These data involve stock historical data, technical indicators, and non-traditional data sources, such as stock posts and financial news. Then, we use the sentiment analysis method based on convolutional neural network for the non-traditional data, which can calculate the investors&#39; sentiment index. Finally, we combine sentiment index, technical indicators and stock historical transaction data as the feature set of stock price prediction and adopt the long short-term memory network for predicting the China Shanghai A-share market. The experiments show that the predicted stock closing price is closer to the true closing price than the single data source, and the mean absolute error can achieve 2.386835, which is better than traditional methods. We verified the effectiveness on the real data sets of five listed companies.},

  abstract     = {Automatic text summarisation (ATS) (therein two main approaches–abstractive summarisation and extractive summarisation are involved) is an automatic procedure for extracting critical information from the text using a specific algorithm or method. Due to the scarcity of corpus, abstractive summarisation achieves poor performance for low-resource language ATS tasks. That’s why it is common for researchers to apply extractive summarisation to low-resource language instead of using abstractive summarisation. As an emerging branch of extraction-based summarisation, methods based on feature analysis quantitate the significance of information by calculating utility scores of each sentence in the article. In this study, we propose a simple but effective extractive method based on the Light Gradient Boosting Machine regression model for Indonesian documents. Four features are extracted, namely PositionScore , TitleScore , the semantic representation similarity between the sentence and the title of document, the semantic representation similarity between the sentence and sentence’s cluster center. We define a formula for calculating the sentence score as the objective function of the linear regression. Considering the characteristics of Indonesian, we use Indonesian lemmatisation technology to improve the calculation of sentence score. The results show that our method is more applicable.},
