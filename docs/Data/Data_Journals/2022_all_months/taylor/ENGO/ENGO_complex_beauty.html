  abstract     = {This is a study on the development of a novel multi-material topology optimization scheme considering temperature-dependent thermoelastic properties for engineering structure design. Two cases, a three-point-bending beam under a uniform temperature field and a cantilever beam under a non-uniform temperature field, are investigated for the effects of thermoelastic properties on topology optimization. The proposed optimization scheme is compared with two existing topology optimization approaches: conventional topology optimization and thermoelastic topology optimization. The results show that the temperature-dependent elastic modulus dominantly influences the design optimization outcomes, in terms of material distribution, structural shape and compliance, while the temperature-dependent thermal expansion coefficient has a much more crucial impact on determining the material distribution and structural geometry than on compliance. Taken together, the findings demonstrate that the developed topology optimization scheme can be used to design thermally sensitive multi-materials in industrial applications, e.g. aerospace structures under high temperature and polymers in additive manufacturing.},

The concepts of oppositional learning and chaos are introduced into the SCA to strengthen its optimization performance. The effectiveness of the proposed model is tested by solving four cases (generation cost, spinning reserve based generation cost, emission and combined cost–emission) using OL-CSCA. The novelty of DTWEED is shown by comparing the results of different cases with the traditional DEED model. Comparison of the results of OL-CSCA for different cases of DEED and DTWEED with the results of SCA and other algorithms demonstrated its robustness and proficiency.},

Several results are obtained: (1) as long as the spillover effect is lower than a threshold, both channel members will participate in the promotion campaign; (2) a higher spillover effect improves the NB manufacturer’s profit by not only enhancing her revenue but also reducing her advertising cost; and (3) a larger quality difference also increases the NB manufacturer’s profit, by growing her revenue more quickly than her advertising cost.},

The linear density filter and Heaviside projection are employed to prevent the mesh dependency and chequerboard pattern and ensure distinct solid/void interfaces in the optimization result. The geometric extraction is easily implemented using the least square fitting with B-spline method. Through illustrative examples, the importance of considering the burst speed constraint in the design of turbine disc is verified, which contributes towards obtaining a safer design at the preliminary design stage. The effectiveness of the proposed method in obtaining a lighter preliminary twin-web turbine disc design is also demonstrated compared with the parametric optimization method.},

This study suggests an improved optimization framework. Blade optimization is performed in two stages: the ply lay-up pattern of the spar cap in the initial blade configuration based on the existing configuration, followed by the cross-sectional design optimization at several spanwise locations. The genetic algorithm is adopted and, in terms of the structural integrity evaluation, the final configuration results are found to be safe; in addition, the number of plies in the spar cap rapidly decreases through the two-stage design optimization procedure. As a result, the blade is lighter, and the lighter blade also reduces the applied load on the wind turbine. This will have an excellent effect that leads to a reduction in the weight of the entire turbine system.},

The problem is converted into a selective vehicle routing problem with soft time windows (SVRPSTW) and formulated as a mixed integer linear programming model.

Swarm-based metaheuristics, such as the whale optimization algorithm (WOA), have gained a notable reputation for solving optimization problems. The unique bubble-net hunting behaviour and fast convergence of the algorithm led to the development of a hybrid multi-objective whale optimization algorithm-based differential evolution (M-WODE) technique to solve the VM scheduling problem. The differential evolution (DE) strategy is used to replace the randomly generated solution produced by the WOA to ensure diversity in the solution and to strengthen the local search of the M-WODE. In addition, the DE technique is applied to the Pareto front produced by the WOA to escape local optima entrapment problems. The experimental results showed that the proposed M-WODE outperformed previous algorithms in most cases on makespan and the cost trade-off.},

In the proposed optimization algorithm, the Mazars model is coupled with finite element analysis for modelling structural responses subjected to material damage. Through a series of numerical examples, the proposed algorithm is validated and the effects of material damage on optimal results are investigated.

The model considers both the choice between different process alternatives and the selection of production resources for the various tasks. It also allows parallelization of stations in the balanced line, thereby improving the flexibility of the algorithm. The objective of optimization is to minimize the total cost of the planned line. A genetic algorithm is used for solving the model. To evaluate its functionality, the approach was applied to 486 well-known reference problems. In addition, the reference problems were expanded to create a new set of reference problems that serve as a benchmark for the algorithm’s new capabilities. The results show that the presented algorithm is feasible for solving the formulated assembly line balancing problem.},

To minimize the sum of construction costs and operating costs of dedicated cold-chain terminals, a stochastic programming model is established considering uncertainty of the type and time of arrival of refrigerated vessels and special requirements for cargo handling and storage, and the simulation optimization method based on tabu search is used to determine the optimal scale of cold-chain terminals.

First, a single-layer multimodal importance sampling (MMIS) method based on the most probable points (MPPs) in the fuzzy failure region is proposed. Secondly, to reduce function calls, an adaptive method fusing kriging model and MMIS is developed. In this method, a surrogate fuzzy failure region (SFFR) based on the kriging prediction information is defined. The MPPs in the SFFR are explored, the important samples are generated, the optimal training point is chosen, and the kriging model and the SFFR are updated. The learning process is executed iteratively until the SFFR converges to the true one. To find all MPPs and maintain unbiasedness, an intelligent multimodal optimization method based on multi-objective optimization is introduced. Four case studies are used to verify the advantages of the proposed method.},

Given that these problems are NP hard and cannot be solved in polynomial time, exact and metaheuristic methods are proposed for different problem sizes. For small-scale instances, optimal schedules are achieved using an effective branch-and-bound algorithm, in which elaborately designed lower bound and branching rules significantly improve computational efficiency.

The UC problem is solved considering the load profiles, and the impact of COVID-19 on power plant scheduling is evaluated. The simulation results show an increase in residential demand for electricity at weekends, while both residential and commercial demand are reduced during weekdays.

The objective is to minimize the sum of the maximal costs arising from the common due-window among the jobs in each group. This problem is proved to be polynomially solvable. Next, the problem is extended to the case that includes resource allocation.

Research on infill sampling with few points, high convergence speed and simplicity has received increasing attention in recent years. In this article, an EGO method with multi-point infill sampling based on kriging (MISK) is proposed. This method obtains multiple sampling points in each iteration by solving a multi-objective problem (MOP). This method can intelligently select points that balance global exploration and local exploitation. In addition, two sampling functions are proposed to construct the MOP. The results show that compared with other well-known global optimization methods, the MISK algorithm can obtain good optimization solutions in a shorter amount of time and that it requires fewer computing resources with extremely few parameters, which may meet the needs of real-world engineering optimization problems.},

Non-uniform rational B-spline (NURBS) is employed to parameterize the free-form geometric shapes of shells. Optimization is conducted for minimizing the shell volume subject to constraints of specified maximum displacement.

Thus, in this research, we present a new synthetic minority oversampling method based on instance density to enhance the performance of imbalanced classification problems. For this, two dimensional reduction techniques, i.e., principal component analysis (PCA) and factor analysis of mixed data (FAMD), are used to map the instances and k-nearest neighbor (kNN) method is used to classify minority class instances into four distinct types. Finally, through the comprehensive experiments on several imbalance datasets with different combination of subcategories, it is shown that the proposed method outperform the traditional oversampling methods.},

Although GAs are widely used in combinatorial optimization, their applications to non-cooperative, simultaneous games have been limited owing to challenges in guiding the evolutionary search to Nash equilibria, which are not necessarily on the Pareto front of the search space and cannot be found by current multi-objective GAs.

  abstract     = {This research aims to establish a nonlinear complementarity model and method for multi-commodity supply chain network equilibrium problems consisting of manufacturers and retailers in which the demands associated with the retail outlets are random. This work is different from previous research in that it focuses on a condition in which a manufacturer cannot sell all of its products. Based on this, the optimizing behaviour of the various decision-makers is modelled, the equilibrium conditions of the manufacturers and the retailers are derived, respectively, and nonlinear complementarity model of this problem is established. Qualitative properties of the equilibrium pattern in terms of existence, boundedness and global uniqueness are provided under milder conditions. Neither strict complementarity nor global Lipschitz continuity are required, and non-singular assumption is replaced by local error bound. A modified smoothing Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm to solve this model is proposed, and its global convergence and quadratic convergence rate are established, respectively. Finally, the model is illustrated through several numerical examples for which equilibrium prices and product shipments are computed under a variety of scenarios. Numerical results indicate the validity of the model, the availability of the algorithm, as well as the variation characteristics of equilibrium price and product shipment pattern.},

  abstract     = {With the increasing attention on environmental issues, green scheduling in manufacturing industries has become a hot research topic. As a typical scheduling problem, the flexible job-shop scheduling problem (FJSP) has received increasing attention, but research on the FJSP considering set-up and transportation times simultaneously is still rare. To address the energy-efficient FJSP with sequence-dependent set-up and transportation times to minimize makespan and total energy consumption, a multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming model of the problem is formulated and an effective novel heuristic method (NHM) is proposed. To enhance the convergence and distribution of the NHM, three strategies—population initialization, greedy iterative decoding and local intensification—are designed. The performance of the NHM is demonstrated by comparison with three algorithms through 48 instances. The results show that the NHM can obtain a scheduling scheme with lower makespan and total energy consumption than those of the comparison algorithms.},

However, instead of lumping the constraints in the physical domain, the method condenses the information of the time-dependent constraints into one equivalent function while retaining information about the point-wise constraints. The formulation is gradient compatible and allows a considerable reduction of the optimization problem. Two versions of the Kreisselmeier–Steinhauser function are studied. The formulation is tested on the size optimization of truss and framed three-dimensional structures subjected to dynamic loads. The methodology is tested in very-large transient response optimization problems in order to check its efficiency. Results show that the formulation is able guarantee the fulfilment of the constraints in the whole time interval studied. The size of the transient response optimization problem is highly reduced, allowing a reduction of the computational resources needed.},

The disassembly line balancing problem (DLBP) is the process of allocating a set of disassembly tasks to an ordered sequence of workstations. A novel mathematical model is presented for the DLBP by considering resource and labour constraints. Utilizing a transformed AND/OR graph as the main input ensures the feasibility of the precedence relationships among the tasks. The objective is to minimize the number of labourers used under the predetermined cycle time. This study proposes a three-phase heuristic adaptive genetic algorithm (AGA) to optimize the number of labourers in the disassembly line. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method is superior to the existing approaches for medium- and large-scale DLBPs.},

The OSSPR has many applications in automotive and maintenance actives. To solve the problem, a mixed-integer linear programming model is presented and a new constraint programming model is proposed. Since the problem under study is NP-hard, a new efficient variable neighbourhood search is proposed using variable search strategies through the proposed constraint programming model.

  abstract     = {The throughput of a belt conveyor system is the primary design parameter when considering a new installation, determined by the cross-section of the material on the belt, coupled with the belt speed. Optimizing this area not only improves efficiency, but also minimizes capital costs through the optimal selection of equipment. Whilst speed-related optimization has seen considerable attention, the cross-sectional area has largely been neglected due to existing design constraints of the system. Conventional belt conveyors typically utilize a 3-idler troughing configuration, which forms a trapezoidal cross-section with a parabolic surcharge. The rigidity of this support directly limits the geometry of the cross-section that may be considered. A new conveyor system developed at the University of Newcastle supports the conveyor belt by a rail-based carriage, with no relative movement between the belt and carriage. This configuration allows the cross-section of the belt to be freely optimized in order to maximize the material throughput for a given belt width, or alternatively to minimize the belt width for a given throughput. This article utilizes the calculus of variations to optimize the form of this cross section, and demonstrates that an increase in throughput of up to 30% is possible, compared to troughed installations.},

The problem formulation for hydrothermal systems is highly complex owing to its nonlinear nature. Hydrothermal scheduling is considered with two decision variables simultaneously: thermal states and water discharge. These two variables are instrumental in determining the optimal hourly schedule of power generation in hydrothermal power plants. The optimum solution is obtained using the backtracking search algorithm (BSA) with two primary operations, namely, mutation and crossover. The BSA is an optimization technique free from high-sensitivity control parameters, because it has only one control parameter for finding the optimal solution. It also has powerful exploration and exploitation capabilities. The simulation results corroborate that BSA is highly efficient compared to existing optimization techniques ( e.g. oppositional real coded chemical reaction-based optimization, differential evolution) in terms of overall efficiency and the quality of the solutions.},

Automatic design of practicable portions of the mines called pushbacks is a desirable tool for the mining industry. This article proposes a new approach based on an integer linear programming model (ILP) determining the volumes to be extracted to maximize profit while respecting geospatial and design constraints. Design constraints require that the minimum width be respected at the bottom of the mine and between successive pushbacks. The ILP is applied to three case studies to show that the model can generate practical solutions in minutes.},

To account for the development goal ‘climate action’ stated by the United Nations, it is mandatory, within the conceptual design phase, to derive energy-efficient system designs. One barrier is the uncertainty of the driving behaviour within the usage phase. This uncertainty is often addressed by using a stochastic synthesis process to derive representative driving cycles and by using cycle-based optimization. To deal with this uncertainty, a new approach based on a stochastic optimization program is presented. This leads to an optimization model that is solved with an exact solver. It is compared to a system design approach based on driving cycles and a genetic algorithm solver. Both approaches are applied to find efficient electric powertrains with fixed-speed and multi-speed transmissions. Hence, the similarities, differences and respective advantages of each optimization procedure are discussed.},

Local search algorithms could be a good solution to this issue. These algorithms usually focus the search on limited solution areas by applying local updates on an incumbent solution. To investigate the feasibility and performance of applying a local search algorithm to resource allocation, a special case of the Generalized Assignment Problem (GAP) is modelled, where task profits are independent of the resources assigned and resources&#39; capacities are identical. Then the performance of a local search algorithm to the target problems is examined empirically, characterizing the features of the GAP that make the problem hard for heuristics.},

  abstract     = {Multi-objective integer or mixed-integer programming problems typically have disconnected feasible domains, making the task of constructing an approximation of the Pareto front challenging. The present article shows that certain algorithms that were originally devised for continuous problems can be successfully adapted to approximate the Pareto front for integer, and mixed-integer, multi-objective problems. Relationships amongst various scalarization techniques are established to motivate the choice of a particular scalarization in these algorithms. The proposed algorithms are tested by means of two-, three- and four-objective integer and mixed-integer problems, and comparisons are made. In particular, a new four-objective algorithm is used to solve a rocket injector design problem with a discrete variable, which is a challenging mixed-integer programming problem.},

Manipulation of the impeller blade angle profile affects both shaft power and efficiency without affecting the head at the best efficiency point, corresponding to a mass flow rate of 1.75 kg/s.

Current RBMDO methods, however, perform design optimization either in a sequential manner or in an all-at-once manner, which does not support design autonomy in various disciplines and has low computational efficiency. In this article, a reliability-based multidisciplinary concurrent design optimization (RBMCDO) method is proposed to solve the problems of lack of design autonomy and low computational efficiency in current RBMDO methods. In RBMCDO, the multidisciplinary reliability constraints are first transformed into deterministic constraints using the multidisciplinary probabilistic constraint transformation method, developed in this work based on the performance measure approach and Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions. The RBMDO problem is then decomposed into several optimization problems of a single discipline, which are solved in parallel based on the collaborative optimization strategy. Two examples are used to verify the proposed method.},

Within this method, an inaccurate search strategy is adopted to optimize the surrogate models, thereby helping to locate the exploitation point. An elite archive is exploited to store superior sampling points for batch sampling, while a customized batch size determination strategy is introduced. The proposed SBO method with its adaptive parallel sampling strategy is tested on six unconstrained and five constrained analytical cases with the optimization results compared to state-of-the-art optimization algorithms. The optimization of a 582-bar tower truss system is also performed and utilized to verify the proposed SBO method.

First, the numerical model of the reducer housing is established by ABAQUS and verified by experiments. A radial basis function (RBF) neural network model is used to construct the approximate finite element model. The structural parameters of the RBF are optimized using the heuristic global optimization ability of the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. Sequential quadratic programming (SQP) and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA II) are used to perform the MORBDO. Finally, the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution, a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method, is used to select the ideal design in multi-objective Pareto points. The optimization method generated a set of Pareto non-dominated solutions with three objectives, which can be selected for a more feasible scheme using MCDM. The proposed method comprehensively measures the requirements of manufacturing and performance criteria, and the optimization results provide a variety of optimization design schemes for the reducer housing of electric vehicles.},

  abstract     = {In the injection moulding process, a set-up containing positioning moulds, a cleaning raw material hopper and machine settings is required. The set-up is uncertain owing to random factors, such as the crew’s skill levels and unexpected breakdowns. The general version of this problem is known as the single-machine scheduling problem with stochastic sequence-dependent set-up times. In this specialized form of the problem, the objective function is defined so as to minimize the total expected cost, which includes set-up, tardiness and earliness costs. Moreover, the effect of the client-dependent tardiness cost on the optimal machine schedule under uncertainty is explored. As a solution approach, a two-stage stochastic programming method is used. For the solution of large-size problems, the harmony search algorithm is proposed, and its performance is compared with the exact solution approach. Finally, the value of the stochastic solution is assessed by comparing the results with the deterministic approach.},

To incentivize users to relocate some of the excess bikes from stations with surplus bikes to bike deficient stations, a mixed rebalancing strategy is proposed. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming model. A hybrid genetic algorithm is developed to solve the proposed problem. Computational experiments are performed to illustrate the properties of the problem.

Recommendations to construct an efficient D -optimal design in a constrained design domain using design of experiments theory are provided. Computational fluid dynamics simulations are carried out to provide measurements of the response. The iteratively reweighted least squares method is used in the fit of the regression models to improve the efficiency of RSM with no additional cost. Enhanced coolant film properties for the optimal design show that the optimization problem was properly solved and the inner liner design was successfully optimized.

A novel design approach which assesses the Fuzzy-Fractional Order PID (FFOPID) controller parameters using bio inspired Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) is presented. The WOA is employed to manipulate the parameters of FFOPID controller and its efficacy is investigated using a comparative study against the performance of FOPID, FFOPID and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) technique tuned FFOPID (PSO-FFOPID) controllers over a single bump and a random road. The ACHD model is also analyzed under different speed levels which discloses performance adaptability of the proposed WOA-FFOPID controller. The Frequency Weighted Root Mean Square and Vibration dose value as per ISO 2631-1 standards are calculated and the results thus acquired are compared comprehensively and are analyzed which confirms that the WOA-FFOPID centered AHCD model provides the best ride comfort by reducing the driver body vibration in vertical motion.},

The NGH coring tool design problem is decomposed into three subsystems through the proposed A-ATC approach; namely, the core tube subsystem, ball valve mechanics subsystem and hydraulic subsystem. Moreover, a parameterized lower confidence bounding (PLCB) scheme-based adaptive metamodel is introduced into A-ATC to replace the analysis module to alleviate the intensive computational burden. Optimization results of the NGH tool are compared with those of kriging-based ATC. The effectiveness of PLCB is investigated through comparisons with other commonly used infill strategies.

To fill this research gap, this study presents an improved similarity coefficient method for designing machine groups in the first stage. Subsequently, a modified part assignment strategy is proposed for forming cells to achieve a higher compatibility with the improved similarity coefficient method.

Optimization results were presented through a Pareto solution set which was then used as a reference by the control architecture for optimal trajectory selection in the transmission control unit.

This research presents a holistic multi-phase decision-support framework to solve the sustainable supplier selection and order allocation problem for the multi-echelon supply chain. The framework comprises a multi-objective mixed-integer nonlinear programming mathematical model augmented with fuzzy multi-criteria decision making techniques and forecast demand. The various economic, environmental and social objectives were optimized for a multi-modal transportation network of a multi-echelon supply chain. The results of the mathematical model highlighted the impact of multi-modal transportation on the total cost and total travel time. The results also demonstrated the relationship between the multi-modal transport network and the environmental impact of the supply chain. The proposed multi-phase holistic decision support framework can be used in the comprehensive sustainability-based analysis of supply chains.},

These two objectives are: the longitudinal natural frequency of the horn should be similar to the frequency of the driven transducer–booster, and the output face of the horn should vibrate uniformly. The weighted sum method is used to calculate the two-objective sensitivity number. Based on the proposed algorithm, three horns (bar, cylindrical and U-shaped bar) are designed. For these horns, optimum designs are obtained, the amplitude uniformities of which are improved by 67%, 19.5% and 584.5%, respectively, compared with the initial models. Also, the resonance frequencies of the bar and U-shaped bar horns are 0.25%, and 0.75% less than the target frequency and the resonance frequency of the cylindrical horn is 0.2% higher than the target frequency. To verify the results of the proposed algorithm, a well-designed bar horn is fabricated and tested. In the experimental results, the resonance frequency and uniformity of the horn are, respectively, 0.4% higher and 0.97% lower than the simulation results.},

In addition to being theoretically difficult to solve (it is NP-hard), it can be in practice difficult to solve because of its conflicting knapsack and demand constraints. Since there are significant large-scale applications of the MDMKP, approximate solution approaches are commonly used to solve these problems. However, using 1620 MDMKPs discussed in the literature, this article demonstrates which types of large MDMKPs can be solved efficiently by operations research practitioners using general purpose integer programming software on a standard personal computer within 0.1% of optimum. Statistical analyses are used to determine which problem parameters significantly impact solution time. Finally, based on these 1620 MDMKP instances, a classification tree is generated. This tree can be used to guide practitioners in solving MDMKPs that arise in business and industry.},

To avoid the discontinuous derivative and improve the optimization efficiency, a non-zero gradient-based material interpolation scheme with penalization is constructed. The cost of die-set materials can be controlled effectively by the maximum size of components. Several topology designs based on minimized compliance confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method.

The CRITIC method, which reflects the contrast intensity and conflicting character of objectives, is applied to determine the weight coefficients of objectives. The conceptual design of a vehicle shock tower is taken as a numerical example. Comparison of the original design and the optimized conceptual design indicates that the stiffness and frequency performance of the shock tower clearly improve as the total weight reduces. Meanwhile, comparison of the weight coefficients and corresponding optimization results produced by the subjective method, CRITIC method, grey comprehensive relational analysis and entropy weight method proves that the CRITIC method is feasible and superior in structural multi-objective topology optimization.},

The whole algorithm of the proposed method can be divided into two stages. First, the kriging model is constructed to estimate the component augmented failure probabilities and obtain quasi-optimal IS samples. Secondly, the constructed kriging model is further refined based on these quasi-optimal IS samples to estimate the correction factor.

Additionally, a weighted mean best position in the IG-QPSO is employed to achieve a good balance between local search and global search.

Next, on the basis of a deep reinforcement learning algorithm, a neural network structure suitable for contour error compensation is established, through which the optimal gain parameters are obtained. Finally, some experiments are carried out, in which the optimal gain parameters sought through off-line learning schemes are applied to the biaxial motion control.

Thus, a bus garage system with reasonable distribution and size is required to address these problems. In this article, a queuing–location–allocation model for optimizing a bus garage system is developed. Since a nonlinear objective function is involved, a linearization technique is introduced to convert the proposed model into an equivalent linear form. Next, a Lagrangian relaxation algorithm is designed to solve the linear form model. To validate the proposed algorithm, two groups of randomly generated test instances and a real-life case, the Dalian transit system in China, are applied.

  abstract     = {The Bi-Level Optimization Problem (BLOP) is defined as a mathematical program with two nested optimization tasks. Although many applications fit the bi-level framework, however, existing resolution methods were most proposed to solve single-objective bi-level problems. Regarding Multi-objective BLOPs (MBLOPs), there do not exist too many previous studies because of the difficulties associated with solving these complex problems. Additionally, a recently proposed metaheuristic, called Non-dominated sorting Chemical Reaction Optimization (NCRO), has been successfully applied to solve single-level Multi-Objective Problems (MOPs). NCRO applies a quick-non-dominated sorting technique that makes it one of the most powerful search algorithms in solving MOPs. Based on these observations, a new Bi-level Multi-objective CRO method, called BMCRO, is proposed in this article for solving MBLOPs. The main idea behind BMCRO is to come up with good solutions in an acceptable execution time within the bi-level framework. Experimental results on well-established benchmarks reveal the outperformance of the proposed algorithm against a bi-level variant of the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) which is developed for this purpose.},

For acoustic wave cloaking, many scientific devices utilizing phase differences have been developed. Considering the irregular surfaces of objects to be concealed, acoustic wave reflections become complex with random phase differences and determinations of the involved geometric parameters of cloaking structures become impractical. To determine the geometric parameters of acoustic cloaking devices with DSHS systematically, the present study applies a structural optimization scheme. The present scheme computes and minimizes the differences between the acoustic pressures reflected from irregular surfaces and the reference acoustic pressures without irregular surfaces by optimizing the location and geometric parameters of the DSHS. To show the validity of the present scheme, structural optimization problems are solved for several three-dimensional problems with complex and irregular surfaces.},

This strategy is used offline to determine these parameters and then the control system uses them in the online MPPT. The strategy uses two nested particle swarm optimization (NESTPSO) search loops: the inner one involves the PV system and the outer one uses the inner PSO as a fitness function. The control parameters and swarm size of the inner PSO loop are used as optimization variables in the outer PSO loop. This strategy can be used not only for PSO but also for all other optimization techniques. The simulation and experimental results obtained using the NESTPSO strategy show a great reduction of 77–681% in convergence time and failure rate compared to 10 benchmark strategies, proving the superiority of this technique.},

Suppose that several products of different kinds are ordered to be produced. Each product consists of several specific parts. The components (parts) of products are manufactured in a flexible job shop, then assembled into products in parallel lines or parallel stations. The objective function is to minimize the total completion time of products (makespan). First, the problem is described and the parameters and decision variables are defined. Then, the problem is modelled as a mixed-integer linear programming model to solve the problem using GAMS software. Owing to the NP-hardness of the problem, two new algorithms are proposed to solve it for medium- and large-sized instances. These algorithms are based on variable neighbourhood search (VNS), with self-adaptive parallel VNS being applied in one of them. The considered problem is decomposed into two subproblems and each algorithm is used on two levels. These algorithms are applied to solve test problems of different sizes. The results show that the two-level algorithms perform better than the integrated one and the algorithm with self-adaptive parallel VNS outperforms the other algorithms in terms of solution quality.},

Secondly, the linear migration model is replaced with the sinusoidal migration model and a modified product insertion method is performed in the migration phase. Then, in the mutation phase, a job insertion method is used to adjust the processing order of jobs in each product. A local search method based on SDST is combined to jump out of local optima. Finally, simulation experiments based on 540 test instances and comparisons with seven existing algorithms as well as one simple biogeography-based optimization algorithm verify the superiority of NBBO.},

Two different solution procedures are presented based on the Decision-Maker&#39;s (DM&#39;s) preference structure. First, when the DM provides his/her preference structure as goals, a solution methodology is proposed using goal programming and its different multi-choice variants. In the second case, when no preference is provided by the DM, a two-step approach is presented that iteratively solves a multi-choice cost-minimizing assignment problem to obtain all Pareto-optimal time–cost pairs and finally, based on the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to the Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), a single efficient pair is obtained. The algorithm is successfully implemented using the CPLEX ® optimization package and tested on various test problems.},

The dimension-reducing subspace is updated as the trust region moves through the function domain, allowing OMoRF to be applied to functions with no known global low-dimensional structure. Furthermore, its low computational requirement allows it to make rapid progress when optimizing high-dimensional functions. Its performance is examined on a set of test problems of moderate to high dimension and a high-dimensional design optimization problem. The results show that OMoRF compares favourably with other common derivative-free optimization methods, even for functions in which no underlying global low-dimensional structure is known.},

However, the damping ratio generally attains its maximum value when the applied surface is fully covered with the damping material. In this study, a method is proposed of topology optimization in the thickness direction using viscoelastic and constrained materials based on CLD in order to obtain a higher damping ratio. A mathematical formulation is proposed of the material interpolation functions of the store elastic modulus, loss elastic modulus, Poisson&#39;s ratio and density. As a result of the optimization using a cantilever beam, the damping ratio obtained in the optimal layout is 1.44 times higher than that in conventional CLD. The higher damping in the optimal layout can be attributed to compression of the viscoelastic material by the slits, and a decrease in the flexural rigidity caused by the taper and the longitudinally extending part of the slits.},

Through an interval discretization strategy, estimation of probability density functions (PDFs) in existing methods is transformed to estimation of the marginal probability of the input, the marginal probability of the output and the joint probability of the inputs–output in NSLS, which avoids the computational complexity and error resulting from PDF estimation in MIGS analysis. To drastically reduce the computational cost of NSLS to estimate the MIGS index, an NSLS-based adaptive kriging (NSLS-AK) method is subsequently developed. In NSLS-AK, a rough global kriging model is first constructed, then this kriging model is adaptively updated until the convergent condition is satisfied for accurately and efficiently predicting the responses of the samples in estimating the MIGS index.},

The goal is to minimize the sum of the given scheduling objectives, including the makespan, the total completion time, the total absolute differences in completion times and the total absolute differences in waiting times of the accepted jobs and total rejection penalty of the rejected jobs. It is illustrated that these problems remain polynomially solvable under the proposed models.

During the identification process, both the inherent and extrinsic uncertainties existing in the aerofoil system are considered.

The proposed model and procedure were verified by the topological results based on the finite element method. The multi-objective EFG optimal topological structures have clearer boundary profiles even without using the sensitivity filtering technique. The effects of the weight coefficient, thermal conductivity factor, Poisson&#39;s ratio factor, off-angle and volume fraction on the multi-objective EFG optimal topological structure and multi-objective function were evaluated in detail, and reasonable ranges of the above parameters were recommended to improve the heat dissipation and mechanical performance. The multi-objective optimal results of the anisotropic structure were 3D printed and compared with the isotropic material, and their temperature, displacement and stress were improved, which reflects the advantages of orthotropic structures.},

  abstract     = {In order to find the optimal product platform in a product family, a system sensitivity analysis-based parallel method for optimization of product platform (SSAPM) is proposed. The key idea of this method is to decompose the product platform optimization problem with a system-level optimization problem and several independent subsystem-level optimization problems by introducing coordination variables. The system-level optimization obtains the sensitivity information on the objective function about the coordination variables by calling the subsystem-level optimization, and adjusts the coordination variables according to the sensitivity information. Under product constraints and performance constraints, the subsystem optimizes each product so that the design variables of each product are as close as possible to the coordination variables. With the continuous iteration between the system and the subsystems, the coordination variables that can maximize the generality of the product family are finally found. The numerical test results show that SSAPM has strong optimization ability.},

In DEDMP, at each generation, the whole population is divided into several subpopulations by the clustering partition and the size of the subpopulation is dynamically adjusted based on the last search experience. Furthermore, DEDMP is adaptive based on two search strategies, one with strong exploration ability and the other with strong exploitation ability. The selection probability of each search strategy is also dynamically adjusted according to the success rate. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm adopts newly designed mutation and crossover operators and it can directly generate feasible solutions in the search space. To evaluate the performance of DEDMP, DEDMP is compared with some state-of-the-art algorithms on benchmark instances. The experimental results show that DEDMP is better than or at least competitive with other outstanding algorithms.},

The diversity here lies in providing every component in a subsystem with its own failure rate as a decision variable in addition to determining the corresponding reliability of each component. Consequently, compared to the state-of-the-art results in the literature, not only can the system reliability be improved, but the combination of multiple configurations also enables relevant required resources to be saved.},

A combination of EPA-SWMM with a new developed multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA), called non-dominated sorting enhanced differential evolution (NSEDE), was used to optimize the size of flood walls, cross-structures and detention ponds, with the objective of minimizing the rehabilitation costs and runoff surcharge. NSEDE exhibited better performance in terms of convergence and solution diversity compared to three well-known MOEAs. Comparison of the model outputs with the rehabilitation plan of Tehran municipality demonstrated the superiority of the optimum designs. At the same level of cost and flooding with respect to the Tehran municipality plan, the optimum designs reduced the cost of rehabilitation by 61.7% and network flooding by 37.5%.},

However, PSO usually suffers from slow convergence. In this article, a reinforcement learning strategy is developed to enhance PSO in convergence by replacing the uniformly distributed random number in the updating function with a random number generated from a selected normal distribution. In the proposed method, the mean and standard deviation of the normal distribution are estimated from the current state of each individual through a policy net. The historic behaviour of the swarm group is used to update the policy net and guide the selection of parameters of the normal distribution. The proposed method is integrated into the original PSO and a state-of-the-art PSO, called the self-adaptive dynamic multi-swarm PSO (sDMS-PSO), and tested with numerical functions and engineering problems. The test results show that the convergence rate of PSO methods can be improved with the proposed reinforcement learning strategy.},

Kriging interpolation is used to produce three surrogate models that correspond to the three maximum von Mises stresses using the results of the simulation experiments in the uniform design. To allow three maximum von Mises stresses be reduced simultaneously, grey relational analysis, entropy weighting analysis and a genetic algorithm are used to resolve this multi-objective optimization problem. Compared with the original design, the optimal design induces 5.07, 17.31 and 10.54% improvements for ASTM C297, C364 and C365 testing simulations, respectively.

However, uncertainties are present in most engineering applications such as turbomachines, and their influence on performance should be assessed. In this work, some advanced optimization techniques are applied to the blade optimization of a European Research Community on Flow, Turbulence and Combustion (ERCOFTAC)-like pump, and the robustness of the optimal profiles through an uncertainty quantification study is assessed. Two primary sources of uncertainty are considered: (i) equipment uncertainties, primarily the rotational speed of the pump shaft that also affects the flow rate; and (ii) uncertainties in the inlet turbulence quantities in CFD simulations.},

To this end, a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model is proposed for time- and cost-oriented assembly line balancing problems with sequence-dependent set-up times between tasks. The problem is computationally intractable; therefore, a Benders’ decomposition algorithm is developed to solve it. The proposed decomposition yields a master problem that addresses the issue of assigning assembly tasks to workstations, as well as a set of subproblems that deal with sequencing tasks within each workstation owing to sequence-dependent set-up times. The algorithm is tested on a set of randomly generated test problems and numerically compared with a MILP formulation of the problem solved using a commercial optimizer. The computational results demonstrate that the proposed Benders’ decomposition approach outperforms the MILP model. The contribution of this article lies in the new models proposed and the decomposition-based exact algorithm developed.},

  abstract     = {Robust design optimization (RDO) of large-scale engineering systems is computationally intensive and requires significant CPU time. Considerable computational effort is still required within conventional meta-model assisted RDO frameworks. The primary objective of this article is to minimize further the computational requirements of meta-model assisted RDO by developing a global two-layered approximation based RDO technique. The meta-model in the inner layer approximates the response quantity and the meta-model in the outer layer approximates the response statistics computed from the response meta-model. This approach eliminates both model building and Monte Carlo simulation from the optimization cycle, and requires considerably fewer actual response evaluations than a single-layered approximation. To demonstrate the approach, two recently developed compressive sensing enabled globally refined Kriging models have been utilized. The proposed framework is applied to one test example and two real-life applications to illustrate clearly its potential to yield robust optimal solutions with minimal computational cost.},

This study aims to find an optimum impact-free path length for a mobile robot with a multi-objective optimization approach. The multi-objective optimization problem is formulated by using path length and a safety aspect as the two objectives. A hybrid population-based optimization algorithm, i.e. the hybrid particle swarm and chemical reaction optimization (HPCRO) algorithm, has been used to obtain a smooth path for the robot in an unknown environment with circular and/or polygonal obstacles. The results of the HPCRO algorithm are then compared with those of genetic algorithms, chemical reaction optimization and particle swarm optimization. Some statistical tests are performed to illustrate the superiority and potential applicability of the hybrid algorithm. The results of the hybrid algorithm are encouraging in terms of cost function value and computational cost.},

These complicated problems probably contain mixed-variables, while most research has focused on continuous variables. This article sets up a mixed-variable surrogate-based optimization algorithm framework that includes a mixed-variable experiment design method and an inaccurate infilling method. The mixed-variable experiment design method combines improved successive local enumeration with enhanced stochastic evolution to deal directly with discrete variables. The inaccurate infilling method tends to find points with better fitness value and relatively low sample density so as to balance exploration and exploitation. Several numerical functions and a mixed-variable solid rocket motor performance matching design problem are solved using the modified surrogate-based optimization method. The results indicate that the proposed method is competitive compared with other heuristic algorithms and surrogate-based algorithms, and can deal with mixed-variable aircraft design problems effectively.},

The design objective is to suppress the PSLL while maximizing the main-beam gain with the constraint of null depth. To save the computational costs and avoid the re-mesh, the improved MoM is presented to solve the radiation problem of anti-interference array, which can accurately give the radiation field and precisely predict the null position. The sensitivity and MMA based solving procedures of the optimization problem are presented. Typical examples are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that, through collaboratively optimizing the rotation angles and excitation phases, the PSLL of anti-interference array with desired nulls is effectively suppressed.},

The extended finite element method (XFEM) is employed to decouple the analysis mesh, material description and nodal design variables. By the advantage of XFEM at modelling material discontinuity, detailed geometrical features are generated on a coarse analysis mesh. To obtain a clear interface between material grids, a variation of the traditional sensitivity filter is introduced to produce discrete solutions. The low computational costs make the proposed approach appropriate for dealing with problems requiring a high number of finite element analysis (FEA) processes, typically high-resolution/large-scale models, stress minimization, etc. Accurate von Mises stress is calculated on a high number of Gaussian points, making the approach perform better at stress minimization. Then, several 2D and 3D examples optimized by different solvers are illustrated to demonstrate the effectiveness and excellent generality of the proposed approach.},
