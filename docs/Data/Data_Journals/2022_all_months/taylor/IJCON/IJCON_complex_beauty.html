  abstract     = {In this paper, a new distributed optimal control strategy for continuous-time nonaffine nonlinear systems with unknown dynamics is presented. We exploit a paradigm based on an Extended Adaptive Dynamic Programming (EADP), which will be fully stated in the paper, to provide a distributed optimal control strategy in the presence of subsystem interactions. A proper design of optimal control law is further fully investigated through the framework of Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB). The proposed EADP algorithm can now be employed in order to solve iteratively the HJB equation associated with each subsystem. The proposed distributed optimal control system mainly consisting of three weighted basis functions for each subsystem is fully developed to handle the issue associated with the availability of unknown dynamics. The convergence analysis of the proposed algorithms is also established. Finally, two numerical examples are given to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.},

Next, these results are used to stabilise multiple oscillators system of arbitrary length with bounded control based on a special canonical form. Explicit conditions are provided to guarantee the stability of the closed-loop system. Compared with the existing results, the proposed controllers contain the so-called state-dependent saturation functions and thus can improve the control performance significantly.

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the problem of hybrid control for a class of switched uncertain systems. The switched system under consideration is subject to structured uncertain dynamics in a linear fractional transformation (LFT) form and time-varying input delays. A novel hybrid controller is proposed, which consists of three major components: the integral quadratic constraint (IQC) dynamics, the continuous dynamics, and the jump dynamics. The IQC dynamics are developed by leveraging methodologies from robust control theory and are utilised to address the effects of time-varying input delays. The continuous dynamics are structured by feeding back not only measurement outputs but also some system&#39;s internal signals. The jump dynamics enforce a jump (update/reset) at every switching time instant for the states of both IQC dynamics and continuous dynamics. Based on this, robust stability of the overall hybrid closed-loop system is established under the average dwell time framework with multiple Lyapunov functions. Moreover, the associated control synthesis conditions are fully characterised as linear matrix inequalities, which can be solved efficiently. An application example on regulation of a nonlinear switched electronic circuit system has been used to demonstrate effectiveness and usefulness of the proposed approach.},

Recursive sliding-modes and nonlinear gain functions are applied for performance improvement of traditional dynamic surface control approaches. Also, an adaptive parameter is introduced for neural networks&#39; weights, and it is for simplification of computational complexity in our control strategy. In theory, it is proven that all signals in the multi-agent system are ultimately bounded, that consensus tracking errors converge to a neighbourhood around the origin, and that there exists Zeno-free behaviour.

The use of Frobenius norm and the inclusion of the input matrix in the LMIs perturbation matrix allows decreasing the conservativeness to select vertices which are combinable, with respect to a previous approach based on Gershgorin circles. A combinability metric that can be applied to an arbitrary partition of the set of vertices is defined. Then, a recursive algorithm finds a lesser-fragmented combinable partition at each iteration by combining together two elements of a partition. The algorithm aims at finding combinable partitions with minimal cardinality in fewer attempts, always preserving the original control performance specifications. The proposed method is validated using numerical examples, a twin rotor MIMO system and a two-link robotic manipulator.},

Interconnection and damping assignment passivity-based control (IDA-PBC) is one of such methods in which the solution to corresponding PDEs which are called matching equations is needed to apply it in practice. In this paper, these matching equations are transformed to corresponding Pfaffian differential equations. Furthermore, it is shown that upon satisfaction of the integrability condition, the solution to the corresponding third-order Pfaffian differential equation may be obtained quite easily. The method is applied to the PDEs of IDA-PBC in some benchmark systems such as Magnetic levitation system, Pendubot, and underactuated cable-driven robot to verify its applicability.},

The latter is any rate-independent hysteresis operator, that is characterised by closed limit cycles when excited by periodic input signals called ‘loading-unloading’ (or ‘increasing-decreasing’). Designing appropriate ‘loading-unloading’ periodic inputs will prove to be crucial in the proposed identification method. By using such signals, the intermediary linear subsystem is made transparent and the hysteresis front block is equivalent to two static nonlinearities (i.e. the lateral borders of the limit cycle). Then, the input and output signals turn out to be related by two composed functions. A decomposition algorithm is then resorted to extract the back nonlinearity and both lateral borders of the front hysteresis operator. Finally, the impulse response of the intermediary linear subsystem is determined using a least-squares like estimator. The quality of the estimated model is checked using a theoretical analysis and simulation results.},

By variational analysis and direct decoupling methods, the social optimal control problem is analysed, and two equivalent auxiliary robust optimal control problems are obtained for a representative agent. By solving the auxiliary problem with consistent mean field approximations, a set of decentralised strategies is designed, and its asymptotic social optimality is further proved. Next, the results are applied into the study of opinion dynamics in social networks. The evolution of opinions is analysed over finite and infinite horizons, respectively. All opinions are shown to reach agreement with the average opinion in a probabilistic sense. Finally, local interactions among multiple sub-populations are examined via graphon theory.},

  abstract     = {This paper is devoted to moment exponential stability of a class of Markovian switching diffusions with Lévy noise. Our objective is to find verifiable conditions for moment exponential stability and instability. By employing the ireducibility of the Markovian switching process and the Fredholm alternative, we derive explicit criteria for moment exponential stability and instability for linear and general nonlinear systems. Explicit contribution of the Markovian switching to the stability and instability is revealed. Using the criteria developed, we can design feedback controls or perturbations to stabilise a given diffusion with Markovian switching and Lévy noise. Several examples are provided to demonstrate our findings.},

By incorporating a barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) into the dynamic surface technique, we develop a coordinate-free integral sliding mode controller which cannot only deal with the state constraint but also enforce the tracking error converge into a vicinity of the origin. To save the computation and communication resources, a modified integral sliding mode-based robust event-triggered controller is proposed, in which the control torque generation and the information transmission of attitude and control signal only need to be implemented at some discrete time when the predefined measurement error exceeds a constant threshold. Furthermore, a lower bound estimation on the inter-execution intervals is also given to show that Zeno behaviour can be avoided. Finally, numerical simulations are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed controller.},

The objective is to minimise the global objective function, which is the sum of local private objective functions, by exchanging and computing local information among each agent or with its neighbourhoods. To avoid continuous communication among agents and reducing communication overheads, we propose an event-triggered distributed optimisation algorithm based on a proportional-integral control strategy. We first show that the developed algorithm does not exhibit Zeno behaviour. Then, it is shown that the proposed algorithm exponentially converges to an exact global minimiser under the restricted secant inequality condition. This condition admits a more general class of the global objective function since it does not require the convexity of the global objective function and the global minimisers are not required to be unique. Theoretical results are illustrated by numerical simulations.},

In other words, by equipping Olfati-Saber&#39;s algorithms with more weighting factors, the steady-state formation behaviours in a concerned multi-agent system can be manoeuvered while collision-free flocking is induced. More specifically, we create novel collective potential functions with the topological specification matrices/vectors to evaluate multi-agent dynamics and achieve the expected steady-state features in terms of graph connectivity, distance keeping, position-pattern-related subgrouping and obstacle avoidance. Moreover, formation convergence can be improved by integral specification of position difference. Numerical simulations well demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.},

The systems are described as strict-feedback cyber-physical systems, in which the communication between the control centre and the physical system is subjected to disturbances. The disturbances, such as information packet losing or transmission medium saturation, cause state variables to be unavailable or distorted, which results in incomplete measurements. To solve these problems, two state estimators are designed for different transmission cases, based on which two backstepping control approaches are adopted. The stability conditions of the state estimators and closed-loop system are derived. It is proved that the control methods can guarantee that all the signals of the closed-loop system are uniformly ultimately bounded in mean square.

Due to complex downhole environments and underactuated, nonlinear, and nonsmooth features of the drilling dynamics, control synthesis of the drilling system is a challenging task. In this study, we propose a novel nonlinear control design for set-point tracking of the torsional velocity and axial rate of penetration, for a vertical drilling system with coupled axial and torsional dynamics and a velocity-independent bit-rock interaction model constrained by a delay differential equation. To eliminate damaging oscillations such as stick-slip, the Barrier Lyapunov Function approach is introduced to ensure smooth motion of the drill bit and to avoid having drilling operate in undesired working conditions. Meanwhile, the stability, boundedness and convergence properties with respect to system states are proved, and validated by a series of simulation results.},

To address the problem of fault detection of helicopters in the presence of sensor, actuator, and component faults, the algorithm uses a bank of particle filters running in parallel. The filter monitors the system states and identifies the occurrence of faults. Using the monitored system states, a log-likelihood ratio-based hypothesis testing is performed to detect and isolate faults in the system. Comparing log-likelihood ratio with threshold generated from deviation function of normal model induces the fault decision signal. The algorithm is applied to a 2 Degrees of Freedom helicopter system which is a highly complex, non-linear, and unstable system. The results are presented for sensor, actuator, and component faults represented as additive and multiplicative models. The results show the effectiveness of the algorithm compared with residual generation methods used in fault diagnosis.},

First, by constructing two identical asymptotic convergence functional observers, a new PTFUIO is developed which can achieve an exact estimation within an arbitrarily prescribed time, where both the estimation accuracy and the convergence time pre-definition are independent of the initial conditions of the original system. Also, the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of such the PTFUIO are given in terms of the original system matrices which are easy to examine. Finally, numerical simulations are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {For a class of manipulators without velocity measurements in random surroundings, the global output feedback trajectory tracking control problem is researched in this paper. The main challenge is how to deal with the highly coupled terms with unmeasurable velocity and the random noises. Under some reasonable assumptions and some properties of the system, a novel nonlinear observer is skilfully constructed to estimate the velocity. Based on the designed observer, an adjustable global tracking controller is designed such that trajectory tracking error can be made small enough and the state of closed-loop system has an asymptotic gain in the first moment. The trajectory tracking problem of a two-degree-of-freedom manipulator in a random working environment is analysed to verify the reasonability of the assumptions and to demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the control strategy.},

Firstly, by constructing a proper set, a necessary and sufficient condition is presented for the asymptotically stable PBN being stable in distribution after function perturbation. Secondly, by removing the case of changing to finite-time stability with probability one from the case of changing to stability in distribution, some criteria are given for the asymptotically stable PBN keeping asymptotically stable after function perturbation. These criteria need to calculate the number of positive-probability cycles. In order to simplify the calculation, two sufficient conditions are further established. Finally, as an application, the robustness of asymptotical feedback stabilisers is further studied for probabilistic Boolean control networks subject to function perturbation.},

The method leverages differential flatness property of linearised systems, online estimation and compensation of disturbances by active disturbance rejection control. The differentially flat output is derived directly from measured data with unknown dynamics and parameters by the flat output identification algorithm. A reduced nominal model of UMS is proposed to simplify the process of finding flat output and trajectory planning. Technique of sparse regression is applied to identify relationships between flat output and system states, which reduce the order of the well-known extended state observer (ESO) and thereby make the ESO more effective for trajectory planning and tracking in terms of the flat output. The proposed control is validated by experimental studies of a rotary crane system in which a rest-to-rest tracking control is implemented.},

The main contribution of the paper is to derive linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) conditions for the ℋ ∞ H ∞ H∞ -SDF problem for LPV systems, taking into account the GS controller. For the good behaviour of the controller, we assume that the time-varying parameters are available for online measurement. In some cases, the H ∞ -GS-SDF controller obtained high control signals, and as we intend to apply the proposed method in practical situations, we introduce the concept of D -stability in the problem approach. Examples and a practical implementation show that the proposed conditions achieved good results in reducing the disturbance effect in the system. Furthermore, with the proposed methods, it is possible to guarantee the asymptotic stability and guaranteed cost H ∞ minimisation.},

Three types of uncertainties are taken into account, including dynamic uncertainty, unknown control coefficients, and nonlinear parameterisation. Different from the existing works, the input-to-state stability (ISS) with unknown supply rates is used to characterise the system of dynamic uncertainty, and the magnitudes of the control coefficients are not required to be known a priori. The nonlinear parameterisation is well treated with the aid of a parameter separation technique. By constructing a switching control strategy, we propose a discontinuous adaptive stabilising control scheme via output feedback to overcome the serious uncertainties in the chained-form non-holonomic systems.

The solution, referred to as the Decoupled Reference Governor (DRG), maintains the highly-attractive computational features of Scalar Reference Governors (SRG) while having performance comparable to Vector Reference Governors (VRG). DRG is based on decoupling the input–output dynamics of the system, followed by the deployment of a bank of SRGs for each decoupled channel. We present two formulations of DRG: DRG-tf, which is based on system decoupling using transfer functions, and DRG-ss, which is built on state feedback decoupling. A detailed set-theoretic analysis of DRG, which highlights its main characteristics, is presented. We also show a quantitative comparison between DRG and the VRG to illustrate the computational advantages of DRG. The robustness of this approach to disturbances and uncertainties is also investigated.},

Necessary and sufficient conditions of CSO and ISO for modular DESs are derived under the assumption that all synchronous events are observable by each component of modular DESs. Moreover, we prove that the initial state estimator of modular system is isomorphic to the synchronous composition of initial state estimators for individual components. These results offer us the opportunity to reduce the complexity in verifying the opacity of modular DESs.},

Traditional torque control consists of maintaining some relevant signals close to certain set-points generated by a map representing the static inverse model of the engine, without any consideration for the optimality of the responses. The proposed model-based control strategy does not make use of any static map and all signals of interests are regulated at the same time by a unique centralised multivariable controller. A Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) H ∞ optimal control design problem, formulated via Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) feasibility conditions, is solved to generate the controller, whose main objectives are the reduction of fuel consumption while maintaining good torque tracking. The resulting regulator presents is gain-scheduled and is designed to be calibratable in real-time. Some numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented approach.},

Moreover, a relaxed Lyapunov Function (LF) method is used to investigate FTISS. Compared with the traditional LF method, the main advantage is that the constructed LF is permitted to own indefinite-derivative. As a special case of FTISS, a corollary on Finite-Time Stability (FTS) is established, which is applicable to investigate the realisation of FTS for nonlinear system via impulsive control strategy.

  abstract     = {We study networks with linear dynamics where the presence of symmetries of the pair ( A , B ) ( A , B ) (A,B) , induces a partition of the network nodes in clusters and the matrix A is not restricted to be in Laplacian form. For these networks, an invariant group consensus subspace can be defined, in which the nodes in the same cluster evolve along the same trajectory in time. We prove that the network dynamics is uncontrollable in directions orthogonal to this subspace. Under the assumption that the dynamics parallel to this subspace is controllable, we design optimal controllers that drive the group consensus dynamics towards a desired state. Then, we consider the problem of selecting additional control inputs that stabilise the group consensus subspace and obtain bounds on the minimum number of additional inputs and driver nodes needed to this end. Altogether, our results indicate that it is possible to independently design the control actions along and transverse to the group consensus subspace.},

  abstract     = {The paper is devoted to the optimisation of parabolic differential inclusions (DFIs) in a bounded rectangular region. For this, a problem with a parabolic discrete inclusion is defined, which is the main inevitable auxiliary problem. With the help of locally adjoint mappings, necessary and sufficient conditions for the optimality of parabolic discrete inclusions are proved. Then, using the method of discretization of parabolic DFIs and the already obtained optimality conditions for discrete inclusions, the necessary and sufficient conditions for the discrete-approximate problem are formulated in the form of the Euler–Lagrange type inclusion. Thus, using a specially proved equivalence theorem, we establish sufficient optimality conditions for a parabolic DFI. To demonstrate the above approach, some linear problems and polyhedral optimisation with inclusions of parabolic type are investigated. In addition, numerical results are also presented.},

Firstly, discrete delays and distributed delays are allowed in the input and output as well as states of the considered system. Secondly, compared to the conventional research contributions of state feedback regulation, not only the condition that the output signal is needed to design the control strategy become relaxed, but also the information about the discrete delays and distributed delays that need to be known is less. Finally, different from the existing research results, based on the time-varying gain technology and Lyapunov–Razumikhin theorem, the output feedback global regulation controller constructed here is more lucid in structure and more perfect in function. Two examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of global regulation about the proposed approach for the considered system.},

We show that the new stability measure for distributed systems is smooth with respect to the system parameters, and robust in the sense that it provides a trade-off between the decay rate of the solution and the H 2 norm of the system. Next, we reformulate the stabilisation problem as an unconstrained minimisation problem considering the smoothed spectral abscissa as the objective function,  and show that its properties enable solving the stabilisation problem by using standard gradient-based optimisation techniques. We show the potential of the proposed approach by using it for the stabilisation of a fleet of vehicles, and an oscillator with a class of time-varying delays in the input.},

Recently, the concept of flat inputs has been proved to be a valuable tool for control design if the system is non-differentially flat. However, flat inputs have not been used yet to solve state estimation problems for these systems. By constructing flat inputs, we introduced a novel state estimation-based control strategy for both observable non-differentially flat nonlinear systems and differentially flat nonlinear systems whose flat output vector is not a measurable variable, as long as the internal dynamics of the system are stable. The efficiency of the proposed approach is illustrated through two numerical examples. Our findings indicated that we increased the class of systems to which the derivative-free nonlinear Kalman filtering based on differential flatness theory can be applied.},

The method is based on approximate dynamic programming, and is closely related to approximate policy iteration. Existing methods typically terminate based on the convergence of the control policy and either require a discounted problem formulation or demand the cost function to lie in a specific subclass of functions. The presented method extends on existing termination criteria by requiring both the control policy and the resulting system state to converge, allowing for use with undiscounted cost functions that are bounded and continuous.

Then, a unified barrier function (UBF) is constructed to address the asymmetric full state dynamic constraints. Next, both of command-filtered backstepping control technique and dynamic event triggering mechanism are adopted to design the control scheme in the asymmetric full state dynamic constraints case. The proposed control scheme could guarantee that all signals of the closed-loop systems are semi-globally ultimately uniformly bounded (SGUUB), the tracking errors converge to the bounded compact set and the full states dynamic constraints are not violated.

Compared with existing results, the novelties of the obained results lie in that: (i) A class of Lyapunov–Krasovskii functionals with inde nite derivative is constructed for switched nonlinear time-delay systems, (ii) Average dwell time switching laws are designed for the fixed-time and finite-time stability of the systems, and (iii) The presented approach has potential applications in fixed-time and finite-time stability of other hybrid systems. The efficacy of the obtained results is illustrated by academic examples.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the finite-time stability of nonautonomous systems is studied by using Lyapunov Krasovskii method and Gronwall inequality. Firstly, a new lemma for the finite-time stability for nonautonomous systems is given by using Gronwall inequality. which make the derivative of Lyapunov function not to be negative all the time. Then, based on the new lemma and Lyapunov Krasovskii method, some finite-time stability criteria about nonautonomous linear systems and nonlinear systems are proposed. Based on this, by designing controllers, the finite-time stabilizable theorem is obtained. In addition, it is pointed out that the conclusion of this paper is more general than the existing literature in the remarks. Finally, several examples are simulated with MATLAB to verify the effectiveness of the results.},

Unlike existing event-triggered frameworks based on signal transmission channels from the sensor to the controller or from the controller to the actuator, these developed trigger mechanisms only compare the difference between the signal to be transmitted and the holding signal. By introducing internal trigger conditions and external trigger conditions, a novel error-to-actuator based event-triggered framework is proposed. It further considers the response of the trigger mechanism to system control performance such that the tracking performance of the system can be guaranteed while reducing the number of signal transmissions. In addition, filter-based techniques (such as the dynamic surface control method), for the first time, are utilised to eliminate some strong constraints that exist in the literature for most high-order nonlinear systems. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated on simulation examples including comparative studies and a practical example.},

To be specific, a nonsingular distributed estimator algorithm is newly designed to respectively estimate the states of the targets in a finite time. Based on the extended state observer (ESO), we present a finite-time local control scheme to obtain satisfactory tracking performance of the NELSs. Besides, sufficient conditions for deriving the finite-time stability of the cascade closed-loop systems are presented based on the Lyapunov argument.

In this paper, we propose to analyse a generalised EM (GEM) algorithm in the context of Gaussian mixture models, where the maximisation step in the EM is replaced by an increasing step. We show that this GEM algorithm can be understood as a linear time-invariant (LTI) system with a feedback nonlinearity. Therefore, we explore some of its convergence properties by leveraging tools from robust control theory. Lastly, we explain how the proposed GEM can be designed and present a pedagogical example to understand the advantages of the proposed approach.},

First, after describing the system control problem, the ISM design problem is given. Then, two kinds of ISM are presented that have the ability to reject the mismatched uncertainty and disturbance. One is called Lyapunov-function integral sliding mode (LFISM) and the other is called assistant-Lyapunov-function integral sliding mode (ALFISM). The system state in the ideal sliding mode of the two ISM surfaces is proved to be robustly stable despite the existence of the mismatched uncertainty and disturbance. In the presented framework, a general case of single input nonlinear system was studied and verified by a simulation application to a one-link robotic manipulator. Additionally, applications to a unicycle using the ISM with the mismatched-disturbance minimisation (ISM-MDM) method, the high-order disturbance observer (HODO) technique, and the LFISM method were reported. The simulation results confirmed that the LFISM&#39;s rejection effect to the mismatched disturbance is better.},

Recent approaches in the literature apply a time transformation, however, which do not maintain recursive feasibility for a piecewise constant control parameterisation. The key idea in this paper is to introduce uniform grids with variable discretisation. A shrinking-horizon grid adaptation scheme ensures convergence to a specific region around the target state and recursive feasibility. The size of the region is configurable by design parameters. This facilitates the systematic dual-mode design for quasi-time-optimal control to restore asymptotic stability and establish a smooth stabilisation. Two nonlinear programme formulations with different sparsity patterns are introduced to realise and implement the underlying optimal control problem. For a class of numerical integration schemes, even nominal asymptotic stability and true time-optimality are achieved without dual-mode. A comparative analysis as well as experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.},

The control objective is to stabilise the relative pose configurations with velocity synchronisation of the rigid bodies which share their states according to a static undirected communication topology. The feedback control design is conducted on the dynamic level, and uses the rotation matrix as opposed to various attitude parameterisations. Almost global asymptotic stability of the consensus subspace is demonstrated both analytically using an extension of the Morse–Lyapunov (M–L) approach, and through numerical simulations.

  abstract     = {Finding feasible solutions to motion planning and control problem of robotic systems in different environments with various applications is an active area of research. This article presents a new solution to the motion planning and control problem of a three-dimensional articulated mobile manipulator comprising a car-like mobile platform and a three-dimensional n -link articulated arm using the Lyapunov-based control scheme. The motion of the system is described as twofold: first, the car-like mobile platform moves from an initial position to its pseudo-target, and second, when the mobile platform is within some predefined distance from the pseudo-target, the end-effector of the robot arm is attracted to its designated target. Therefore, presenting a new 2-Step Algorithm in this paper for dual movement of the articulated mobile manipulator in 3D. In addition, a workspace cluttered with fixed spherical and rod obstacles of random sizes and positions is considered in this research. For the mobile manipulator to avoid an obstacle, the Minimum Distance Technique is adapted where a point on the robot that is closest to an obstacle will avoid the obstacle. The convergence of the two bodies and the stability of the mechanical system are guaranteed by the Lyapunov&#39;s direct method. The continuous nonlinear control laws proposed from the control scheme also take into account all mechanical singularities and velocity limitations associated with the system. Theoretical proofs and computer simulations validate the new continuous, acceleration-based, nonlinear, time-invariant control laws.},

To handle with the design difficulty from non-affine structure of pure-feedback system, a continuous and positive control gain function is constructed to model the periodically disturbed non-affine function as a form that facilitates the control design. As a result, the non-affine function is not necessary to be differentiable with respect to control variables or input. In addition, the bounds of non-affine function are unknown functions, and some appropriate compact sets are introduced to investigate the bounds of non-affine function so as to cope with the difficulty from these unknown bounds. It is proven that the closed-loop control system is semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded by choosing the appropriate design parameters. Finally, comparative simulations are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.},

Compared with traditional continuous or discrete systems, this paper considers the dynamic equation on time scales. Heterogeneous systems composed of nonlinear and linear dynamic behaviour are put forward, and the dynamic behaviour of each agent is distinct from each other. Furthermore, we propose two asynchronous impulsive control schemes, which do not require the impulse to occur at the same time instant for each agent. Based on stability theorem and time scale theory, two criteria are put forward on time scales to solve leaderless and leader-following consensus. Especially, for the leader-following case, a pinning control strategy is introduced. The number of pinning impulsive nodes is different at disparate impulsive instants and the minimum proportion of pinned nodes can be derived. At last, two simulation results indicate the validity of theoretical analysis.},

Correspondingly, an event-triggered controller related to the communication delay is proposed to reduce update frequency of the controller effectively. Then, the feedback gain and triggering parameters are co-designed and solved through linear matrix inequality. Relational conclusions for bounded consensus in mean square are established for fixed and time-varying communication delays, respectively.

Open-loop Stackelberg equilibrium is considered. The follower first solve a stochastic optimal control problem with partial observation, the maximum principle and verification theorem are obtained. Then the leader turns to solve an optimal control problem for a conditional mean-field forward–backward stochastic differential equation, and both maximum principle and verification theorem are proved. A linear-quadratic Stackelberg stochastic differential game with asymmetric noisy observation is discussed to illustrate the theoretical results in this paper. With the aid of some new Riccati equations, the open-loop Stackelberg equilibrium admits its state estimate feedback representation.

In particular, necessary conditions for optimality for this stochastic optimal control problem are obtained. In spite of the fact that the method used here was used by several authors before, our adaptation is not immediate. It applies a trick which is used to get estimates for solutions of SPDE with Locally Monotone Coefficients as in the proof of the Lemmas 5.1 and 5.3. This adaptation permits us to apply our results to get a maximum principle for the optimal control to the cases when the system is governed by the 2D stochastic Navier-Stokes equation and by a stochastic Burgers&#39; equation.},

The sliding mode controller (SMC) relying on the linearised model, the PID controller, and the high order differential feedback controller (HODFC) not relying on the model are designed. The closed-loop system stability under both SMC and HODFC are analysed. The HODFC with a control filtering can actively reject the disturbance and uncertainty. The control performance of HODFC is superior to SMC and PID controllers. The SMC and HODFC can stabilise the chaotic oscillations of UAV helicopter’s angular velocity, whereas the PID controller fails, and the HODFC control effect is superior to the SMC for disturbance rejection, uncertainty and linearisation bias in steady-state errors.},

By augmenting the state space of the system with information on its visit time, the DeepRL agent is able to solve problems in which its task dynamically changes within the same episode. To address the scalability problems caused by the state space augmentation, we propose a procedure to partition the episode length to define separate sub-problems that are then solved by specialised DeepRL agents. Contrary to standard solutions, with the proposed approach the DeepRL agents correctly estimate the value function at each time-step and are hence able to solve time-varying tasks. Numerical simulations validate the approach in a classic RL environment.},

On the basis of this model, we propose a nonlinear control law based on energy considerations which is able to perform position control of the crane while damping the oscillations of the load.

In this paper, a robust neuro-adaptive sliding mode control (NASMC) is designed for the UCG process to maintain a desired heating value level. The unknown model parameters used in NASMC are estimated using the feed-forward neural network. Moreover, the controller also requires time derivatives of some model parameters, which are estimated by uniform robust exact differentiator. As the relative degree of the output with respect to the input is zero, therefore, to apply NASMC, the relative degree is increased to one. This approach maintains the desired heating value and provides insensitivity to input disturbance and model uncertainties. A comparison is also made between NASMC and an already designed conventional SMC. The simulation results show that NASMC exhibits better performance as compared to the conservative SMC design.},

First, an almost dissipativity of switched nonlinear systems is defined using multiple storage functions and multiple supply rates. This dissipativity property means that each active subsystem is dissipative except for a ball. And the energy of the inactive subsystem is seen as the transformation from the active subsystem. By weakening the conventional dissipativity, a more extensive class of open-loop systems and controllers can be obtained, leading to broader application. Second, the ultimate boundedness is achieved by almost dissipativity under some restrictive conditions on the energy changing of inactive subsystems. Third, the almost dissipativity conditions for these systems are given. Based on these conditions, two types of switching laws are obtained to achieve almost dissipativity. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by a practical example a mass-spring-damping system.},

Moreover, some ubiquitous constraints, such as unknown control directions and time-varying communication delays, are also comprehensively considered and effectively excluded so as to further enhance the control reliability. Meanwhile, some sufficient criteria on the algorithm synthesis and stability analysis without involving Zeno behaviour are successfully built with the aid of Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional.

A necessary and sufficient condition is proved under which a discrete-time control system is flat. The condition is based on a sequence of vector spaces of differential 1-forms. A more general definition of flatness is considered than in most cases, since the flat output is allowed to depend on the backward shifts of the states and inputs. Also, unlike most conditions that check flatness of a discrete-time system, the one proposed in the current paper does not require actually computing the flat output. Although, the flat output can be found from the vector spaces based on which the necessary and sufficient condition is presented. Algorithms are provided in order to compute all the necessary vector spaces. Two examples illustrate the results.},

First, the ASTDOs are designed to estimate the system disturbances in fixed time, and the adaptive method relaxes the assumption about the system disturbances, which is that the upper bound of the first and second derivatives of the disturbance is unknown. Then we present a backstepping control strategy via an improved distributed fast terminal sliding mode, which not only guarantees that the sliding mode surface of each step is independent of one another, but also makes the system states converge in fixed time. Furthermore, to avoid the ‘differential explosion’ problem and the singularity problem, the dynamics surface control method is constituted. Theoretical analysis shows that the closed-loop system is semi-globally uniformly ultimately fixed-time bounded. Finally, simulation results show the validity of the proposed control strategy.},

The main objective is to design LTI finite-dimensional static/dynamic stabilising centralised/decentralised output feedback controllers. For this, the decentralised pole assignment algorithm developed for decentralised stabilisation of finite-dimensional systems is extended to the time-delay case. In this approach, decentralised controllers are designed sequentially, where a centralised design approach is used in each step. As the centralised design approach, the eigenvalue optimisation-based stabilisation method is utilised. Regarding the nonconvexity of the optimisation problem, an initialisation procedure, which determines the minimum possible dimension of the stabilising controller and the initial controller parameters, is developed. As a particular case of dynamic output feedback, the decentralised proportional-integral control is also considered. The proposed controller design methods are verified through numerical and practical examples.},

  abstract     = {As it is well-known, system uncertainties and unmodeled dynamics can deteriorate stability properties of model reference adaptive control systems. Motivated by this standpoint, we first analyse stability conditions of model reference adaptive control architectures in the presence of unstructured system uncertainties and unmodeled dynamics. We then synthesise adaptive robustifying terms to relax the aforementioned stability condition, which presents our main contribution. Specifically, these terms in the feedback loop guarantee overall system stability even in the presence of significant system uncertainties when unmodeled dynamics satisfy a condition. We further demonstrate our theoretical findings in an experiment involving an inverted pendulum on a cart (modeled dynamics) coupled with another cart through a spring (unmodeled dynamics).},

  abstract     = {Contractive nonlinear systems possess numerous desirable properties, which have drawn considerable attention from the control community. The work proposes an extended HGO based output feedback strategy, which can assure contraction of a class of uncertain singularly perturbed (SP) systems. The analysis differs from the conventional Lyapunov approach in two aspects: the convergence bounds explicitly depend on the singular perturbation parameter (SPP); and the sufficient conditions for contraction do not require any interconnection conditions. Moreover, it is observed that the requirement of the smallness of SPP can be relaxed for certain classes of nonlinear systems. The derived bounds also reveal a particular trade-off between the contraction rates and condition numbers associated with the transformation metric. These bounds offer additional degree of freedom in tuning the closed loop performances apart from reducing the SPP. Multiple numerical simulations point to the veracity of the claims.},

Based on a general multiple discontinuous Lyapunov functions (MDLFs), stability conditions are acquired for switched nonlinear systems with unstable modes. Whereafter, the stability result is extended to the weighted -gain analysis for the system with external disturbance. Moreover, in light of the quadratic MDLFs, the stability and weighted -gain criteria are also presented for the liner systems under the obtained switching scheme. Due to the time subsequence technique, the proposed switching method is more convenient in practice. Particularly, under the switching scheme, the tighter bounds are provided for MDADT, and the MDADT on unstable modes is not restricted by upper bounds.

This framework leads to stable and robust real-time control such that a feasible output trajectory can be tracked. This is made possible by Hölder-continuous real-time stable learning schemes that act as discrete-time stable uncertainty observers. These observers learn from prior input-output history and ensure finite-time stable convergence of estimation errors to a bounded neighborhood of the zero vector if the system is Lipschitz-continuous with respect to time, outputs, inputs, internal parameters and states. In combination with nonlinearly stable controllers, this makes the proposed framework nonlinearly stable and robust to disturbances, model uncertainties, and unknown measurement noise. Nonlinear stability and robustness analyses of the observer and controller designs are carried out using discrete Lyapunov analysis. A numerical experiment on a second-order system demonstrates the performance of this nonlinear model-free control framework.},

In addition, L 2 performance under the constraint of actuator saturation is considered to develop a framework of a considerably complete problem.

  abstract     = {In this paper, the assignability of linear time-invariant (LTI) systems with respect to arbitrary control structures is addressed. It is well established that the closed-loop spectrum of an LTI system with an arbitrary control structure is confined to the set containing the fixed-modes of the system with respect to that control structure. However, the assignment of the closed-loop spectrum is not merely limited by the existence of fixed-modes in practical scenarios. The pole assignment may require excessive control effort or even become infeasible due to the presence of small perturbations in the system dynamics. To offer more insights in such more realistic scenarios, a continuous measure known as fixed-mode radius is developed. However, its evaluation is confronted with a highly non-convex optimization problem combined with the need for a combinatorial search. This study utilises properties of positive-definite cones and duality theory to formulate the assignability assessment as an optimization problem with linear matrix inequality (LMI) constraints. Based on the suggested formulation, three alternative methods are proposed to evaluate the distance to unassignability. The first two methods offer alternative non-iterative and convex programs. The third method proposes an iterative convex optimization while updating the binary variables based on the dual variables. All the proposed methods rely on convex optimization, do not involve gridding over the complex plane and circumvent the combinatorial nature of the problem by using properties of positive definite cones. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed methods in the assessment of fixed-mode radius with respect to arbitrary control structures.},

Identical subsystem models are a typical assumption made in networked control systems which often fail in practice. In this paper, we propose a systematic method for removing this assumption, leading to a general approach to distributed-control design for stabilising networks of multiple non-identical dynamic agents. Local subsystems represented as autonomous dynamic agents are assumed to share a set of structural properties, (controllability) indices. Our approach relies on the solution of certain model-matching type problems using local state-feedback and state/input-matrix transformations that map local dynamics to a target system, selected to minimise joint control effort. By adapting well-established distributed LQR control design methodologies to our framework, the stabilisation problem of networks of non-identical dynamic agents is solved. The applicability of our approach is illustrated via a synchronisation example of eleven harmonic oscillators with non-identical dynamics communicating over a connected graph.},

In order to make the design process more feasible, the coordinate transformation is introduced to generate a scaling gain. Then the linear observer is constructed and the sampled-data controller is obtained based on the estimated states. Under the upper-triangular linear growth assumption and Lyapunov method, the suitable parameters can be selected to make the system achieve globally stable. It can be proved that the proposed method can also be extended to the system with multiple time delays. Finally, the effectiveness of the designed controller is demonstrated by using numerical and practical examples.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider the structural controllability problems of a class of driftless discrete-time bilinear systems which have nearly the same structure as linear systems. Algebraic as well as graph-theoretic conditions for structural controllability of such systems with single-input and multi-input are, respectively, obtained. Furthermore, we introduce a new notion, called structural near controllability, for those structured systems which cannot be structurally controllable but structurally nearly-controllable. It is shown that the bilinear systems can be structurally nearly-controllable although their linear counterparts can never have a large controllable region no matter what the parameters are chosen. Necessary and sufficient conditions for structural near-controllability of the bilinear systems are thus derived. We also consider the structural controllability problem in the continuous-time case. Examples and graphs are given to illustrate the obtained results of this paper.},

However control coupling dynamics is still needed to obtain closed-form expression of optimal control effort. In addition to this, initial stabilizing controller and two sets of neural networks (NN) (known as Actor-Critic) are required to implement IRL scheme. In order to remedy these, this paper presents a critic-only IRL controller coupled with an experience replay (ER)-based identifier to solve optimal tracking control problem for an unknown continuous-time systems under actuator constraints.

Then, constructibility is also examined using the same approach. Moreover, the link between observability and constructibility concepts on arbitrary time sets is discussed. Further, the observability and reachability duality relationship for time-varying linear systems on time scales is established.

An LMI-based event-triggered controller is designed to guarantee the local asymptotic stability by introducing auxiliary feedback matrices to handle input saturation. In addition, the region of attraction is well estimated. Meanwhile, by synthesising the feedback control gains and the given event-triggering condition, an optimisation problem for maximising the region of attraction is formulated in LMIs. For input-saturated piecewise-affine systems with bounded disturbance, our control objective is to reduce the influence of disturbance while reducing communication in order to guarantee that the system is uniformly ultimately bounded.

An additional switching control action is proposed to counteract the bounded matching input of the leader. The proposed control ensures the asymptotic convergence of the consensus error for known matching bounded input at the leader without disturbances, and an H ∞ performance criterion from bounded disturbances to the consensus error has been provided. Contrary to the traditional consensus frameworks, our approach considers the nonlinear agents to resolve the bipartite consensus, L 2 disturbances for a robust distributed control, directed signed graphs, and bounded non-zero input at the leader for dealing with a realistic consensus scenario.

Furthermore, a self-triggered adaptive control scheme is presented to guarantee close-loop system signals are bounded.

In this work super-twisting sliding mode controllers (STSMCs) are designed for the control-oriented model of the DBS, which maintain a desired water level and pressure of the drum. The unknown state of the DBS required for the control design is estimated using a gain-scheduled Utkin observer (GSUO). A rigorous mathematical analysis is also included to show that the closed-loop system is locally stable. The simulation results show that the closed-loop system yields the required performance even in the presence of parametric uncertainty, process and measurement noises, and external disturbance. To make a fair comparison, a quantitative analysis is also carried out for STSMC and PI controllers. Both controllers consume similar control energy, but STSMC shows better tracking performance.},

A variable-pitch rotor quadcopter generates thrust in both vertical directions for the special design of the rotor’s actuation mechanism. This research proposes two possible solutions for the flip: a regulation solution based on the geometric control approach; and tracking a predefined optimal smooth trajectory covering a turnover. The first solution uses a geometric control approach that is immune to singular points since the rotation matrix is integrated on the manifold on SO ( 3 ) . The second solution proposes an optimal trajectory generation for flip maneuver using open-loop optimal control, two-point boundary value problem (TPBVP) approach. Since generated open-loop state information is not applicable without a controller, the state-dependent differential Riccati equation (SDDRE) is chosen for trajectory tracking.},

  abstract     = {We study a kind of time-inconsistent linear-quadratic non-zero sum stochastic differential game problems with random jumps. The time-inconsistency arises from the presence of a quadratic term of the expected state and a state-dependent term, as well as the time-dependent weight of each term in the cost functionals. We define the time-consistent Nash equilibrium point for this kind of problems and establish a general sufficient condition for it through a flow of forward-backward stochastic differential equations with random jumps. In the situation of one-dimensional state and deterministic coefficients, a Nash equilibrium point is given explicitly by some flows of Riccati-like and linear ordinary differential equations. We apply the truncation method to obtain the existence and uniqueness of solutions to them for a specific case. Moreover, an investment and consumption problem is solved and some numerical examples are further provided to illustrate the application of our theoretic results.},

A novel event-triggered control protocol with a dynamic compensator is proposed. By using Lyapunov theory, it is proved that the output tracking errors exponentially converge to zero under the event-triggered control protocol. At the same time, the states of all agents are not triggered synchronously, that is, whether each agent triggers or not only depends on its own state information. Moreover, with the unified frame work of the distributed event-triggered strategy, all the inter-event times are lower-bounded by a positive constant and the Zeno behaviour is excluded. Finally, some numerical simulation examples are given to illustrate the advantages of the proposed event-triggered consensus protocol.},

Although our result is local, we take into account the complete dynamics of the induction motor and the three-phase inverter-DC/DC Buck power electronic converter system. Despite the complexity of the problem, our proposal is based on several proportional-integral control loops. The key to achieve this result is a novel passivity-based approach that we call energy-based control having a number of advantages over previous passivity-based approaches in the literature. An important problem that is considered is that of an unbalanced three-phase voltage source. This condition appears during the transient periods in the inverter-DC/DC Buck power electronic converter system. This is important because the standard models of induction motors are obtained under the assumption of a balanced three-phase voltage source.},

The developed scheme achieves periodic reference tracking and improves the performance of periodic and aperiodic unknown disturbances rejection by incorporating the equivalent-input-disturbance (EID) estimator with the modified repetitive controller (MRC). Furthermore, a periodic event-triggered feedback observer (PETFO) is proposed to reduce the computational burden and energy consumption, and saving communication resources. The PETFO observes the occurrence of a predetermined event or not, where the current data are transmitted only when the event occurs otherwise, there is a zero-order hold keeps the data unchanged. The stability of the overall systems is guaranteed using the Lyapunov Krasovskii functional theory and linear matrix inequalities (LMIs).

For practical reasons, it is preferable to consider a non distributed control law to achieve the control objective. In contrast to our previous work that considers fully distributed control actions where the three control inputs are assumed to be distributed along the reactor, here the last two control inputs are applied at the reactor inlet and only the coolant temperature is distributed along the reactor.

First, a smooth function is employed to map the constrained input. Based on SMC theory, a fast adaptive SMC scheme is designed to reduce the effects of unknown input and approximate error which has two advantages. One is that the proposed scheme is independent of the uncertain information. The other is that the proposed scheme forces the states to converge with exponential rate as they are far away from the sliding mode surface, and the states move with linear rate when they are closed to the sliding mode surface. Then, a zero-sum differential games strategy-based adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) technique is employed to obtain the optimal performance of sliding mode dynamics system. The loop-system and estimation weight error can be proved stable by utilising Lyapunov theory. Finally, the missile autopilot system is used to indicate the effectiveness of the designed approach.},

Structural damage fault is apparently studied less than faults of actuator and sensor. Because of this reason, this study focuses on the structural damage fault. In order to solve the chattering which is the main problem of first-order/ traditional SMC, second-order controller is designed. The Lyapunov theorem is used for affirming the design and stability of the closed-loop system. Experimental results show that the control system with the proposed controller is easily implemented.

Considering such background, this paper introduces a new adaptive Kalman filter algorithm in order to handle the unknown process noise covariance for linear discrete-time closed-loop systems. From the closed-loop joint analysis of the system and the a priori recursive form of the Kalman filter, we adaptively estimate the process noise covariance by relating it to the observation vector covariance. The latter is then obtained from an exponential moving average technique. Lastly, we also extend our adaptive methodology for a special class of nonlinear systems. The performance of the proposed adaptive method is demonstrated through numerical examples and it has been compared to other types of adaptive filtering algorithms.},

To achieve the objective, the gain adaptation law is enhanced with a sliding mode disturbance observer. The new control scheme ensures the sliding variable follows the defined segment-like trajectory during the reaching phase, thereby reducing the necessary control signal amplitude by avoiding the overestimation of the control gains. This novel approach allows a reduction of the design constraints on the system actuators while guaranteeing an exact desired convergence time under unknown bounded perturbations. The disturbance observer tuning methodology is also addressed in function of the expected perturbation signal type. To support the proposition, numerical simulations are performed to illustrate the fixed-time disturbance rejection capacities of the closed-loop system subject to constant, periodic, or stochastic perturbations on a tutorial example. Finally, the proposed controller is applied to drive the velocities of an unmanned surface vehicle model under realistic perturbations.},

The agent is initially located inside the robot&#39;s detection region, and it wants to escape from it as soon as possible. The DDR, on the other hand, wants to delay the escape as much as possible. The pursuer&#39;s detection region is modelled as a circle centred at the pursuer&#39;s current location. In this work, the time-optimal motion strategies for the players are presented. Also, based on the players&#39; initial configurations, we solve the decision problem of determining the winner of the game.},

An output to state description theorem is proposed, by which, an adaptive output feedback FTC with a function equation constraint is designed for the LTI system in consideration. A controller reconfiguration algorithm is proposed to solve the constraint and construct an approximate controller that can compensate effectively the fault effect on systems. Furthermore, in certain conditions, the output feedback control gains can be determined by the state feedback control gains. A linear longitudinal dynamics of an aircraft and a linearised dynamic model of a vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) aircraft in the vertical plane are applied to illustrate the effectiveness and merits of the proposed method.},

However, for such models, model selection is a hard task if no prior physical knowledge is given. In this paper, we propose a non-parametric approach to infer a continuous-time linear model from data, by automatically selecting a proper structure of the transfer function and guaranteeing to preserve the system stability properties. By means of benchmark simulation examples, the proposed approach is shown to outperform state-of-the-art continuous-time methods, also in the critical case when short sequences of canonical input signals, like impulses or steps, are used for model learning.},

The ``explosion of complexity&quot; phenomenon is avoided by introducing first-order filters in traditional backstepping control, and filter errors are handled with compensating signals. All adaptive laws are accumulated to the last step by using tuning functions. The whole control design method is divided into two parts. One is to design adaptive tracking control for dynamic leaders. The other is to design adaptive containment control for followers. Through the proposed control method, the closed-loop system is stable, and all followers can converge to the convex hull built by the leaders.

The control strategy is critical for the performance of nonlinear four-leg inverter system owing to the problems of coupling, disturbances of nonlinear/unbalanced loads, variable operating condition, etc. In view of the above problems, a nonlinear composite controller is proposed for four-leg inverter system under d q 0 d q 0 dq0 reference frame by integrating a higher-order sliding mode observer (HOSMO) and finite-time feedback control technique. The HOSMO can observe the uncertainties and disturbances by means of the soft sensing manner for feedforward compensation, which economises some sensors for their states being inconvenient to measure. In addition, it is a novel way for the HOSMO to realise the decoupling of the inverter system under d q 0 frame. The finite-time feedback controller works in coordination with the HOSMO which provides more rapid convergence rate and further improves anti-disturbance capacity of the system. Finally, the simulation results with PI comparison illustrate the feasibility of the proposed method for stabilizing system.},

Using the strict Lyapunov function approach of Malisoff and Mazenc [(2009). Constructions of strict Lyapunov functions .

Adaptive control technique and sliding mode control theory are applied to design the guidance law. More specifically, the designed adaptive law can ensure sliding mode manifold fast reach a predefined region and weaken the chattering phenomenon without the upper bounds of target maneuvers. Furthermore, the line-of-sight angle tracking errors and the line-of-sight angular rates can achieve finite-time convergence via the designed nonsingular fast terminal sliding mode controller. Therefore, the accurate interception of the missile against maneuvering targets can be achieved via the proposed guidance law.

The control criterion is selected to be invariant, leading to covariant control equations that take advantage of the system dynamics. Motion equations are associated with conjugate control equations resulting in a system of second order ordinary differential equations. The suggested control method consists in solving this system of equations to obtain optimal joint forces off-line and use them as inputs in a control scheme to track optimal trajectories. Position-velocity feedback ensures proper behaviour. Motion control simulations show that the optimal trajectory can be tracked with good accuracy, even with imposed perturbations. A stability analysis for switched systems precedes real-time motion control experiments conducted on a serial robot manipulator with revolute joints to validate our method.},

Formulations and numerical simulations prove the effectiveness of the newly proposed attack detection procedure. Unlike previous approaches that the trade-off between attack detection delay or LQG the performance was significant, in this approach it is proved that the difference in this trade-off is not considered in early moments when the attack happens since the attack detection rate is rapid and thus, the attacks can be stopped with defense strategies in the first moments with the proposed attack detection criterion.},

  abstract     = {Stability of nonlinear delay evolution equation with stochastic perturbations is considered. It is shown that if the level of stochastic perturbations fades on the infinity then an exponentially stable deterministic system remains to be exponentially stable (in mean square). This idea has already been checked for ordinary linear stochastic differential equations and linear stochastic difference equations. Here a similar statement is proven for a nonlinear stochastic evolution equation with quickly enough fading stochastic perturbations. More exactly: if the level of the stochastic perturbation is given by a continuous and square integrable function, then the zero solution of the considered exponentially stable deterministic system remains exponentially mean square stable independently on the maximum magnitude of the stochastic perturbations. Applications of the obtained results to stochastic reaction-diffusion equations and stochastic 2D Navier-Stokes model are shown. Consideration of other types of fading stochastic perturbations (for instance, if stochastic perturbations fade on the infinity not so quickly) is an open problem.},

Nowadays, second-order sliding modes such as the well-known super-twisting algorithm are widely recognised for their usefulness in the design of controllers, observers, and exact differentiators. However, a theoretical proof for an optimal and systematical selection of parameters for the algorithm to be stable is of particular interest. The solution proposed in this paper is based on combining exact convex representations of the nonlinear algorithms with a strict Lyapunov function, which leads to stability or design conditions in terms of linear matrix inequalities that can be efficiently solved via convex optimisation techniques, allowing us to provide an enlarged and optimal parameter setting in contrast with existing results; moreover, the systematic nature of the proposal is able to deal with different scenarios avoiding ad-hoc solutions of previous works. Effectiveness of the results is verified via simulation examples.},

If the inputted discrete-time consensus algorithm has polynomial-time complexity O ( C ) , then the proposed correction algorithms have polynomial-time complexity O ( C n f ) (and O ( C n ) for the detection of faulty nodes), for n nodes, and f maximum allowed faulty nodes.

A test for the satisfaction of the Internal-Model Principle is provided. The second result is a necessary and sufficient condition for the asymptotic synchronisation of the disturbed agents. Third, the synchronisability of the agents is investigated and it is shown that additional dynamics in the local controllers may be necessary to make the extended agents synchronisable. Fourth, a design method is proposed to find a networked controller that synchronises the agent outputs and simultaneously attenuates the disturbances. Finally, the analysis of the resulting synchronous trajectory shows that the disturbance model included in the extended agents may dominate the overall system behaviour.

Contrary to the conventional FAT, the use of basis functions in dynamic and actuator parameter approximations is completely eliminated. Besides, the proposed control scheme was improved by integrating a high order sliding mode observer to eliminate the need for velocity measurements. Consequently, offline simulation and comparative studies were carried out to validate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme, and controlled experimental cases were conducted using the haptic manipulator (Entact W3C) for validating the system in real time.},

An IDA-PBC including friction compensation with the LuGre model is designed to achieve locally asymptotically joint position regulation of a class of underactuated mechanical systems. To the best knowledge of the authors, this is the first original LuGre model-based controller for position regulation of underactuated mechanical systems. More importantly, the proposed theoretical framework allows us to redesign any IDA-PBC originally designed without friction compensation, as long as the parameters of the LuGre model of each actuator are available. Additionally, friction compensation in mechanical systems is known to improve controller performance at low velocities, being an advantage over other controllers that do not consider it. As a case study, an underactuated mechanical system available in numerous automatic control laboratories, called pendubot , is worked out to illustrate its performance through real-time experiments. Finally, a comparison is carried out between the proposed controller and an IDA-PBC with Dahl model friction compensation to test its superiority.},

By melting command filter technique into backstepping design, a finite-time control scheme is proposed, which overcomes the ‘explosion of complexity’ and ‘singularity’ problems resulted from the calculation of repeated derivatives of virtual control inputs in the conventional backstepping method. A hyperbolic tangent function is adopted to estimate saturation with a bounded estimation error in order to guarantee that the saturation function acting on the rudder angle can be differentiable, where the rudder angle is considered as a new state variable whose initial value is zero. The finite-time disturbance estimator is constructed to provide the estimation of compounded uncertain item derived from unmodelled dynamics and external disturbances.

To this end, we develop a distributed model reference adaptive critic learning algorithm with a hierarchical and distributed synchronisation control framework, which transforms the synchronisation problem of unknown nonlinear MASs into that of defined reference ones. Moreover, the algorithm extends our previous work to the distributed MASs, so that it is guaranteed that all the agents reach an agreement with the minimised transient errors and robustness against the disturbances and the neural network (NN) approximation errors. It is proved that the local neighbour tracking errors and the NN weight estimation errors are uniformly ultimately bounded via Lyapunov stability theory.

  abstract     = {This paper is concerned with the control of systems composed of multiple coupled subsystems. In such architectures, communication between different local controllers is desired in order to achieve a better overall control performance. Any resultant improvement in control performance needs, however, to be significant enough to warrant the additional design complexity and higher energy consumption and costs associated with introducing communication channels between controllers. A practical distributed control design aims, therefore, to achieve an acceptable balance between minimising the use of communication between controllers and maximising the system-wide performance. In this article, a new approach to the problem of synthesising stabilising distributed control laws for discrete-time linear systems that balances performance and communication is presented. The approach employs a supervisory agent that, periodically albeit not necessarily at every sampling instant, solves an optimisation problem in order to synthesise a stabilising state feedback control law for the system. The online optimisation problem, which maximises sparsity of the control law while minimising an infinite-horizon performance cost, is formulated as a bilinear matrix inequality (BMI) problem; subsequently, it is then relaxed to a linear matrix inequality (LMI) problem, and (i) convergence to a solution as well as (ii) that early termination guarantees a feasible (but suboptimal) control law are proved. Stability of the closed-loop system under what is a switched control law is guaranteed by the inclusion of dwell-time constraints in the LMI problem. Finally, the efficacy of the approach is demonstrated through numerical simulation examples.},

We further show that also for the stochastic problem, the optimal control is given in terms of the stabilising solution of the Lur&#39;e equation, which generalises the algebraic Riccati equation. We conclude our paper by examining an application of our theory to fluid dynamics problems.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the problem of observer-based control for cyber-physical systems (CPSs) with incomplete measurements. The CPSs are described as a class of nonlinear strict-feedback systems. When data transmission problems, such as information packet losing or transmission medium saturation, occur, the state variables become unavailable or distorted. To solve these problems, two-state estimators are constructed for different transmission cases, based on which two backstepping controllers are designed. The stability conditions of the state estimators and closed-loop system are derived by solving a linear matrix inequality (LMI). It is proved that the control methods can guarantee that all the signals of the closed-loop system are uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) in mean square. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is confirmed by a simulation example.},

The investor allocates her wealth in a financial market consisting of one risk-free asset and one risky asset, and she is subject to a random liability. The historical information of the wealth and liability affects the investor&#39;s wealth process, which is then governed by a stochastic differential delay equation. Firstly, a general ALM problem with delay is formulated and the extended Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman system of equations is obtained. Secondly, we focus on a linear model and derive the closed-form expressions of the equilibrium investment strategy and the corresponding equilibrium value function. Meanwhile, we also derive the pre-commitment strategy for the mean-variance ALM problem with delay using the maximum principle. Finally, some numerical examples and sensitivity analysis are presented to illustrate the equilibrium investment strategies and the efficient frontiers under the equilibrium and pre-commitment frameworks.},

The strategy proposed has two important properties: (i) it achieves practical consensus, i.e. the synchronisation error that measures the disagreement among the agents&#39; states converges to a ball centred at the origin, with a radius that can be made arbitrarily small and (ii) the minimum of the inter-event times for each agent is lower bounded by a strictly positive number, hence Zeno behaviour is excluded. Furthermore, it affords system designers adequate tools to trade off the frequency of communications among agents against the level of performance achieved in MAS consensus/synchronisation.

We propose a new Monte Carlo approach that significantly improves upon existing methodology. We tackle the issue of exponential growth in variance with the time horizon by casting optimal control estimation as a smoothing problem for a state-space model, and applying smoothing algorithms based on particle Markov chain Monte Carlo. To further reduce the cost, we then develop a multilevel Monte Carlo method which allows us to obtain an estimator of the optimal control with O ( ϵ 2 ) mean squared error with a cost of O ( ϵ − 2 log ⁡ ( ϵ ) 2 ) . In contrast, a cost of O ( ϵ − 3 ) is required for the existing methodology to achieve the same mean squared error. Our approach is illustrated on two numerical examples.},

The matched uncertainties are cancelled directly by adopting their opposite, whereas a dynamic inversion of the system is required to eliminate the effect of the mismatched uncertainties on the output.

The design philosophy of the extended filtered high-gain output feedback controller is that the extended state observer (ESO), high-gain and low-pass filter are integrated together. The ESO can not only estimate the unknown internal state, but also deliver a good property of disturbance rejection simultaneously due to the presence of high gain. Since the high gain deteriorates the robustness of the system, a low-pass filtering mechanism is added in the control law to filter away aggressive signals and recover the robustness. The filtered control law is designed to compensate the nonlinear uncertainties and deliver a good tracking performance with guaranteed robustness. The uniform performance bounds are derived for the states and control signals via comparison with the virtual reference system.},

Furthermore, a nonlinear extended differentiator-predictor is designed for future estimation and chattering rejection. The stability analysis of differentiator-predictors is described in time domain. The iterative transfer function method is proposed to analyse the robustness in frequency domain, and the rules of differentiator-predictor parameters selection are presented.

Existing methodologies for input, output structure selection rely on criteria expressing distance to uncontrollability, unobservability. Although controllability is invariant under state feedback, its corresponding degrees expressing distance to uncontrollability is not. The paper introduces new criteria for distance to uncontrollability (dually for unobservability) which is invariant under feedback transformations. The approach uses the restricted matrix pencils developed for the characterisation of invariant spaces of the geometric theory and then deploys exterior algebra to define the invariant input and output decoupling polynomials. This reduces the overall problem of distance to uncontrollability (unobservability) to two optimisation problems: the distance from the Grassmann variety and distance of a set of polynomials from non-coprimeness. Results on the distance of Sylvester Resultants from singularity provide the new measures.},

To deal with the constraints in practical situations, a new approach is proposed based on using diffeomorphism, which is the first introduced. Based on this transformation, the control input can be regarded as a function of an auxiliary variable. As a result, the value of control input is limited to a prescribed bound by choosing the proper bounded function. That is, it provides a new aspect to deal with the inequality control input constraints. The range of the input bounds is related to the uncertainties and can be designed according to the actual situation. This novel control is proven to guarantee uniform boundedness and uniform ultimate boundedness. In the simulation, we show this control renders a superior performance at a lower control cost, comparing with the LQR control.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a fixed-time sliding mode control scheme for the rapid and accurate trajectory tracking of a fully actuated USV in the presence of model uncertainties and external disturbances. First, a novel fixed-time nonsingular sliding mode manifold is developed based on the bi-limit homogeneous theory. Then, a fixed-time sliding mode controller is designed to track the desired trajectory of the USV based on the fixed-time sliding mode manifold. Rigorous theoretical analysis for the global fixed-time stability of the whole closed-loop system is provided. The proposed fixed-time sliding mode control scheme can guarantee the position and velocity tracking errors converge to zero in fixed time with strong robustness against lumped uncertainties. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, there are really limited existing controllers can achieve such excellent performance under the same conditions. Numerical simulations illustrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed control scheme.},

  abstract     = {Stabilisation via adaptive feedback is investigated for an ODE system cascaded by coupled parabolic equations. The remarkable characteristic of the system is the presence of serious uncertainties since no known or bounded intervals are needed for the unknown parameters. Besides, strong coupling exists in the PDE subsystem which brings essential difference compared with those of the related literature. For this, a passive identifier is skillfully constructed firstly, and in turn adaptive laws are given to compensate the serious parametric unknowns. Then, by constructing a backstepping transformation and its inverse one, the identifier joint with the original system is transformed into a new system. From the new system, an adaptive state-feedback controller is designed which ensures that all the states of the closed-loop system are bounded and particularly those of the original system converge to zero. Finally, a numerical example is provided to validate the proposed algorithm.},

This scheme is based on our recently developed theory for finite-time stability for discrete-time systems using discrete Lyapunov analysis. The proposed scheme here is developed in discrete time as it is more convenient for onboard computer implementation and ensures stability irrespective of the sampling period. This scheme guarantees a stable convergence of translational and rotational tracking errors to the desired trajectory in finite time. Furthermore, the advantages of finite-time stabilisation in discrete-time over finite-time stabilisation of a sampled continuous-time tracking control system is addressed here through a numerical comparison. This comparison is performed using numerical simulations on continuous and discrete FTS tracking control schemes applied to an unmanned aerial vehicle model.},

The designed controller can guarantee that tracking error of each subsystem is constrained by finite-time performance function and converges to the given neighborhood of the equilibrium point within a given arbitrarily settling time. Meanwhile, all the signals in the closed-loop interconnected system are bounded. In addition, the problem that the prescribed performance control method is difficult to realize decentralized control is solved by means of a special mathematical transformation. Specifically, the settling time is a design parameter which is independent of the system initial states in this method.

Although the design is undertaken using a state-space-model, frequency response analysis based on the sensitivity and complementary functions is used to demonstrate the characteristics of the repetitive control system for disturbance rejection, reference following and measurement noise attenuation. Moreover, operational constraints can be included in the design for applications where this feature is required.

In the recently introduced feedback approach to trading, the stock price is instead treated as an exogenous disturbance to a feedback loop scheme and a controller is synthesised with the unique goal of minimising the impact of the return variations on the investment gain. Since such an approach is intrinsically model-free , the tuning of the controller represents a critical task. In this work, we propose a data-driven adaptive control strategy, exploiting the knowledge of the gain/loss as well as the measured returns over a moving window. The proposed approach is extensively back-tested on real-world financial series and the related performance is compared to that of classical feedback schemes and to benchmark investment strategies.},

In this paper, an improved ℒ 2 L 2 L2 -gain analysis method called a delay-mode-based Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional (DMBLKF) method is proposed to replace the LKF method. This is achieved by weakening the condition that a LKF is required for a system with a delay varying in a delay interval.

A dynamic inversion-based approach, combined with an optimisation formulation, is used to design optimal guidance laws that enable the UAV swarm to track the evolution of the contaminant, so that the swarm takes a configuration such that its spatial density distribution is proportional to the contaminant density.

  abstract     = {Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs), with the intrinsical vulnerability of the cyber layer, are always suffering from malicious data injection (DI) attacks. In this paper, switched counteraction principle based defense strategies are designed for secure state estimation (SSE) of CPSs under sparse DI attacks. Firstly, the physical layer is modelled by a hybrid mechanism, based on which malicious injections are excluded by implementing adaptively switched counteraction searching. Sufficient conditions are established to ensure the feasibility of SSE design. Next, by set cover approach, a defence strategy is presented to further relax the computation burden caused by combinational brute force search. Two numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness and potential of the proposed design methods.},

Networked systems consist of multiple leaders and followers in different groups, and the dynamics of multiple leaders are governed by Euler–Lagrange (EL) equations. By considering the interactions of different intensity among Lagrangian agents, we propose a distributed adaptive controller with differentiators over the newly introduced cooperative–competitive weighted network. It is found that the Lagrangian followers can converge to the dynamic convex hull spanned by leaders&#39; weighted coordinates, as long as every topology formed by the leaders&#39; group or followers&#39; group is interactively balanced, every follower obtains at least one leader&#39;s information and each follower is weight-product balanced.

The novel performance function with arbitrarily preassigned fixed-time convergence property is developed, which imposes priori performance envelops on both altitude and airspeed tracking errors. By using error transformed technology, the constrained fixed-time performance envelops are changed into unconstrained equivalent errors. Based on modified error compensation mechanism, a novel backstepping approach is proposed to guarantee altitude tracking equivalent error converges to the specified small neighbourhood and presents excellent robustness against model uncertainties and external disturbances, and airspeed controller with fixed-time prescribed performance is designed. The proposed methodology guarantees the transient and steady-state performance of altitude and airspeed tracking errors within constrained fixed-time performance envelops in spite of lumped disturbances.

The purpose of this paper is to elucidate the properties of the zero dynamics within the context of input–output models, which, like state-space models, are time-domain models, but, unlike state-space models, have no internal state. In particular, the focus is on the zero dynamics of left polynomial fraction description (LPFD) input–output models whose denominator polynomial is not necessarily monic.},

Then, the emulation method is used to construct the sampled-data output feedback controllers with a sampling period. Based on the homogeneity theory, Hölder inequality and Gronwall–Bellman inequality, the relationships between the sampling states (controllers) and the current states (controllers) are revealed. In the meantime, we obtain the sampling period for the sampled-data output feedback controllers to guarantee the global stabilisation of the closed-loop systems in finite time.

Subsequently, a mode-dependent switching control scheme is proposed and the well-posedness of the closed-loop PDE system is also analysed. Then, based on Lyapunov direct method, an integrated design of switching controllers and mobile actuator/sensor guidance laws is developed in the form of linear matrix inequalities, such that the closed-loop PDE system is exponentially stable while providing an upper bound for the prescribed quadratic cost function. Moreover, a suboptimal guaranteed cost design problem is also addressed to make the cost bound as small as possible.

An error model is developed to characterise the position feedback information of target for a high-repetition rate process to determine the effects of the non-collocation of the sensor’s measurement point and target on the control system’s performance – a challenge for the real-time position control of targets. Behaviour of the control system is investigated with the error model and experimental data. It is found that a controller’s position compensation scheme can be ineffective due to the erroneous position feedback as a result of the non-linear position information associated with the non-collocated measurement point and the actual target. To solve the problem, an angular compensation technique is proposed.},

The primary interest is to optimise the availability of the system, which is defined as the probability that the system is operating properly when it is requested for use. The system model considered in our current work is governed by coupled transport and integro-differential equations. A corrective maintenance policy is represented by the repair rate, which depends on the distributed repair time. The objective is to determine an optimal repair rate that maximises the availability of the system in good mode over a given system running period. This essentially leads to a bilinear control problem set in a nonreflexive Banach space using L 1 -optimisation. A rigorous proof of existence of an optimal controller and the first-order necessary conditions of optimality are addressed.

Firstly, in order to achieve finite-time stability and avoid singular problem, a continuous and smooth non-singular terminal sliding mode manifold is designed based on a piecewise function. And then a continuous control law is designed by indirectly estimating the bound of the general uncertainty, to compensate the external disturbance and modelling uncertainty. Based on the Lyapunov stability analysis, it is verified that the tracking error can converge to a certain range near zero in a finite time. Finally, the proposed control scheme is applied to ODIN AUV and compared with another two finite-time tracking controllers. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.},

The investigated closed-loop control system is assumed to contain an adaptive control allocator to distribute the total control input among actuators. Although conventional control allocation methods can handle actuator rate and magnitude constraints, they cannot consider actuator uncertainty. On the other hand, adaptive allocators manage uncertainty and actuator magnitude limits. The proposed projection algorithm enables adaptive control allocators to handle both magnitude and rate saturation constraints. A mathematically rigorous analysis is provided to show that with the help of the proposed projection algorithm, the performance of the adaptive control allocator can be guaranteed, in terms of error bounds.

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the input-to-state contraction for impulsive systems. The notion of input-to-state contraction (ISC) is proposed via incremental input-to-state stability ( δ ISS). By using the method of variation, the equivalence between global ISC and exponential δ ISS is established. Then by the technique of the average dwell-time (ADT), some criteria for global ISC and exponential δ ISS are derived for impulsive systems. Moreover, by using impulse frequency (I.F.) to replace ADT, the criteria are improved and less conservative criteria via I.F. are established for global ISC and exponential δ ISS. The criteria are used to derive global ISC and exponential δ ISS for continuous and discrete time systems. Discussions are given to relax the differentiable vector fields. And the criteria of exponential δ ISS via the Lyapunov-like function are derived for impulsive systems satisfying time-varying Lipschitz condition. Finally, three examples are worked out for illustrations, where impulsive control is designed for chaotic systems to achieve global ISC.},

The proposed Load Frequency Control (LFC), relying on H ∞ H ∞ H∞ methodologies enhanced with integral action and pole clustering, can provide frequency regulation and fast transient response despite the presence of unknown disturbance load application. The inherent saturation constraints are handled by the combination of a controller gain minimisation framework and an anti-windup enhanced controller design which provides stability guarantees, while avoiding frequency and tie-line power oscillations. For this scheme, particular attention should be paid on the modelling and controllability aspects of the power system, where it is shown that due to the singularity of the Laplacian matrix of the network&#39;s graph, a reduction of the state vector is necessary. Simulation studies are offered to illustrate the effectiveness of the suggested scheme.},

One novelty of the study is that the PDE sensor includes globally Lipschitz nonlinear dynamics. The other novelty is that the proposed observer relies on sampled measurements at the sensor boundary. The observer provides online estimates of both the plant (finite-dimensional) state vector and the sensor PDE distributed state. Exponential stability of the observation error system is analysed using backstepping-like transformation, Lyapunov-Krasovski type functional, Wirtinger’s and Halanay’s inequalities. Additional observer features are highlighted by simulation results, including its robustness to global Lipschitz assumption, and its applicability to output feedback stabilisation.},

The main purpose of the proposed approach is to estimate the multiplicative component faults. The direct influence of fault occurrences on the system stability is considered in the design procedure. In the proposed approach, the unknown input-decoupling principle is used to decouple the component faults from sensor and actuator faults. Then, an algebraic technique is used to derive a regressor description of the system energy balance, where the regressor coefficients are component of the fault matrix elements. This formulation provides the possibility of using a Least-Squares technique to on-line component faults estimation. In order to estimate the component fault along with sensor faults, a new observer structure is proposed where the regressor description is coupled with the Unknown Input Observer by means of an auxiliary output.},

Then, a simple and typical scenario where communication sequence is purely Round-robin is considered and a bound of attack frequency and duration is calculated to ensure the stability of the distributed CPS.

There are multiple ways to solve this problem, among them using gramian-based measures, which include the Hankel interaction index array, the participation matrix and the Σ 2 Σ 2 Σ2 method. The gramian-based measures, however, have issues with input and output scaling. Generally, this is resolved by scaling all inputs and outputs to have equal range. However, we demonstrate how this can result in an incorrect pairing and examine alternative methods of scaling the gramian-based measures, using either row or column sums or by utilising the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm. To systematically analyse the benefits of the scaling schemes, a multiple-input multiple-output model generator is used to test the different schemes on a large number of systems. This assessment shows considerable benefits to be gained from the alternative scaling of the gramian-based measures, especially when using the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm.},

Unlike the majority of existing extremum-seeking-based source seeking strategies that only deal with the quadratic map, the more universal case is considered that the map is quasi-concave nonlinear. In addition, the dynamic sensor reading is also considered which arises in many applications. However, this dynamic sensor could cause poor performance and could be a potential cause of instability. To resolve it, combined filters and a phase-lead compensator are utilised to improve the performance. Furthermore, a critical semi-global stability analysis is theoretically proven which shows that the proposed scheme can seek an arbitrarily small neighbourhood of the signal&#39;s source from an arbitrarily large set of initial location. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed scheme is illustrated by numerical simulations.},

In this paper, nonlinear active controller is obtained to synchronize the two identical dissipative fermionic systems in their chaotic states for different initial values. The synchronization is presented in the master–slave structure which implies that the states of the controlled chaotic slave system asymptotically synchronizes the states of the master system. Also the numerical simulations are given to show the effectiveness of the used controllers.},

  abstract     = {In this manuscript, we address discrete-time state and error feedback output regulator designs for a class of linear distributed parameter systems (DPS) with bounded input and output operators. By utilising the Cayley–Tustin bilinear transform, a linear infinite-dimensional discrete-time system is obtained without model spatial approximation or model order reduction. Based on the internal model principle, discrete state and error feedback regulators are designed. In particular, discrete Sylvester regulator equations are formulated, and their solvability is proved and linked to the continuous counterparts. To ensure the stability of the closed-loop system, the design of stabilising feedback gain and its dual problem of stabilising output injection gain design are provided in the discrete-time setting. Finally, three simulation examples including a first-order hyperbolic partial differential equation model and a 1-D heat equation with considerations of step-like, ramp-like and harmonic exogenous signals are shown to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

A new type of event-triggered mechanism is proposed based on an appropriate storage function, which is chosen larger than the derivative of Lyapunov function. Thus, the convergence of the observer system is guaranteed by the negativity of this storage function. With the utilisation of LMI techniques and the designed novel event-triggered mechanism, as well as the utilisation of a Wirtinger-based inequality, only a slight over-estimation exists in the process of obtaining stability conditions, leading to reduced conservatism. With simulations of a mobile cart system, the effectiveness of this novel event-triggered mechanism is proven through a comparison with a classical event-triggered and also periodic time-triggered mechanisms.},

First, with the help of the algebraic state-space expression, the dynamics of NPPs are proposed under a centralised view. Then, some stability criteria are obtained by the equivalence of NPPs and a special category of logical systems. Consequently, stability and stabilisation of NPPs are considered. With an analysis of the dynamic properties of NPPs (i.e. controllability of the corresponding logical control systems), the event-triggered controls, which are seen as the intermediaries in NPPs, are designed to realise convergence (stabilization) of NPPs starting from arbitrary initial states, which is the main improvement of this paper compared with the former discussions about CPPs.

To begin with, we establish an equivalent Markov jump system for the considered KVLNs with MJDs via semi-tensor product (STP) of matrices, which can simplify the stability analysis of KVLNs with MJDs. Next, two criteria are proposed for finite-time stability and stability in distribution of KVLNs with MJDs, respectively.

The overall closed-loop system is described as a switched control system. The notion of weighted L 2 − L ∞ performance is then introduced and analysed. Based on the local information obtained from the neighbours, a topology-dependent controller is designed. The switchings between the communication topologies and the controllers are asynchronous. Conditions are developed for the existence of a control protocol to produce the leader-following consensus with a certain level of weighted L 2 − L ∞ performance. The design algorithm is then formulated as a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). A numerical example is then given to show the effectiveness of the proposed consensus algorithm.},

Beyond the consensus algorithms, our primary contribution is to provide strict barrier Lyapunov functions, i.e. positive definite and with negative definite derivative in the agreement subspace.

By designing events such that a specifically chosen Lyapunov function is monotonically decreasing, event-triggered algorithms succeed in reducing communications among agents while still ensuring that the entire system converges to the desired state. However, depending on the chosen Lyapunov function the transient behaviours can be very different. Moreover, performance requirements also vary from application to application. Consequently, we are instead interested in considering a class of Lyapunov functions such that each Lyapunov function produces a different event-triggered coordination algorithm to solve the multi-agent average consensus problem. The proposed class of algorithms all guarantee exponential convergence of the resulting system and exclusion of Zeno behaviours. This allows us to easily implement different algorithms that all guarantee correctness to meet varying performance needs. We show that our findings can be applied to the practical clock synchronisation problem in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and further corroborate their effectiveness with simulation results.},

The control is based on a time-periodic ℋ ∞ H ∞ H∞ state feedback law and a time-periodic feed-forward preview signal that is based on an estimate of the drag influence. The feedback control stabilises the orbit and introduces a robustness margin. By anticipating and compensating for drag effects, the feed-forward control produces improved station keeping (the maintenance of a design orbit). The efficacy of these ideas is demonstrated by simulation results that are based on a Circular Restricted Thee-Body Problem (CRTBP) model. The feedback control is characterised by the solution of a time-periodic H ∞ control Riccati equation. The feed-forward control comes from the solution of a linear time-periodic equation, solved backwards in time, that is driven by a disturbance estimate.},

It is rigorously proved that the states of fuzzy systems remain within a specific compact set, on which fuzzy approximation is valid. Besides, asymmetric full-state constraints aren&#39;t violated for all time, and the tracking error converges to the prescribed small region around zero in a preassigned finite-time.

  abstract     = {The problem addressed in this paper is the optimal allocation of a CPU to a number of software control tasks. Each task is used to implement a feedback controller for a linear and time invariant system and is activated with a fixed period. On every periodic activation, the task executes a job, which collects the output of the system, and produces the control values after executing for a random computation time. If a job&#39;s duration exceeds a deadline, then the job is cancelled and the control values are not updated. The systems to be controlled are affected by process noise. Therefore the performance of each control loop can be evaluated through the steady-state covariance of the system&#39;s state, which depends on the probability with which the task implementing the controller drops its jobs. We show that by making a proper choice for the scheduling algorithm, this probability can be straightforwardly computed as a function of the scheduling parameters. This observation enables the construction of a very efficient procedure for finding the scheduling parameters that attain the optimal tradeoff between the performance of the different control loops.},

For each agent, a sliding-mode observer-based estimator/controller module is proposed that uses the available local relative output measurements and the information transmitted from the neighbouring agents. By considering the H ∞ performance index and using the linear matrix inequality technique, the parameters of the observers are designed such that the fault estimation is robust against disturbances and at the same time, a robust leader-following mission in the presence of actuator fault is guaranteed. As the fault estimator and fault tolerant controller are integrated in the proposed strategy, there is no need for separate design of these units. Moreover, the proposed method improves the existing fault estimation techniques in terms of both complexity and performance. Two simulation examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.},

Based on the fixed-time stability theory, a novel fixed-time disturbance observer is proposed, which switches from a uniform second-order sliding mode observer with high-degree term to the classical continuous super-twisting observer. Then, a command filtered backstepping control scheme is designed to enforce the tracking error into a small neighbourhood of the origin in fixed time while the full-state constraint and input saturation constraint are satisfied. To further reduce the communication burden, an event-triggered communication strategy between the controller and the actuator input is also developed. Furthermore, all the signals in the closed-loop system are proven to be bounded. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is illustrated by numerical simulations.},

Two different tools of discrete event systems have been used: Timed Event Graphs (TEGs) and (Max,+) algebra. First, the contribution is to model all components of NCS with TEGs, and to represent the behaviour of these graphs by (Max,+) linear equations, and then to determine the upper bounds of the response time by an analytical formula. The main novelty of these results is to introduce a modular method capable of providing crucial validation elements regarding temporal performances for an industrial scale NCS that includes inter CPU communication. Moreover, the modular aspect of the presented approach remains in considering the end-to-end delays introduced by the network as model parameters, calculated from other models.},

Sufficient conditions are established by means of the mixed-mode and token-dependent Lyapunov-like technique such that the closed-loop system is stable in the mean-square sense. In addition, a set of mixed-mode and token-dependent state feedback controllers are designed in terms of minimising a certain upper bound of the worst-case infinite horizon cost function.

In this paper, we present a novel approach to deal with the safe diagnosis issue for stochastic DESs by constructing a nondeterministic automaton called the safe verifier, and the necessary and sufficient condition for safe diagnosability of stochastic DESs is presented. It is worth noting that the proposed approach has lower complexity than the existing approach based on safe diagnoser as far as the number of states.},

The MAS is considered to be non-introspective, meaning that each individual agent is not able to measure the absolute plant state/output of its own but can sense relative information from its neighbours. A novel dynamic relative output-feedback (DROF) controller structure is proposed by leveraging the integral quadratic constraints (IQCs) from robust control theory. This new DROF controller is compelling in the sense that it utilises not only the relative plant outputs, but also the relative controller states and relative IQC-induced dynamics states for distributed feedback control. Based on this, the associated consensus control synthesis conditions that guarantee optimal H ∞ disturbance attenuation performance in the presence of time-varying input delays are derived and formulated as linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), which can be solved efficiently via convex optimisation. Effectiveness of the proposed theoretical results is demonstrated through simulation studies.},

First, a new concept of geometrical quasi-dissipativity for a switched discrete-time nonlinear system is proposed. In contrast with geometrically dissipative system, the supply rate of geometrical quasi-dissipativity is the sum of the conventional dissipativity supply rate and the constant supply rate, which means geometrically quasi-dissipative system can produce energy by itself. Then, a geometrically quasi-dissipative switched nonlinear system is shown to be uniformly ultimately bounded under some restricted conditions on the energy changing of inactive subsystems. Second, the sufficient conditions to be geometrical quasi-dissipative are obtained by the design of a more general state-dependent switching law. Third, a composite state-dependent switching law is designed to render interconnected switched systems geometrically quasi-(Q,S,R)-dissipative. The designed switching law allow the interconnected switched nonlinear systems to switch asynchronously. Finally, the effectiveness of the obtained results is verified by an example of a thermal system.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates new achievements in global chassis control, involving Active Front steering (AFS) and Direct Yaw Control (DYC), to improve the overall vehicle performance, i.e. the vehicle manoeuvrability, lateral stability and rollover avoidance. Two multilayer control architectures, each formed by three hierarchical layers, are developed, validated and compared. The lower layer represents the actuators implemented into the vehicle which generate their control inputs based on the orders sent from the middle layer. The middle layer is the control layer which is responsible to generate the control inputs that minimise the errors between the desired and actual vehicle yaw rate, side-slip angle and roll angle, regardless of the driving situation. The control layer is the main difference of the proposed architectures, where a centralised and a decentralised controllers are developed. In the centralised architecture, the novelty is that one single Multi-Input-Multi-Output MIMO optimal controller generates the optimal additive steering angle provided by the AFS and the optimal differential braking provided by the DYC to minimise -at once- all the vehicle state errors . The optimal H ∞ control technique based on offline Linear Matrix Inequality optimal solutions, in the framework of Linear-Parameter-Varying systems, is applied to synthesise the controller. In the decentralised architecture, a heuristic solution is proposed by decoupling the control problem where the Super-Twisting Sliding Mode (STSM) technique is applied to derive the AFS control input which minimises only the errors on the yaw rate, and the roll angle. Similarly, the DYC control input is privileged to minimise only the error on the side-slip angle. The higher layer of both architectures is the decision making layer which instantly monitors two criteria laying on lateral stability and rollover risks. Then, it generates two weighted parameters which adapt the controller(s) performance(s) according to the driving conditions in order to improve the vehicle&#39;s manoeuvrability, lateral stability and rollover avoidance. Both control architectures are tested and validated on the professional simulator ‘SCANeR Studio’. Simulation shows that both architectures are relevant to the global chassis control. The centralised one is optimal, complex and overall closed-loop stability is guaranteed, while the decentralised one does not guarantee the overall closed-loop stability, but it is intuitive, simple and robust.},

  abstract     = {In standard linear-quadratic (LQ) control, the first step in investigating infinite-horizon optimal control is to derive the stabilisation condition with the optimal LQ controller. This paper focuses on the stabilisation of an Itô stochastic system with indefinite control and state-weighting matrices in the cost functional. A generalised algebraic Riccati equation (GARE) is obtained via the convergence of the generalised differential Riccati equation (GDRE) in the finite-horizon case. More importantly, the necessary and sufficient stabilisation conditions for indefinite stochastic control are obtained. One of the key techniques is that the solution of the GARE is decomposed into a positive semi-definite matrix that satisfies the singular algebraic Riccati equation (SARE) and a constant matrix that is an element of the set satisfying certain linear matrix inequality conditions. Using the equivalence between the GARE and SARE, we reduce the stabilisation of the general indefinite case to that of the definite case, in which the stabilisation is studied using a Lyapunov functional defined by the optimal cost functional subject to the SARE.},

Non-quadratic cost functions are introduced to handle input constraints and a novel distributed optimal consensus protocol is derived based on event-triggered adaptive dynamic programming method. An online implement scheme is designed under actor-critic network framework in order to obtain the solutions of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations online. The computation and communication loads are effectively reduced since the weight estimation vectors and controllers are updated only at event-triggered instants. Detailed analysis is presented based on Lyapunov stability theory which guarantees that the weight estimation errors and local consensus errors are uniformly ultimately bounded. Furthermore, it proves that Zeno behaviour can be effectively avoided. Finally, the simulation examples are presented to validate the proposed strategy.},

One existing classical method for analyzing stability of such systems is the Razumikhin-type theorem with requiring the time derivative of relating Lyapunov function to be non-positive for uniform stability and negative for uniform asymptotic or exponential stability, which are difficult to be satisfied. To relax these restrictions, by introducing the time-scale type uniformly stable function and uniformly asymptotically stable function, this paper presents several less conservative stability criteria, in which the time-scale time derivative of Lyapunov function can be positive or non-negative. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretic results, a numerical example about non-continuous and non-discrete time-delay systems is given.},

A novel discrete-time quasi-sliding mode control (DQSMC) scheme is mainly proposed. Since the sliding mode bound is directly involved in the DQSMC law, the chattering bound can be accurately specified. By the proposed method, the dynamic of the sliding mode is unable to escape from the pre-given neighbourhood once it is attracted into the neighbourhood, in addition, the closed-loop system achieves the almost surely stable in mean square sense. Moreover, the proposed DQSMC provides a convenient method to simultaneously regulate the convergence rates of the sliding mode and the closed-loop system.

The first method leads to the differential Bellman equation, while the second method leads to the integral Bellman equation. The target of the current article is to prove the equivalence of those Bellman equations in many specific models.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to polynomial control design based on iterations that involve either a fast coordinate-wise minimisation or a univariate minimisation along a randomly chosen direction. We provide a detailed iteration complexity analysis of the method, and we prove its convergence in probability to the global optimum. The practical effectiveness of the proposed method is also illustrated via a comparison with state-of-the-art tools available in the literature. An example of application to an automated space rendezvous manoeuvre is finally presented, showing how the method can be particularly relevant in the context of nonlinear model predictive control.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a data-driven algorithm for identification of locally differentially flat output from system output measurements. No detailed mathematical model of the system is needed. Trial output is written as a linear combination of measured outputs. An optimal linear combination is identified so that the trial output achieves the highest relative degree. When the relative degree is equal to the order of the system, the output is flat. The identification is done in the frequency domain by taking advantage of the asymptotic behaviour of transfer functions of linear systems. We have also developed data handling strategies to obtain the best estimate of the relative degree in the presence of measurement noise, high-frequency dynamics and Nyquist digitisation effect. The proposed algorithm is validated by numerical examples and an experimental study of a rotary crane system.},

  abstract     = {A leader–follower system is developed to cooperatively swing a payload up to a desired angle without interagent communication. The main advantages of this system are that no force sensor is required to measure the swing angle, and the states of the leader and the follower are not communicated to achieve synchronous swinging. The leader actively swings up the payload using an energy-based controller. The follower controller can compensate the angle difference and mimic the leader swing simultaneously by estimating the difference in swing angle and the energy rate, which avoid any need for interagent communication of their states for achieving the appropriate interaction. Force sensors are also not needed since unscented Kalman filters are developed to estimate the external forces applied to the agents. The results from a stability analysis prove that the system is stable. Simulation was conducted to verify the performance of the developed controllers and estimator.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the leaderless consensus control problem of high-order nonholonomic chained systems. Based on the relationship between state and consensus error, a novel Lyapunov function is defined and is proved positive definite and radially unbounded. The first control law is constructed to make the Lyapunov function non-increasing. The Lyapunov method, graph theory and LaSalle invariance principle are applied to analyse system stability, where some skillful mathematical calculations are conducted to overcome the difficulties caused by nonholonomic constraint and high-order structure, and the explicit expression and the conditions of control parameter matrix are calculated. Then, the second control law is designed by extending the results to the input saturation case. Both of the two controllers are smooth, time-invariant, static, distributed, and able to achieve global asymptotic consensus of nonholonomic chained systems over connected undirected graph. Numerical simulation examples are implemented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control schemes.},

  abstract     = {Establishment of a long-term biological population management policy requires balancing its cost and utility/disutility. We approach this issue from the viewpoint of stochastic control as an efficient candidate for its modelling and analysis. A remarkable point of the present model is making good use of an unbounded performance index, which naturally penalises too much population decrease. The goal of the present optimal control problem is approached through solving a Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation having a solution blowing up at a boundary. We thus positively use a singular mathematical model. Solution behaviour of the HJB equation is analysed from the viewpoint of viscosity solutions with the help of an asymptotic expansion technique, which can handle the blow up under regularity assumptions. Numerical framework for analysing the optimal control problem is presented and examined as well, to qualitatively determine the profile of the solution, optimal human intervention, and probability density function.},

After formulating the problem, we extend the concept of the virtual regulated output from the unsigned digraph to the signed digraph. Based on the virtual regulated output, we can define a so-called distributed internal model and form a so-called ancillary augmented system. We then show that, under some standard conditions, the problem can be converted into the distributed stabilisation problem of the ancillary augmented system, thus leading to the solvability of the problem. A special case of our result where the digraph is unsigned recovers the solution of the robust cooperative output regulation problem for the same class of linear uncertain multi-agent systems.},

The asymptotic stability criterion for the cascade system is developed without requiring passivity of subsystem in the whole state interval. Passivity and stabilisation of the closed-loop system are achieved by co-designing an output feedback control law and a state-dependent switching signal if the full output information is measurable. While the output information of the first switched system are not available, the sampled integral stabilisation (SIS) technique which only adopts the output information and common energy function of the second one, is exploited to achieve passive control of two switched systems connected in a cascade way. Then, a particular case of cascade system where only one passive switched system exists is stabilised via SIS technique. Finally, the validity of the developed results is demonstrated via a plane articulation arm example.},
