We first discuss the relation between the isotonicity of the projection onto the cone and its dual cone. Some sufficient conditions for the isotonicity of the projection with respect to the mutually dual orders onto general cones are then proved. By using the self-dual cone in the hyperplane, we establish some specific isotone projection cones. Some properties and representations of the projection onto these cones are studied. We also prove some heredity and expansivity for the isotonicity of the projection onto these cones. By using the isotonicity characterizations of the projection with respect to the mutually dual orders, some solvability and approximation theorems for the complementarity and conic optimization problems are obtained. In Theorems 5.1–5.4, if the order relation does not satisfy the regularity, to guarantee convergence of isotone Picard iterations, three different order methods are used, respectively. Our results generalize those about the isotone projection cone and methods to establish isotone iterations for complementarity problems.},

The inertial factor in these methods is chosen to be less than 1 in most of the papers that studied these methods. It is known from a computational point of view that the efficiency of these methods improves as the inertial factor approaches 1. In this paper, we modify both the inertial projection and contraction method and the inertial forward-backward-forward method with the possibility of inertial factor taken as 1. Our proposed methods also involve a step-size rule which does not depend on the Lipschitz constant of the cost function and without any line search rule. We analyse the weak convergence of the methods under appropriate conditions. We also modify the proposed methods so that strong convergence is obtained. Preliminary computational results show that our proposed methods are promising and show better performance than some variants of inertial projection and contraction methods and inertial forward-backward-forward methods where the inertial factor is assumed to be less than 1.},

The model of multi-objective multi-item Just-in-Time transportation problem is formulated, and then an algorithm is developed under some priority-based approaches to obtain a Pareto optimal solution. To test and justify the efficiency of our study, we include a practical example having three-fold priority: (i) first priority is to deliver goods within the scheduled time, (ii) second priority is to minimize the total transportation cost, and (iii) third priority is to maximize the profit.

  abstract     = {The ℓ 1 -regularized minimization has been widely used in many data science applications, and certain special constrained ℓ 1 -regularized minimizations have also been proposed in some recent applications. In this paper, we consider a sphere constrained ℓ 1 -regularized minimization, which can arise in image processing, signal recognition and sparse principal component analysis. Viewing the sphere as a simple Riemannian manifold, manifold-based methods for non-smooth minimization can be applied to solve such a problem, but may still encounter slow convergence in some situations. Our objective of this paper is to propose a new and efficient active-set proximal quasi-Newton method for this problem. The idea behind is to speed up the convergence by separately handling the convergence of both the active and inactive variables. In particular, our method invokes a procedure to effectively estimate active and inactive variables, and then designs the search directions based on proximal gradients and quasi-Newton directions to efficiently treat the convergence of the active and inactive variables, respectively. We show that under some mild conditions, the global convergence is guaranteed, and the complexity is also performed to reveal the computational efficiency. Numerical experience on the ℓ 1 -regularized quadratic programming and sparse principal component analysis on both synthetic and real data demonstrates its robustness and efficiency.},

For the sake of applying HJB equation, a cost function is constructed according to the built Markov model, and HJB equation is derived by using optimality principle. The optimal soot blowing strategy and repair plan can be obtained by solving HJB equation. Particularly, the properties of value function, which are regarded as the optimality conditions, can ensure the existence and uniqueness of HJB equation solution. On this basis, Kushner method is used to overcome the difficulty of obtaining analytical solution of HJB equation.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we develop an extended constant elasticity of variance (CEV) model with stochastic volatility to study an optimal investment strategy problem. This extended CEV model remedies the shortcoming of classical CEV model. In CEV model, the volatility term is an power function of stock price, which only covers firm-specific risks. Consequently, we consider the coefficient of volatility with the mean reverting process to make the volatility involve the market risks to improve the classical CEV model. For the optimal investment objective with a constant absolute risk aversion (CARA) utility function, the analytical solution under the extended CEV model cannot be obtained due to the complicated nonlinearity of the partial differential equation. In this paper we successfully employ a dual method, Legendre transformation, and an asymptotic expansion technique to approach an asymptotic solution. The numerical examples indicate the optimal strategy is an increasing function of the expectation of stock returns and correlations between the two market risks. Besides, it is a decreasing function of interest rate and risk aversion coefficient. In addition, by statistical analysis, we find that the power parameter, the expectation of stock returns and interest rate are all significant factors affecting the investment strategy.},

We prove the weak convergence of the trajectory to a fixed point of the operator by relying on Lyapunov analysis. Under a metric subregularity condition, we further derive a flexible global exponential-type rate for the distance of the trajectory to the set of fixed points. The results obtained are applied to analyse the asymptotic behaviour of the trajectory of an adaptive Douglas–Rachford dynamical system, which is applied for finding a zero of the sum of two operators, one of which is strongly monotone while the other one is weakly monotone.},

In the case of bicriteria mixed-integer problems, the approximation of the Pareto frontier becomes, however, significantly harder. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm for approximating the Pareto frontier of bicriteria mixed-integer programs with convex constraints. Such Pareto frontiers are composed of patches of solutions with shared assignments for the discrete variables. By adaptively creating such a patchwork, our algorithm is able to create approximations that converge quickly to the true Pareto frontier. As a quality measure, we use the difference in hypervolume between the approximation and the true Pareto frontier. At least a certain number of patches is required to obtain an approximation with a given quality. This patch complexity gives a lower bound on the number of required computations. We show that our algorithm performs a number of optimization steps that are of a similar order as this lower bound. We provide an efficient MIP-based implementation of this algorithm. The efficiency of our algorithm is illustrated with numerical results showing that our algorithm has a strong theoretical performance guarantee while being competitive with other state-of-the-art approaches in practice.},

In addition to standing assumptions, two main hypotheses are imposed. The first one is the Gâteaux-differentiability at the considered control of the objective functional and it is precisely characterized by the vanishing of an adjoint state on the set of all zeros of the corresponding state. The second one is a structural assumption on the sets of all points at which the values of the interested state are ‘close’ to the non-differentiability point of the max-function. We then derive a ‘no-gap’ theory of second-order optimality conditions in terms of a second-order generalized derivative of the cost functional, i.e. for which the only change between necessary and sufficient second-order optimality conditions are between a strict and non-strict inequality.},

First, by using the Dinkelbach-type method, we transform the fractional problem into a univariate nonlinear equation. To evaluate this equation, we need to solve a non-convex quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) problem. To solve this problem, we propose a new method. In the proposed method, first, by using relaxation and convexification of non-convex constraints of non-convex QCQP problem, an upper bound and a lower bound of the optimal value is obtained. By using these bounds, we construct a parametric QCQP problem with two constraints. Then, by solution of the new problem, the parameters of this problem are updated for the next iteration. We show that the sequence of solutions of new problems is convergent to a global optimal solution of the non-convex QCQP problem.

  abstract     = {Filled function methods have been considered as an effective approach for solving global optimization problems. However, most filled functions have the drawbacks of discontinuity, non-differentiability, and they could be sensitive to parameters and have exponential or logarithmic terms which may reduce their efficiency. In this paper, we propose a continuously differentiable filled function without parameters and exponential/logarithmic terms to overcome these problems. The continuous differentiability of the presented filled function makes its minimization an easy process and allows using efficient indirect local search methods. The proposed filled function has no parameters to adjust. Adjustment of the parameters is not an easy task, since the parameters may take different values for different problems. Moreover, the new filled function is numerically stable, since there are no exponential or logarithmic terms. Theoretical features of the considered filled function are investigated and a new algorithm for unconstrained global optimization problems is designed. The numerical results show that this method can successfully be used to solve global optimization problems, with a large number of variables. Furthermore, we extend the proposed filled function method to solve systems of nonlinear equations. Finally, some test problems for systems of nonlinear equations are reported, with satisfactory numerical results.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we introduce a self-adaptive subgradient extragradient method for finding a common element in the solution set of a pseudomonotone equilibrium problem and set of fixed points of a quasi- ϕ -nonexpansive mapping in 2-uniformly convex and uniformly smooth Banach spaces. The stepsize of the algorithm is selected self-adaptively which helps to prevent the necessity for prior estimates of the Lipschitz-like constants of the bifunction. A strong convergence result is proved under some mild conditions and some applications to Nash equilibrium problem and contact problem are presented to show the applicability of the result. Furthermore, some numerical examples are given to illustrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method by comparing with other related methods in the literature.},

We first use Heston&#39;s SV model to depict the financial market and two-dimensional Poisson process with common shock dependence to characterize the surplus process. We then introduce the past performance and use it to derive the wealth process depicted by the stochastic delay differential equation. Applying the stochastic control theory within the framework of the game theory, and stochastic control theory with delay, we derive an extended Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation with delay. By solving the equation, we obtain the equilibrium strategy and the corresponding equilibrium value function. We also provide a numerical example to analyze the effects of delay parameters and co-shocks parameters on equilibrium strategy and explain why such effects occur.},

  abstract     = {We propose a new duality scheme based on a sequence of smooth minorants of the weighted- ℓ 1 ℓ 1 ℓ1 penalty function, interpreted as a parametrized sequence of augmented Lagrangians, to solve non-convex constrained optimization problems. For the induced sequence of dual problems, we establish strong asymptotic duality properties. Namely, we show that (i) the sequence of dual problems is convex and (ii) the dual values monotonically increase to the optimal primal value. We use these properties to devise a subgradient based primal–dual method, and show that the generated primal sequence accumulates at a solution of the original problem. We illustrate the performance of the new method with three different types of test problems: A polynomial non-convex problem, large-scale instances of the celebrated kissing number problem, and the Markov–Dubins problem. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that, when compared with the traditional implementation of a well-known smooth solver, our new method (using the same well-known solver in its subproblem) can find better quality solutions, i.e. ‘deeper’ local minima, or solutions closer to the global minimum. Moreover, our method seems to be more time efficient, especially when the problem has a large number of constraints.},

In this paper, chance theory is used to analyse the hybrid uncertainty that combines random returns and uncertain returns. We regard the total return as an uncertain random variable and study the uncertain random portfolio optimization problem. We first define the skewness of an uncertain random variable and derive some important properties and explicit expressions with deterministic distributions. These theoretical results help transform the model into a deterministic form. Then, uncertain random mean–variance–skewness portfolio optimization models and their corresponding equivalents are established to meet the diverse needs of investors. Finally, we provide two numerical experiments to illustrate the applicability of the proposed model, one of which demonstrates that the model can be applied in the area of energy finance. It is shown that when uncertain asset returns are asymmetric, this model can be used to make investment decisions for investors. We also find that a higher return is accompanied by higher risk and higher skewness.},

This class of robust convex optimization problems includes the corresponding quadratically constrained convex quadratic optimization problems and separable convex polynomial optimization problems, and it employs a general bounded spectrahedron uncertainty set that covers the most commonly used uncertainty sets of numerically solvable robust optimization models, such as boxes, balls and ellipsoids. As special cases, it also demonstrates that explicit exact dual SDP and second-order cone programming (SOCP) in terms of original data hold for the robust two-stage convex quadratic programs with quadratic constraints and the robust two-stage separable convex quadratic programs under an ellipsoidal uncertainty set, respectively.

  abstract     = {A countermeasure against sediment depletion in rivers is sand replenishment. The cost-efficient sizing of its capacity is critical for sustainable environmental management. However, only temporally discrete replenishment is possible, and sediment transport is intermittent and uncertain. In this paper, we approach this new design problem using a robust ergodic control. First, a stochastic differential equation driven by a (tempered) stable subordinator describes the sediment storage dynamics. Sand replenishment is considered an impulse control, wherein observation/replenishment chances arrive at Poisson jump times. The subordinator is ambiguous since the decision-maker does not precisely know its Lévy measure. Using a dynamic risk measure that balances replenishment cost, disutility triggered by sediment depletion, and penalization of ambiguity, we derived the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman–Isaacs (HJBI) equation to determine the optimal storage capacity. We obtained that the HJBI equation has an analytical solution when a stable subordinator is used. Furthermore, we prove it admits a unique continuous viscosity solution and that it is optimal and applied the proposed model to real data.},

  abstract     = {We apply a class of stochastic differential equations to model individual growth in a randomly fluctuating environment using cattle weight data. We have used maximum likelihood theory to estimate the parameters. However, for cattle data, it is often not feasible to obtain animal&#39;s observations at equally spaced ages nor even at the same ages for different animals and there is typically a small number of observations at older ages. For these reasons, maximum likelihood estimates can be quite inaccurate, being interesting to consider in the likelihood function a weight function associated to the elapsed times between two consecutive observations of each animal, which results in the weighted maximum likelihood method. We compare the results obtained from both methods in several data structures and conclude that the weighted maximum likelihood improves the estimation when observations at older ages are scarce and the observation instants are unequally spaced, whereas the maximum likelihood estimates are recommended when animals are weighted at equally spaced ages. For unequally spaced observations, a bootstrap estimation method was also applied to correct the bias of the maximum likelihood estimates; it revealed to be a more precise alternative, except when the available data only has young animals.},

  abstract     = {The main goal of this work is to assess and compare the influence of Allee effects in profit optimization of stochastically fluctuating harvested populations considering several harvesting policies. The policies to compare are based on constant, variable, and stepwise harvesting efforts. For application purposes, the population growth models considered are the logistic model and a logistic-like model with weak Allee effects. In recent work, we have shown that the optimal harvesting policy with variable effort is inapplicable whereas the optimal harvesting policy with constant effort is easily applicable and leads to population sustainability. However, the latter implies profit losses, comparing to the first one. So, we consider a stepwise policy which is applicable but shares some of the problems with the optimal policy based on variable effort. We also show that some of the disadvantages of the optimal policy are eliminated by considering a penalized profit with an artificial running energy cost on the effort. However, the applicability problems remain. Finally, in terms of optimal profit, we study the influence of Allee effects on all policies and check whether Allee effects should or should not be taken into account when designing harvesting policies.},

Positive stabilization of such a system means feedback stabilization that preserves positivity of the system. It is shown that if a positive (linear or nonlinear) continuous-time system is positively reachable from the origin, then it is positively feedback stabilizable. On the other hand, such implication does not hold in general for systems on discrete time scales, even linear ones, though it holds for one-dimensional systems. These differences between continuous-time and discrete-time systems follow from different characterizations of positive reachability for these two classes of systems.},

Fleet composition, load, vehicle speed, road slope, and traffic are considered as factors affecting the produced pollution. Considering the NP-Hard complexity of this problem, an Improved Adaptive Large Neighbourhood Search (IALNS) algorithm is designed to treat the problem efficiently. The performance of the proposed algorithm is enhanced using the Taguchi design method. Finally, Adaptive Large Neighbourhood Search (ALNS) algorithm and Variable Neighbourhood Search (VNS) algorithm are considered as two well-known algorithms to test the efficiency of the IALNS algorithm using benchmark problems. Furthermore, a statistical test is conducted to efficiently provide the required comparisons for large-sized problems. It is revealed that the proposed IALNS has a superior performance and can appropriately tackle the problem.

We prove that the basic reproduction number is the threshold of local stability of a drug-free and endemic equilibrium. Then, we formulate an optimal control problem to minimize the total number of drug users and the cost associated with prevention education measures and treatment. We prove the existence of an optimal control and derive its characterization through Pontryagin&#39;s maximum principle. The resulting optimality system is solved numerically.

This research addresses the production planning of a sustainable hybrid production system including integrated manufacturing and remanufacturing processes within a closed-loop reverse logistics network with two-way substitution and Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) directive. One of the main options of our developed model is that a number of customers may switch from new products to remanufactured ones and vice versa. Moreover, a stochastic demand is met by purchasing manufactured and remanufactured products in primary and secondary markets, respectively. Six scenarios are considered based on the capacity of manufacturing and remanufacturing processes to develop a sustainable manufacturing/remanufacturing policy that would maximize the expected profit. Through sensitivity analyses, the impacts of the key parameters such as substitution rates, sales price, yield rate and production costs are investigated to provide useful managerial insights. Based on the obtained results, with the increase of substitution rates, the expected profit and the recycling rate increase. Furthermore, with the increase in production costs, the expected profit and the recycling rate decrease.},

The goal function is the mean value of final investor&#39;s capital. Making use of the stage-by-stage VaR constraints and a multivariate normal model for rates of return, the method of dynamic programming is applied. Due to peculiarities of this optimal control problem of the Markov chain with a set of absorbing states, an optimal investment policy turns out to be a relatively simple policy. More exactly, at each stage optimal portfolio depends only on the number of stage, but not on the value of current investor&#39;s capital. The initial problem is reduced to a sequence of one-stage portfolio optimization problems. Analysis of such one-stage problem is mainly based on known results, providing sufficient and necessary conditions for fulfilment of Slater&#39;s constraint qualification, as well as conditions for optimality. In addition, we extend the obtained results to a non-normality situation by use of elliptical distributions.},

Since there is not a ground truth for brain connectivity, the resulting model cannot be evaluated quantitatively. However, we should at least make sure that the best structure results for the used modelling approach and the data. Later, this result can be appreciated by further correlated literature of anatomy and physiology. Nearly all of the previously published studies rest on limited data, which brings doubt to the resulting structures. In theory, an immense number of samples is required, which is impossible to collect in practice. In this study, the appropriate number of data which makes a dDBN modelling trustable is searched by practical experiments and found to be O ( K p + 1 ) for binary and ternary-valued networks, where K is the cardinality of the random variables and p is the maximum number of parents possibly present in the network.

  abstract     = {In practical integer optimization applications, perturbations of multiple cost coefficients often occur simultaneously. One important example is the perturbation of the probability distribution estimates for scenarios of a stochastic integer optimization cost function formulation. This study aims to develop multiple cost coefficients sensitivity theorems, which indicate that the optimal solution remains the same if the perturbation amount of cost coefficients is greater than or equal to the derived bounds. We developed two sensitivity theorems. One depends on the underlying algorithm, the iterative dual method proposed by Bell and Shapiro , and the other directly uses the optimal integer output that can be obtained by any algorithms. We carried out numerical experiments using the two proposed theorems separately to compare their effectiveness and computational tractability. These theorems are useful especially when dealing with the problems where the cost coefficients change frequently.},

Inspired by this, we introduce a new approximate nondominated solution depending on a variable point substituting for a fixed point, which generalize the usual solutions. By proposing two types of separation bi-functionals, optimality characterizations in a unified way are concluded for various approximate nondominated solutions. Augmented dual cones and max scalarizing functional are proved to associate closely with some specific separation bi-functionals. Considering only weakly nondominated or nondominated minimizers, we also derive the Fermat rules based on the tools of variational analysis. Particularly, the important setting for variable ordering structures equipped with Bishop-Phelps cones are examined based on our theories.},

By using the linear-quadratic optimal control theory and the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, the closed-form expressions for the value function and optimal strategies are obtained under the special case of perfect correlation between the bond and stock processes. We present that the solution of the HJB equation is no longer a classical solution, but a viscosity solution due to the non-negativity constraint of the reinsurance strategy.

Theorems of strong convergence are analysed which are based on the incorporated Tikhonov regularization method for equilibrium problems. The first method is designed in the case where the Lipschitz-type constants of bifunction are known. While the second method can be implemented more easily without the prior knownledge of Lipschitz-type constants. The reason is that the second method have used a new stepsize rule whose computation is simple and easy to check at each step. Several numerical experiments are performed and they have demonstrated the effectiveness and the fast convergence of the new methods over existing methods.},

  abstract     = {Given a nonconvex minimization problem where the objective function is nonlinear and twice differentiable. To gain more information about the objective function, it is essential to obtain all its stationary points and study the behaviour of these points. Since many nonlinear functions are expressible as polynomials via interpolation, there is a need to devise fast and accurate algorithms in finding root(s) of the interpolating polynomial. Through interval computation, the Weierstrass-like parallel iterative methods are known for their efficiency in finding polynomial zeros. However, these schemes are highly dependent on the midpoints of each interval in generating successive intervals. In this study, we propose a scaling function on some Weierstrass-like parallel iterative methods such that the procedures are less dependent on the generated midpoints, hence allowing a more efficient search for the zeros while reducing the width of the intervals. The proposed procedures with the shifted centres of the enclosing intervals are tested on 120 problems and we compare their efficiency with the existing Weierstrass-like methods in terms of the number of iterations and largest final interval width. The results indicate that the proposed procedures outperform the original procedures, giving more reduction on the final interval width with a lesser number of iterations.},

In these game models, each player independently controls a continuous-time Markov chain, but players are coupled by the immediate cost functions. The transition rates and immediate cost functions are allowed to be unbounded. Each player wants to minimize certain expected average cost, but constraints are imposed on other expected average costs. By introducing the average occupation measures, we establish the one-to-one relationship of constrained Nash equilibria and the fixed points of certain multifunction defined on the product space of average occupation measures. Then, by using the fixed point theorem, we show the existence of constrained Nash equilibria. Finally, we show that each stationary Nash equilibrium corresponds to a global minimizer of a certain mathematical program.},

  abstract     = {A unified study of necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of intersection points and other important points in mathematical analysis is presented. The results are established in topologically based settings and shown to have equivalent formulations for various kinds of important points. For set-valued maps from a set to a topological space, instead of a convexity structure on this set, we use two general structures. The first structure is based on continuous single-valued maps from simpleces to the aforementioned set in order to extend the ideas of Knaster–Kuratowski–Mazurkiewicz and Fan for convex hulls. The second one is based on single-valued maps from the unit interval of the real line to the considered set and extends the classical connectedness properties. The general existence theorems of the above types are crucial tools in studies of the solution existence in optimization and other areas of applied mathematics. Here we choose minimax problems for applications of our general theorems. Our results are new, or improve or include as special cases many known results.},

This new QCR is based on the technique of simultaneous diagonalization which has become one of the hottest tools in the area of quadratic programming. We first demonstrate that the ‘best’ QCR can be achieved by solving a Shor relaxation of the original problem. Then, we design a branch-and-bound algorithm based on the proposed QCR for obtaining the global optimal solution. Numerical experiments with extended Celis–Dennis–Tapia problem and optimal spectrum sharing problem are conducted to show that our proposed QCR well balances the bound quality and computing efficiency, hence it is very competitive with two state-of-the-art QCRs when they are executed by the same branch-and-bound scheme.},

In this study, within the realm of financial markets, we configure liquidity as an independent stochastic process moderating the fluidity of all transactions and hence dynamically changing asset values. This study’s asset value process ignoring liquidity is modelled with a stochastic volatility jump-diffusion ( S V J ) model and that model is augmented with the incorporation of a liquidity process. The new model is called liquidity augmented stochastic volatility jump-diffusion ( L A S V J ) model. The simulation results suggest that L A S V J model outperforms the models without liquidity. The application of L A S V J model on the estimation of probabilities of default and credit risk spreads, using actual financial data of the selected companies listed in Dow Jones 30, reveals that neglecting the liquidity dimension in asset valuation might lead to inefficient assessments of risks. The models without an illiquidity process underestimate the probabilities of default and credit spread risks in comparison to the liquidity augmented model, L A S V J model, and we believe this might have accounted for the ignored risks that caused the 2007–2008 financial crisis in a great degree.},

We also introduce an adaptive variant of restarts which yields improved performance on global optimization problems. As Py-BOBYQA is a model-based trust-region method, we compare largely with other global optimization methods for which (global) models are important, such as Bayesian optimization and response surface methods; we also consider state-of-the-art representative deterministic and stochastic codes, such as DIRECT and CMA-ES. We find numerically that the restarts procedures in Py-BOBYQA are effective at helping it to escape local minima, when compared to using no restarts in Py-BOBYQA. Additionally, we find that Py-BOBYQA with adaptive restarts has comparable performance with global optimization solvers for all accuracy/budget regimes, in both smooth and noisy settings. In particular, Py-BOBYQA variants are best performing for smooth and multiplicative noise problems in high-accuracy regimes. As a by-product, some preliminary conclusions can be drawn on the relative performance of the global solvers we have tested with default settings.},

Thereby, from a practical point of view, most of all the so-called set approach is of interest. However, optimality conditions for these problems, for instance using directional derivatives, are still very limited. The key aspect for a useful directional derivative is the definition of a useful set difference for the evaluation of the numerator in the difference quotient. We present here a new set difference which avoids the use of a convex hull and which applies to arbitrary convex sets, and not to strictly convex sets only. The new set difference is based on the new concept of generalized Steiner sets. We introduce the Banach space of generalized Steiner sets as well as an embedding of convex sets in this space using Steiner points. In this Banach space we can easily define a difference and a directional derivative. We use the latter for new optimality conditions for set optimization. Numerical examples illustrate the new concepts.},

We propose efficient algorithms for both classes. For GEN we propose an enumerative algorithm that works in polynomial time as long as the number of regressors is O ( 1 ) . The proposed algorithm utilizes the special structure of arrangements of hyperplanes that occur in our problem and is superior to other known algorithms in this area.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we aim to build confidence regions of the true solution to the stochastic variational inequalities problem (SVIP) when the sample average approximation (SAA) scheme is implemented. A new approach based on error bound conditions admitted by the SVIP is proposed. This so-called error bound approach provides an upper bound of the distance between SAA solutions and the true solution set through the distance between the SAA function and the true counterpart at the SAA solutions. Certain statistical tools such as central limit theorem and Owen&#39;s empirical likelihood theorem are then employed to construct the asymptotic confidence regions of the solutions to SVIP. In particular, if the SVIP admits a global error bound condition, the non-asymptotic (uniform) confidence regions of the solutions are also approachable. Different from the conventional normal map approach, our error bound approach does not require any information regarding the derivative of the solution mapping with respect to perturbations of involved functions in SVIP. For constructing component-wise confidence regions, the validity of the error bound approach is guaranteed for those cases where the functions own separable structures.},

To address the problem, we propose a two-boundary graph pattern-based contraction algorithm for lossless max-flow acceleration (TBGMax). TBGMax can obtain accurate results by contracting two-boundary graphs of any size into edges, only involves connectivity information and does not need any extra information such as the edge capacity and local topology. TBGMax can accelerate even further by excluding irrelevant nodes. Random and real graphs-based simulations show that TBGMax can accelerate classic max-flow algorithm by up to 75.1 times in benchmark problem families and up to 22.3 times in real-world road networks, and at best only involve an average of 0.002\% of the nodes in a graph.},

Moreover, we prove that the proposed method is locally quadratically convergent without requiring strict complementarity conditions. Compared with existing smoothing Newton methods for solving the CCP, our method has three new features: (i) the generated iteration sequence is bounded; (ii) the value of the merit function converges to zero; (iii) the whole iteration sequence converges to an accumulation point if this point is isolated.

It is assumed that both the resolvents of two maximal monotone operators can be easily computed. This enables us to consider the case in which a solution to the problem cannot be computed easily. This paper introduces a new mapping, which satisfies the nonexpansivity property, from the individual resolvents of two maximal monotone operators and investigates some of its properties. In particular, we show that the mapping has a fixed point if and only if the problem has a solution. Then, using this mapping, we propose a splitting method for solving the problem in a real Hilbert space. In particular, we show that the sequences generated by the method converge strongly to the solution to the problem under certain assumptions. Convergence rate analysis of the methods is also provided to illustrate the method&#39;s efficiency. Finally, we apply the results to a class of optimization problems.},

The strong convergence of the proposed algorithm is established without the prior knowledge of the Lipschitz and strongly monotone constants of the mappings.

Demand comes from two types of patients: (1) emergency patients, who arise randomly and have to be admitted immediately, and (2) elective patients, whose admissions can be scheduled. The authors develop a Markov Decision Process (MDP) model that decides how many elective patients should be admitted each day, with the objective of optimally using both operating room and inpatient bed capacity. The authors demonstrate that the number of elective admissions scheduled each day is monotonically increasing in the state of the system and in the bed capacity, indicating that a higher level of waiting elective patients and available (or total) bed capacity pulls more elective admissions through the system. The total discounted expected cost of the system exhibits decreasing marginal returns as the capacity in each stage increases independently of other stages. Through numerical experiments, there is substantial value in making admission scheduling decisions by jointly considering inpatient beds and operating rooms.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we primary establish Hölder and Lipschitz continuity of solutions to abstract dynamical mixed equilibrium problems, DMEP for short, which we apply to obtain quantitative stability for parametric differential variational inclusions. Then, by involving key conditions on Fitzpatrick transform of equilibrium bifunctions introduced and studied in Chbani et al. [From convergence of dynamical equilibrium systems to bilevel hierarchical Ky Fan minimax inequalities and applications. J Minimax Theory Appl. 2019;4:231–270], we derive further quantitative stability for a parametric bilevel equilibrium problem which is regarded in our approach as a limit problem of the dynamic model DMEP. The obtained abstract result on bilevel equilibria is thereby applied to parametric mathematical programs with equilibrium constraints. A specific applied model illustrating the meaning of the involved parameters is also discussed with respect to optimal control problems whose state equation is defined by a variational inequality. We also report a numerical illustration to highlight the convergence and estimation rates we obtained and support our theoretical results.},

Accordingly, the lower level problem is expressed by a hemivariational inequality associated with a nonconvex nonsmooth locally Lipschitz superpotential.

This model finds its motivation in quasi-convex programming and generalized Nash equilibria modelled by the supremum of the so-called Nikaido–Isoda functions. We exploit a new recent variant of the celebrated Lim&#39;s Lemma considered in the context of metric regularity and approximate fixed points to establish quantitative stability for ε -approximate solutions to ( Q O p t ) under parametric perturbations in the spirit of the result presented for convex programming in the seminal contribution by Attouch and Wets [Quantitative stability of variational systems: III. ε -approximatesolutions. Math Program. 1993;61:197–214, Theorem 4.3]. Sharp estimates are then extended to parametric exact solutions to ( Q O p t ) by means of a qualitative stability analysis stressing the role of Painlevé-Kuratowski and Pompeiu-Hausdorff convergence for sets of approximate minima to a set of exact ones under usual compactness and/or completeness conditions. Finally, we apply our main result to a non-smooth mathematical program under polyhedral convex mappings and situate our contribution in the close recent literature.},

On the basis of Lyapunov&#39;s analysis and temporal scaling techniques, we show a convergence rate of the values of the order 1 / t 3 1 / t 3 1/t3 , and obtain the convergence of the trajectories towards optimal solutions. When f is strongly convex, an exponential rate of convergence is obtained. We complete the study of the continuous dynamic by introducing a damping term induced by the Hessian of f . This allows the oscillations to be controlled and attenuated. Then, we analyse the convergence of the proximal-based algorithms obtained by temporal discretization of this system, and obtain similar convergence rates. The algorithmic results are valid for a general convex, lower semicontinuous and proper function f : H → R ∪ { + ∞ } .},

We use as separating functionals the ones that are generated by the duality pairing [ x , p ] = p ( x ) = ⟨ x , a ⟩ + δ ‖ x ‖ [ x , p ] = p ( x ) = 〈 x , a 〉 + δ ‖ x ‖ [x,p]=p(x)=〈x,a〉+δ‖x‖ . We show that normlinear functions can be used to separate points from radiant or coradiant sets in X . Then we pass to separation defined by means of the pairing [ x , ⋅ ] [ x , ⋅ ] [x,⋅] , seen as a function defined on 𝒩 N N . Since in this case the evaluation functionals are linear, separation describes a special subclass of convex sets in N . We characterize X -convex sets by exploiting the isomorphism between N and the space Y = X ∗ × R . We also study polarity relations defined on N . Polar sets are X -convex. And we describe what further properties are needed in order to make a subset C ⊂ Y the polar, or the reverse polar, of some set in X . For polar sets C ⊂ Y , it is possible to deduce the unique closed, radiant prepolar set U ⊂ X . To conclude, we emphasize some connections between upward (downward) X -convex sets in Y and sets of upper (resp. lower) bounds in Y .},

In order to further improve the robustness of the model, chance constraints are employed to specify the lower bound of the probability that the distance from the projected samples to the projection of the other class centre is at least one. RPTSVM considers a pair of non-convex non-smooth problems with chance constraints. To solve these difficult problems, a newly designed method based on the difference of convex functions (DC) programs approach is presented. Extensive experiments on artificial datasets and benchmark datasets demonstrate the robustness and feasibility of our proposed RPTSVM.},

We consider two models: multivariate polynomial approximation and multivariate generalized rational approximation. In the second case, the approximations are ratios of linear forms and the basis functions are not limited to monomials. It is already known that in the case of multivariate polynomial approximation on a finite grid the corresponding optimization problems can be reduced to solving a linear programming problem, while the area of multivariate rational approximation is not so well understood. In this paper we demonstrate that in the case of multivariate generalized rational approximation the corresponding optimization problems are quasiconvex. This statement remains true even when the basis functions are not limited to monomials. Then we apply a bisection method, which is a general method for quasiconvex optimization. This method converges to an optimal solution with given precision. We demonstrate that the convex feasibility problems appearing in the bisection method can be solved using linear programming. Finally, we compare the deviation error and computational time for multivariate polynomial and generalized rational approximation with the same number of decision variables.},

In other words, an observer path is deemed optimal if it maximizes information so that the location of the target is estimated with smallest uncertainty, in some sense. We formulate this problem as an optimal control problem maximizing the determinant of the Fisher information matrix, which is one of the possible measures of information. We derive analytical results for optimality using the Maximum Principle. We carry out numerical experiments and discuss the multiple (locally) optimal solutions obtained. We verify graphically that the necessary conditions of optimality are verified by the numerical solutions. Finally we provide a comprehensive list of possible extensions for future work.},

  abstract     = {We propose a unifying general framework of quantitative primal and dual sufficient and necessary error bound conditions covering linear and nonlinear, local and global settings. The function is not assumed to possess any particular structure apart from the standard assumptions of lower semicontinuity in the case of sufficient conditions and (in some cases) convexity in the case of necessary conditions. We expose the roles of the assumptions involved in the error bound assertions, in particular, on the underlying space: general metric, normed, Banach or Asplund. Employing special collections of slope operators, we introduce a succinct form of sufficient error bound conditions, which allows one to combine in a single statement several different assertions: nonlocal and local primal space conditions in complete metric spaces, and subdifferential conditions in Banach and Asplund spaces.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we demonstrate that a well-known linear inequality method developed for rational Chebyshev approximation is equivalent to the application of the bisection method used in quasiconvex optimization. Although this correspondence is not surprising, it naturally connects rational and generalized rational Chebyshev approximation problems with modern developments in the area of quasiconvex functions and, therefore, offers more theoretical and computational tools for solving this problem. The second important contribution of this paper is the extension of the linear inequality method to a broader class of Chebyshev approximation problems, where the corresponding objective functions remain quasiconvex. In this broader class of functions, the inequalities are no longer required to be linear: it is enough for each inequality to define a convex set and the computational challenge is in solving the corresponding convex feasibility problems. Therefore, we propose a more systematic and general approach for treating Chebyshev approximation problems. In particular, we are looking at the problems where the approximations are quasilinear functions with respect to their parameters that are also the decision variables in the corresponding optimization problems.},

Following a robust optimization approach, data uncertainty is faced by handling set-valued inclusion problems. The employment of recent advances about error bounds and tangential approximations of the solution set to the latter enables one to achieve necessary conditions for weak efficiency via a penalization method as well as via the modern revisitation of the Euler–Lagrange method, with or without generalized convexity assumptions. The presented conditions are formulated in terms of various nonsmooth analysis constructions, expressing first-order approximations of mappings and sets, while the metric increase property plays the role of a constraint qualification.},

We solve this bi-criteria model by first converting it into a collection of weighted sum piecewise linear convex programs, and then analysing their optimality conditions. We not only provide explicit analytical formulas for all the efficient portfolios, but also explore as a whole the set of all the efficient portfolios and its structure such as dimensionality and distribution. We generalize the classical Two-fund Theorem by providing some collections of finitely many efficient portfolios to generate or estimate the set of all the efficient portfolios. We also notice that our efficient portfolios are almost the risk parity ones in the sense that the risks are allocated equally across the investments. Moreover, we illustrate the reliability of our model by carrying out Monte Carlo simulations to test the performance of some efficient portfolios versus inefficient ones.},

Mimicking the classical setting, an abstract convex function is the upper envelope of a family of abstract affine functions (being conventional vertical translations of the abstract linear functions). We establish new conditions for zero duality gap under no topological assumptions on the space of abstract linear functions. In particular, we prove that the zero duality gap property can be fully characterized in terms of an inclusion involving (abstract) ϵ -subdifferentials . This result is new even for the classical convex setting. Endowing the space of abstract linear functions with the topology of pointwise convergence, we extend several fundamental facts of functional/convex analysis. This includes (i) the classical Banach–Alaoglu–Bourbaki theorem (ii) the subdifferential sum rule, and (iii) a constraint qualification for zero duality gap which extends a fact established by Borwein, Burachik and Yao (2014) for the conventional convex case. As an application, we show with a specific example how our results can be exploited to show zero duality for a family of non-convex, non-differentiable problems.},

We also apply our result for various iterative methods in variational inequality problem. For the Lipschitz continuous mappings, we deal with the extragradient method of Korpelevič, the subgradient extragradient method of Censor et al. and the extragradient of Tseng where the step size rule is priorly or posteriorly chosen. For the non-Lipschitz continuous mappings, we use our results to deduce the convergence results of Shehu and Iyiola and of Thong and Gibali. Our approach allows us to conclude many new results with some new assumptions.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study a green product dual-channel supply chain with a manufacturer and a retailer. The service free-riding is considered, and the channel price difference is also introduced as a strategic tool to adjust the channel conflict. In centralized and decentralized models, we give the optimal decisions of the supply chain members and analyse the effects of the service free-riding and the price difference on the related decisions. In order to coordinate the dual-channel green supply chain, we also design a two-part tariff contract coordination model, which allows both the manufacturer and the retailer to obtain a win–win result. From the analytical and numerical results, we find that the proper service free-riding degree and price difference are beneficial to the decision makers and the greening of supply chain. And in the centralized model, when the degree of service free-riding is small, the increase of the channel price difference can stimulate the manufacturer to provide the lower price product with lower service and green degree, otherwise, it is the opposite. Besides, the result also shows that, except for consumers, the centralized model always performs better than the decentralized model in the profit and social welfare aspects.},

We prove that the proposed method converges strongly to a solution to the aforementioned problem under the assumption that the associated singlevalued operator for the monotone variational inclusion problem is monotone and Lipschitz continuous. Our method uses a stepsize that is generated at each iteration by some simple computations, which allows it to be easily implemented without the prior knowledge of the Lipschitz constant of the singlevalued operator. Moreover, we discuss some consequences of our results and apply them to solve the split linear inverse problems, for which we also considered a special case of the split linear inverse problem, namely, the LASSO problem. We also give some numerical illustrations of the proposed method in comparison with other method in the literature to further demonstrate the applicability and efficiency of our method.},

Existence, uniqueness and convergence results for this problem have already been obtained in the literature.  In this current paper we complete these results by proving the well-posedness of the problem, in the sense of Tykhonov. To this end we introduce a family of approximating problems for which we state and prove various equivalence and convergence results. We illustrate these abstract results in the study of a frictionless contact model with elastic materials. The process is assumed to be static and the contact is with unilateral constraints. We derive a weak formulation of the model which is in the form of a mixed variational problem with unknowns being the displacement field and the Lagrange multiplier. Then, we prove various results on the corresponding mixed problem, including its well-posedness in the sense of Tykhonov, under various assumptions on the data. Finally, we provide mechanical interpretation of our results.},

In this work, we extend this method for solving variational inequality problems with pseudo-monotone and Lipschitz continuous mappings in real Hilbert spaces. The first algorithm provides the strong convergence without using the viscosity technique, as well as the monotonicity of the associated mapping. The advantage of the second algorithm is that it does not require the knowledge of the Lipschitz constants of the variational inequality mappings.

The proposed approach splits a large block of trade into smaller packages to minimize the execution cost of the trade. In this study, we suggest an incipient price dynamics for the asset where we express its current market price as a convex combination of the price impervious to our anterior trade in the asset and the execution price carrying the impact of our anterior trade in it. We propose to apply the regression techniques to estimate the unaffected price of the asset. The formulated model is a convex quadratic optimization problem and thus computationally tractable. We evaluate the performance of the proposed model on five stocks namely, Apple, Microsoft, Coca-Cola, Amazon, and Netflix and conclude that the proposed model consistently achieves a lower execution cost than the one obtained from some other models existing in the literature.},

  abstract     = {The so-called ℓ 0 ℓ 0 ℓ0 pseudonorm on ℝ d R d Rd counts the number of nonzero components of a vector. For exact sparse optimization problems – with the ℓ 0 ℓ 0 ℓ0 pseudonorm standing either as criterion or in the constraints – the Fenchel conjugacy fails to provide relevant analysis. In this paper, we display a class of conjugacies that are suitable for the ℓ 0 ℓ 0 ℓ0 pseudonorm. For this purpose, we suppose given a (source) norm on ℝ d R d Rd . With this norm, we define, on the one hand, a sequence of so-called coordinate- k norms and, on the other hand, a coupling between R d and itself, called Capra (constant along primal rays). Then, we provide formulas for the Capra-conjugate and biconjugate, and for the Capra subdifferentials, of functions of the ℓ 0 pseudonorm, in terms of the coordinate- k norms. As an application, we provide a new family of lower bounds for the ℓ 0 pseudonorm, as a fraction between two norms, the denominator being any norm.},

This work provides a complete description of the efficient solution set, when the objective functions are defined on the real line. This is motivated, besides theoretical aspects, also by a numerical point of view, since most algorithms in scalar minimization involve the solvability of a one-dimensional optimization problem to find the next iterate. It is expected that the same situation occurs in the multiobjective optimization problem. We first consider the case when all the objective functions are semistrictly quasiconvex, and afterwards we consider the same problem under quasiconvexity along with some additional assumptions. The latter allows us to deal with the general bicriteria optimization problem under quasiconvexity. Several examples showing the applicability of our results are presented, and an algorithm is proposed to compute the whole efficient solution set.},

Without restrictions on the variance of the errors, we assume that these approximations are available within a sufficiently large, but fixed, probability and we extend, in the spirit of Cartis and Scheinberg [Global convergence rate analysis of unconstrained optimization methods based on probabilistic models.

The notion of asymptotic cone is one the main concept used to introduce the class of problems considered as well as to establish the well definition of the algorithm. This class of optimization problems, with closed and convex constraint set, are characterized by two conditions on the gradient of the objective function. The first one establishes that the gradient of the objective function is Lipschitz continuous, which is quite usual in the analysis of this algorithm. The second one, which is new in this subject, establishes that the gradient belongs to the interior of dual asymptotic cone of the constraint set. Classical results on asymptotic behaviour and iteration complexity bounds for the sequence generated by Frank–Wolfe algorithm are extended to this new class of problems. Some examples of problems with non-compact constraints and objective functions satisfying the aforementioned conditions are provided.},

The convergence analysis is carried out when the objective function is the sum of two convex functions where one of them is assumed to be continuously differentiable. The proposed splitting method exhibits full convergence to a weakly efficient solution without assuming the Lipschitz continuity of the Jacobian of the differentiable component. To carry this analysis, the popular Beck–Teboulle&#39;s line-search procedure is extended to the vectorial setting under mild assumptions. It is also shown that the proposed scheme obtains an ϵ -approximate solution to the vector optimization problem in at most O ( 1 / ε ) iterations.},

  abstract     = {Quasi-equilibrium problems (QEPs) allow a change of the feasible region together with the considered point, in contrast to standard equilibrium problems (EPs). In this work, we extend the Newton-type method for EPs considered by Santos et al. to the setting of QEPs. We prove locally the convergence of the method and we establish the superlinear/quadratic convergence of the algorithm to a solution of the problem under suitable assumptions. Applications to generalized Nash equilibrium problems (GNEPs) are considered. Some preliminary numerical results are reported showing the performance of the algorithm.},
