  abstract     = {In this article, we propose and implement a distributed autonomic manager that maintains service level agreements (SLA) for each application scenario. The proposed autonomic manager supports SLAs by configuring the bandwidth ratios for each application scenario and uses an overlay network as an infrastructure. The most important aspect of the proposed autonomic manager is its scalability which allows us to deal with geographically distributed cloud-based applications and a large volume of computation. This can be useful in look ahead optimization and in adaptations using complex models, such as machine learning. We formally prove the safety and liveness properties of the implemented distributed algorithms. Through experiments on the Amazon AWS cloud, using two different use cases, we demonstrate the elasticity and flexibility of the autonomic manager as a measure of its applicability to different cloud applications with different types of workloads. Experiments also demonstrate that increasing the size of a look ahead window, up to a certain size, improves the accuracy of the adaptation decisions by up to 50\%.},

  abstract     = {Many self-adaptive systems benefit from human involvement and oversight, where a human operator can provide expertise not available to the system and detect problems that the system is unaware of. One way of achieving this synergy is by placing the human operator on the loop —i.e., providing supervisory oversight and intervening in the case of questionable adaptation decisions. To make such interaction effective, an explanation can play an important role in allowing the human operator to understand why the system is making certain decisions and improve the level of knowledge that the operator has about the system. This, in turn, may improve the operator’s capability to intervene and, if necessary, override the decisions being made by the system. However, explanations may incur costs, in terms of delay in actions and the possibility that a human may make a bad judgment. Hence, it is not always obvious whether an explanation will improve overall utility and, if so, then what kind of explanation should be provided to the operator. In this work, we define a formal framework for reasoning about explanations of adaptive system behaviors and the conditions under which they are warranted. Specifically, we characterize explanations in terms of explanation content , effect , and cost . We then present a dynamic system adaptation approach that leverages a probabilistic reasoning technique to determine when an explanation should be used to improve overall system utility. We evaluate our explanation framework in the context of a realistic industrial control system with adaptive behaviors.},

There is active research on OMOkC, particularly in the design of decentralised algorithms for solving it. We propose a new take on the issue: Rather than classically developing new algorithms, we apply a macro-level paradigm, called aggregate computing , specifically designed to directly program the global behaviour of a whole ensemble of devices at once. To understand the potential of the application of aggregate computing to OMOkC, we extend the Alchemist simulator (supporting aggregate computing natively) with a novel toolchain component supporting the simulation of mobile robots. This way, we build a software engineering toolchain comprising language and simulation tooling for addressing OMOkC. Finally, we exercise our approach and related toolchain by introducing new algorithms for OMOkC; we show that they can be expressed concisely, reuse existing software components and perform better than the current state-of-the-art in terms of coverage over time and number of objects covered overall.},

We consider a setting where not only the member agents are adaptive but also the multi-agent system viewed as an entity in its own right is adaptive. Specifically, the social structure of a multi-agent system can be reflected in the social norms among its members. It is well recognized that the norms that arise in society are not always beneficial to its members. We focus on prosocial norms, which help achieve positive outcomes for society and often provide guidance to agents to act in a manner that takes into account the welfare of others. Specifically, we propose Cha, a framework for the emergence of prosocial norms. Unlike previous norm emergence approaches, Cha supports continual change to a system (agents may enter and leave) and dynamism (norms may change when the environment changes). Importantly, Cha agents incorporate prosocial decision-making based on inequity aversion theory, reflecting an intuition of guilt arising from being antisocial. In this manner, Cha brings together two important themes in prosociality: decision-making by individuals and fairness of system-level outcomes. We demonstrate via simulation that Cha can improve aggregate societal gains and fairness of outcomes.},

Our approach is to deploy dynamic cloud-based virtual machine proxies for physical IoT devices. Our architecture leverages virtual machine proxies with diverse software configurations to mitigate vulnerable and static software configurations on physical devices. We develop an algorithm for selecting new configurations based on network anomaly detection signals to learn vulnerable software configurations on IoT devices, automatically shifting towards more secure configurations. Cloud-based proxy machines mediate requests between application clients and vulnerable IoT devices, facilitating a dynamic diversification system. We report on simulation experiments to evaluate the dynamic system. Two models of powerful adversaries are introduced and simulated against the diversified defense strategy. Our experiments show that a dynamically diversified IoT architecture can be invulnerable to large classes of attacks that would succeed against a static architecture.},

  abstract     = {Many software systems today face uncertain operating conditions, such as sudden changes in the availability of resources or unexpected user behavior. Without proper mitigation these uncertainties can jeopardize the system goals. Self-adaptation is a common approach to tackle such uncertainties. When the system goals may be compromised, the self-adaptive system has to select the best adaptation option to reconfigure by analyzing the possible adaptation options, i.e., the adaptation space. Yet, analyzing large adaptation spaces using rigorous methods can be resource- and time-consuming, or even be infeasible. One approach to tackle this problem is by using online machine learning to reduce adaptation spaces. However, existing approaches require domain expertise to perform feature engineering to define the learner and support online adaptation space reduction only for specific goals. To tackle these limitations, we present “Deep Learning for Adaptation Space Reduction Plus”—DLASeR+ for short. DLASeR+ offers an extendable learning framework for online adaptation space reduction that does not require feature engineering, while supporting three common types of adaptation goals: threshold, optimization, and set-point goals. We evaluate DLASeR+ on two instances of an Internet-of-Things application with increasing sizes of adaptation spaces for different combinations of adaptation goals. We compare DLASeR+ with a baseline that applies exhaustive analysis and two state-of-the-art approaches for adaptation space reduction that rely on learning. Results show that DLASeR+ is effective with a negligible effect on the realization of the adaptation goals compared to an exhaustive analysis approach and supports three common types of adaptation goals beyond the state-of-the-art approaches.},

  abstract     = {In Dynamic Service Composition (DSC), an application can be dynamically composed using web services to achieve its functional and Quality of Services (QoS) goals. DSC is a relatively mature area of research that crosscuts autonomous and services computing. Complex autonomous and self-adaptive computing paradigms (e.g., multi-tenant cloud services, mobile/smart services, services discovery and composition in intelligent environments such as smart cities) have been leveraging DSC to dynamically and adaptively maintain the desired QoS, cost and to stabilize long-lived software systems. While DSC is fundamentally known to be an NP-hard problem, systematic attempts to analyze its scalability have been limited, if not absent, though such analysis is of a paramount importance for their effective, efficient, and stable operations. This article reports on a new application of goal-modeling, providing a systematic technique that can support DSC designers and architects in identifying DSC-relevant characteristics and metrics that can potentially affect the scalability goals of a system. The article then applies the technique to two different approaches for QoS-aware dynamic services composition, where the article describes two detailed exemplars that exemplify its application. The exemplars hope to provide researchers and practitioners with guidance and transferable knowledge in situations where the scalability analysis may not be straightforward. The contributions provide architects and designers for QoS-aware dynamic service composition with the fundamentals for assessing the scalability of their own solutions, along with goal models and a list of application domain characteristics and metrics that might be relevant to other solutions. Our experience has shown that the technique was able to identify in both exemplars application domain characteristics and metrics that had been overlooked in previous scalability analyses of these DSC, some of which indeed limited their scalability. It has also shown that the experiences and knowledge can be transferable: The first exemplar was used as an example to inform and ease the work of applying the technique in the second one, reducing the time to create the model, even for a non-expert.},

  abstract     = {Existing studies on the multirobot foraging problem often assume safe settings, in which nothing in an environment hinders the robots’ tasks. In many real-world applications, robots have to collect objects from hazardous environments like earthquake rescue, where possible risks exist, with possibilities of destroying robots. At this stage, there are no targeted algorithms for foraging robots in hazardous environments, which can lead to damage to the robot itself and reduce the final foraging efficiency. A motivating example is a rescue scenario, in which the lack of a suitable solution results in many victims not being rescued after all available robots have been destroyed. Foraging robots face a dilemma after some robots have been destroyed: whether to take over tasks of the destroyed robots or continue executing their remaining foraging tasks. The challenges that arise when attempting such a balance are twofold: (1) the loss of robots adds new constraints to traditional problems, complicating the structure of the solution space, and (2) the task allocation strategy in a multirobot team affects the final expected utility, thereby increasing the dimension of the solution space. In this study, we address these challenges in two fundamental environmental settings: homogeneous and heterogeneous cases. For the former case, a decomposition and grafting mechanism is adopted to split this problem into two weakly coupled problems: the foraging task execution problem and the foraging task allocation problem. We propose an exact foraging task allocation algorithm, and graft it to another exact foraging task execution algorithm to find an optimal solution within the polynomial time. For the latter case, it is proven \( \mathcal {NP} \)-hard to find an optimal solution in polynomial time. The decomposition and grafting mechanism is also adopted here, and our proposed greedy risk-aware foraging algorithm is grafted to our proposed hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithm to find high-utility solutions with low computational overhead. Finally, these algorithms are extensively evaluated through simulations, demonstrating that compared with various benchmarks, they can significantly increase the utility of objects returned by robots before all the robots have been stopped.},

In addition, the article utilizes clustering to group subjects, thereby enabling the system to focus on the areas that are more densely populated. Moreover, it proposes a dynamic mechanism for controlling the pre-recording time spent on running the solution. Furthermore, it develops a parallel algorithm, allowing the most time-consuming phases to be parallelized, and thus run efficiently by the centralized parallel processing subsystem.

No existing work investigates the following question: How can we reason about the trade-off between predicted benefits and cost of pursuing microservice granularity adaptation under uncertainty? To address this question, we provide a novel formulation of the decision problem to pursue granularity adaptation as a real options problem. We propose a novel evaluation process for dynamically evaluating granularity adaptation design decisions under uncertainty. Our process is based on a novel combination of real options and the concept of Bayesian surprises. We show the benefits of our evaluation process by comparing it to four representative industrial microservice runtime monitoring tools, which can be used for retrospective evaluation for granularity adaptation decisions. Our comparison shows that our process can supersede and/or complement these tools. We implement a microservice application—Filmflix—using Amazon Web Service Lambda and use this implementation as a case study to show the unique benefit of our process compared to traditional application of real options analysis.},

  abstract     = {In a multi-robot operation, multi-tasking resources are expected to simultaneously perform multiple tasks, thus, reducing the overall time/energy requirement of the operation. This paper presents a task allocation framework named Rostam that efficiently utilizes multi-tasking capable robots. Rostam uses a task clustering mechanism to form robot specific task maps. The customized maps identify tasks that can be multi-tasked by individual robots and mark them for simultaneous execution. The framework then uses an Evolutionary Algorithm along with the customized maps to make quality task allocations. The most prominent contribution of this work is Rostam&#39;s flexible design which enables it to handle a range of task allocation scenarios seamlessly. Rostam&#39;s performance is evaluated against an auction-based scheme; the results demonstrate its effective use of multi-tasking robots. The paper also demonstrates Rostam&#39;s flexibility towards a number of MRTA scenarios through a case study.},

  abstract     = {The concept of conventions has attracted much attention in the multi-agent system research. In this article, we study the emergence of conventions from repeated n -player coordination games. Distributed agents learn their policies independently and are capable of observing their neighbours in a network topology. We distinguish two types of information representation about the observations: gist trace and verbatim trace. We conjecture that learning based on the gist trace, which overlooks the details and focuses only on the general choice of action of a neighbourhood, should achieve efficient convention emergence. To this end, a novel learning method that makes use of the gist trace is proposed. The experimental results confirm that the proposed method establishes conventions much faster than the state-of-the-art learning methods across diverse settings of multi-agent systems. In particular, the use of gist trace derived at a low level of abstraction further improves the efficiency of convention emergence.},

  abstract     = {In contingent planning under partial observability with sensing actions, agents actively use sensing to discover meaningful facts about the world. Recent successful approaches translate the partially observable contingent problem into a non-deterministic fully observable problem, and then use a planner for non-deterministic planning. However, the translation may become very large, encumbering the task of the non-deterministic planner. We suggest a different approach—using an online contingent solver repeatedly to construct a plan tree. We execute the plan returned by the online solver until the next observation action, and then branch on the possible observed values, and replan for every branch independently. In many cases a plan tree can have an exponential width in the number of state variables, but the tree may have a structure that allows us to compactly represent it using a directed graph. We suggest a mechanism for tailoring such a graph that reduces both the computational effort and the storage space. Our method also handles non-deterministic domains, by identifying cycles in the plans. We present a set of experiments, showing our approach to scale better than state-of-the-art offline planners.},
