  abstract     = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is impacting the world’s connectivity landscape. More and more IoT devices are connected, bringing many benefits to our daily lives. However, the influx of IoT devices poses non-trivial challenges for the existing cloud-based computing paradigm. In the cloud-based architecture, a large amount of IoT data is transferred to the cloud for data management, analysis, and decision making. It could not only cause a heavy workload on the cloud but also result in unacceptable network latency, ultimately undermining the benefits of cloud-based computing. To address these challenges, researchers are looking for new computing models for the IoT. Edge computing, a new decentralized computing model, is valued by more and more researchers in academia and industry. The main idea of edge computing is placing data processing in near-edge devices instead of remote cloud servers. It is promising to build more scalable, low-latency IoT systems. Many studies have been proposed on edge computing and IoT, but a comprehensive survey of this crossover area is still lacking. In this survey, we first introduce the impact of edge computing on the development of IoT and point out why edge computing is more suitable for IoT than other computing paradigms. Then, we analyze the necessity of systematical investigation on the edge-computing-driven IoT (ECDriven-IoT) and summarize new challenges occurring in ECDriven-IoT. We categorize recent advances from bottom to top, covering six aspects of ECDriven-IoT. Finally, we conclude lessons learned and propose some challenging},

AUC maximization refers to a learning paradigm that learns a predictive model by directly maximizing its AUC score. It has been studied for more than two decades dating back to late 90s, and a huge amount of work has been devoted to AUC maximization since then. Recently, stochastic AUC maximization for big data and deep AUC maximization (DAM) for deep learning have received increasing attention and yielded dramatic impact for solving real-world problems. However, to the best our knowledge, there is no comprehensive survey of related works for AUC maximization. This article aims to address the gap by reviewing the literature in the past two decades. We not only give a holistic view of the literature but also present detailed explanations and comparisons of different papers from formulations to algorithms and theoretical guarantees. We also identify and discuss remaining and emerging issues for DAM and provide suggestions on topics for future work.},

This survey focuses particularly on studies that adopt high-performance computing techniques to design, implement, and experiment trajectory-based metaheuristics, which pose a great challenge to high-performance computing and represent a large gap in the operations research literature. We outline the contributions from 1987 to the present, and the result is a complete overview of the current state-of-the-art with respect to multi-core and distributed trajectory-based metaheuristics. Basic notions of high-performance computing are introduced, and different taxonomies for multi-core and distributed architectures and metaheuristics are reviewed.

We introduce the Framework for Evaluating Recommender systems (FEVR), which we derive from the discourse on recommender systems evaluation. In FEVR, we categorize the evaluation space of recommender systems evaluation. We postulate that the comprehensive evaluation of a recommender system frequently requires considering multiple facets and perspectives in the evaluation. The FEVR framework provides a structured foundation to adopt adequate evaluation configurations that encompass this required multi-facetedness and provides the basis to advance in the field.

This paper aims to present a comprehensive survey of the relevant research and technological developments in honeyword-based authentication techniques.

The survey begins with a discussion of FCA, its hierarchical advantages, several advanced models of FCA, and lattice management strategies. It then examines how FCA has been used in bioinformatics applications, followed by future prospects of FCA in those areas. The applications addressed include gene data analysis (with next-generation sequencing), biomarkers discovery, protein-protein interaction, disease analysis (including COVID-19, cancer, and others), drug design and development, healthcare informatics, biomedical ontologies, and phylogeny. Some of the most promising prospects of FCA are identifying influential nodes in a network representing protein-protein interactions, determining critical concepts to discover biomarkers, integrating machine learning and deep learning for cancer classification, and pattern matching for next-generation sequencing.},

Since these devices are not under the control of the electoral authority and could be potentially compromised, this setting is referred to as an “uncontrolled environment” for which special security assumptions have to be considered. This paper employs general election principles to derive cryptographic, technical, and organizational requirements for remote electronic voting. Based on these requirements, we have extended an existing methodology to assess online voting schemes and develop a corresponding reference attacker model to support the preparation of tailored protection profiles for different levels of elections. After presenting a broad survey of different voting schemes, we use this methodology to assess and classify those schemes comparatively by leveraging four election-specific attacker models.},

In the last few decades, our understanding of quantum computers has expanded and multiple efforts have been made to create languages, libraries, tools, and environments to facilitate their programming. Nonetheless, quantum computers are complex systems at the bottom of a stack of layers that programmers need to understand. Hence, efforts towards creating quantum programming languages and computing environments that can abstract low-level technology details have become crucial steps to achieve a useful quantum computing technology. However, most of these environments still lack many of the features that would be desirable, such as those outlined in The Talavera Manifesto for Quantum Software Engineering and Programming. For advancing quantum computing, we will need to develop quantum software engineering techniques and tools to ensure the feasibility of this new type of quantum software. To contribute to this goal, this paper provides a review of the main quantum software components and platforms.

Many papers have been published on adversarial attacks and their countermeasures in the realm of deep learning.

Meanwhile, given the dynamics in both users’ privacy needs and OSN context, a comprehensive understanding of OSN image privacy throughout the entire sharing process is preferable to any views from a single side, dimension, or level. To fill this gap, we contribute a survey of “privacy intelligence” that targets modern privacy issues in dynamic OSN image sharing from a user-centric perspective. Specifically, we present the important properties and a taxonomy of OSN image privacy, along with a high-level privacy analysis framework based on the lifecycle of OSN image sharing. The framework consists of three stages with different principles of privacy by design. At each stage, we identify typical user behaviors in OSN image sharing and their associated privacy issues. Then a systematic review of representative intelligent solutions to those privacy issues is conducted, also in a stage-based manner. The analysis results in an intelligent “privacy firewall” for closed-loop privacy management. Challenges and future directions in this area are also discussed.},

We show that, driven by the aim of preserving the accuracy of the learned models, DP-based ML implementations are so loose that they do not offer the ex ante privacy guarantees of DP. Instead, what they deliver is basically noise addition similar to the traditional (and often criticized) statistical disclosure control approach. Due to the lack of formal privacy guarantees, the actual level of privacy offered must be experimentally assessed ex post , which is done very seldom. In this respect, we present empirical results showing that standard anti-overfitting techniques in ML can achieve a better utility/privacy/efficiency tradeoff than DP.},

Deep learning provides a diverse selection of architectures to model sentiment analysis tasks and has surpassed other machine learning methods as the foremast approach for performing sentiment analysis tasks. Recent developments in deep learning architectures represent a shift away from Recurrent and Convolutional neural networks and the increasing adoption of Transformer language models. Utilising pre-trained Transformer language models to transfer knowledge to downstream tasks has been a breakthrough in NLP. This survey applies a task-oriented taxonomy to recent trends in architectures with a focus on the theory, design and implementation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the only survey to cover state-of-the-art Transformer-based language models and their performance on the most widely used benchmark datasets.

However, there is a missing connection between ongoing ML research and well-established safety principles. In this article, we present a structured and comprehensive review of ML techniques to improve the dependability of ML algorithms in uncontrolled open-world settings. From this review, we propose the Taxonomy of ML Safety that maps state-of-the-art ML techniques to key engineering safety strategies. Our taxonomy of ML safety presents a safety-oriented categorization of ML techniques to provide guidance for improving dependability of the ML design and development.

Recently, with the advent of neural architectures, significant research efforts have been made to advance automatic text summarization systems, and numerous studies on the challenges of extending these systems to the long document domain have emerged. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of the research on long document summarization and a systematic evaluation across the three principal components of its research setting: benchmark datasets, summarization models, and evaluation metrics. For each component, we organize the literature within the context of long document summarization and conduct an empirical analysis to broaden the perspective on current research progress. The empirical analysis includes a study on the intrinsic characteristics of benchmark datasets, a multi-dimensional analysis of summarization models, and a review of the summarization evaluation metrics.

Numerous research efforts have been devoted to developing effective approaches to defend against Android malware. However, given the explosive growth of Android malware and the continuous advancement of malicious evasion technologies like obfuscation and reflection, Android malware defense approaches based on manual rules or traditional machine learning may not be effective. In recent years, a dominant research field called deep learning (DL), which provides a powerful feature abstraction ability, has demonstrated a compelling and promising performance in a variety of areas, like natural language processing and computer vision. To this end, employing DL techniques to thwart Android malware attacks has recently garnered considerable research attention. Yet, no systematic literature review focusing on DL approaches for Android malware defenses exists. In this article, we conducted a systematic literature review to search and analyze how DL approaches have been applied in the context of malware defenses in the Android environment. As a result, a total of 132 studies covering the period 2014–2021 were identified. Our investigation reveals that, while the majority of these sources mainly consider DL-based Android malware detection, 53 primary studies (40.1\%) design defense approaches based on other scenarios. This review also discusses research trends, research focuses, challenges, and future research directions in DL-based Android malware defenses.},

Despite being highly configurable, the default Kubernetes scheduler cannot fully meet the requirements of emerging applications, such as machine/deep learning workloads and edge computing applications. This has led to different proposals of custom Kubernetes schedulers that focus on addressing the requirements of the aforementioned applications. Since the related literature is growing in this area, we aimed, in this survey, to provide a classification of the related literature based on multiple criteria, including scheduling objectives as well as the types of considered workloads and environments. Additionally, we provide an overview of the main approaches that have been adopted to achieve each objective.

This fact has driven researchers to integrate dynamic elements into fuzzy theory and proposed dynamic fuzzy sets and dynamic fuzzy logic. Based on these pioneering theoretical works and various theories for uncertain datasets, an innovative machine learning paradigm that is referred to as dynamic fuzzy machine learning (DFML) was proposed in the early 2000s. DFML extends existing fuzzy machine learning paradigms to deal with dynamic fuzzy problems in machine learning activities. This article provides an insightful overview of DFML by surveying the field from basics to advances in five aspects: (1) the theoretical basics; (2) the system and the learning model; (3) typical DFML methods and categorization of the methods; (4) the open challenges; and (5) the research frontiers.

  abstract     = {Data augmentation, the artificial creation of training data for machine learning by transformations, is a widely studied research field across machine learning disciplines. While it is useful for increasing a model&#39;s generalization capabilities, it can also address many other challenges and problems, from overcoming a limited amount of training data to regularizing the objective, to limiting the amount of data used to protect privacy. Based on a precise description of the goals and applications of data augmentation and a taxonomy for existing works, this survey is concerned with data augmentation methods for textual classification and aims at providing a concise and comprehensive overview for researchers and practitioners. Derived from the taxonomy, we divide more than 100 methods into 12 different groupings and give state-of-the-art references expounding which methods are highly promising by relating them to each other. Finally, research perspectives that may constitute a building block for future work are provided.},

  abstract     = {Recommender systems (RSs) have become an inseparable part of our everyday lives. They help us find our favorite items to purchase, our friends on social networks, and our favorite movies to watch. Traditionally, the recommendation problem was considered to be a classification or prediction problem, but it is now widely agreed that formulating it as a sequential decision problem can better reflect the user-system interaction. Therefore, it can be formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP) and be solved by reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. Unlike traditional recommendation methods, including collaborative filtering and content-based filtering, RL is able to handle the sequential, dynamic user-system interaction and to take into account the long-term user engagement. Although the idea of using RL for recommendation is not new and has been around for about two decades, it was not very practical, mainly because of scalability problems of traditional RL algorithms. However, a new trend has emerged in the field since the introduction of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) , which made it possible to apply RL to the recommendation problem with large state and action spaces. In this paper, a survey on reinforcement learning based recommender systems (RLRSs) is presented. Our aim is to present an outlook on the field and to provide the reader with a fairly complete knowledge of key concepts of the field. We first recognize and illustrate that RLRSs can be generally classified into RL- and DRL-based methods. Then, we propose an RLRS framework with four components, i.e., state representation, policy optimization, reward formulation, and environment building, and survey RLRS algorithms accordingly. We highlight emerging topics and depict important trends using various graphs and tables. Finally, we discuss important aspects and challenges that can be addressed in the future.},

  abstract     = {Machine learning components are essential for today’s software systems, causing a need to adapt traditional software engineering practices when developing machine-learning-based systems. This need is pronounced due to many development-related challenges of machine learning components such as asset, experiment, and dependency management. Recently, many asset management tools addressing these challenges have become available. It is essential to understand the support such tools offer to facilitate research and practice on building new management tools with native supports for machine learning and software engineering assets. This article positions machine learning asset management as a discipline that provides improved methods and tools for performing operations on machine learning assets. We present a feature-based survey of 18 state-of-practice and 12 state-of-research tools supporting machine-learning asset management. We overview their features for managing the types of assets used in machine learning experiments. Most state-of-research tools focus on tracking, exploring, and retrieving assets to address development concerns such as reproducibility, while the state-of-practice tools also offer collaboration and workflow-execution-related operations. In addition, assets are primarily tracked intrusively from the source code through APIs and managed via web dashboards or command-line interfaces (CLIs). We identify asynchronous collaboration and asset reusability as directions for new tools and techniques.},

We also consider the vulnerability of other components within a heterogeneous system such as the interconnect and memory component.

Consequently, the world experienced grave repercussions to citizens’ lives, health, wellness, and the economy. In responding to such a disastrous global event, countermeasures are often implemented to slow down and limit the virus’s rapid spread. Meanwhile, disaster recovery, mitigation, and preparation measures have been taken to manage the impacts and losses of the ongoing and future pandemics. Data-driven techniques have been successfully applied to many domains and critical applications in recent years. Due to the highly interdisciplinary nature of pandemic management, researchers have proposed and developed data-driven techniques across various domains. However, a systematic and comprehensive survey of data-driven techniques for pandemic management is still missing. In this article, we review existing data analysis and visualization techniques and their applications for COVID-19 and future pandemic management with respect to four phases (namely, Response, Recovery, Mitigation, and Preparation) in disaster management.

Among other important features, NDN integrates security mechanisms and focuses on protecting the content rather than the communications channels. Along with a new architecture come new threats, and NDN is no exception. NDN is a potential target for new network attacks such as Interest Flooding Attacks (IFAs). Attackers take advantage of IFA to launch (D)DoS attacks in NDN. Many IFA detection and mitigation solutions have been proposed in the literature. However, there is no comprehensive review study of these solutions that has been proposed so far. Therefore, in this article, we propose a survey of the various IFAs with a detailed comparative study of all the relevant proposed solutions as counter-measures against IFAs. We also review the requirements for a complete and efficient IFA solution and pinpoint the various issues encountered by IFA detection and mitigation mechanisms through a series of attack scenarios.

Therefore, designing a feasible incentive mechanism to regulate entity behaviors becomes essential to improve blockchain system performance. The prosperous characteristics of blockchain can also contribute to an effective incentive mechanism. Unfortunately, current literature still lacks a thorough survey on incentive mechanisms related to the blockchain to understand how incentive mechanisms and blockchain make each other better. To this end, we propose evaluation requirements in terms of the properties and costs of incentive mechanisms. On the one hand, we provide a taxonomy of the incentive mechanisms of blockchain systems according to blockchain versions, incentive forms, and incentive goals. On the other hand, we categorize blockchain-based incentive mechanisms according to application scenarios and incentive goals. During the review, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of state-of-the-art incentive mechanisms based on the proposed evaluation requirements.

A prime threat in training phase is called poisoning attack, where adversaries strive to subvert the behavior of machine learning systems by poisoning training data or other means of interference. Although a growing number of relevant studies have been proposed, the research among poisoning attack is still overly scattered, with each paper focusing on a particular task in a specific domain. In this survey, we summarize and categorize existing attack methods and corresponding defenses, as well as demonstrate compelling application scenarios, thus providing a unified framework to analyze poisoning attacks. Besides, we also discuss the main limitations of current works, along with the corresponding future directions to facilitate further researches.

  abstract     = {In recent years, aspect category detection has become popular due to the rapid growth in customer reviews data on e-commerce and other online platforms. Aspect Category Detection, a sub-task of Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis, categorizes the reviews based on the features of a product such as a laptop’s display or an aspect of an entity such as the restaurant’s ambiance. Various methods have been proposed to deal with such a problem. In this article, we first introduce several datasets in the community that deal with this task and take a closer look at them by providing some exploratory analysis. Then, we review a number of representative methods for aspect category detection and classify them into two main groups: (1) supervised learning and (2) unsupervised learning. Next, we discuss the strengths and weaknesses of different kinds of methods, which are expected to benefit both practical applications and future research. Finally, we discuss the challenges, open problems, and future research directions.},

Both names refer to a family of computational models that use high-dimensional distributed representations and rely on the algebraic properties of their key operations to incorporate the advantages of structured symbolic representations and distributed vector representations. Notable models in the HDC/VSA family are Tensor Product Representations, Holographic Reduced Representations, Multiply-Add-Permute, Binary Spatter Codes, and Sparse Binary Distributed Representations but there are other models too. HDC/VSA is a highly interdisciplinary field with connections to computer science, electrical engineering, artificial intelligence, mathematics, and cognitive science. This fact makes it challenging to create a thorough overview of the field. However, due to a surge of new researchers joining the field in recent years, the necessity for a comprehensive survey of the field has become extremely important. Therefore, amongst other aspects of the field, this Part I surveys important aspects such as: known computational models of HDC/VSA and transformations of various input data types to high-dimensional distributed representations. Part II of this survey [ 84 ] is devoted to applications, cognitive computing and architectures, as well as directions for future work. The survey is written to be useful for both newcomers and practitioners.},

  abstract     = {The advent of recent Natural Language Processing technology has led human and machine interactions more toward conversation. In Conversational Search Systems (CSS) like chatbots and Virtual Personal Assistants such as Apple’s Siri, Amazon Alexa, Microsoft’s Cortana, and Google Assistant, both user and device have a limited platform to communicate through chatting or voice. In the information-seeking process, often users do not know how to properly describe their information need in a machine understandable language. Consequently, it is hard for the assistant agent to predict the user’s intent and yield relevant results by only relying on the original query. Studies have shown many unsatisfactory results can be enhanced with the benefit of CSS, which can dig deeper into the user’s query to reveal the real need. This survey intends to provide a comprehensive and comparative overview of ambiguous query clarification task in the context of conversational search technology. We investigate different approaches, their evaluation methods, and future work. We also address the importance of understanding a query for retrieving the most relevant document(s) and satisfying user’s need by predicting their potential request. This work provides an overview of characteristics of ambiguous queries and contributes to better understanding of the existing technologies and challenges in CSS focus on disambiguation of unclear queries from various dimensions.},

  abstract     = {With the continued digitization of societal processes, we are seeing an explosion in available data. This is referred to as big data. In a research setting, three aspects of the data are often viewed as the main sources of challenges when attempting to enable value creation from big data: volume, velocity, and variety. Many studies address volume or velocity, while fewer studies concern the variety. Metric spaces are ideal for addressing variety because they can accommodate any data as long as it can be equipped with a distance notion that satisfies the triangle inequality. To accelerate search in metric spaces, a collection of indexing techniques for metric data have been proposed. However, existing surveys offer limited coverage, and a comprehensive empirical study exists has yet to be reported. We offer a comprehensive survey of existing metric indexes that support exact similarity search: we summarize existing partitioning, pruning, and validation techniques used by metric indexes to support exact similarity search; we provide the time and space complexity analyses of index construction; and we offer an empirical comparison of their query processing performance. Empirical studies are important when evaluating metric indexing performance, because performance can depend highly on the effectiveness of available pruning and validation as well as on the data distribution, which means that complexity analyses often offer limited insights. This article aims at revealing strengths and weaknesses of different indexing techniques to offer guidance on selecting an appropriate indexing technique for a given setting, and to provide directions for future research on metric indexing.},

They extend finite-state automata with clocks, that constrain the system behavior in locations, and to take transitions.

In this work, we review works studying security properties for timed automata over the past two decades. We notably review theoretical works, with a particular focus on opacity, as well as more practical works, with a particular focus on attack trees and their extensions.

We present a catalogue of 704 open datasets described by 10 variables that can be valuable to researchers searching for secondary data: name and reference, creation purpose, data type, annotations, source, population groups, ordinal size of people captured simultaneously, URL, motion capture sensor, and funders. The catalogue is available in the supplementary materials. We provide an analysis of the datasets and further review them under the themes of human diversity, ecological validity, and data recorded.

When applied specifically to the memory hierarchy, caching is used to speed up memory accesses and memory translations. Different cache implementations are considered microarchitectural secrets and oftentimes change between generations. The integration of caches in hardware greatly influences security policy enforcement in the platform since caches maintain copies of code and data and their security properties. Examples of attacks due to the existence of caches are side-channels against cryptographic software, recent speculative execution abuses to leak secret data, and usages of cache-based manipulations (e.g., forcing cache splits/incoherence) to hide from security software detection. This survey examines the security issues due to different cache usages in a microarchitecture. The survey also explains the most complicated caching features and their impact on the security of the platform in different scenarios.},

Such schemes extend every word in memory with a tag and enforce security policies across them. This paper provides a survey of existing work on tagged architectures and describe the types of attacks such architectures aim to prevent as well as the guarantees they provide. It highlights the main distinguishing factors among tagged architectures and presents the diversity of designs and implementations that have been proposed. The survey reveals several real-world challenges have been neglected relating to both security and practical deployment.

Despite skeleton-based person identification gaining popularity while overcoming the challenges of traditional approaches, existing survey studies lack the comprehensive review of skeleton-based approaches to gait identification. We present a detailed review of the human pose estimation and gait analysis that makes the skeleton-based approaches possible. The study covers various types of related datasets, tools, methodologies, and evaluation metrics with associated challenges, limitations, and application domains. Detailed comparisons are presented for each of these aspects with recommendations for potential research and alternatives. A common trend throughout this paper is the positive impact that deep learning techniques are beginning to have on topics such as human pose estimation and gait identification.

However, the contradiction between the high Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of massive data and the limited network bandwidth and the heterogeneous network is becoming deeper and deeper. The heterogeneity of smart factory networks brings many challenges to unified access and fusion, real-time transmission, and centralized control and management. This article provides a survey on heterogeneous networks in smart factories. We first study and discuss the heterogeneity of smart factory networks, and then discuss the existing mainstream wired and wireless network technologies, as well as promising future technologies, including 5G, OLE for Process Control Unified Architecture (OPC UA), and Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN). In addition, we also analyze current heterogeneous network fusion architecture and discuss the enabling technologies of heterogeneous network fusion in view of the shortcoming of the current solutions. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of open challenges and future research directions towards the effective realization of the smart factory.},

With the emergence of the big data age, along with the data-centric and data-intensive computing trend, the great amount of energy consumed by database systems has become a major concern in a society that pursues Green IT. However, to the best of our knowledge, despite the importance of this matter in Green IT, there have been few comprehensive or systematic studies conducted in this field. Therefore, the objective of this article is to present a literature survey with breadth and depth on existing energy management techniques for database systems. The existing literature is organized hierarchically with two major branches focusing separately on energy consumption models and energy-saving techniques. Under each branch, we first introduce some basic knowledge, then we classify, discuss, and compare existing research according to their core ideas, basic approaches, and main characteristics. Finally, based on these observations through our study, we identify multiple open issues and challenges, and provide insights for future research.

The packing of executable files, which is one of the most common techniques for code protection, has been repurposed for code obfuscation by malware authors as a means of evading malware detectors (mainly static analysis-based detectors). This paper provides statistics on the use of packers based on an extensive analysis of 24,000 PE files (both malicious and benign files) for the past 10 years, which allowed us to observe trends in packing use during that time and showed that packing is still widely used in malware. This paper then surveys 23 methods proposed in academic research for the detection and classification of packed portable executable (PE) files and highlights various trends in malware packing. The paper highlights the differences between the methods and their abilities to detect and identify various aspects of packing. A taxonomy is presented, classifying the methods as static, dynamic, and hybrid analysis-based methods. The paper also sheds light on the increasing role of machine learning methods in the development of modern packing detection methods. We analyzed and mapped the different packing methods and identified which of them can be countered by the detection methods surveyed in this paper.},

The Android operating system provides various APIs to collect such mobile usage and sensor data for third-party developers. Usage Statistics API (US API) and Accessibility Service API (AS API) are representative Android APIs for collecting app usage data and are used for various research purposes, as they can collect fine-grained interaction data (e.g., app usage history and user interaction type). Furthermore, other sensor APIs help to collect a user’s context and device state data, along with AS/US APIs. This review investigates mobile usage and sensor data-driven research using AS/US APIs by categorizing the research purposes and the data types. In this article, the surveyed studies are classified as follows: five themes and 21 subthemes and a four-layer hierarchical data classification structure. This allows us to identify a data usage trend and derive insight into data collection according to research purposes. Several limitations and future research directions of mobile usage and sensor data-driven analytics research are discussed, including the impact of changes in the Android API versions on research, the privacy and data quality issues, and the mitigation of reproducibility risks with standardized data typology.},

  abstract     = {Despite their success, deep networks are used as black-box models with outputs that are not easily explainable during the learning and the prediction phases. This lack of interpretability is significantly limiting the adoption of such models in domains where decisions are critical such as the medical and legal fields. Recently, researchers have been interested in developing methods that help explain individual decisions and decipher the hidden representations of machine learning models in general and deep networks specifically. While there has been a recent explosion of work on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (ExAI) on deep models that operate on imagery and tabular data, textual datasets present new challenges to the ExAI community. Such challenges can be attributed to the lack of input structure in textual data, the use of word embeddings that add to the opacity of the models and the difficulty of the visualization of the inner workings of deep models when they are trained on textual data. Lately, methods have been developed to address the aforementioned challenges and present satisfactory explanations on Natural Language Processing (NLP) models. However, such methods are yet to be studied in a comprehensive framework where common challenges are properly stated and rigorous evaluation practices and metrics are proposed. Motivated to democratize ExAI methods in the NLP field, we present in this work a survey that studies model-agnostic as well as model-specific explainability methods on NLP models. Such methods can either develop inherently interpretable NLP models or operate on pre-trained models in a post hoc manner. We make this distinction and we further decompose the methods into three categories according to what they explain: (1) word embeddings (input level), (2) inner workings of NLP models (processing level), and (3) models’ decisions (output level). We also detail the different evaluation approaches interpretability methods in the NLP field. Finally, we present a case-study on the well-known neural machine translation in an appendix, and we propose promising future research directions for ExAI in the NLP field.},

However, what about smartphones? Despite the fact that these ubiquitous mobile devices now offer levels of hardware and performance approaching that of laptops, locally executed model-training using data mining methods on smartphones is still notably rare. On-device model-training offers a number of advantages. It largely mitigates issues of data security and privacy, since no data is required to leave the device. It also ensures a self-contained, fully portable data mining solution requiring no cloud computing or network resources and able to operate in any location. In this article, we focus on the intersection of smartphones and data mining. We investigate the growth in smartphone performance, survey smartphone usage models in previous research, and look at recent developments in locally executed data mining on smartphones.},

Still, the existing MEC practical initiatives are incomplete in their majority, hardening or invalidating their effective deployment. To fill this gap, it is essential to understand a series of experimental prototypes, implementations, and deployments. The early implementations can reveal the potential, the limitations, the related technologies, and the development tools for MEC adoption. In this context, this work first brings a discussion on existing MEC initiatives regarding the use cases they target and their vision (i.e., whether they are more network-related or more distributed systems). Second, we survey MEC practical initiatives according to their strategies, including the ETSI MEC standard. Besides, we compare the strategies according to related limitations, impact, and deployment efforts. We also survey the existing tools making MEC systems a reality. Finally, we give hints to issues yet to be addressed in practice.

Due to the important application value of recommender systems, there have always been emerging works in this field. In recommender systems, the main challenge is to learn the effective user/item representations from their interactions and side information (if any). Recently, graph neural network (GNN) techniques have been widely utilized in recommender systems since most of the information in recommender systems essentially has graph structure and GNN has superiority in graph representation learning. This article aims to provide a comprehensive review of recent research efforts on GNN-based recommender systems. Specifically, we provide a taxonomy of GNN-based recommendation models according to the types of information used and recommendation tasks. Moreover, we systematically analyze the challenges of applying GNN on different types of data and discuss how existing works in this field address these challenges. Furthermore, we state new perspectives pertaining to the development of this field.

This is important due to ethical concerns and trust issues strongly connected to reliability, robustness, auditability, and fairness, and has important consequences toward keeping the human in the loop in high levels of automation, especially in critical cases for decision making, where both (human and the machine) play important roles. Although the research community has given much attention to explainability of closed (or black) prediction boxes, there are tremendous needs for explainability of closed-box methods that support agents to act autonomously in the real world. Reinforcement learning methods, and especially their deep versions, are such closed-box methods. In this article, we aim to provide a review of state-of-the-art methods for explainable deep reinforcement learning methods, taking also into account the needs of human operators—that is, of those who make the actual and critical decisions in solving real-world problems. We provide a formal specification of the deep reinforcement learning explainability problems, and we identify the necessary components of a general explainable reinforcement learning framework. Based on these, we provide a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art methods, categorizing them into classes according to the paradigm they follow, the interpretable models they use, and the surface representation of explanations provided.

  abstract     = {Mobile devices such as smartphones and autonomous vehicles increasingly rely on deep neural networks (DNNs) to execute complex inference tasks such as image classification and speech recognition, among others. However, continuously executing the entire DNN on mobile devices can quickly deplete their battery. Although task offloading to cloud/edge servers may decrease the mobile device’s computational burden, erratic patterns in channel quality, network, and edge server load can lead to a significant delay in task execution. Recently, approaches based on split computing (SC) have been proposed, where the DNN is split into a head and a tail model, executed respectively on the mobile device and on the edge server. Ultimately, this may reduce bandwidth usage as well as energy consumption. Another approach, called early exiting (EE), trains models to embed multiple “exits” earlier in the architecture, each providing increasingly higher target accuracy. Therefore, the tradeoff between accuracy and delay can be tuned according to the current conditions or application demands. In this article, we provide a comprehensive survey of the state of the art in SC and EE strategies by presenting a comparison of the most relevant approaches. We conclude the article by providing a set of compelling research challenges.},

  abstract     = {The ever-developing Internet of Things (IoT) brings the prosperity of wireless sensing and control applications. In many scenarios, different wireless technologies coexist in the shared frequency medium as well as the physical space. Such wireless coexistence may lead to serious cross-technology interference (CTI) problems, e.g., channel competition, signal collision, and throughput degradation. Compared with traditional methods like interference avoidance, tolerance, and concurrency mechanism, direct and timely information exchange among heterogeneous devices is therefore a fundamental requirement to ensure the usability, inter-operability, and reliability of the IoT. Under this circumstance, Cross-Technology Communication (CTC) technique thus becomes a hot topic in both academic and industrial fields, which aims at directly exchanging data among heterogeneous devices that follow different standards. This paper comprehensively summarizes the CTC techniques and reveals that the key challenge for CTC lies in the heterogeneity of IoT devices, including the incompatibility of technical standards and the asymmetry of connection capability. Based on the above finding, we present a taxonomy of the existing CTC works (packet-level CTCs and physical-level CTCs) and compare the existing CTC techniques in terms of throughput, reliability, hardware modification, and concurrency.},

  abstract     = {In the last decade, many studies have significantly pushed the limits of wireless device-free human sensing (WDHS) technology and facilitated various applications, ranging from activity identification to vital sign monitoring. This survey presents a novel taxonomy that classifies the state-of-the-art WDHS systems into 11 categories according to their sensing task type and motion granularity . In particular, existing WDHS systems involve three primary sensing task types. The first type, behavior recognition , is a classification problem of recognizing predefined meaningful behaviors. The second type is movement tracking , monitoring the quantitative values of behavior states integrating with spatiotemporal information. The third type, user identification , leverages the unique features in behaviors to identify who performs the movements. The selected papers in each sensing task type can be further divided into sub-categories according to their motion granularity. Recent advances reveal that WDHS systems within a particular granularity follow similar challenges and design principles. For example, fine-grained hand recognition systems target extracting subtle motion-induced signal changes from the noisy signal responses, and their sensing areas are limited to a relatively small range. Coarse-grained activity identification systems need to overcome the interference of other moving objects within the room-level sensing range. A novel research framework is proposed to help to summarize WDHS systems from methodology, evaluation performance, and design goals. Finally, we conclude with several open issues and present the future research directions from the perspectives of data collection , sensing methodology , performance evaluation , and application scenario .},

  abstract     = {Fault attacks are among the well-studied topics in the area of cryptography. These attacks constitute a powerful tool to recover the secret key used in the encryption process. Fault attacks work by forcing a device to work under non-ideal environmental conditions (such as high temperature) or external disturbances (such as glitch in the power supply) while performing a cryptographic operation. The recent trend shows that the amount of research in this direction—which ranges from attacking a particular primitive, proposing a fault countermeasure, to attacking countermeasures—has grown up substantially and is going to stay as an active research interest for the foreseeable future. Hence, it becomes apparent to have a comprehensive yet compact study of the (major) works. This work, which covers a wide spectrum in the present-day research on fault attacks that fall under the purview of the symmetric key cryptography, aims at fulfilling the absence of an up-to-date survey. We present mostly all aspects of the topic in a way that is not only understandable for a non-expert reader, but also helpful for an expert as a reference.},

As companies build voice assistants with extra functionalities, attacks that trick a voice assistant into performing malicious behaviors can pose a significant threat to a user’s security, privacy, and even safety. However, the diverse attacks and stand-alone defenses in the literature often lack a systematic perspective, making it challenging for designers to properly identify, understand, and mitigate the security threats against voice assistants. To overcome this problem, this article provides a thorough survey of the attacks and countermeasures for voice assistants. We systematize a broad category of relevant but seemingly unrelated attacks by the vulnerable system components and attack methods, and categorize existing countermeasures based on the defensive strategies from a system designer’s perspective. To assist designers in planning defense based on their demands, we provide a qualitative comparison of existing countermeasures by the implementation cost, usability, and security and propose practical suggestions. We envision this work can help build more reliability into voice assistants and promote research in this fast-evolving area.},

Recent advancements in DNNs have brought levels beyond human accuracy in many tasks, but at the cost of high computational complexity. To enable efficient execution of DNN inference, more and more research works, therefore, are exploiting the inherent error resilience of DNNs and employing Approximate Computing (AC) principles to address the elevated energy demands of DNN accelerators. This article provides a comprehensive survey and analysis of hardware approximation techniques for DNN accelerators. First, we analyze the state of the art, and by identifying approximation families, we cluster the respective works with respect to the approximation type. Next, we analyze the complexity of the performed evaluations (with respect to the dataset and DNN size) to assess the efficiency, potential, and limitations of approximate DNN accelerators. Moreover, a broad discussion is provided regarding error metrics that are more suitable for designing approximate units for DNN accelerators as well as accuracy recovery approaches that are tailored to DNN inference. Finally, we present how Approximate Computing for DNN accelerators can go beyond energy efficiency and address reliability and security issues as well.},

  abstract     = {Unlabelled data appear in many domains and are particularly relevant to streaming applications, where even though data is abundant, labelled data is rare. To address the learning problems associated with such data, one can ignore the unlabelled data and focus only on the labelled data (supervised learning); use the labelled data and attempt to leverage the unlabelled data (semi-supervised learning); or assume some labels will be available on request (active learning). The first approach is the simplest, yet the amount of labelled data available will limit the predictive performance. The second relies on finding and exploiting the underlying characteristics of the data distribution. The third depends on an external agent to provide the required labels in a timely fashion. This survey pays special attention to methods that leverage unlabelled data in a semi-supervised setting. We also discuss the delayed labelling issue, which impacts both fully supervised and semi-supervised methods. We propose a unified problem setting, discuss the learning guarantees and existing methods, and explain the differences between related problem settings. Finally, we review the current benchmarking practices and propose adaptations to enhance them.},

  abstract     = {Social media embeddedness relationships consist of online social networks formed by self-organized individual actors and significantly affect many aspects of our lives. Since the high cost and inefficiency of using population networks generated by social media embeddedness relationships to study practical issues, sampling techniques have become increasingly important than ever. Our work consists of three parts. We first comprehensively analyze current sampling selection methods, evaluation indexes, and evaluation methods in terms of technological evolution. In the second part, we systematically conduct sampling tests using representative large-scale social media datasets. The test results indicate that unequal-probability sampling methods can construct similar sample networks at the macroscale and microscale and outperform the equal-probability methods. However, non-negligible sampling errors at the mesoscale seriously affect the sampling reliability and validity. MANOVA tests show that the direct cause of sampling errors is the low in-degree nodes with medium-high betweenness located between the core and periphery, and current sampling methods cannot accurately sample such complex interconnected structures. In the third part, we summarize the pros and cons of current sampling methods and provide suggestions for future work.},

  abstract     = {The context of this study examines the requirements of Future Intelligent Networks (FIN), solutions, and current research directions through a survey technique. The background of this study is hinged on the applications of Machine Learning (ML) in the networking field. Through careful analysis of literature and real-world reports, we noted that ML has significantly expedited decision-making processes, enhanced intelligent automation, and helped resolve complex problems economically in different fields of life. Various researchers have also envisioned future networks incorporating intelligent functions and operations with ML. Several efforts have been made to automate individual functions and operations in the networking domain; however, most of the existing ML models proposed in the literature lack several vital requirements. Hence, this study aims to present a comprehensive summary of the requirements of FIN and propose a taxonomy of different network functionalities that needs to be equipped with ML techniques. The core objectives of this study are to provide a taxonomy of requirements envisioned for end-to-end FIN, relevant ML techniques, and their analysis to find research gaps, open issues, and future research directions. The real benefit of ML applications in any domain can only be ensured if intelligent capabilities cover all of its components. We observed that future generations of networks are heterogeneous, multi-vendor, and multidimensional, and ML can provide optimal results only if intelligent capabilities are used on a holistic scale. Realizing intelligence on a holistic scale is only possible if the ML algorithms can solve heterogeneous problems in a multi-vendor and multidimensional environment. ML models must be reliable and efficient, support, and possess the capability to learn and share the knowledge across the network layers and administrative domains to solve issues. First, this study ascertains the requirements of the FIN and proposes their taxonomy through reviews on envisioned ideas by various researchers and articles gathered from reputed conferences and standard developing organizations using keyword queries. Second, we have reviewed existing studies on ML applications focusing on coverage, heterogeneity, distributed architecture, and cross-domain knowledge learning and sharing. Our study observed that in the past, ML applications were focused mainly on an individual/isolated level only, and aspects of global and deep holistic learning with cross-layer/cross-domain knowledge sharing with agile ML operations are not explored at large. We recommend that the issues mentioned previously be addressed with improved ML architecture and agile operations and propose an ML pipeline based architecture for FIN. The significant contribution of this study is the impetus for researchers to seek ML models suitable for a modular, distributed, multi-domain, and multi-layer environment and provide decision making on a global or holistic rather than an individual function level.},

As a consequence, the correctness of software systems built with MDE approaches relies mainly on the correctness of model transformations, and thus, detecting and locating bugs in model transformations have been popular research topics in recent years. This surge of work has led to a vast literature on model transformation testing and debugging, which makes it challenging to gain a comprehensive view of the current state-of-the-art. This is an obstacle for newcomers to this topic and MDE practitioners to apply these approaches. This article presents a survey on testing and debugging model transformations based on the analysis of 140 papers on the topics. We explore the trends, advances, and evolution over the years, bringing together previously disparate streams of work and providing a comprehensive view of these thriving areas. In addition, we present a conceptual framework to understand and categorize the different proposals.

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) has experienced a boom in recent years, which is jointly promoted by the prosperity of machine learning and Artificial Intelligence along with emerging privacy issues. In the FL paradigm, a central server and local end devices maintain the same model by exchanging model updates instead of raw data, with which the privacy of data stored on end devices is not directly revealed. In this way, the privacy violation caused by the growing collection of sensitive data can be mitigated. However, the performance of FL with a central server is reaching a bottleneck, while new threats are emerging simultaneously. There are various reasons, among which the most significant ones are centralized processing, data falsification, and lack of incentives. To accelerate the proliferation of FL, blockchain-enabled FL has attracted substantial attention from both academia and industry. A considerable number of novel solutions are devised to meet the emerging demands of diverse scenarios. Blockchain-enabled FL provides both theories and techniques to improve the performance of FL from various perspectives. In this survey, we will comprehensively summarize and evaluate existing variants of blockchain-enabled FL, identify the emerging challenges, and propose potentially promising research directions in this under-explored domain.},

The railway signaling domain is a field in which formal methods have traditionally been applied, with several success stories. This article reports on a mapping study that surveys the landscape of research on applications of formal methods to the development of railway systems. Following the guidelines of systematic reviews, we identify 328 relevant primary studies, and extract information about their demographics, the characteristics of formal methods used and railway-specific aspects. Our main results are as follows: (i) we identify a total of 328 primary studies relevant to our scope published between 1989 and 2020, of which 44\% published during the last 5 years and 24\% involved industry; (ii) the majority of studies are evaluated through Examples (41\%) and Experience Reports (38\%), while full-fledged Case Studies are limited (1.5\%); (iii) Model checking is the most commonly adopted technique (47\%), followed by simulation (27\%) and theorem proving (19.5\%); (iv) the dominant languages are UML (18\%) and B (15\%), while frequently used tools are ProB (9\%), NuSMV (8\%), and UPPAAL (7\%); however, a diverse landscape of languages and tools is employed; (v) the majority of systems are interlocking products (40\%), followed by models of high-level control logic (27\%); and (vi) most of the studies focus on the Architecture (66\%) and Detailed Design (45\%) development phases. Based on these findings, we highlight current research gaps and expected actions. In particular, the need to focus on more empirically sound research methods, such as Case Studies and Controlled Experiments, and to lower the degree of abstraction, by applying formal methods and tools to development phases that are closer to software development. Our study contributes with an empirically based perspective on the future of research and practice in formal methods applications for railways. It can be used by formal methods researchers to better focus their scientific inquiries, and by railway practitioners for an improved understanding of the interplay between formal methods and their specific application domain.},

The classical stereo matching is then revised on the spherical domain, where methodologies for detecting and describing sparse and dense features become crucial. The stereo matching concepts are then extrapolated for multiple view camera setups, categorizing them among light fields, multi-view stereo, and structure from motion (or visual simultaneous localization and mapping).

These are (1) Zonal, (2) Regional, (3) Multi-regional, (4) Global, (5) Hybrid, and (6) Multi-cloud deployment archetypes. The goal is to classify cloud applications into a set of deployment archetypes and deployment models that tradeoff their needs around availability, latency, and geographical constraints with a focus on serving applications. This enables application owners to better examine the tradeoffs of each deployment model and what is needed for achieving the availability and latency goals for their application.},

  abstract     = {Recent advances in communication technologies and the Internet-of-Medical-Things (IOMT) have transformed smart healthcare enabled by artificial intelligence (AI). Traditionally, AI techniques require centralized data collection and processing that may be infeasible in realistic healthcare scenarios due to the high scalability of modern healthcare networks and growing data privacy concerns. Federated Learning (FL), as an emerging distributed collaborative AI paradigm, is particularly attractive for smart healthcare, by coordinating multiple clients (e.g., hospitals) to perform AI training without sharing raw data. Accordingly, we provide a comprehensive survey on the use of FL in smart healthcare. First, we present the recent advances in FL, the motivations, and the requirements of using FL in smart healthcare. The recent FL designs for smart healthcare are then discussed, ranging from resource-aware FL, secure and privacy-aware FL to incentive FL and personalized FL. Subsequently, we provide a state-of-the-art review on the emerging applications of FL in key healthcare domains, including health data management, remote health monitoring, medical imaging, and COVID-19 detection. Several recent FL-based smart healthcare projects are analyzed, and the key lessons learned from the survey are also highlighted. Finally, we discuss interesting research challenges and possible directions for future FL research in smart healthcare.},

An informative universal sentence embedding can greatly promote subsequent natural language processing tasks. However, unlike universal word embeddings, a widely accepted general-purpose sentence embedding technique has not been developed. This survey summarizes the current universal sentence-embedding methods, categorizes them into four groups from a linguistic view, and ultimately analyzes their reported performance. Sentence embeddings trained from words in a bottom-up manner are observed to have different, nearly opposite, performance patterns in downstream tasks compared to those trained from logical relationships between sentences. By comparing differences of training schemes in and between groups, we analyze possible essential reasons for different performance patterns. We additionally collect incentive strategies handling sentences from other models and propose potentially inspiring future research directions.},

This embraces a twofold meaning: improvement of designers’ productivity and completion of the virtuous cycle. In this article, we present a comprehensive review of the work that applies ML for computer architecture and system design. First, we perform a high-level taxonomy by considering the typical role that ML techniques take in architecture/system design, i.e., either for fast predictive modeling or as the design methodology. Then, we summarize the common problems in computer architecture/system design that can be solved by ML techniques and the typical ML techniques employed to resolve each of them. In addition to emphasis on computer architecture in a narrow sense, we adopt the concept that data centers can be recognized as warehouse-scale computers; sketchy discussions are provided in adjacent computer systems, such as code generation and compiler; we also give attention to how ML techniques can aid and transform design automation. We further provide a future vision of opportunities and potential directions and envision that applying ML for computer architecture and systems would thrive in the community.},

Among the commercialized LPWAN technologies, LoRa (Long Range) attracts much interest from academia and industry due to its open-source physical (PHY) layer and standardized networking stack. In the flourishing LoRa community, many observations and countermeasures have been proposed to understand and improve the performance of LoRa networking in practice. From the perspective of the LoRa networking stack; however, we lack a whole picture to comprehensively understand what has been done or not and reveal what the future trends are. This survey proposes a taxonomy of a two-dimensional (i.e., networking layers, performance metrics) to categorize and compare the cutting-edge LoRa networking techniques. One dimension is the layered structure of the LoRa networking stack. From down to the top, we have the PHY layer, Link layer, Media-access Control (MAC) layer, and Application (App) layer. In each layer, we focus on the three most representative layer-specific research issues for fine-grained categorizing. The other dimension is LoRa networking performance metrics, including range, throughput, energy, and security. We compare different techniques in terms of these metrics and further overview the open issues and challenges, followed by our observed future trends. According to our proposed taxonomy, we aim at clarifying several ways to achieve a more effective LoRa networking stack and find more LoRa applicable scenarios, leading to a brand-new step toward a large-scale and long-term IoT.},

Since they now touch on many aspects of our lives, it is crucial to develop ML algorithms that are not only accurate but also objective and fair. Recent studies have shown that algorithmic decision making may be inherently prone to unfairness, even when there is no intention for it. This article presents an overview of the main concepts of identifying, measuring, and improving algorithmic fairness when using ML algorithms, focusing primarily on classification tasks. The article begins by discussing the causes of algorithmic bias and unfairness and the common definitions and measures for fairness. Fairness-enhancing mechanisms are then reviewed and divided into pre-process, in-process, and post-process mechanisms. A comprehensive comparison of the mechanisms is then conducted, toward a better understanding of which mechanisms should be used in different scenarios. The article ends by reviewing several emerging research sub-fields of algorithmic fairness, beyond classification.},

To address these concerns plentitude of studies propose postprocessing of alarms: processing the alarms after they are generated. These studies differ greatly in their approaches to postprocess alarms. A comprehensive overview of the postprocessing approaches is, however, missing. In this article, we review 130 primary studies that propose postprocessing of alarms. The studies are collected by combining keywords-based database search and snowballing. We categorize approaches proposed by the collected studies into six main categories: clustering, ranking, pruning, automated elimination of false positives, combination of static and dynamic analyses, and simplification of manual inspection. We provide overview of the categories and sub-categories identified for them, their merits and shortcomings, and different techniques used to implement the approaches. Furthermore, we provide (1) guidelines for selection of the postprocessing techniques by the users/designers of static analysis tools; and (2) directions that can be explored by the researchers.},

  abstract     = {The Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) is a fundamental NP-complete decision problem in automated reasoning and mathematical logic. As evidenced by the results of SAT competitions, the performance of SAT solvers varies substantially between different SAT categories (random, crafted, and industrial). A suggested explanation is that SAT solvers may exploit the underlying structure inherent to SAT instances. There have been attempts to define the structure of SAT in terms of structural measures such as phase transition, backbones, backdoors, small-world, scale-free, treewidth, centrality, community, self-similarity, and entropy. Still, the empirical evidence of structural measures for SAT has been provided for only some SAT categories. Furthermore, the evidence has not been theoretically proven. Also, the impact of structural measures on the behavior of SAT solvers has not been extensively examined. This work provides a comprehensive study on structural measures for SAT that have been presented in the literature. We provide an overview of the works on structural measures for SAT and their relatedness to the performance of SAT solvers. Accordingly, a taxonomy of structural measures for SAT is presented. We also review in detail important applications of structural measures for SAT, focusing mainly on enhancing SAT solvers, generating SAT instances, and classifying SAT instances.},

Nowadays, much literature describes clustering algorithms on multivariate data sets. However, there is limited literature that presented them with exhaustive and extensive theoretical analysis as well as experimental comparisons. This experimental survey paper deals with the basic principle, and techniques used, including important characteristics, application areas, run-time performance, internal, external, and stability validity of cluster quality, etc., on five different data sets of eleven clustering algorithms. This paper analyses how these algorithms behave with five different multivariate data sets in data representation. To answer this question, we compared the efficiency of eleven clustering approaches on five different data sets using three validity metrics-internal, external, and stability and found the optimal score to know the feasible solution of each algorithm. In addition, we have also included four popular and modern clustering algorithms with only their theoretical discussion. Our experimental results for only traditional clustering algorithms showed that different algorithms performed different behavior on different data sets in terms of running time (speed), accuracy and, the size of data set. This study emphasized the need for more adaptive algorithms and a deliberate balance between the running time and accuracy with their theoretical as well as implementation aspects.},

It is a part of the IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Network (6LoWPAN) protocol stack. Features such as energy-efficient mechanisms and availability of the secure modes of operations make RPL suitable for the constrained Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Hence, the majority of IoT applications rely on RPL for data communication. However, routing security in RPL-based IoT networks is a significant concern, motivating us to study and analyze routing attacks and suggested countermeasures against them. To this end, we provide a comprehensive survey on the state-of-the-art security threats and their corresponding countermeasures in RPL-based IoT networks. Based on our study, we propose a novel classification scheme that uses a mapping between RPL attacks and their countermeasure techniques to the RPL control messages used to develop these techniques. Furthermore, we provide an in-depth statistical analysis that includes analysis of routing attacks through the RPL control messages, distribution of various mitigation techniques as per the method used, RPL control messages involved in the mitigation techniques, and details of the tools used by multiple researchers. In the end, we highlight some open challenges and future research opportunities on this topic. We believe that this survey will be beneficial to researchers and practitioners working in the area of RPL security.},

Nevertheless, despite relying on the processing of large amounts of data, most of the so-called smart systems that we have nowadays merely consider humans as sources of data, not as system beneficiaries or even active “components.” For truly smart systems, we need to create systems that are able to understand human actions and emotions, and take them into account when deciding on the system behavior. Naturally, in order to achieve this, we first have to empower systems with human sensing capabilities, possibly in ways that are as inconspicuous as possible. In this context, in this article we survey existing approaches to unobtrusive monitorization of human beings, namely, of their activity, vital signs, and emotional states. After setting a taxonomy for human sensing, we proceed to present and analyze existing solutions for unobtrusive sensing. Subsequently, we identify and discuss open issues and challenges in this area. Although there are surveys that address some of the concerned fields of research, such as healthcare, human monitorization, or even the use-specific techniques like channel state information or image recognition, as far as we know this is the first comprehensive survey on unobtrusive sensing of human beings.},

Concepts learned by a classification model are prone to change and non-adaptive models are likely to deteriorate and become ineffective over time. The challenge of recognising and reacting to change in a stream is compounded by the scarcity of labels problem. This refers to the very realistic situation in which the true class label of an incoming point is not immediately available (or might never be available) or in situations where manually annotating data points are prohibitively expensive. In a high-velocity stream, it is perhaps impossible to manually label every incoming point and pursue a fully supervised approach. In this article, we formally describe the types of change, which can occur in a data-stream and then catalogue the methods for dealing with change when there is limited access to labels.

This article reviews the design principles and the different node embedding techniques for NRL over homogeneous networks.

With this unifying reference framework, we highlight the representative methods, models, and techniques used at different stages of the node embedding model learning process.

However, the differences in users’ motivations and the disclosure of too sensitive information (among others) can lead to loss of privacy. In this work, we identify requirements such as automation, preference-centered, relationship-based, and multi-party privacy mechanisms, which have been more researched. But also other requirements (recently emerged), such as privacy preservation with risk metrics, explainability, and ephemeral messages. We explore all the advances made in the literature, and we have seen that most of these have been focused on matching the users’ preferences with their decision (which is not appropriate, because users cannot evaluate all of the potential privacy scenarios) instead of assessing privacy risk metrics, adaptation, and explainability. Therefore, we have identified open challenges, such as metrics for assessing privacy risks, explainable solutions for users, ephemeral communication solutions, and the application of these requirements to the multi-party privacy scenario.},

In this survey, we present an up-to-date and detailed review of the models and algorithms developed by this field.

  abstract     = {The purpose of a reputation system is to hold the users of a distributed application accountable for their behavior. The reputation of a user is computed as an aggregate of the feedback provided by fellow users in the system. Truthful feedback is clearly a prerequisite for computing a reputation score that accurately represents the behavior of a user. However, it has been observed that users can hesitate in providing truthful feedback because, for example, of fear of retaliation. Privacy-preserving reputation systems enable users to provide feedback in a private and thus uninhibited manner. In this survey, we propose analysis frameworks for privacy-preserving reputation systems. We use these analysis frameworks to review and compare the existing approaches. Emphasis is placed on blockchain-based systems as they are a recent significant development in the area. Blockchain-based privacy-preserving reputation systems have properties, such as trustlessness, transparency, and immutability, which prior systems do not have. Our analysis provides several insights and directions for future research. These include leveraging blockchain to its full potential in order to develop truly trustless systems, to achieve some important security properties, and to include defenses against common attacks that have so far not been addressed by most current systems.},

  abstract     = {With the development of real-time critical systems, the ever-increasing communication data traffic puts forward high-bandwidth and low-delay requirements for communication networks. Therefore, various real-time Ethernet protocols have been proposed, but these protocols are not compatible with each other. The IEEE 802.1 Working Group developed standardized protocols named Audio Video Bridging (AVB) in 2005, and renamed it Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) later. TSN not only adds new features but also retains the original functions of AVB. Proposing real-time Ethernet modeling and design methodologies is the key to meeting high-bandwidth and low-delay communication requirements. This article surveys the modeling from AVB to TSN, mainly including: (1) AVB and TSN modeling; (2) end-to-end delay modeling; (3) real-time scheduling modeling; (4) reliability modeling; and (5) security modeling. Based on these models, this article surveys the recent advances in real-time Ethernet design methodologies from AVB to TSN: (1) end-to-end delay analysis from AVB to TSN; (2) real-time scheduling from AVB to TSN; (3) reliability-aware design for TSN; and (4) security-aware design for TSN. Among the above four points, the last two points are only for TSN, because AVB lacks reliability and security mechanisms. This article further takes the automotive use case as an example to discuss the application of TSN in automobiles. Finally, this article discusses the future trends of TSN. By surveying the recent advances and future trends, we hope to provide references for researchers interested in real-time Ethernet modeling and design methodologies for AVB and TSN.},

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) is one of the promising models that synthesizes data samples that are similar to real data samples. While the variations of GANs models in general have been covered to some extent in several survey papers, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that reviews the state-of-the-art video GANs models. This paper first categorizes GANs review papers into general GANs review papers, image GANs review papers, and special field GANs review papers such as anomaly detection, medical imaging, or cybersecurity. The paper then summarizes the main improvements in GANs that are not necessarily applied in the video domain in the first run but have been adopted in multiple video GANs variations. Then, a comprehensive review of video GANs models are provided under two main divisions based on existence of a condition. The conditional models are then further classified according to the provided condition into audio, text, video, and image. The paper concludes with the main challenges and limitations of the current video GANs models.},

In this complex scenario, there is a need to define and implement orchestration processes to ensure that applications and services can be provided, considering the settled agreements. Although some publications have dealt with orchestration in fog computing, there are still some diverse definitions and functional intersection with other areas, such as resource management and monitoring. This article presents a systematic review of the literature with focus on orchestration in fog computing. A generic architecture of fog orchestration is presented, created from the consolidation of the analyzed proposals, bringing to light the essential functionalities addressed in the literature.

This rise in popularity, however, is causing an increasing interest from criminals, making UAVs the target of new attacks. To fully characterize the current UAV cybersecurity landscape, we perform a complete literature review, digging into drone security historic facts and scientific studies on the matter, reviewing specialized articles and scientific papers focusing on cybersecurity threats and gaps in the context of small UAVs in commercial applications. Being a recent research and development area, most of the articles have been published between 2016 and 2020 as a direct consequence of the increase of security concerns and interest in the drone field. Papers in this review deal with UAV cyberthreats and related vulnerabilities, identifying flaws experimented in a lab or describing incidents detected in the field. Communication, sensors, and system misconfigurations are among the most important threat vectors, while sensor spoofing/jamming and malware DoS/control are among the most cited threats. Threat vectors permit depicting a complete overview of the topic and potential countermeasures known to date, with related gap analysis, also accounting for the recent Unmanned Aircraft System evolution toward ad hoc or cloud-based UAV networks. Countermeasures include the adoption of traditional communication encryption and standard protocols, GPS spoofing/jamming mitigation, encryption and privacy-aware implementations, and counter-malware techniques, to name the most adopted. It also emerges that often attacks are simply ported or adapted from other attacks in similar domains, while peculiar attacks still remain such as targeted physical attacks, specific UAV malware, and GPS spoofing/jamming.},

Numerous studies have investigated binary code with the goal of extracting fingerprints that can illuminate the semantics of a target application. However, extracting fingerprints is a challenging task since a substantial amount of significant information will be lost during compilation, notably, variable and function naming, the original data and control flow structures, comments, semantic information, and the code layout. This article provides the first systematic review of existing binary code fingerprinting approaches and the contexts in which they are used. In addition, it discusses the applications that rely on binary code fingerprints, the information that can be captured during the fingerprinting process, and the approaches used and their implementations.

  abstract     = {Computer games, one of the most popular forms of entertainment in the world, are increasingly online multiplayer, connecting geographically dispersed players in the same virtual world over a network. Network latency between players and the server can decrease responsiveness and increase inconsistency across players, degrading player performance and quality of experience. Latency compensation techniques are software-based solutions that seek to ameliorate the negative effects of network latency by manipulating player input and/or game states in response to network delays. We search, find, and survey more than 80 papers on latency compensation, organizing their latency compensation techniques into a novel taxonomy. Our hierarchical taxonomy has 11 base technique types organized into four main groups. Illustrative examples of each technique are provided, as well as demonstrated use of the techniques in commercial games.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning approaches have recently raised the bar in many fields, from Natural Language Processing to Computer Vision, by leveraging large amounts of data. However, they could fail when the retrieved information is not enough to fit the vast number of parameters, frequently resulting in overfitting and therefore in poor generalizability. Few-Shot Learning aims at designing models that can effectively operate in a scarce data regime, yielding learning strategies that only need few supervised examples to be trained. These procedures are of both practical and theoretical importance, as they are crucial for many real-life scenarios in which data is either costly or even impossible to retrieve. Moreover, they bridge the distance between current data-hungry models and human-like generalization capability. Computer vision offers various tasks that can be few-shot inherent, such as person re-identification. This survey, which to the best of our knowledge is the first tackling this problem, is focused on Few-Shot Object Detection, which has received far less attention compared to Few-Shot Classification due to the intrinsic challenge level. In this regard, this review presents an extensive description of the approaches that have been tested in the current literature, discussing their pros and cons, and classifying them according to a rigorous taxonomy.},

  abstract     = {Left ventricle segmentation in short-axis cardiac magnetic resonance images is important to diagnose heart disease. However, repetitive manual segmentation of these images requires considerable human effort and can decrease diagnostic accuracy. In recent years, several fully and semi-automatic approaches have been proposed, mainly using image-based, atlas, graph, deformable model, and artificial intelligence methods. This article presents a systematic mapping on left ventricle segmentation, considering 74 studies published in the past decade. The main contributions of this review are definition of the main segmentation challenges in these images; proposal of a new schematization, dividing the segmentation process into stages; categorization and analysis of the segmentation methods, including hybrid combinations; and analysis of the evaluation process, metrics, and databases. The performance of the methods in the most used public database is assessed, and the main limitations, weaknesses, and strengths of each method category are presented. Finally, trends, challenges, and research opportunities are discussed. The analysis indicates that methods from all categories can achieve good performance, and hybrid methods combining deep learning and deformable models obtain the best results. Methods still fail in specific slices, segment wrong regions, and produce anatomically impossible segmentations.},

  abstract     = {Industrial processes rely on sensory data for decision-making processes, risk assessment, and performance evaluation. Extracting actionable insights from the collected data calls for an infrastructure that can ensure the dissemination of trustworthy data. For the physical data to be trustworthy, it needs to be cross validated through multiple sensor sources with overlapping fields of view. Cross-validated data can then be stored on the blockchain, to maintain its integrity and trustworthiness. Once trustworthy data is recorded on the blockchain, product lifecycle events can be fed into data-driven systems for process monitoring, diagnostics, and optimized control. In this regard, digital twins (DTs) can be leveraged to draw intelligent conclusions from data by identifying the faults and recommending precautionary measures ahead of critical events. Empowering DTs with blockchain in industrial use cases targets key challenges of disparate data repositories, untrustworthy data dissemination, and the need for predictive maintenance. In this survey, while highlighting the key benefits of using blockchain-based DTs, we present a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art research results for blockchain-based DTs. Based on the current research trends, we discuss a trustworthy blockchain-based DTs framework. We also highlight the role of artificial intelligence in blockchain-based DTs. Furthermore, we discuss the current and future research and deployment challenges of blockchain-supported DTs that require further investigation.},

It has become a very profitable business for cybercriminals with revenues of millions of dollars, and a very serious threat to organizations with financial losses of billions of dollars. Numerous studies were proposed to address the ransomware threat, including surveys that cover certain aspects of ransomware research. However, no study exists in the literature that gives the complete picture on ransomware and ransomware defense research with respect to the diversity of targeted platforms. Since ransomware is already prevalent in PCs/workstations/desktops/laptops, and is becoming more prevalent in mobile devices, and has already hit IoT/CPS recently, and will likely grow further in the IoT/CPS domain very soon, understanding ransomware and analyzing defense mechanisms with respect to target platforms is becoming more imperative. In order to fill this gap and motivate further research, in this paper, we present a comprehensive survey on ransomware and ransomware defense research with respect to PCs/workstations, mobile devices, and IoT/CPS platforms. Specifically, covering 137 studies over the period of 1990-2020, we give a detailed overview of ransomware evolution, comprehensively analyze the key building blocks of ransomware, present a taxonomy of notable ransomware families, and provide an extensive overview of ransomware defense research (i.e., analysis, detection, and recovery) with respect to platforms of PCs/workstations, mobile devices, and IoT/CPS. Moreover, we derive an extensive list of open issues for future ransomware research.

  abstract     = {Computing systems have undergone a tremendous change in the last few decades with several inflexion points. While Moore’s law guided the semiconductor industry to cram more and more transistors and logic into the same volume, the limits of instruction-level parallelism (ILP) and the end of Dennard’s scaling drove the industry towards multi-core chips. More recently, we have entered the era of domain-specific architectures (DSA) and chips for new workloads like artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). These trends continue, arguably with other limits, along with challenges imposed by tighter integration, extreme form factors and increasingly diverse workloads, making systems more complex to architect, design, implement and optimize from an energy efficiency perspective. Energy efficiency has now become a first order design parameter and constraint across the entire spectrum of computing devices. Many research surveys have gone into different aspects of energy efficiency techniques implemented in hardware and microarchitecture across devices, servers, HPC/cloud, data center systems along with improved software, algorithms, frameworks, and modeling energy/thermals. Somewhat in parallel, the semiconductor industry has developed techniques and standards around specification, modeling/simulation, benchmarking and verification of complex chips; these areas have not been addressed in detail by previous research surveys. This survey aims to bring these domains holistically together, present the latest in each of these areas, highlight potential gaps and challenges, and discuss opportunities for the next generation of energy efficient systems. The survey is composed of a systematic categorization of key aspects of building energy efficient systems - (1) specification - the ability to precisely specify the power intent, attributes or properties at different layers (2) modeling and simulation of the entire system or subsystem (hardware or software or both) so as to be able to experiment with possible options and perform what-if analysis, (3) techniques used for implementing energy efficiency at different levels of the stack, (4) verification techniques used to provide guarantees that the functionality of complex designs are preserved, and (5) energy efficiency benchmarks, standards and consortiums that aim to standardize different aspects of energy efficiency, including cross-layer optimizations.},

  abstract     = {Machine learning (ML) models have been widely applied to various applications, including image classification, text generation, audio recognition, and graph data analysis. However, recent studies have shown that ML models are vulnerable to membership inference attacks (MIAs), which aim to infer whether a data record was used to train a target model or not. MIAs on ML models can directly lead to a privacy breach. For example, via identifying the fact that a clinical record that has been used to train a model associated with a certain disease, an attacker can infer that the owner of the clinical record has the disease with a high chance. In recent years, MIAs have been shown to be effective on various ML models, e.g., classification models and generative models. Meanwhile, many defense methods have been proposed to mitigate MIAs. Although MIAs on ML models form a newly emerging and rapidly growing research area, there has been no systematic survey on this topic yet. In this article, we conduct the first comprehensive survey on membership inference attacks and defenses. We provide the taxonomies for both attacks and defenses, based on their characterizations, and discuss their pros and cons. Based on the limitations and gaps identified in this survey, we point out several promising future research directions to inspire the researchers who wish to follow this area. This survey not only serves as a reference for the research community but also provides a clear description for researchers outside this research domain. To further help the researchers, we have created an online resource repository, which we will keep updated with future relevant work.

  abstract     = {Fuzz testing (fuzzing) has witnessed its prosperity in detecting security flaws recently. It generates a large number of test cases and monitors the executions for defects. Fuzzing has detected thousands of bugs and vulnerabilities in various applications. Although effective, there lacks systematic analysis of gaps faced by fuzzing. As a technique of defect detection, fuzzing is required to narrow down the gaps between the entire input space and the defect space. Without limitation on the generated inputs, the input space is infinite. However, defects are sparse in an application, which indicates that the defect space is much smaller than the entire input space. Besides, because fuzzing generates numerous test cases to repeatedly examine targets, it requires fuzzing to perform in an automatic manner. Due to the complexity of applications and defects, it is challenging to automatize the execution of diverse applications.

  abstract     = {Industrial cyber-physical systems ( ICPSs ) manage critical infrastructures by controlling the processes based on the “physics” data gathered by edge sensor networks. Recent innovations in ubiquitous computing and communication technologies have prompted the rapid integration of highly interconnected systems to ICPSs. Hence, the “security by obscurity” principle provided by air-gapping is no longer followed. As the interconnectivity in ICPSs increases, so does the attack surface. Industrial vulnerability assessment reports have shown that a variety of new vulnerabilities have occurred due to this transition. Although there are existing surveys in this context, very little is mentioned regarding the outputs of these reports. While these reports show that the most exploited vulnerabilities occur due to weak boundary protection, these vulnerabilities also occur due to limited or ill-defined security policies. However, current literature focuses on intrusion detection systems ( IDSs ), network traffic analysis ( NTA ) methods, or anomaly detection techniques. Hence, finding a solution for the problems mentioned in these reports is relatively hard. We bridge this gap by defining and reviewing ICPSs from a cybersecurity perspective. In particular, multi-dimensional adaptive attack taxonomy is presented and utilized for evaluating real-life ICPS cyber incidents. Finally, we identify the general shortcomings and highlight the points that cause a gap in existing literature while defining future research directions.},

It is one of the most important yet challenging tasks in natural language processing (NLP). Various neural encoder-decoder models have been proposed to achieve the goal by learning to map input text to output text. However, the input text alone often provides limited knowledge to generate the desired output, so the performance of text generation is still far from satisfaction in many real-world scenarios. To address this issue, researchers have considered incorporating (i) internal knowledge embedded in the input text and (ii) external knowledge from outside sources such as knowledge base and knowledge graph into the text generation system. This research topic is known as knowledge-enhanced text generation . In this survey, we present a comprehensive review of the research on this topic over the past five years. The main content includes two parts: (i) general methods and architectures for integrating knowledge into text generation; (ii) specific techniques and applications according to different forms of knowledge data.

This article provides a taxonomy of cognitive concepts and a survey of the literature since the beginning of the Software Engineering discipline. The taxonomy comprises the top-level concepts of perception, attention, memory, cognitive load, reasoning, cognitive biases, knowledge, social cognition, cognitive control, and errors, and procedures to assess them both qualitatively and quantitatively. The taxonomy provides a useful tool to filter existing studies, classify new studies, and support researchers in getting familiar with a (sub) area. In the literature survey, we systematically collected and analysed 311 scientific papers spanning five decades and classified them using the cognitive concepts from the taxonomy. Our analysis shows that the most developed areas of research correspond to the four life-cycle stages, software requirements, design, construction, and maintenance. Most research is quantitative and focuses on knowledge, cognitive load, memory, and reasoning. Overall, the state of the art appears fragmented when viewed from the perspective of cognition. There is a lack of use of cognitive concepts that would represent a coherent picture of the cognitive processes active in specific tasks. Accordingly, we discuss the research gap in each cognitive concept and provide recommendations for future research.},

Assertion-based verification is a promising avenue for efficient hardware validation and debug. In this article, we provide a comprehensive survey of recent progress in assertion-based hardware verification. Specifically, we outline how to define assertions using temporal logic to specify expected behaviors in different abstraction levels. Next, we describe state-of-the art approaches for automated generation of assertions. We also discuss test generation techniques for activating assertions to ensure that the generated assertions are valid. Finally, we present both pre-silicon and post-silicon assertion-based validation approaches that utilize simulation, formal methods as well as hybrid techniques.

The unique features of this computing model include rapid auto-scaling, strong isolation, fine-grained billing options, and access to a massive service ecosystem, which autonomously handles resource management decisions. This model is increasingly being explored for deployments in geographically distributed edge and fog computing networks as well, due to these characteristics. Effective management of computing resources has always gained a lot of attention among researchers. The need to automate the entire process of resource provisioning, allocation, scheduling, monitoring, and scaling has resulted in the need for specialized focus on resource management under the serverless model. In this article, we identify the major aspects covering the broader concept of resource management in serverless environments and propose a taxonomy of elements that influence these aspects, encompassing characteristics of system design, workload attributes, and stakeholder expectations. We take a holistic view on serverless environments deployed across edge, fog, and cloud computing networks. We also analyse existing works discussing aspects of serverless resource management using this taxonomy.

We also introduce the different characteristics of the two major types of ADL, respectively. We summarized three fundamental factors in the designation of a selector.

However, among other challenges such as environmental pollution, cost, maintenance, security, and privacy, the ownership of vehicles (especially for Autonomous Vehicles) is the major obstacle in the realization of this technology at the commercial level. Furthermore, the business model of pay-as-you-go type services further attracts the consumer, because there is no need for upfront investment. In this vein, the idea of car-sharing (aka carpooling) is getting ground due to, at least in part, its simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and affordable choice of transportation. Carpooling systems are still in their infancy and face challenges such as scheduling, matching passengers interests, business model, security, privacy, and communication. To date, a plethora of research work has already been done covering different aspects of carpooling services (ranging from applications to communication and technologies); however, there is still a lack of a holistic, comprehensive survey that can be a one-stop-shop for the researchers in this area to (i) find all the relevant information and (ii) identify the future research directions. To fill these research challenges, this article provides a comprehensive survey on carpooling in autonomous and connected vehicles and covers architecture, components, and solutions, including scheduling, matching, mobility, pricing models of carpooling. We also discuss the current challenges in carpooling and identify future research directions.

However, the highly dynamic and diverse feature of cloud workloads and environments considerably raises the complexity of orchestration mechanisms. Machine learning algorithms are accordingly employed by container orchestration systems for behavior modeling and prediction of multi-dimensional performance metrics. Such insights could further improve the quality of resource provisioning decisions in response to the changing workloads under complex environments.

These works thus encompass several fields of research and demonstrate that multimodality plays a fundamental role in VR, enhancing the experience, improving overall performance, and yielding unprecedented abilities in skill and knowledge transfer.},

Therefore, manufacturers should guarantee that their mobile apps achieve high-quality levels. A good strategy is to include software testing and quality assurance activities during the whole life cycle of such solutions. Problem: Systematically warranting NFRs is not an easy task for any software product. Software engineers must take important decisions before adopting testing techniques and automation tools to support such endeavors. Proposal: To provide to the software engineers with a broad overview of existing dynamic techniques and automation tools for testing mobile apps regarding NFRs. Methods: We planned and conducted a Systematic Mapping Study (SMS) following well-established guidelines for executing secondary studies in software engineering. Results: We found 56 primary studies and characterized their contributions based on testing strategies, testing approaches, explored mobile platforms, and the proposed tools. Conclusions: The characterization allowed us to identify and discuss important trends and opportunities that can benefit both academics and practitioners.},

Like ResNet and EfficientNet, many architectures have achieved outstanding results in at least one dataset by the time of their creation. A critical factor in training concerns the network’s regularization, which prevents the structure from overfitting. This work analyzes several regularization methods developed in the past few years, showing significant improvements for different CNN models. The works are classified into three main areas: the first one is called “data augmentation,” where all the techniques focus on performing changes in the input data. The second, named “internal changes,” aims to describe procedures to modify the feature maps generated by the neural network or the kernels. The last one, called “label,” concerns transforming the labels of a given input. This work presents two main differences comparing to other available surveys about regularization: (i) the first concerns the papers gathered in the manuscript, which are not older than five years, and (ii) the second distinction is about reproducibility, i.e., all works referred here have their code available in public repositories or they have been directly implemented in some framework, such as TensorFlow or Torch.},

  abstract     = {Face recognition (FR) is one of the most popular and long-standing topics in computer vision. With the recent development of deep learning techniques and large-scale datasets, deep face recognition has made remarkable progress and has been widely used in many real-world applications. Given a natural image or video frame as input, an end-to-end deep face recognition system outputs the face feature for recognition. To achieve this, a typical end-to-end system is built with three key elements: face detection, face alignment, and face representation. Face detection locates faces in the image or frame. Then, the face alignment is proceeded to calibrate the faces to the canonical view and crop them with a normalized pixel size. Finally, in the stage of face representation, the discriminative features are extracted from the aligned face for recognition. Nowadays, all of the three elements are fulfilled by the technique of deep convolutional neural network. In this survey article, we present a comprehensive review about the recent advance of each element of the end-to-end deep face recognition, since the thriving deep learning techniques have greatly improved their capability of them. To start with, we present an overview of the end-to-end deep face recognition. Then, we review the advance of each element, respectively, covering many aspects such as the to-date algorithm designs, evaluation metrics, datasets, performance comparison, existing challenges, and promising directions for future research. Also, we provide a detailed discussion about the effect of each element on its subsequent elements and the holistic system. Through this survey, we wish to bring contributions in two aspects: first, readers can conveniently identify the methods which are quite strong-baseline style in the subcategory for further exploration; second, one can also employ suitable methods for establishing a state-of-the-art end-to-end face recognition system from scratch.},

  abstract     = {Oblivious transfer (OT) protocol is an essential tool in cryptography that provides a wide range of applications such as secure multi-party computation, private information retrieval, private set intersection, contract signing, and privacy-preserving location-based services. The OT protocol has different variants such as one-out-of-2, one-out-of- n , k -out-of- n , and OT extension. In the OT (one-out-of-2, one-out-of- n , and OT extension) protocol, the sender has a set of messages, whereas the receiver has a key. The receiver sends that key to the sender in a secure way; the sender cannot get any information about the received key. The sender encrypts every message by operating on every message using the received key and sends all the encrypted messages to the receiver. The receiver is able to extract only the required message using his key. However, in the k -out-of- n OT protocol, the receiver sends a set of k keys to the sender, and in replay, the sender sends all the encrypted messages. The receiver uses his keys and extracts the required messages, but it cannot gain any information about the messages that it has not requested. Generally, the OT protocol requires high communication and computation cost if we transfer millions of oblivious messages. The OT extension protocol provides a solution for this, where the receiver transfers a set of keys to the sender by executing a few numbers of OT protocols. Then, the sender encrypts all the messages using cheap symmetric key cryptography with the help of a received set of keys and transfers millions of oblivious messages to the receiver. In this work, we present different variants of OT protocols such as one-out-of-2, one-out-of- n , k -out-of- n , and OT extension. Furthermore, we cover various aspects of theoretical security guarantees such as semi-honest and malicious adversaries, universally composable, used techniques, computation, and communication efficiency aspects. From the analysis, we found that the semi-honest adversary-based OT protocols required low communication and computation costs as compared to malicious adversary-based OT protocols.},

These models require a large amount of data to avoid the problem of overfitting. One of the data space solutions to the problem of limited data is data augmentation. The purpose of this study focuses on various data augmentation techniques that can be used to further improve the accuracy of a neural network. This saves the cost and time consumption required to collect new data for the training of deep neural networks by augmenting available data. This also regularizes the model and improves its capability of generalization. The need for large datasets in different fields such as computer vision, natural language processing, security, and healthcare is also covered in this survey paper.

  abstract     = {In 2006, Geoffrey Hinton proposed the concept of training “Deep Neural Networks (DNNs)” and an improved model training method to break the bottleneck of neural network development. More recently, the introduction of AlphaGo in 2016 demonstrated the powerful learning ability of deep learning and its enormous potential. Deep learning has been increasingly used to develop state-of-the-art software engineering (SE) research tools due to its ability to boost performance for various SE tasks. There are many factors, e.g., deep learning model selection, internal structure differences, and model optimization techniques, that may have an impact on the performance of DNNs applied in SE. Few works to date focus on summarizing, classifying, and analyzing the application of deep learning techniques in SE. To fill this gap, we performed a survey to analyze the relevant studies published since 2006. We first provide an example to illustrate how deep learning techniques are used in SE. We then conduct a background analysis (BA) of primary studies and present four research questions to describe the trend of DNNs used in SE (BA), summarize and classify different deep learning techniques (RQ1), and analyze the data processing including data collection, data classification, data pre-processing, and data representation (RQ2). In RQ3, we depicted a range of key research topics using DNNs and investigated the relationships between DL-based model adoption and multiple factors (i.e., DL architectures, task types, problem types, and data types). We also summarized commonly used datasets for different SE tasks. In RQ4, we summarized the widely used optimization algorithms and provided important evaluation metrics for different problem types, including regression, classification, recommendation, and generation. Based on our findings, we present a set of current challenges remaining to be investigated and outline a proposed research road map highlighting key opportunities for future work.},

We review this recent progress as well as recent literature utilizing text mining in top IS journals to develop an outline for how future IS research can benefit from these new techniques. Our review of existing IS literature reveals that suboptimal text mining techniques are prevalent and that the more advanced TLMs could be applied to enhance and increase IS research involving text data, and to enable new IS research topics, thus creating more value for the research community. This is possible because these techniques make it easier to develop very powerful custom systems and their performance is superior to existing methods for a wide range of tasks and applications. Further, multilingual language models make possible higher quality text analytics for research in multiple languages. We also identify new avenues for IS research, like language user interfaces, that may offer even greater potential for future IS research.},

  abstract     = {Live video streaming services have experienced significant growth since the emergence of social networking paradigms in recent years. In this scenario, adaptive bitrate streaming communications transmitted on web protocols provide a convenient and cost-efficient facility to serve various multimedia platforms over the Internet. In these communication models, video content is delivered optimally, possibly transcoded, edited automatically, and cached temporarily by network elements along the path. To this end, the computational capabilities of various network elements are considered as major resources to be optimized for service quality improvements. This article provides a contemporary survey of cutting-edge live video streaming studies from a computation-driven perspective. First, an overview of the global standards, system architectures, and streaming protocols is presented. Next, hierarchical computation-driven models of live video streaming are anatomized, including cloud-, edge-, and peer-to-peer-based solutions. Cutting-edge studies are then reviewed to discover the advances they have made in improving system performance in multiple areas. Finally, open challenges are presented to direct future research in this field.},

  abstract     = {Decision trees have the particularity of being machine learning models that are visually easy to interpret and understand. Therefore, they are primarily suited for sensitive domains like medical diagnosis, where decisions need to be explainable. However, if used on complex problems, then decision trees can become large, making them hard to grasp. In addition to this aspect, when learning decision trees, it may be necessary to consider a broader class of constraints, such as the fact that two variables should not be used in a single branch of the tree. This motivates the need to enforce constraints in learning algorithms of decision trees. We propose a survey of works that attempted to solve the problem of learning decision trees under constraints. Our contributions are fourfold. First, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey that deals with constraints on decision trees. Second, we define a flexible taxonomy of constraints applied to decision trees and methods for their treatment in the literature. Third, we benchmark state-of-the art depth-constrained decision tree learners with respect to predictive accuracy and computational time. Fourth, we discuss potential future research directions that would be of interest for researchers who wish to conduct research in this field.},

  abstract     = {Astounding results from Transformer models on natural language tasks have intrigued the vision community to study their application to computer vision problems. Among their salient benefits, Transformers enable modeling long dependencies between input sequence elements and support parallel processing of sequence as compared to recurrent networks, e.g., Long short-term memory. Different from convolutional networks, Transformers require minimal inductive biases for their design and are naturally suited as set-functions. Furthermore, the straightforward design of Transformers allows processing multiple modalities (e.g., images, videos, text, and speech) using similar processing blocks and demonstrates excellent scalability to very large capacity networks and huge datasets. These strengths have led to exciting progress on a number of vision tasks using Transformer networks. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the Transformer models in the computer vision discipline. We start with an introduction to fundamental concepts behind the success of Transformers, i.e., self-attention, large-scale pre-training, and bidirectional feature encoding. We then cover extensive applications of transformers in vision including popular recognition tasks (e.g., image classification, object detection, action recognition, and segmentation), generative modeling, multi-modal tasks (e.g., visual-question answering, visual reasoning, and visual grounding), video processing (e.g., activity recognition, video forecasting), low-level vision (e.g., image super-resolution, image enhancement, and colorization), and three-dimensional analysis (e.g., point cloud classification and segmentation). We compare the respective advantages and limitations of popular techniques both in terms of architectural design and their experimental value. Finally, we provide an analysis on open research directions and possible future works. We hope this effort will ignite further interest in the community to solve current challenges toward the application of transformer models in computer vision.},
