  abstract     = {This article investigates the performance of multistart next ascent hillclimbing and well-known evolutionary algorithms incorporating diversity preservation techniques on instances of the multimodal problem generator. This generator induces a class of problems in the bitstring domain which is interesting to study from a theoretical perspective in the context of multimodal optimization, as it is a generalization of the classical OneMax and TwoMax functions for an arbitrary number of peaks. An average-case runtime analysis for multistart next ascent hillclimbing is presented for uniformly distributed equal-height instances of this class of problems. It is shown empirically that conventional niching and mating restriction techniques incorporated in an evolutionary algorithm are not sufficient to make them competitive with the hillclimbing strategy. We conjecture the reason for this behavior is the lack of structure in the space of local optima on instances of this problem class, which makes an optimization algorithm unable to exploit information from one optimum to infer where another optimum might be. When no such structure exists, it seems that the best strategy for discovering all optima is a brute-force one. Overall, our study gives insights with respect to the adequacy of hillclimbers and evolutionary algorithms for multimodal optimization, depending on properties of the fitness landscape.},

  abstract     = {We propose a novel constraint-handling technique for the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES). The proposed technique is aimed at solving explicitly constrained black-box continuous optimization problems, in which the explicit constraint is a constraint whereby the computational time for the constraint violation and its (numerical) gradient are negligible compared to that for the objective function. This method is designed to realize two invariance properties: invariance to the affine transformation of the search space, and invariance to the increasing transformation of the objective and constraint functions. The CMA-ES is designed to possess these properties for handling difficulties that appear in black-box optimization problems, such as non-separability, ill-conditioning, ruggedness, and the different orders of magnitude in the objective. The proposed constraint-handling technique (CHT), known as ARCH, modifies the underlying CMA-ES only in terms of the ranking of the candidate solutions. It employs a repair operator and an adaptive ranking aggregation strategy to compute the ranking. We developed test problems to evaluate the effects of the invariance properties, and performed experiments to empirically verify the invariance of the algorithm. We compared the proposed method with other CHTs on the CEC 2006 constrained optimization benchmark suite to demonstrate its efficacy. Empirical studies reveal that ARCH is able to exploit the explicitness of the constraint functions effectively, sometimes even more efficiently than an existing box-constraint handling technique on box-constrained problems, while exhibiting the invariance properties. Moreover, ARCH overwhelmingly outperforms CHTs by not exploiting the explicit constraints in terms of the number of objective function calls.},

This article addresses the question of how successful and well performing Evolution-in-Materio processors can be designed through the selection of nanomaterials and an evolutionary algorithm for a target application. A physical model of a nanomaterial network is developed which allows for both randomness, and the possibility of Ohmic and non-Ohmic conduction, that are characteristic of such materials. These differing networks are then exploited by differential evolution, which optimises several configuration parameters (e.g., configuration voltages, weights, etc.), to solve different classification problems. We show that ideal nanomaterial choice depends upon problem complexity, with more complex problems being favoured by complex voltage dependence of conductivity and vice versa. Furthermore, we highlight how intrinsic nanomaterial electrical properties can be exploited by differing configuration parameters, clarifying the role and limitations of these techniques. These findings provide guidance for the rational design of nanomaterials and algorithms for future Evolution-in-Materio processors.},

Applications of evolutionary algorithms to non-cooperative simultaneous games have been limited due to challenges in guiding the evolutionary search toward equilibria, which are usually inferior points in the objective space. We propose a regret-based approach to select candidate decision options of the players for the next generation in a multipopulation genetic algorithm called Regret-Based Nash Equilibrium Sorting Genetic Algorithm (RNESGA). We show that RNESGA can converge to multiple Nash equilibria in a single run using two- and three- player competitive knapsack games and other games from the literature.

  abstract     = {An optimal recombination operator for two-parent solutions provides the best solution among those that take the value for each variable from one of the parents (gene transmission property). If the solutions are bit strings, the offspring of an optimal recombination operator is optimal in the smallest hyperplane containing the two parent solutions. Exploring this hyperplane is computationally costly, in general, requiring exponential time in the worst case. However, when the variable interaction graph of the objective function is sparse, exploration can be done in polynomial time. In this article, we present a recombination operator, called Dynastic Potential Crossover (DPX), that runs in polynomial time and behaves like an optimal recombination operator for low-epistasis combinatorial problems. We compare this operator, both theoretically and experimentally, with traditional crossover operators, like uniform crossover and network crossover, and with two recently defined efficient recombination operators: partition crossover and articulation points partition crossover. The empirical comparison uses NKQ Landscapes and MAX-SAT instances. DPX outperforms the other crossover operators in terms of quality of the offspring and provides better results included in a trajectory and a population-based metaheuristic, but it requires more time and memory to compute the offspring.},

  abstract     = {The most relevant property that a quality indicator (QI) is expected to have is Pareto compliance, which means that every time an approximation set strictly dominates another in a Pareto sense, the indicator must reflect this. The hypervolume indicator and its variants are the only unary QIs known to be Pareto-compliant but there are many commonly used weakly Pareto-compliant indicators such as R2, IGD + ⁠ , and ε + ⁠ . Currently, an open research area is related to finding new Pareto-compliant indicators whose preferences are different from those of the hypervolume indicator. In this article, we propose a theoretical basis to combine existing weakly Pareto-compliant indicators with at least one being Pareto-compliant, such that the resulting combined indicator is Pareto-compliant as well. Most importantly, we show that the combination of Pareto-compliant QIs with weakly Pareto-compliant indicators leads to indicators that inherit properties of the weakly compliant indicators in terms of optimal point distributions. The consequences of these new combined indicators are threefold: (1) to increase the variety of available Pareto-compliant QIs by correcting weakly Pareto-compliant indicators, (2) to introduce a general framework for the combination of QIs, and (3) to generate new selection mechanisms for multiobjective evolutionary algorithms where it is possible to achieve/adjust desired distributions on the Pareto front.},

This study investigates the effects of MOEA/D with the Partial Update Strategy (PS) in an extensive set of MOPs to generate insights into correspondences of MOEA/D with the partial update and MOEA/D with small population size and big population size. Our work undertakes an in-depth analysis of the populational dynamics behaviour considering their final approximation Pareto sets, anytime hypervolume performance, attained regions, and number of unique nondominated solutions. Our results indicate that MOEA/D with partial update progresses with the search as fast as MOEA/D with small population size and explores the search space as MOEA/D with big population size. MOEA/D with partial update can mitigate common problems related to population size choice with better convergence speed in most MOPs, as shown by the results of hypervolume and number of unique nondominated solutions, and as the anytime performance and Empirical Attainment Function indicate.},

  abstract     = {Domination-based multiobjective (MO) evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are today arguably the most frequently used type of MOEA. These methods, however, stagnate when the majority of the population becomes nondominated, preventing further convergence to the Pareto set. Hypervolume-based MO optimization has shown promising results to overcome this. Direct use of the hypervolume, however, results in no selection pressure for dominated solutions. The recently introduced Sofomore framework overcomes this by solving multiple interleaved single-objective dynamic problems that iteratively improve a single approximation set, based on the uncrowded hypervolume improvement (UHVI). It thereby however loses many advantages of population-based MO optimization, such as handling multimodality. Here, we reformulate the UHVI as a quality measure for approximation sets, called the uncrowded hypervolume (UHV), which can be used to directly solve MO optimization problems with a single-objective optimizer. We use the state-of-the-art gene-pool optimal mixing evolutionary algorithm (GOMEA) that is capable of efficiently exploiting the intrinsically available grey-box properties of this problem. The resulting algorithm, UHV-GOMEA, is compared with Sofomore equipped with GOMEA, and the domination-based MO-GOMEA. In doing so, we investigate in which scenarios either domination-based or hypervolume-based methods are preferred. Finally, we construct a simple hybrid approach that combines MO-GOMEA with UHV-GOMEA and outperforms both.},

MGE also enhances the state-of-the-art Grammatical Evolution (GE) methods in two directions. First, MGE&#39;s representation is modular in that each individual has a set of genes, and each gene is mapped to a neuron by grammatical rules. Second, the proposed representation mitigates two important drawbacks of GE, namely the low scalability and weak locality of representation, toward generating modular and multilayer networks with a high number of neurons. We define and evaluate five different forms of structures with and without modularity using MGE and find single-layer modules with no coupling more productive. Our experiments demonstrate that modularity helps in finding better neural networks faster. We have validated the proposed method using ten well-known classification benchmarks with different sizes, feature counts, and output class counts. Our experimental results indicate that MGE provides superior accuracy with respect to existing NeuroEvolution methods and returns classifiers that are significantly simpler than other machine learning generated classifiers. Finally, we empirically demonstrate that MGE outperforms other GE methods in terms of locality and scalability properties.},

Our novel Variable Space Diversity-based MOEA ( vsd-moea ) explicitly considers the diversity of both decision variable and objective function space. This information is used with the aim of properly adapting the balance between exploration and intensification during the optimization process. Particularly, at the initial stages, decisions made by the approach are more biased by the information on the diversity of the variable space, whereas it gradually grants more importance to the diversity of objective function space as the evolution progresses. The latter is achieved through a novel density estimator. The new method is compared with state-of-art moea s using several benchmarks with two and three objectives. This novel proposal yields much better results than state-of-the-art schemes when considering metrics applied on objective function space, exhibiting a more stable and robust behavior.},

  abstract     = {Several test function suites are being used for numerical benchmarking of multiobjective optimization algorithms. While they have some desirable properties, such as well-understood Pareto sets and Pareto fronts of various shapes, most of the currently used functions possess characteristics that are arguably underrepresented in real-world problems such as separability, optima located exactly at the boundary constraints, and the existence of variables that solely control the distance between a solution and the Pareto front. Via the alternative construction of combining existing single-objective problems from the literature, we describe the bbob-biobj test suite with 55 bi-objective functions in continuous domain, and its extended version with 92 bi-objective functions ( bbob-biobj-ext ). Both test suites have been implemented in the COCO platform for black-box optimization benchmarking and various visualizations of the test functions are shown to reveal their properties. Besides providing details on the construction of these problems and presenting their (known) properties, this article also aims at giving the rationale behind our approach in terms of groups of functions with similar properties, objective space normalization, and problem instances. The latter allows us to easily compare the performance of deterministic and stochastic solvers, which is an often overlooked issue in benchmarking.},

  abstract     = {An important challenge in reinforcement learning is to solve multimodal problems, where agents have to act in qualitatively different ways depending on the circumstances. Because multimodal problems are often too difficult to solve directly, it is often helpful to define a curriculum, which is an ordered set of subtasks that can serve as the stepping stones for solving the overall problem. Unfortunately, choosing an effective ordering for these subtasks is difficult, and a poor ordering can reduce the performance of the learning process. Here, we provide a thorough introduction and investigation of the Combinatorial Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithm (CMOEA), which allows all combinations of subtasks to be explored simultaneously. We compare CMOEA against three algorithms that can similarly optimize on multiple subtasks simultaneously: NSGA-II, NSGA-III, and ε -Lexicase Selection. The algorithms are tested on a function-optimization problem with two subtasks, a simulated multimodal robot locomotion problem with six subtasks, and a simulated robot maze-navigation problem where a hundred random mazes are treated as subtasks. On these problems, CMOEA either outperforms or is competitive with the controls. As a separate contribution, we show that adding a linear combination over all objectives can improve the ability of the control algorithms to solve these multimodal problems. Lastly, we show that CMOEA can leverage auxiliary objectives more effectively than the controls on the multimodal locomotion task. In general, our experiments suggest that CMOEA is a promising algorithm for solving multimodal problems.},

  abstract     = {High-dimensional unbalanced classification is challenging because of the joint effects of high dimensionality and class imbalance. Genetic programming (GP) has the potential benefits for use in high-dimensional classification due to its built-in capability to select informative features. However, once data are not evenly distributed, GP tends to develop biased classifiers which achieve a high accuracy on the majority class but a low accuracy on the minority class. Unfortunately, the minority class is often at least as important as the majority class. It is of importance to investigate how GP can be effectively utilized for high-dimensional unbalanced classification. In this article, to address the performance bias issue of GP, a new two-criterion fitness function is developed, which considers two criteria, that is, the approximation of area under the curve (AUC) and the classification clarity (i.e., how well a program can separate two classes). The obtained values on the two criteria are combined in pairs, instead of summing them together. Furthermore, this article designs a three-criterion tournament selection to effectively identify and select good programs to be used by genetic operators for generating offspring during the evolutionary learning process. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves better classification performance than other compared methods.},

  abstract     = {We investigate the addition of constraints on the function image and its derivatives for the incorporation of prior knowledge in symbolic regression. The approach is called shape-constrained symbolic regression and allows us to enforce, for example, monotonicity of the function over selected inputs. The aim is to find models which conform to expected behavior and which have improved extrapolation capabilities. We demonstrate the feasibility of the idea and propose and compare two evolutionary algorithms for shape-constrained symbolic regression: (i) an extension of tree-based genetic programming which discards infeasible solutions in the selection step, and (ii) a two-population evolutionary algorithm that separates the feasible from the infeasible solutions. In both algorithms we use interval arithmetic to approximate bounds for models and their partial derivatives. The algorithms are tested on a set of 19 synthetic and four real-world regression problems. Both algorithms are able to identify models which conform to shape constraints which is not the case for the unmodified symbolic regression algorithms. However, the predictive accuracy of models with constraints is worse on the training set and the test set. Shape-constrained polynomial regression produces the best results for the test set but also significantly larger models.},

  abstract     = {Linear Genetic Programming (LGP) represents programs as sequences of instructions and has a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) dataflow. The results of instructions are stored in registers that can be used as arguments by other instructions. Instructions that are disconnected from the main part of the program are called noneffective instructions, or structural introns. They also appear in other DAG-based GP approaches like Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP). This article studies four hypotheses on the role of structural introns: noneffective instructions (1) serve as evolutionary memory, where evolved information is stored and later used in search, (2) preserve population diversity, (3) allow neutral search, where structural introns increase the number of neutral mutations and improve performance, and (4) serve as genetic material to enable program growth. We study different variants of LGP controlling the influence of introns for symbolic regression, classification, and digital circuits problems. We find that there is (1) evolved information in the noneffective instructions that can be reactivated and that (2) structural introns can promote programs with higher effective diversity. However, both effects have no influence on LGP search performance. On the other hand, allowing mutations to not only be applied to effective but also to noneffective instructions (3) increases the rate of neutral mutations and (4) contributes to program growth by making use of the genetic material available as structural introns. This comes along with a significant increase of LGP performance, which makes structural introns important for LGP.},

  abstract     = {Niching methods have been developed to maintain the population diversity, to investigate many peaks in parallel, and to reduce the effect of genetic drift. We present the first rigorous runtime analyses of restricted tournament selection (RTS), embedded in a ( ⁠ μ + 1) EA, and analyse its effectiveness at finding both optima of the bimodal function TwoMax . In RTS, an offspring competes against the closest individual, with respect to some distance measure, amongst w (window size) population members (chosen uniformly at random with replacement), to encourage competition within the same niche. We prove that RTS finds both optima on TwoMax efficiently if the window size w is large enough. However, if w is too small, RTS fails to find both optima even in exponential time, with high probability. We further consider a variant of RTS selecting individuals for the tournament without replacement. It yields a more diverse tournament and is more effective at preventing one niche from taking over the other. However, this comes at the expense of a slower progress towards optima when a niche collapses to a single individual. Our theoretical results are accompanied by experimental studies that shed light on parameters not covered by the theoretical results and support a conjectured lower runtime bound.},
