  abstract     = {Abstract. The brain is a frustrated system that contains conflictual link arrangements named frustration. The frustration as a source of disorder prevents the system from settling into low-energy states and provides flexibility for brain network organization. In this research, we tried to identify the pattern of frustration formation in the brain at the levels of region, connection, canonical network, and hemisphere. We found that frustration formation has no uniform pattern. Some subcortical elements have an active role in frustration formation, despite low contributions from many cortical elements. Frustrating connections are mostly between-network connections, and triadic frustrations are mainly formed between three regions from three distinct canonical networks. We did not find any significant differences between brain hemispheres or any robust differences between the frustration formation patterns of various life-span stages. Our results may be interesting for those who study the organization of brain links and promising for those who want to manipulate brain networks.Author Summary. Brain network analysis approaches commonly ignore the signs of links. Frustration is a fascinating phenomenon referring to the conflictual arrangements of signed links. As a source of instability, it can give valuable information on altering components of a network. It can specify which brain network elements intend to drive brain network alterations. Accordingly, we tried to identify the pattern of frustration formation in the brain network, which brain network elements are more frustrated and which ones are less frustrated. We provided some maps for frustration formation in the levels of region, connection, canonical network, and hemisphere. The introduced concept of frustration and our results may be interesting for brain network scientists.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Hunger and satiety drive eating behaviours via changes in brain function. The hypothalamus is a central component of the brain networks that regulate food intake. Animal research parsed the roles of the lateral hypothalamus (LH) and medial hypothalamus (MH) in hunger and satiety, respectively. Here, we examined how hunger and satiety change information flow between human LH and MH brain networks, and how these interactions are influenced by body mass index (BMI). Forty participants (16 overweight/obese) underwent two resting-state functional MRI scans while being fasted and sated. The excitatory/inhibitory influence of information flow between the MH and LH was modelled using spectral dynamic causal modelling. Our results revealed two core networks interacting across homeostatic state and weight: subcortical bidirectional connections between the LH, MH and the substantia nigra pars compacta (prSN), and cortical top-down inhibition from fronto-parietal and temporal areas. During fasting, we found higher inhibition between the LH and prSN, whereas the prSN received greater top-down inhibition from across the cortex. Individuals with higher BMI showed that these network dynamics occur irrespective of homeostatic state. Our findings reveal fasting affects brain dynamics over a distributed hypothalamic-midbrain-cortical network. This network is less sensitive to state-related fluctuations among people with obesity.Author Summary. The hypothalamus is a central component of the brain networks regulating food intake. Animal research subdivided the hypothalamus anatomically and functionally into lateral hypothalamus (LH) and medial hypothalamus (MH). This is the first study showing how the LH and MH causally interact with other neural regions and how their dynamics change with weight and homeostasis in humans. Adopting state-of-the-art spectral dynamic causal modelling of resting-state fMRI data, we provide new insights into how homeostasis affect hypothalamic circuit dynamics, which involve a distributed network of midbrain and cortical areas with a key role of the substantia nigra. We identified unique aspects of network organisation associated with obesity involving reciprocal connections between the LH and MH, and input from the substantia nigra to the MH.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Here, we propose a novel technique to investigate nonlinear interactions between brain regions that captures both the strength and type of the functional relationship. Inspired by the field of functional analysis, we propose that the relationship between activity in separate brain areas can be viewed as a point in function space, identified by coordinates along an infinite set of basis functions. Using Hermite polynomials as bases, we estimate a subset of these values that serve as “functional coordinates,” characterizing the interaction between BOLD activity across brain areas. We provide a proof of the convergence of the estimates in the limit, and we validate the method with simulations in which the ground truth is known, additionally showing that functional coordinates detect statistical dependence even when correlations (“functional connectivity”) approach zero. We then use functional coordinates to examine neural interactions with a chosen seed region: the fusiform face area (FFA). Using k-means clustering across each voxel’s functional coordinates, we illustrate that adding nonlinear basis functions allows for the discrimination of interregional interactions that are otherwise grouped together when using only linear dependence. Finally, we show that regions in V5 and medial occipital and temporal lobes exhibit significant nonlinear interactions with the FFA.Author Summary. In this paper, we introduce a new method to investigate not only whether a set of brain areas interact, but also how the activity in those regions is related. To do this, we model the functional relationships between activity in distinct brain areas as points in a function space that can be described by “functional coordinates” along multiple basis functions. First, we demonstrate the efficacy of this novel method on simulated data; next, we apply it to real neural data, reporting evidence of nonlinear interactions. Functional coordinates can serve as a tool in future studies to further our understanding of the complex interactions across the brain.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. How communication among neuronal ensembles shapes functional brain dynamics is a question of fundamental importance to neuroscience. Communication in the brain can be viewed as a product of the interaction of node activities with the structural network over which these activities flow. The study of these interactions is, however, restricted by the difficulties in describing the complex dynamics of the brain. There is thus a need to develop methods to study these network-dynamical interactions and how they impact information flow, without having to ascertain dynamics a priori or resort to restrictive analytical approaches. Here, we adapt a recently established network analysis method based on perturbations, it to a neuroscientific setting to study how information flow in the brain can raise from properties of underlying structure. For proof-of-concept, we apply the approach on in silico whole-brain models. We expound on the functional implications of the distributions of metrics that capture network-dynamical interactions, termed net influence and flow. We also study the network-dynamical interactions at the level of resting-state networks. An attractive feature of this method is its simplicity, which allows a direct translation to an experimental or clinical setting, such as for identifying targets for stimulation studies or therapeutic interventions.Author Summary. In this work, we use controlled perturbations in silico to identify regions that influence and mediate information flow in active brain networks. Conventional approaches of identifying such regions require the extensive analytical treatment of mathematical models describing node dynamics, thus restricting its scope only to systems where such models have been defined. The presented formalism can identify regions of dynamical and functional importance by simply measuring responses to perturbations, and can thus be applied at any scale where regions can be perturbed, and without any prerequisite information about node dynamics. Furthermore, the relation of metrics to interregional communication, functional capabilities, and structure-function mapping in general affords them considerable practical importance, especially for identifying targets for therapeutic interventions.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. An important goal in systems neuroscience is to understand the structure of neuronal interactions, frequently approached by studying functional relations between recorded neuronal signals. Commonly used pairwise measures (e.g., correlation coefficient) offer limited insight, neither addressing the specificity of estimated neuronal interactions nor potential synergistic coupling between neuronal signals. Tripartite measures, such as partial correlation, variance partitioning, and partial information decomposition, address these questions by disentangling functional relations into interpretable information atoms (unique, redundant, and synergistic). Here, we apply these tripartite measures to simulated neuronal recordings to investigate their sensitivity to noise. We find that the considered measures are mostly accurate and specific for signals with noiseless sources but experience significant bias for noisy sources.We show that permutation testing of such measures results in high false positive rates even for small noise fractions and large data sizes. We present a conservative null hypothesis for significance testing of tripartite measures, which significantly decreases false positive rate at a tolerable expense of increasing false negative rate. We hope our study raises awareness about the potential pitfalls of significance testing and of interpretation of functional relations, offering both conceptual and practical advice.Author Summary. Tripartite functional relation measures enable the study of interesting effects in neural recordings, such as redundancy, functional connection specificity, and synergistic coupling. However, estimators of such relations are commonly validated using noiseless signals, whereas neural recordings typically contain noise. Here we systematically study the performance of tripartite estimators using simulated noisy neural signals. We demonstrate that permutation testing is not a robust procedure for inferring ground truth statistical relations from commonly used tripartite relation estimators. We develop an adjusted conservative testing procedure, reducing false positive rates of the studied estimators when applied to noisy data. Besides addressing significance testing, our results should aid in accurate interpretation of tripartite functional relations and functional connectivity.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Structural connectivity provides the backbone for communication between neural populations. Since axonal transmission occurs on a millisecond time scale, measures of M/EEG functional connectivity sensitive to phase synchronization, such as coherence, are expected to reflect structural connectivity. We develop a model of MEG functional connectivity whose edges are constrained by the structural connectome. The edge strengths are defined by partial coherence, a measure of conditional dependence. We build a new method—the adaptive graphical lasso (AGL)—to fit the partial coherence to perform inference on the hypothesis that the structural connectome is reflected in MEG functional connectivity. In simulations, we demonstrate that the structural connectivity’s influence on the partial coherence can be inferred using the AGL. Further, we show that fitting the partial coherence is superior to alternative methods at recovering the structural connectome, even after the source localization estimates required to map MEG from sensors to the cortex. Finally, we show how partial coherence can be used to explore how distinct parts of the structural connectome contribute to MEG functional connectivity in different frequency bands. Partial coherence offers better estimates of the strength of direct functional connections and consequently a potentially better estimate of network structure.},

Neurophysiological signals across different spatial and temporal scales provide insight into neural communication. However, additional methodological considerations arise when investigating network-wide brain dynamics rather than local effects. Specifically, larger amounts of data, investigated across a higher dimensional space, are necessary. Here, we present FiNN (Find Neurophysiological Networks), a novel toolbox for the analysis of neurophysiological data with a focus on functional and effective connectivity. FiNN provides a wide range of data processing methods and statistical and visualization tools to facilitate inspection of connectivity estimates and the resulting metrics of brain dynamics. The Python toolbox and its documentation are freely available as Supporting Information. We evaluated FiNN against a number of established frameworks on both a conceptual and an implementation level. We found FiNN to require much less processing time and memory than other toolboxes. In addition, FiNN adheres to a design philosophy of easy access and modifiability, while providing efficient data processing implementations. Since the investigation of network-level neural dynamics is experiencing increasing interest, we place FiNN at the disposal of the neuroscientific community as open-source software.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Criticality is hypothesized as a physical mechanism underlying efficient transitions between cortical states and remarkable information-processing capacities in the brain. While considerable evidence generally supports this hypothesis, nonnegligible controversies persist regarding the ubiquity of criticality in neural dynamics and its role in information processing. Validity issues frequently arise during identifying potential brain criticality from empirical data. Moreover, the functional benefits implied by brain criticality are frequently misconceived or unduly generalized. These problems stem from the nontriviality and immaturity of the physical theories that analytically derive brain criticality and the statistic techniques that estimate brain criticality from empirical data. To help solve these problems, we present a systematic review and reformulate the foundations of studying brain criticality, that is, ordinary criticality (OC), quasi-criticality (qC), self-organized criticality (SOC), and self-organized quasi-criticality (SOqC), using the terminology of neuroscience. We offer accessible explanations of the physical theories and statistical techniques of brain criticality, providing step-by-step derivations to characterize neural dynamics as a physical system with avalanches. We summarize error-prone details and existing limitations in brain criticality analysis and suggest possible solutions. Moreover, we present a forward-looking perspective on how optimizing the foundations of studying brain criticality can deepen our understanding of various neuroscience questions.Author Summary. The brain criticality hypothesis is one of the most focused and controversial topics in neuroscience and biophysics. This research develops a unified framework to reformulate the physics theories of four basic types of brain criticality, ordinary criticality (OC), quasi-criticality (qC), self-organized criticality (SOC), and self-organized quasi-criticality (SOqC), into more accessible and neuroscience-related forms. For the statistic techniques used to validate the brain criticality hypothesis, we also present comprehensive explanations of them, summarize their error-prone details, and suggest possible solutions. This framework may help resolve potential controversies in studying the brain criticality hypothesis, especially those arising from the misconceptions about the theoretical foundations of brain criticality.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Systems neuroscience is facing an ever-growing mountain of data. Recent advances in protein engineering and microscopy have together led to a paradigm shift in neuroscience; using fluorescence, we can now image the activity of every neuron through the whole brain of behaving animals. Even in larger organisms, the number of neurons that we can record simultaneously is increasing exponentially with time. This increase in the dimensionality of the data is being met with an explosion of computational and mathematical methods, each using disparate terminology, distinct approaches, and diverse mathematical concepts. Here we collect, organize, and explain multiple data analysis techniques that have been, or could be, applied to whole-brain imaging, using larval zebrafish as an example model. We begin with methods such as linear regression that are designed to detect relations between two variables. Next, we progress through network science and applied topological methods, which focus on the patterns of relations among many variables. Finally, we highlight the potential of generative models that could provide testable hypotheses on wiring rules and network progression through time, or disease progression. While we use examples of imaging from larval zebrafish, these approaches are suitable for any population-scale neural network modeling, and indeed, to applications beyond systems neuroscience. Computational approaches from network science and applied topology are not limited to larval zebrafish, or even to systems neuroscience, and we therefore conclude with a discussion of how such methods can be applied to diverse problems across the biological sciences.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Psychedelic drugs show promise as safe and effective treatments for neuropsychiatric disorders, yet their mechanisms of action are not fully understood. A fundamental hypothesis is that psychedelics work by dose-dependently changing the functional hierarchy of brain dynamics, but it is unclear whether different psychedelics act similarly. Here, we investigated the changes in the brain’s functional hierarchy associated with two different psychedelics (LSD and psilocybin). Using a novel turbulence framework, we were able to determine the vorticity, that is, the local level of synchronization, that allowed us to extend the standard global time-based measure of metastability to become a local-based measure of both space and time. This framework produced detailed signatures of turbulence-based hierarchical change for each psychedelic drug, revealing consistent and discriminate effects on a higher level network, that is, the default mode network. Overall, our findings directly support a prior hypothesis that psychedelics modulate (i.e., “compress”) the functional hierarchy and provide a quantification of these changes for two different psychedelics. Implications for therapeutic applications of psychedelics are discussed.Author Summary. Significant progress has been made in understanding the effects of psychedelics on brain function. One of the main hypotheses is that psychedelics work by changing the functional hierarchy of brain dynamics in a dose-dependent manner, modulating the encoding of the precision of priors, beliefs, or assumptions in the brain.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Major depressive disorder is a heterogeneous diagnostic category with multiple available treatments. With the goal of optimizing treatment selection, researchers are developing computational models that attempt to predict treatment response based on various pretreatment measures. In this paper, we review studies that use brain activity data to predict treatment response. Our aim is to highlight and clarify important methodological differences between various studies that relate to the incorporation of domain knowledge, specifically within two approaches delineated as data-driven and theory-driven. We argue that theory-driven generative modeling, which explicitly models information processing in the brain and thus can capture disease mechanisms, is a promising emerging approach that is only beginning to be utilized in treatment response prediction. The predictors extracted via such models could improve interpretability, which is critical for clinical decision-making. We also identify several methodological limitations across the reviewed studies and provide suggestions for addressing them. Namely, we consider problems with dichotomizing treatment outcomes, the importance of investigating more than one treatment in a given study for differential treatment response predictions, the need for a patient-centered approach for defining treatment outcomes, and finally, the use of internal and external validation methods for improving model generalizability.Author Summary. Individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) vary in their response to available treatments, rendering treatment selection a challenging task. In this paper, we review studies applying computational models for predicting treatment response in MDD based on measures of brain activity. We discuss methodological differences across studies, focusing on how they incorporate existing knowledge about MDD and how that affects interpretability of model predictions. In this context, we argue that theory-driven generative modeling, which explicitly models information processing in the brain and thus can capture disease mechanisms, is a promising emerging approach for treatment response prediction. Finally, we identify several other important limitations that are holding back the translation of these tools into clinical practice.},

In the first step, the pipeline employs a nonparametric Bayesian clustering method that can estimate the optimal number of clusters, cluster assignments of brain regions of interest (ROIs), and the strength of within- and between-cluster connections without any prior knowledge. In the second step, a factor analysis model is applied to functional data with factors defined as the obtained structural clusters and the factor structure informed by the structural network. The coactivations of ROIs and their clusters can be studied by correlations between factors, which can largely differ by ongoing cognitive task. We provide a simulation study to validate that the pipeline can recover the underlying structural and functional network. We also apply the proposed pipeline to empirical data to explore the structural network of ROIs obtained by the Gordon parcellation and study their functional coactivations across eight cognitive tasks and a resting-state condition.Author Summary.

This paper integrates emerging evidence from two broad streams of scientific literature into one common framework: (a) hierarchical gradients of functional connectivity that reflect the brain’s large-scale structural architecture (e.g., a lamination gradient in the cerebral cortex); and (b) approaches to predictive processing and one of its specific instantiations called allostasis (i.e., the predictive regulation of energetic resources in the service of coordinating the body’s internal systems). This synthesis begins to sketch a coherent, neurobiologically inspired framework suggesting that predictive energy regulation is at the core of human brain function, and by extension, psychological and behavioral phenomena, providing a shared vocabulary for theory building and knowledge accumulation.Author Summary. Allostasis refers to the process by which the brain anticipates the needs of the body and attempts to meet those needs before they arise, and is one specific instantiation of a broader predictive processing framework. In this perspective article, we propose that allostasis is a basic function of the human brain subserved by an intrinsic architecture composed of two hierarchical functional gradients.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Spontaneous brain activity changes across states of consciousness. A particular consciousness-mediated configuration is the anticorrelations between the default mode network and other brain regions. What this antagonistic organization implies about consciousness to date remains inconclusive. In this Perspective Article, we propose that anticorrelations are the physiological expression of the concept of segregation, namely the brain’s capacity to show selectivity in the way areas will be functionally connected. We postulate that this effect is mediated by the process of neural inhibition, by regulating global and local inhibitory activity. While recognizing that this effect can also result from other mechanisms, neural inhibition helps the understanding of how network metastability is affected after disrupting local and global neural balance. In combination with relevant theories of consciousness, we suggest that anticorrelations are a physiological prior that can work as a marker of preserved consciousness. We predict that if the brain is not in a state to host anticorrelations, then most likely the individual does not entertain subjective experience. We believe that this link between anticorrelations and the underlying physiology will help not only to comprehend how consciousness happens, but also conceptualize effective interventions for treating consciousness disorders in which anticorrelations seem particularly affected.Author Summary. The fMRI resting paradigm can quantify brain function by surpassing communication and sophisticated setups, hence helping to infer consciousness in individuals who are unable to communicate with their environment. A particular consciousness-mediated rsfMRI configuration is that of functional anticorrelations, that is, the antagonistic relationship between a specific set of brain regions. We suggest that anticorrelations are a key physiological prior, without which consciousness cannot be supported, because the brain cannot segregate how regions get connected. We postulate that segregation is possible thanks to neural inhibition, by regulating global and local inhibitory activity. We believe that the link between anticorrelations and the underlying physiology can help not only to comprehend how consciousness happens, but also conceptualize effective interventions for treating its disorders.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Animal brains evolved to optimize behavior in dynamic environments, flexibly selecting actions that maximize future rewards in different contexts. A large body of experimental work indicates that such optimization changes the wiring of neural circuits, appropriately mapping environmental input onto behavioral outputs. A major unsolved scientific question is how optimal wiring adjustments, which must target the connections responsible for rewards, can be accomplished when the relation between sensory inputs, action taken, and environmental context with rewards is ambiguous. The credit assignment problem can be categorized into context-independent structural credit assignment and context-dependent continual learning. In this perspective, we survey prior approaches to these two problems and advance the notion that the brain’s specialized neural architectures provide efficient solutions. Within this framework, the thalamus with its cortical and basal ganglia interactions serves as a systems-level solution to credit assignment. Specifically, we propose that thalamocortical interaction is the locus of meta-learning where the thalamus provides cortical control functions that parametrize the cortical activity association space. By selecting among these control functions, the basal ganglia hierarchically guide thalamocortical plasticity across two timescales to enable meta-learning. The faster timescale establishes contextual associations to enable behavioral flexibility, while the slower one enables generalization to new contexts.Author Summary. Deep learning has shown great promise over the last decades, allowing artificial neural networks to solve difficult tasks. The key to success is the optimization process by which task errors are translated to connectivity patterns. A major unsolved question is how the brain optimally adjusts the wiring of neural circuits to minimize task error analogously. In our perspective, we advance the notion that the brain’s specialized architecture is part of the solution and spell out a path towards its theoretical, computational, and experimental testing. Specifically, we propose that the interaction between the cortex, thalamus, and basal ganglia induces plasticity in two timescales to enable flexible behaviors. The faster timescale establishes contextual associations to enable behavioral flexibility, while the slower one enables generalization to new contexts.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Most human neuroscience research to date has focused on statistical approaches that describe stationary patterns of localized neural activity or blood flow. While these patterns are often interpreted in light of dynamic, information-processing concepts, the static, local, and inferential nature of the statistical approach makes it challenging to directly link neuroimaging results to plausible underlying neural mechanisms. Here, we argue that dynamical systems theory provides the crucial mechanistic framework for characterizing both the brain’s time-varying quality and its partial stability in the face of perturbations, and hence, that this perspective can have a profound impact on the interpretation of human neuroimaging results and their relationship with behavior. After briefly reviewing some key terminology, we identify three key ways in which neuroimaging analyses can embrace a dynamical systems perspective: by shifting from a local to a more global perspective, by focusing on dynamics instead of static snapshots of neural activity, and by embracing modeling approaches that map neural dynamics using “forward” models. Through this approach, we envisage ample opportunities for neuroimaging researchers to enrich their understanding of the dynamic neural mechanisms that support a wide array of brain functions, both in health and in the setting of psychopathology.Author Summary. The study of dynamical systems offers a powerful framework for interpreting neuroimaging data from a range of different contexts, however, as a field, we have yet to fully embrace the power of this approach. Here, we offer a brief overview of some key terms from the dynamical systems literature, and then highlight three ways in which neuroimaging studies can begin to embrace the dynamical systems approach: by shifting from local to global descriptions of activity, by moving from static to dynamic analyses, and by transitioning from descriptive to generative models of neural activity patterns.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. What structural and connectivity features of the human brain help to explain the extraordinary human cognitive abilities? We recently proposed a set of relevant connectomic fundamentals, some of which arise from the size scaling of the human brain relative to other primate brains, while others of these fundamentals may be uniquely human. In particular, we suggested that the remarkable increase of the size of the human brain due to its prolonged prenatal development has brought with it an increased sparsification, hierarchical modularization, as well as increased depth and cytoarchitectonic differentiation of brain networks. These characteristic features are complemented by a shift of projection origins to the upper layers of many cortical areas as well as the significantly prolonged postnatal development and plasticity of the upper cortical layers. Another fundamental aspect of cortical organization that has emerged in recent research is the alignment of diverse features of evolution, development, cytoarchitectonics, function, and plasticity along a principal, natural cortical axis from sensory (“outside”) to association (“inside”) areas. Here we highlight how this natural axis is integrated in the characteristic organization of the human brain. In particular, the human brain displays a developmental expansion of outside areas and a stretching of the natural axis such that outside areas are more widely separated from each other and from inside areas than in other species. We outline some functional implications of this characteristic arrangement.Author Summary. Which brain connectivity features underlie the extraordinary human cognitive abilities?

  abstract     = {Abstract. The brain’s structural connectivity supports the propagation of electrical impulses, manifesting as patterns of coactivation, termed functional connectivity. Functional connectivity emerges from the underlying sparse structural connections, particularly through polysynaptic communication. As a result, functional connections between brain regions without direct structural links are numerous, but their organization is not completely understood. Here we investigate the organization of functional connections without direct structural links. We develop a simple, data-driven method to benchmark functional connections with respect to their underlying structural and geometric embedding. We then use this method to reweigh and reexpress functional connectivity. We find evidence of unexpectedly strong functional connectivity among distal brain regions and within the default mode network. We also find unexpectedly strong functional connectivity at the apex of the unimodal-transmodal hierarchy. Our results suggest that both phenomena—functional modules and functional hierarchies—emerge from functional interactions that transcend the underlying structure and geometry. These findings also potentially explain recent reports that structural and functional connectivity gradually diverge in transmodal cortex. Collectively, we show how structural connectivity and geometry can be used as a natural frame of reference with which to study functional connectivity patterns in the brain.Author Summary. The structural connectivity of the brain supports interregional signaling, manifesting as highly organized patterns of functional connectivity. Importantly, structural and functional connectivity are fundamentally constrained by the spatial embedding of brain regions, such that proximal regions are more likely to exhibit stronger connectivity. Here we develop a simple method that uses robust relationships between geometry, structure, and function as the baseline to reweigh and reexpress functional connectivity. We use the method to identify functional connections that are greater than expected given their structural and geometric embedding. We then show that the arrangement of these connections systematically follows the functional modules and the putative unimodal-transmodal hierarchy of the brain. Collectively, our findings demonstrate highly organized patterns of polysynaptic functional connections that support the emergence of canonical features of functional connectivity networks, including modules and hierarchies.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In recent years, research on network analysis applied to MRI data has advanced significantly. However, the majority of the studies are limited to single networks obtained from resting-state fMRI, diffusion MRI, or gray matter probability maps derived from T1 images. Although a limited number of previous studies have combined two of these networks, none have introduced a framework to combine morphological, structural, and functional brain connectivity networks. The aim of this study was to combine the morphological, structural, and functional information, thus defining a new multilayer network perspective. This has proved advantageous when jointly analyzing multiple types of relational data from the same objects simultaneously using graph- mining techniques. The main contribution of this research is the design, development, and validation of a framework that merges these three layers of information into one multilayer network that links and relates the integrity of white matter connections with gray matter probability maps and resting-state fMRI. To validate our framework, several metrics from graph theory are expanded and adapted to our specific domain characteristics. This proof of concept was applied to a cohort of people with multiple sclerosis, and results show that several brain regions with a synchronized connectivity deterioration could be identified.Author Summary.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Reading difficulties (RDs) are characterized by slow and inaccurate reading as well as additional challenges in cognitive control (i.e., executive functions, especially in working memory, inhibition, and visual attention). Despite evidence demonstrating differences in these readers’ language and visual processing abilities, white matter differences associated with executive functions (EFs) difficulties in children with RDs are scarce. Structural correlates for reading and EFs in 8- to 12-year-old children with RDs versus typical readers (TRs) were examined using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data. Results suggest that children with RDs showed significantly lower reading and EF abilities versus TRs. Lower fractional anisotropy (FA) in left temporo-parietal tracts was found in children with RDs, who also showed positive correlations between reading and working memory and switching/inhibition scores and FA in the left superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF). FA in the left SLF predicted working memory performance mediated by reading ability in children with RDs but not TRs. Our findings support alterations in white matter tracts related to working memory, switching/inhibition, and overall EF challenges in children with RDs and the linkage between working memory difficulties and FA alterations in the left SLF in children with RDs via reading.Author Summary. Our findings support alterations in white matter tracts related to working memory, a component of executive functions, and reading in children with reading difficulties as well as the differences in association between white matter alterations in tracts associated with reading deficiency and working memory, switching/inhibition, and overall executive function challenges in children with reading difficulties.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Since its development, social media has grown as a source of information and has a significant impact on opinion formation. Individuals interact with others and content via social media platforms in a variety of ways, but it remains unclear how decision-making and associated neural processes are impacted by the online sharing of informational content, from factual to fabricated. Here, we use EEG to estimate dynamic reconfigurations of brain networks and probe the neural changes underlying opinion change (or formation) within individuals interacting with a simulated social media platform. Our findings indicate that the individuals who changed their opinions are characterized by less frequent network reconfigurations while those who did not change their opinions tend to have more flexible brain networks with frequent reconfigurations. The nature of these frequent network configurations suggests a fundamentally different thought process between intervals in which individuals are easily influenced by social media and those in which they are not. We also show that these reconfigurations are distinct to the brain dynamics during an in-person discussion with strangers on the same content. Together, these findings suggest that brain network reconfigurations may not only be diagnostic to the informational context but also the underlying opinion formation.Author Summary. Distinctive neural underpinnings of opinion formation and change during in-person and online social interactions are not well understood. Here, we analyze EEG recordings of the participants interacting with a simulated social media platform and during an in-person discussion by using a network-based analysis approach. We show that the structure of network reconfigurations during these interactions is diagnostic of the opinion change and the context in which information was received.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Essential tremor (ET) is the most common movement disorder. Its neural underpinnings remain unclear. Here, we quantified structural covariance between cortical thickness (CT), surface area (SA), and mean curvature (MC) estimates in patients with ET before and 1 year after ventro-intermediate nucleus stereotactic radiosurgical thalamotomy, and contrasted the observed patterns with those from matched healthy controls. For SA, complex rearrangements within a network of motion-related brain areas characterized patients with ET. This was complemented by MC alterations revolving around the left middle temporal cortex and the disappearance of positive-valued covariance across both modalities in the right fusiform gyrus. Recovery following thalamotomy involved MC readjustments in frontal brain centers, the amygdala, and the insula, capturing nonmotor characteristics of the disease. The appearance of negative-valued CT covariance between the left parahippocampal gyrus and hippocampus was another recovery mechanism involving high-level visual areas. This was complemented by the appearance of negative-valued CT/MC covariance, and positive-valued SA/MC covariance, in the right inferior temporal cortex and bilateral fusiform gyrus. Our results demonstrate that different morphometric properties provide complementary information to understand ET, and that their statistical cross-dependences are also valuable. They pinpoint several anatomical features of the disease and highlight routes of recovery following thalamotomy.Author Summary. Doubts remain regarding the anatomical alterations underlying essential tremor, partly owing to heterogeneity in symptoms’ severity and response to medication. Here, we studied drug-resistant patients clinically assessed and imaged before as well as 1 year after stereotactic radiosurgical thalamotomy, which significantly lowered tremor intensity. We extracted morphometric estimates of volume (subcortex and cerebellum), cortical thickness, surface area, and mean curvature (cortex), and quantified cross-regional statistical dependences across subjects (i.e., structural covariance or SC) for each measure, as well as cross-measure relationships for each region. Compared to matched healthy controls, patients showed altered surface area structural covariance within motion-related areas. Thalamotomy modulated mean curvature SC in frontal and subcortical centers. In both comparisons, SC and cross-measure relationship differences were also observed in visual areas.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. To determine the effect of implanting electrodes on electrographic features of nearby and connected brain regions in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy, we analyzed intracranial EEG recordings from 10 patients with drug-resistant epilepsy who underwent implant revision (placement of additional electrodes) during their hospitalization. We performed automated spike detection and measured EEG functional networks. We analyzed the original electrodes that remained in place throughout the full EEG recording, and we measured the change in spike rates and network connectivity in these original electrodes in response to implanting new electrodes. There was no change in overall spike rate pre- to post-implant revision (t(9) = 0.1, p = 0.95). The peri-revision change in the distribution of spike rate and connectivity across electrodes was no greater than chance (Monte Carlo method, spikes: p = 0.40, connectivity: p = 0.42). Electrodes closer to or more functionally connected to the revision site had no greater change in spike rate or connectivity than more distant or less connected electrodes. Changes in electrographic features surrounding electrode implantation are no greater than baseline fluctuations occurring throughout the intracranial recording. These findings argue against an implant effect on spikes or network connectivity in nearby or connected brain regions.Author Summary. We tested whether implanting intracranial electrodes affected interictal spike rates or functional connectivity on preexisting electrodes. We found that the change in electrographic features following electrode implantation was no larger than the baseline fluctuations occurring throughout the intracranial recording.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Uncovering interactions between edges of brain networks can reveal the organizational principle of the networks and also their dysregulations underlying aberrant behaviours such as in neuropsychiatric diseases. In this study, we looked into the applicability of edge-based network analysis in uncovering possible network mechanisms of aberrant anxiogenic processing. Utilizing a rat model of prodromal Parkinson’s disease we examined how a dorsomedial striatum–tied associative network (DSAN) may mediate context-based anxiogenic behaviour. Following dopamine depletion in the dorsomedial striatum, an exaggerated bottom-up signalling (posterior parietal-hippocampal-retrosplenial to anterior prefrontal-cingulate-amygdala regions) and gradient specific to the theta frequency in this network was observed. This change was accompanied by increased anxiety behaviour of the animals. By employing an edge-based approach in correlating informational flow (phase transfer entropy) with functional connectivity of all edges of this network, we further explore how the abnormal bottom-up signalling might be explained by alterations to the informational flow-connectivity motifs in the network. Our results demonstrate usage of edge-based network analysis in revealing concurrent informational processing and functional organization dynamics across multiple pathways in a brain network. This approach in unveiling network abnormalities and its impact on behavioural outcomes would be useful in probing the network basis of neuropsychiatric conditions.Author Summary. This study employs a unique approach to study the neural basis of anxiety by quantifying the correlation of concurrent fluctuations in information flow and connectivity between all edges of the brain network involved. This is the first time that such an edge-based technique is used to analyse field potential signals of the brain in an animal model of a neuropsychiatric disorder. We demonstrate how such edge-based analysis complements other analyses such as local field potential power and gross network changes. This work helps lay the foundation for future investigations into decoding the network aberrations of a wide spectrum of neuropsychiatric disorders.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Altered activity within and between large-scale brain networks has been implicated across various neuropsychiatric conditions. However, patterns of network dysregulation associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and further impacted by cannabis (CB) use, remain to be delineated. We examined the impact of HIV and CB on resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) between brain networks and associations with error awareness and error-related network responsivity. Participants (N = 106), stratified into four groups (HIV+/CB+, HIV+/CB−, HIV−/CB+, HIV−/CB−), underwent fMRI scanning while completing a resting-state scan and a modified Go/NoGo paradigm assessing brain responsivity to errors and explicit error awareness. We examined separate and interactive effects of HIV and CB on resource allocation indexes (RAIs), a measure quantifying rsFC strength between the default mode network (DMN), central executive network (CEN), and salience network (SN). We observed reduced RAIs among HIV+ (vs. HIV−) participants, which was driven by increased SN-DMN rsFC. No group differences were detected for SN-CEN rsFC. Increased SN-DMN rsFC correlated with diminished error awareness, but not with error-related network responsivity. These outcomes highlight altered network interactions among participants with HIV and suggest such rsFC dysregulation may persist during task performance, reflecting an inability to disengage irrelevant mental operations, ultimately hindering error processing.Author Summary. One systems-level framework proposes that dysregulated brain network interactions may underlie neurocognitive aspects of addiction, neurodegeneration, and other neuropsychiatric conditions. Three specific networks have been highlighted: the default mode network (DMN), the central executive network (CEN), and the salience network (SN). To examine alterations linked with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and cannabis (CB) use across these three canonical brain networks, we utilized a composite network association index, previously used to assess drug-related effects on brain networks. This study provides a novel perspective on dysregulated DMN and SN rsFC among participants living with HIV and delineates potential implications for error-monitoring behavior.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The brain consists of billions of neurons connected by ultra-dense synapses, showing remarkable efficiency, robust flexibility, and economy in information processing. It is generally believed that these advantageous properties are rooted in brain connectivity; however, direct evidence remains absent owing to technical limitations or theoretical vacancy. This research explores the origins of these properties in the largest yet brain connectome of the fruit fly. We reveal that functional connectivity formation in the brain can be explained by a percolation process controlled by synaptic excitation-inhibition (E/I) balance. By increasing the E/I balance gradually, we discover the emergence of these properties as byproducts of percolation transition when the E/I balance arrives at 3:7. As the E/I balance keeps increase, an optimal E/I balance 1:1 is unveiled to ensure these three properties simultaneously, consistent with previous in vitro experimental predictions. Once the E/I balance reaches over 3:2, an intrinsic limitation of these properties determined by static (anatomical) brain connectivity can be observed. Our work demonstrates that percolation, a universal characterization of critical phenomena and phase transitions, may serve as a window toward understanding the emergence of various brain properties.Author Summary. This research presents a novel framework to study functional connectivity on the largest yet brain connectome of the fruit fly, revealing that synaptic excitation-inhibition (E/I) balance characterizes the formation of dynamic brain connectivity as a percolation process. Various remarkable properties of brain functions, such as information transmission efficiency, robust flexibility, and economy, emerge as byproducts of percolation transition. These advantages can be simultaneously ensured at an optimal E/I balance 1:1, consistent with previous in vitro experimental predictions. Our work demonstrates percolation as a potential way to understand the emergence of brain function characteristics through connectivity.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The brain presents a real complex network of modular, small-world, and hierarchical nature, which are features of non-Euclidean geometry. Using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, we constructed a scale-free binary graph for each subject, using internodal time series correlation of regions of interest as a proximity measure. The resulting network could be embedded onto manifolds of various curvatures and dimensions. While maintaining the fidelity of embedding (low distortion, high mean average precision), functional brain networks were found to be best represented in the hyperbolic disc. Using the 𝕊1/ℍ2 model, we reduced the dimension of the network into two-dimensional hyperbolic space and were able to efficiently visualize the internodal connections of the brain, preserving proximity as distances and angles on the hyperbolic discs. Each individual disc revealed relevance with its anatomic counterpart and absence of center-spaced node. Using the hyperbolic distance on the 𝕊1/ℍ2 model, we could detect the anomaly of network in autism spectrum disorder subjects. This procedure of embedding grants us a reliable new framework for studying functional brain networks and the possibility of detecting anomalies of the network in the hyperbolic disc on an individual scale.Author Summary. Human brain networks possess modular, small-world, and hierarchical natures, which necessitate the inspection of network in a basis of non-Euclidean geometry. In this work, using the time series correlation of BOLD signals from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, we constructed a scale-free network for each individual subject and embedded the networks into hyperbolic discs of the 𝕊1/ℍ2 model. The embedding procedure showed reproducibility, and the embedded discs showed relevance with their anatomical counterparts. Then, we assessed the anomaly of brain networks in subjects with autism spectrum disorder by comparing hyperbolic distances of edges. This procedure leads us to a new method of reproducible visualization of functional brain networks and the possibility of detecting anomalies of internodal pathways in the brain network of a diseased subject, on an individual scale.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Networks in neuroscience determine how brain function unfolds, and their perturbations lead to psychiatric disorders and brain disease. Brain networks are characterized by their connectomes, which comprise the totality of all connections, and are commonly described by graph theory. This approach is deeply rooted in a particle view of information processing, based on the quantification of informational bits such as firing rates. Oscillations and brain rhythms demand, however, a wave perspective of information processing based on synchronization. We extend traditional graph theory to a dual, particle-wave, perspective, integrate time delays due to finite transmission speeds, and derive a normalization of the connectome. When applied to the database of the Human Connectome Project, it explains the emergence of frequency-specific network cores including the visual and default mode networks. These findings are robust across human subjects (N = 100) and are a fundamental network property within the wave picture. The normalized connectome comprises the particle view in the limit of infinite transmission speeds and opens the applicability of graph theory to a wide range of novel network phenomena, including physiological and pathological brain rhythms. These two perspectives are orthogonal, but not incommensurable, when understood within the novel, here-proposed, generalized framework of structural connectivity.Author Summary. All networks are composed of nodes and links, forming the structural frame, in which communication occurs. We demonstrate that graph theoretical tools make the implicit assumption of information transmission via exchange of bits, suggesting that the stronger connected nodes have greater impact upon the remainder of the network. This corollary does not extend to communication via oscillations, which is the prominent information carrier in brain networks. We extend traditional network analysis to the oscillatory domain and derive a novel network normalization complete with descriptive metrics. Along the prototypical example of the brain as a network, we illustrate the consequences of this novel approach and demonstrate that the normalization robustly explains the emergence of the prominent frequency-specific network cores, which cannot be understood within the traditional framework.},

An important gap yet to be addressed is optimization of fetal fMRI preprocessing. Rapid developmental changes, imaged within the maternal compartment using an abdominal coil, introduce novel constraints that challenge established methods used in adult fMRI. This study evaluates the impact of (1) normalization to a group mean-age template versus normalization to an age-matched template; (2) independent components analysis (ICA) denoising at two criterion thresholds; and (3) smoothing using three kernel sizes. Data were collected from 121 fetuses (25–39 weeks, 43.8\% female). Results indicate that the mean age template is superior in older fetuses, but less optimal in younger fetuses. ICA denoising at a more stringent threshold is superior to less stringent denoising. A larger smoothing kernel can enhance cross-hemisphere functional connectivity. Overall, this study provides improved understanding of the impact of specific steps on fetal image quality. Findings can be used to inform a common set of best practices for fetal fMRI preprocessing.},

Comprehending the interplay between spatial and temporal characteristics of neural dynamics can contribute to our understanding of information processing in the human brain. Graph neural networks (GNNs) provide a new possibility to interpret graph-structured signals like those observed in complex brain networks. In our study we compare different spatiotemporal GNN architectures and study their ability to model neural activity distributions obtained in functional MRI (fMRI) studies. We evaluate the performance of the GNN models on a variety of scenarios in MRI studies and also compare it to a VAR model, which is currently often used for directed functional connectivity analysis. We show that by learning localized functional interactions on the anatomical substrate, GNN-based approaches are able to robustly scale to large network studies, even when available data are scarce. By including anatomical connectivity as the physical substrate for information propagation, such GNNs also provide a multimodal perspective on directed connectivity analysis, offering a novel possibility to investigate the spatiotemporal dynamics in brain networks.Author Summary. In our study we compare different spatial and temporal modeling techniques based on graph neural networks (GNNs) for investigating the spatiotemporal dynamics in brain networks. We show that a convolutional neural network and a recurrent neural network–based approach are both very suitable to capture the temporal characteristics in functional activity distributions. Further, we demonstrate that structural connectome embeddings can effectively reduce the number of parameters in GNN models, by naturally including higher order topological relations between brain areas within the structural network. We compare the prediction accuracy of the GNN-based approaches to a vector autoregressive model, and we show that GNNs remain considerably more accurate when brain networks become large and available data are limited. Finally, we demonstrate how these spatiotemporal GNN models can provide a multimodal perspective on directed connectivity in brain networks.},

However, the focus has primarily been on global graphic metrics with little attention to the information contained in paths connecting brain regions. Details of disruption of these paths may be highly informative for understanding disease mechanisms. To detect the absence or addition of multistep paths in the patient group, we provide an algorithm estimating edges that contribute to these paths with reference to the control group. We next examine where pairs of nodes were connected through paths in both groups by using a covariance decomposition method. We apply our method to study resting-state fMRI data in schizophrenia versus controls. Results show several disconnectors in schizophrenia within and between functional domains, particularly within the default mode and cognitive control networks. Additionally, we identify new edges generating additional paths. Moreover, although paths exist in both groups, these paths take unique trajectories and have a significant contribution to the decomposition. The proposed path analysis provides a way to characterize individuals by evaluating changes in paths, rather than just focusing on the pairwise relationships. Our results show promise for identifying path-based metrics in neuroimaging data.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Recordings from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) reflect the influence of pathways between brain areas. A wide range of methods have been proposed to measure this functional connectivity (FC), but the lack of “ground truth” has made it difficult to systematically validate them. Most measures of FC produce connectivity estimates that are symmetrical between brain areas. Differential covariance (dCov) is an algorithm for analyzing FC with directed graph edges. When we applied dCov to rs-fMRI recordings from the human connectome project (HCP) and anesthetized mice, dCov-FC accurately identified strong cortical connections from diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) in individual humans and viral tract tracing in mice. In addition, those HCP subjects whose dCov-FCs were more integrated, as assessed by a graph-theoretic measure, tended to have shorter reaction times in several behavioral tests. Thus, dCov-FC was able to identify anatomically verified connectivity that yielded measures of brain integration significantly correlated with behavior.Author Summary. Our ability to sense, think, feel and react is reflected in the activation patterns of distinct brain regions. These patterns can be observed noninvasively by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Statistical dependencies between the activities in brain regions have been widely used to measure functional connectivity (FC). However, due to common inputs from other brain areas, two correlated brain regions may not have direct neural fibers connecting them, which makes correlated activity difficult to interpret. A new method for measuring FC called differential covariance (dCov) was applied to fMRI recordings from anesthetized mice and resting human subjects. The analysis closely matched known neuronal fiber connections. In addition, dCov-FC from individual humans predicted reaction times for several types of psychological tests.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The emerging area of dynamic brain network analysis has gained considerable attention in recent years. However, development of multivariate statistical frameworks that allow for examining the associations between phenotypic traits and dynamic patterns of system-level properties of the brain, and drawing statistical inference about such associations, has largely lagged behind. To address this need we developed a mixed-modeling framework that allows for assessing the relationship between any desired phenotype and dynamic patterns of whole-brain connectivity and topology. This novel framework also allows for simulating dynamic brain networks with respect to desired covariates. Unlike current tools, which largely use data-driven methods, our model-based method enables aligning neuroscientific hypotheses with the analytic approach. We demonstrate the utility of this model in identifying the relationship between fluid intelligence and dynamic brain networks by using resting-state fMRI (rfMRI) data from 200 participants in the Human Connectome Project (HCP) study. We also demonstrate the utility of this model to simulate dynamic brain networks at both group and individual levels. To our knowledge, this approach provides the first model-based statistical method for examining dynamic patterns of system-level properties of the brain and their relationships to phenotypic traits as well as simulating dynamic brain networks.Author Summary. In recent years, a growing body of studies have aimed at analyzing the brain as a complex dynamic system by using various neuroimaging data. This has opened new avenues to answer compelling questions about the brain function in health and disease. However, methods that allow for providing statistical inference about how the complex interactions of the brain are associated with desired phenotypes are to be developed for a more profound insight. This study introduces a promising regression-based model to relate dynamic brain networks to desired phenotypes and provide statistical inference. Moreover, it can be used for simulating dynamic brain networks with respect to desired phenotypes at the group and individual levels.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Functional connectivity (FC) studies have predominantly focused on resting state, where ongoing dynamics are thought to reflect the brain’s intrinsic network architecture, which is thought to be broadly relevant because it persists across brain states (i.e., is state-general). However, it is unknown whether resting state is the optimal state for measuring intrinsic FC. We propose that latent FC, reflecting shared connectivity patterns across many brain states, better captures state-general intrinsic FC relative to measures derived from resting state alone. We estimated latent FC independently for each connection using leave-one-task-out factor analysis in seven highly distinct task states (24 conditions) and resting state using fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project. Compared with resting-state connectivity, latent FC improves generalization to held-out brain states, better explaining patterns of connectivity and task-evoked activation. We also found that latent connectivity improved prediction of behavior outside the scanner, indexed by the general intelligence factor (g). Our results suggest that FC patterns shared across many brain states, rather than just resting state, better reflect state-general connectivity. This affirms the notion of “intrinsic” brain network architecture as a set of connectivity properties persistent across brain states, providing an updated conceptual and mathematical framework of intrinsic connectivity as a latent factor.Author Summary. The initial promise of resting-state fMRI was that it would reflect “intrinsic” functional relationships in the brain free from any specific task context, yet this assumption has remained untested until recently. Here we propose a latent variable method for estimating intrinsic functional connectivity (FC) as an alternative to rest FC. We show that latent FC outperforms rest FC in predicting held-out FC and regional activation states in the brain. Additionally, latent FC better predicts a marker of general intelligence measured outside of the scanner. We demonstrate that the latent variable approach subsumes other approaches to combining data from multiple states (e.g., averaging) and that it outperforms rest FC alone in terms of generalizability and predictive validity.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Hierarchical brain organization, in which the rich club and diverse club situate in core position, is critical for global information integration in the human brain network. Parkinson’s disease (PD), a common movement disorder, has been conceptualized as a network disorder. Levodopa is an effective treatment for PD. Whether there is a functional divergence in the hierarchical brain system under PD pathology, and how this divergence is regulated by immediate levodopa therapy, remains unknown. We constructed a functional network in 61 PD patients and 89 normal controls and applied graph theoretical analyses to examine the neural mechanism of levodopa short response from the perspective of brain hierarchical configuration. The results revealed the following: (a) PD patients exhibited disrupted function within rich-club organization, while the diverse club preserved function, indicating a differentiated brain topological organization in PD. (b) Along the rich-club derivate hierarchical system, PD patients showed impaired network properties within rich-club and feeder subnetworks, and decreased nodal degree centrality in rich-club and feeder nodes, along with increased nodal degree in peripheral nodes, suggesting distinct functional patterns in different types of nodes. And (c) levodopa could normalize the abnormal network architecture of the rich-club system. This study provides evidence for levodopa effects on the hierarchical brain system with divergent functions.Author Summary. Many studies of brain networks have revealed densely connected regions forming the rich club and diverse club, which occupy the central position of the hierarchical brain system. Here, we explore the hierarchical topology in Parkinson’s disease (PD) and investigate the neural effect of levodopa on it. We show that within the core position of the hierarchical system, the function of the diverse club is preserved while the function of the rich club is impaired. Along the rich-club hierarchical system, the function of biologically costly rich-club and feeder subnetworks is disrupted, together with an increased function of peripheral nodes, which could be normalized by levodopa. Our study provides evidence of a disparity pattern between different levels of brain hierarchical systems under PD pathology.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. A binary state on a graph means an assignment of binary values to its vertices. A time-dependent sequence of binary states is referred to as binary dynamics. We describe a method for the classification of binary dynamics of digraphs, using particular choices of closed neighbourhoods. Our motivation and application comes from neuroscience, where a directed graph is an abstraction of neurons and their connections, and where the simplification of large amounts of data is key to any computation. We present a topological/graph theoretic method for extracting information out of binary dynamics on a graph, based on a selection of a relatively small number of vertices and their neighbourhoods. We consider existing and introduce new real-valued functions on closed neighbourhoods, comparing them by their ability to accurately classify different binary dynamics. We describe a classification algorithm that uses two parameters and sets up a machine learning pipeline. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method on simulated activity on a digital reconstruction of cortical tissue of a rat, and on a nonbiological random graph with similar density.Author Summary. We explore the mathematical concept of a closed neighbourhood in a digraph in relation to classifying binary dynamics on a digraph, with particular emphasis on dynamics on a neuronal network. Using methodology based on selecting neighbourhoods and vectorising them by combinatorial and topological parameters, we experimented with a dataset implemented on the Blue Brain Project reconstruction of a neocortical column, and on an artificial neural network with random underlying graph implemented on the NEST simulator. In both cases the outcome was run through a support vector machine algorithm reaching classification accuracy of up to 88\% for the Blue Brain Project data and up to 81\% for the NEST data. This work is open to generalisation to other types of networks and the dynamics on them.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Astrocytes communicate bidirectionally with neurons, enhancing synaptic plasticity and promoting the synchronization of neuronal microcircuits. Despite recent advances in understanding neuron-astrocyte signaling, little is known about astrocytic modulation of neuronal activity at the population level, particularly in disease or following injury. We used high-speed calcium imaging of mixed cortical cultures in vitro to determine how population activity changes after disruption of glutamatergic signaling and mechanical injury. We constructed a multilayer network model of neuron-astrocyte connectivity, which captured distinct topology and response behavior from single-cell-type networks. mGluR5 inhibition decreased neuronal activity, but did not on its own disrupt functional connectivity or network topology. In contrast, injury increased the strength, clustering, and efficiency of neuronal but not astrocytic networks, an effect that was not observed in networks pretreated with mGluR5 inhibition. Comparison of spatial and functional connectivity revealed that functional connectivity is largely independent of spatial proximity at the microscale, but mechanical injury increased the spatial-functional correlation. Finally, we found that astrocyte segments of the same cell often belong to separate functional communities based on neuronal connectivity, suggesting that astrocyte segments function as independent entities. Our findings demonstrate the utility of multilayer network models for characterizing the multiscale connectivity of two distinct but functionally dependent cell populations.Author Summary.

  abstract     = {Abstract. For better translational outcomes, researchers and clinicians alike demand novel tools to distill complex neuroimaging data into simple yet behaviorally relevant representations at the single-participant level. Recently, the Mapper approach from topological data analysis (TDA) has been successfully applied on noninvasive human neuroimaging data to characterize the entire dynamical landscape of whole-brain configurations at the individual level without requiring any spatiotemporal averaging at the outset. Despite promising results, initial applications of Mapper to neuroimaging data were constrained by (1) the need for dimensionality reduction and (2) lack of a biologically grounded heuristic for efficiently exploring the vast parameter space. Here, we present a novel computational framework for Mapper—designed specifically for neuroimaging data—that removes limitations and reduces computational costs associated with dimensionality reduction and parameter exploration. We also introduce new meta-analytic approaches to better anchor Mapper-generated representations to neuroanatomy and behavior. Our new NeuMapper framework was developed and validated using multiple fMRI datasets where participants engaged in continuous multitask experiments that mimic “ongoing” cognition. Looking forward, we hope our framework will help researchers push the boundaries of psychiatric neuroimaging toward generating insights at the single-participant level across consortium-size datasets.Author Summary. Modern neuroimaging promises to transform how we understand human brain function, as well as how we diagnose and treat mental disorders. However, this promise hinges on the development of computational tools for distilling complex, high-dimensional neuroimaging data into simple representations that can be explored in research or clinical settings. The Mapper approach from topological data analysis (TDA) can be used to generate such representations. Here, we introduce several improvements to the underlying algorithm to aid scalability and parameter selection for high-dimensional neuroimaging data. We also provide new analytical tools for annotating and extracting neurobiological and behavioral insights from the generated representations. We hope this new framework will help facilitate translational applications of precision neuroimaging in clinical settings.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Network approaches that investigate the interaction between symptoms and behaviours have opened new ways of understanding psychological phenomena in health and disorder in recent years. In parallel, network approaches that characterise the interaction between brain regions have become the dominant approach in neuroimaging research. In this paper, we introduce a methodology for combining network psychometrics and network neuroscience. This approach utilises the information from the psychometric network to obtain neural correlates that are associated with each node in the psychometric network (network-based regression). Moreover, we combine the behavioural variables and their neural correlates in a joint network to characterise their interactions. We illustrate the approach by highlighting the interaction between the triad of autistic traits and their resting-state functional connectivity associations. To this end, we utilise data from 172 male autistic participants (10–21 years) from the autism brain data exchange (ABIDE, ABIDE-II) that completed resting-state fMRI and were assessed using the autism diagnostic interview (ADI-R). Our results indicate that the network-based regression approach can uncover both unique and shared neural correlates of behavioural measures. For instance, our example analysis indicates that the overlap between communication and social difficulties is not reflected in the overlap between their functional brain correlates.Author Summary. The article introduces a method to combine common practices in network psychometrics and network neuroimaging. Namely, we use the unique variance in behavioural measures as regressors to identify unique neural correlates. This enables the description of brain-level and behavioural-level data into a joint network while keeping the dimensionality of the results manageable and interpretable. We illustrate this approach by showing the network of autistic traits and their correlates in resting-state functional connectivity.},

We demonstrate that the structurally informed network outperforms the unconstrained model in simulating brain dynamics, wherein by constraining the inference model with the network structure we may improve the estimation of pairwise BOLD signal interactions. Further, we simulate brain network dynamics using Monte Carlo simulations with the new hybrid connectome to probe connectome-level differences in excitation-inhibition balance between apolipoprotein E (APOE)-ε4 carriers and noncarriers. Our results reveal sex differences among APOE-ε4 carriers in functional dynamics at criticality; specifically, female carriers appear to exhibit a lower tolerance to network disruptions resulting from increased excitatory interactions. In sum, the new multimodal network explored here enables analysis of brain dynamics through the integration of structure and function, providing insight into the complex interactions underlying neural activity such as the balance of excitation and inhibition.},

We tested the filter in rat epicranial recordings and human event-related EEG data, using SC priors from a meta-analysis of tracer studies and diffusion tensor imaging metrics, respectively. We show that, particularly under conditions of low signal-to-noise ratio, SC priors can help to refine estimates of directed FC, promoting sparse functional networks that combine information from structure and function. In addition, the proposed filter provides intrinsic protection against SC-related false negatives, as well as robustness against false positives, representing a valuable new tool for multimodal imaging in the context of dynamic and directed FC analysis.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Increasing evidence suggests that measures of signal variability and complexity could present promising biomarkers for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Earlier studies have however been limited to the characterization of local activity. Here, we investigate whether a network version of permutation entropy could serve as a novel biomarker for early-stage AD. Resting-state source-space magnetoencephalography was recorded in 18 subjects with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) and 18 subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Local activity was characterized by permutation entropy (PE). Network-level interactions were studied using the inverted joint permutation entropy (JPEinv), corrected for volume conduction. The JPEinv showed a reduction of nonlinear connectivity in MCI subjects in the theta and alpha band. Local PE showed increased theta band entropy. Between-group differences were widespread across brain regions. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis of classification of MCI versus SCD subjects revealed that a logistic regression model trained on JPEinv features (78.4\% [62.5–93.3\%]) slightly outperformed PE (76.9\% [60.3–93.4\%]) and relative theta power–based models (76.9\% [60.4–93.3\%]). Classification performance of theta JPEinv was at least as good as the relative theta power benchmark. The JPEinv is therefore a potential biomarker for early-stage AD that should be explored in larger studies.Author Summary. Functional network disruption is a well-established finding in Alzheimer’s disease. Sensitive network-based biomarkers are however not available. We aimed to detect neuronal dysfunction at a predementia (mild cognitive impairment, MCI) stage of Alzheimer’s disease, by applying a network-level neural variability measure to magnetoencephalography data: the inverted joint permutation entropy (JPEinv). This measure integrates information on local signal variability/complexity and nonlinear coupling. We found significant differences in JPEinv between subjects with subjective cognitive decline and MCI, primarily in the theta band. The diagnostic ability of the JPEinv was reported to be similar to that of relative theta power, the most potent neurophysiological biomarker of predementia Alzheimer’s disease to date.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We introduce an extension of independent component analysis (ICA), called multiscale ICA, and design an approach to capture dynamic functional source interactions within and between multiple spatial scales. Multiscale ICA estimates functional sources at multiple spatial scales without imposing direct constraints on the size of functional sources, overcomes the limitation of using fixed anatomical locations, and eliminates the need for model-order selection in ICA analysis. We leveraged this approach to study sex-specific and sex-common connectivity patterns in schizophrenia. Results show dynamic reconfiguration and interaction within and between multi-spatial scales. Sex-specific differences occur (a) within the subcortical domain, (b) between the somatomotor and cerebellum domains, and (c) between the temporal domain and several others, including the subcortical, visual, and default mode domains. Most of the sex-specific differences belong to between-spatial-scale functional interactions and are associated with a dynamic state with strong functional interactions between the visual, somatomotor, and temporal domains and their anticorrelation patterns with the rest of the brain. We observed significant correlations between multi-spatial-scale functional interactions and symptom scores, highlighting the importance of multiscale analyses to identify potential biomarkers for schizophrenia. As such, we recommend such analyses as an important option for future functional connectivity studies.Author Summary. Brain function can be modeled as the dynamic interactions between functional sources (e.g., intrinsic connectivity networks, ICNs) at different spatial scales. Each spatial scale contains its own functional sources with unique information. For example, the default mode (DM)-ICNs from lower order independent component analysis (ICA) are not a simple union of DM-ICNs from a higher order. Furthermore, dynamic functional interactions occur both within and between different spatial scales, which has been underrepresented. Here, we introduce multiscale ICA to capture functional sources and their interactions across multiple spatial scales. We leveraged this approach to study sex-specific changes in schizophrenia. Most sex-specific differences occur in between-model order, highlighting the benefit of multi-spatial-scale analysis. In sum, studying multi-spatial-scale functional sources provides us with a wealth of information to better characterize brain function.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Multiple sclerosis (MS) features extensive connectivity changes, but how structural and functional connectivity relate, and whether this relation could be a useful biomarker for cognitive impairment in MS is unclear. This study included 79 MS patients and 40 healthy controls (HCs). Patients were classified as cognitively impaired (CI) or cognitively preserved (CP). Structural connectivity was determined using diffusion MRI and functional connectivity using resting-state magnetoencephalography (MEG) data (theta, alpha1, and alpha2 bands). Structure-function coupling was assessed by correlating modalities, and further explored in frequency bands that significantly correlated with whole-brain structural connectivity. Functional correlates of short- and long-range structural connections (based on tract length) were then specifically assessed. Receiving operating curve analyses were performed on coupling values to identify biomarker potential. Only the theta band showed significant correlations between whole-brain structural and functional connectivity (rho = −0.26, p = 0.023, only in MS). Long-range structure-function coupling was stronger in CI patients compared to HCs (p = 0.005). Short-range coupling showed no group differences. Structure-function coupling was not a significant classifier of cognitive impairment for any tract length (short-range area under the curve (AUC) = 0.498, p = 0.976, long-range AUC = 0.611, p = 0.095). Long-range structure-function coupling was stronger in CI MS compared to HCs, but more research is needed to further explore this measure as biomarkers in MS.Author Summary. Cognitive impairment in multiple sclerosis (MS) is common and relates to structural and functional connectivity. However, it remains unclear whether the interplay (coupling) between structural and functional connectivity could be a biomarker of MS-related cognitive impairment. This study investigated the cognitive relevance of structure-function coupling in 79 MS patients and 40 healthy controls using diffusion MRI and magnetoencephalography. Results show that coupling was stronger in cognitively impaired MS patients compared to controls, but only when considering long-distance connections. Nonetheless, classifier analyses indicated only weak biomarker potential in terms of sensitivity and specificity. Future studies should include additional operationalization of coupling as well as longitudinal and regional or network level data.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Epilepsy is one of the most common chronic neurological conditions, traditionally defined as a disorder of recurrent seizures. Cognitive and affective dysfunction are increasingly recognized as core disease dimensions and can affect patient well-being, sometimes more than the seizures themselves. Connectome-based approaches hold immense promise for revealing mechanisms that contribute to dysfunction and to identify biomarkers. Our review discusses emerging multimodal neuroimaging and connectomics studies that highlight network substrates of cognitive/affective dysfunction in the common epilepsies. We first discuss work in drug-resistant epilepsy syndromes, that is, temporal lobe epilepsy, related to mesiotemporal sclerosis (TLE), and extratemporal epilepsy (ETE), related to malformations of cortical development. While these are traditionally conceptualized as ‘focal’ epilepsies, many patients present with broad structural and functional anomalies. Moreover, the extent of distributed changes contributes to difficulties in multiple cognitive domains as well as affective-behavioral challenges. We also review work in idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE), a subset of generalized epilepsy syndromes that involve subcortico-cortical circuits. Overall, neuroimaging and network neuroscience studies point to both shared and syndrome-specific connectome signatures of dysfunction across TLE, ETE, and IGE. Lastly, we point to current gaps in the literature and formulate recommendations for future research.Author Summary. Epilepsy is increasingly recognized as a network disorder characterized by recurrent seizures as well as broad-ranging cognitive difficulties and affective dysfunction. Our manuscript reviews recent literature highlighting brain network substrates of cognitive and affective dysfunction in common epilepsy syndromes, namely temporal lobe epilepsy secondary to mesiotemporal sclerosis, extratemporal epilepsy secondary to malformations of cortical development, and idiopathic generalized epilepsy syndromes arising from subcortico-cortical pathophysiology. We discuss prior work that has indicated both shared and distinct brain network signatures of cognitive and affective dysfunction across the epilepsy spectrum, improves our knowledge of structure-function links and interindividual heterogeneity, and ultimately aids screening and monitoring of therapeutic strategies.},

The minimum spanning tree (MST) is increasingly applied to overcome this problem. It is yet unknown whether this approach leads to more consistent findings across studies and converging outcomes of either disease-specific biomarkers or transdiagnostic effects. We performed a systematic review on MST analysis in neurophysiological and neuroimaging studies (N = 43) to study consistency of MST metrics between different network sizes and assessed disease specificity and transdiagnostic sensitivity of MST metrics for neurological and psychiatric conditions. Analysis of data from control groups (12 studies) showed that MST leaf fraction but not diameter decreased with increasing network size. Studies showed a broad range in metric values, suggesting that specific processing pipelines affect MST topology. Contradicting findings remain in the inconclusive literature of MST brain network studies, but some trends were seen: (1) a more linelike organization characterizes neurodegenerative disorders across pathologies, and is associated with symptom severity and disease progression; (2) neurophysiological studies in epilepsy show frequency band specific MST alterations that normalize after successful treatment; and (3) less efficient MST topology in alpha band is found across disorders associated with attention impairments.Author Summary.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Precisely how the anatomical structure of the brain supports a wide range of complex functions remains a question of marked importance in both basic and clinical neuroscience. Progress has been hampered by the lack of theoretical frameworks explaining how a structural network of relatively rigid interareal connections can produce a diverse repertoire of functional neural dynamics. Here, we address this gap by positing that the brain’s structural network architecture determines the set of accessible functional connectivity patterns according to predictions of network control theory. In a large developmental cohort of 823 youths aged 8 to 23 years, we found that the flexibility of a brain region’s functional connectivity was positively correlated with the proportion of its structural links extending to different cognitive systems. Notably, this relationship was mediated by nodes’ boundary controllability, suggesting that a region’s strategic location on the boundaries of modules may underpin the capacity to integrate information across different cognitive processes. Broadly, our study provides a mechanistic framework that illustrates how temporal flexibility observed in functional networks may be mediated by the controllability of the underlying structural connectivity.Author Summary. Precisely how the relatively rigid white matter wiring of the human brain gives rise to a diverse repertoire of functional neural dynamics is not well understood. In this work, we combined tools from network science and control theory to address this question. Capitalizing on a large developmental cohort, we demonstrated that the ability of a brain region to flexibly change its functional module allegiance over time (i.e., its modular flexibility) was positively correlated with its proportion of anatomical edges projecting to multiple cognitive networks (i.e., its structural participation coefficient). Moreover, this relationship was strongly mediated by the region’s boundary controllability, a metric capturing its capacity to integrate information across multiple cognitive domains.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In systems neuroscience, most models posit that brain regions communicate information under constraints of efficiency. Yet, evidence for efficient communication in structural brain networks characterized by hierarchical organization and highly connected hubs remains sparse. The principle of efficient coding proposes that the brain transmits maximal information in a metabolically economical or compressed form to improve future behavior. To determine how structural connectivity supports efficient coding, we develop a theory specifying minimum rates of message transmission between brain regions to achieve an expected fidelity, and we test five predictions from the theory based on random walk communication dynamics. In doing so, we introduce the metric of compression efficiency, which quantifies the trade-off between lossy compression and transmission fidelity in structural networks. In a large sample of youth (n = 1,042; age 8–23 years), we analyze structural networks derived from diffusion-weighted imaging and metabolic expenditure operationalized using cerebral blood flow. We show that structural networks strike compression efficiency trade-offs consistent with theoretical predictions. We find that compression efficiency prioritizes fidelity with development, heightens when metabolic resources and myelination guide communication, explains advantages of hierarchical organization, links higher input fidelity to disproportionate areal expansion, and shows that hubs integrate information by lossy compression. Lastly, compression efficiency is predictive of behavior—beyond the conventional network efficiency metric—for cognitive domains including executive function, memory, complex reasoning, and social cognition. Our findings elucidate how macroscale connectivity supports efficient coding and serve to foreground communication processes that utilize random walk dynamics constrained by network connectivity.Author Summary. Macroscale communication between interconnected brain regions underpins most aspects of brain function and incurs substantial metabolic cost. Understanding efficient and behaviorally meaningful information transmission dependent on structural connectivity has remained challenging. We validate a model of communication dynamics atop the macroscale human structural connectome, finding that structural networks support dynamics that strike a balance between information transmission fidelity and lossy compression. Notably, this balance is predictive of behavior and explanatory of biology. In addition to challenging and reformulating the currently held view that communication occurs by routing dynamics along metabolically efficient direct anatomical pathways, our results suggest that connectome architecture and behavioral demands yield communication dynamics that accord to neurobiological and information theoretical principles of efficient coding and lossy compression.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a severe neurodegenerative disorder that affects a growing worldwide elderly population. Identification of brain functional biomarkers is expected to help determine preclinical stages for targeted mechanistic studies and development of therapeutic interventions to deter disease progression. Connectomic analysis, a graph theory–based methodology used in the analysis of brain-derived connectivity matrices was used in conjunction with percolation theory targeted attack model to investigate the network effects of AD-related amyloid deposition. We used matrices derived from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging collected on mice with extracellular amyloidosis (TgCRND8 mice, n = 17) and control littermates (n = 17). Global, nodal, spatial, and percolation-based analysis was performed comparing AD and control mice. These data indicate a short-term compensatory response to neurodegeneration in the AD brain via a strongly connected core network with highly vulnerable or disconnected hubs. Targeted attacks demonstrated a greater vulnerability of AD brains to all types of attacks and identified progression models to mimic AD brain functional connectivity through betweenness centrality and collective influence metrics. Furthermore, both spatial analysis and percolation theory identified a key disconnect between the anterior brain of the AD mice to the rest of the brain network.Author Summary. Accurate biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are needed for early diagnosis and treatments. Connectomic analysis, a graph theory approach, coupled with percolation theory, a network attack approach, were applied here to analyze neuroimaging through a quantitative lens. We report a marker of AD vulnerability, which highlighted a core network disconnected from key hubs, notably within the anterior portion of the brain disconnected. Additionally, preliminary models using targeted attacks provide potential pathways of neurodegeneration from the control state to the diseased state. These findings show key differences in brain connectivity due to AD and provide a potential methodology for identifying biomarkers.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Theories for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have been formulated at different levels, ranging from physiological observations to perceptual and behavioral descriptions. Understanding the physiological underpinnings of perceptual traits in ASD remains a significant challenge in the field. Here we show how a recurrent neural circuit model that was optimized to perform sampling-based inference and displays characteristic features of cortical dynamics can help bridge this gap. The model was able to establish a mechanistic link between two descriptive levels for ASD: a physiological level, in terms of inhibitory dysfunction, neural variability, and oscillations, and a perceptual level, in terms of hypopriors in Bayesian computations. We took two parallel paths—inducing hypopriors in the probabilistic model, and an inhibitory dysfunction in the network model—which lead to consistent results in terms of the represented posteriors, providing support for the view that both descriptions might constitute two sides of the same coin.Author Summary. Two different views of autism, one regarding altered probabilistic computations, and one regarding inhibitory dysfunction, are brought together by means of a recurrent neural network model trained to perform sampling-based inference in a visual setting. Moreover, the model captures a variety of experimental observations regarding differences in neural variability and oscillations in subjects with autism. By linking neural connectivity, dynamics, and function, this work contributes to the understanding of the physiological underpinnings of perceptual traits in autism spectrum disorder.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This study aimed at replicating a previously reported negative correlation between node flexibility and psychological resilience, that is, the ability to retain mental health in the face of stress and adversity. To this end, we used multiband resting-state BOLD fMRI (TR = .675 sec) from 52 participants who had filled out three psychological questionnaires assessing resilience. Time-resolved functional connectivity was calculated by performing a sliding window approach on averaged time series parcellated according to different established atlases. Multilayer modularity detection was performed to track network reconfigurations over time, and node flexibility was calculated as the number of times a node changes community assignment. In addition, node promiscuity (the fraction of communities a node participates in) and node degree (as proxy for time-varying connectivity) were calculated to extend previous work. We found no substantial correlations between resilience and node flexibility. We observed a small number of correlations between the two other brain measures and resilience scores that were, however, very inconsistently distributed across brain measures, differences in temporal sampling, and parcellation schemes. This heterogeneity calls into question the existence of previously postulated associations between resilience and brain network flexibility and highlights how results may be influenced by specific analysis choices.Author Summary. We tested the replicability and generalizability of a previously proposed negative association between dynamic brain network reconfigurations derived from multilayer modularity detection (node flexibility) and psychological resilience. Using multiband resting-state BOLD fMRI data and exploring several parcellation schemes, sliding window approaches, and temporal resolutions of the data, we could not replicate previously reported findings regarding the association between node flexibility and resilience. By extending this work to other measures of brain dynamics (node promiscuity, degree) we observe a rather inconsistent pattern of correlations with resilience that strongly varies across analysis choices. We conclude that further research is needed to understand the network neuroscience basis of mental health and discuss several reasons that may account for the variability in results.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is increasingly recognized as a multisystem disorder accompanied by cognitive changes. To date, no effective therapy is available for ALS patients, partly due to disease heterogeneity and an imperfect understanding of the underlying pathophysiological processes. Reliable models that can predict cognitive and motor deficits are needed to improve symptomatic treatment and slow down disease progression. This study aimed to identify individualized functional connectivity–based predictors of cognitive and motor function in ALS by using multiple kernel learning (MKL) regression. Resting-state fMRI scanning was performed on 34 riluzole-naive ALS patients. Motor severity and global cognition were separately measured with the revised ALS functional rating scale (ALSFRS-R) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Our results showed that functional connectivity within the default mode network (DMN) as well as between the DMN and the sensorimotor network (SMN), fronto-parietal network (FPN), and salience network (SN) were predictive for MoCA scores. Additionally, the observed connectivity patterns were also predictive for the individual ALSFRS-R scores. Our findings demonstrate that cognitive and motor impairments may share common connectivity fingerprints in ALS patients. Furthermore, the identified brain connectivity signatures may serve as novel targets for effective disease-modifying therapies.Author Summary. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is recognized as a multisystem disorder, and currently no effective therapy is available for this devastating disease. Reliable models that can predict disease progression may facilitate the development of more efficient symptomatic treatment. This study used multiple kernel learning algorithm to identify a potential functional connectivity–based marker for cognitive and motor functioning in ALS. The results show that cognitive decline and motor progression could be predicted by seed-based functional connectivity from the medial prefrontal cortex/posterior cingulate cortex to the sensorimotor network, fronto-parietal network, and salience network. The identified brain connectivity signatures may serve as novel targets for effective disease-modifying therapies.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Regression dynamic causal modeling (rDCM) is a novel and computationally highly efficient method for inferring effective connectivity at the whole-brain level. While face and construct validity of rDCM have already been demonstrated, here we assessed its test-retest reliability—a test-theoretical property of particular importance for clinical applications—together with group-level consistency of connection-specific estimates and consistency of whole-brain connectivity patterns over sessions. Using the Human Connectome Project dataset for eight different paradigms (tasks and rest) and two different parcellation schemes, we found that rDCM provided highly consistent connectivity estimates at the group level across sessions. Second, while test-retest reliability was limited when averaging over all connections (range of mean intraclass correlation coefficient 0.24–0.42 over tasks), reliability increased with connection strength, with stronger connections showing good to excellent test-retest reliability. Third, whole-brain connectivity patterns by rDCM allowed for identifying individual participants with high (and in some cases perfect) accuracy. Comparing the test-retest reliability of rDCM connectivity estimates with measures of functional connectivity, rDCM performed favorably—particularly when focusing on strong connections. Generally, for all methods and metrics, task-based connectivity estimates showed greater reliability than those from the resting state. Our results underscore the potential of rDCM for human connectomics and clinical applications.Author Summary. Test-retest reliability is an important prerequisite for the validity of connectivity estimates in many situations, particularly in clinical applications. Here, using different datasets from the Human Connectome Project, we demonstrate that regression dynamic causal modeling (rDCM) yields good to excellent test-retest reliability when focusing on strong connections. Comparing this with the test-retest reliability of functional connectivity measures, rDCM performed favorably in most cases. Furthermore, we show that reliability is not homogeneously distributed: We identified several regions (primarily in frontal and temporal lobe) that were linked via highly reliable connections, regardless of the paradigm. Finally, we demonstrate that individual connectivity profiles are sufficiently unique that participants can be identified with high accuracy. Our findings emphasize the potential of rDCM for robust inference on directed “connectivity fingerprints” from fMRI data.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Quantifying brain state transition cost is a fundamental problem in systems neuroscience. Previous studies utilized network control theory to measure the cost by considering a neural system as a deterministic dynamical system. However, this approach does not capture the stochasticity of neural systems, which is important for accurately quantifying brain state transition cost. Here, we propose a novel framework based on optimal control in stochastic systems. In our framework, we quantify the transition cost as the Kullback-Leibler divergence from an uncontrolled transition path to the optimally controlled path, which is known as Schrödinger Bridge. To test its utility, we applied this framework to functional magnetic resonance imaging data from the Human Connectome Project and computed the brain state transition cost in cognitive tasks. We demonstrate correspondence between brain state transition cost and the difficulty of tasks. The results suggest that our framework provides a general theoretical tool for investigating cognitive functions from the viewpoint of transition cost.Author Summary. In our daily lives, we perform numerous tasks with different kinds and levels of cognitive demand. To successfully perform these tasks, the brain needs to modulate its spontaneous activity to reach an appropriate state for each task. Previous studies utilized optimal control in deterministic systems to measure the cost for the brain state transition. However, no unified framework for quantifying brain state transition cost that takes account of the stochasticity of neural activities has been proposed. Here, we describe a novel framework for measuring brain state transition cost, utilizing the idea of optimal control in stochastic systems. We assessed the utility of our framework for quantifying the cost of transitioning between various cognitive tasks. Our framework can be applied to very diverse settings because of its generality.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Structural plasticity of the brain can be represented in a highly simplified form as adaptive rewiring, the relay of connections according to the spontaneous dynamic synchronization in network activity. Adaptive rewiring, over time, leads from initial random networks to brain-like complex networks, that is, networks with modular small-world structures and a rich-club effect. Adaptive rewiring has only been studied, however, in networks of identical oscillators with uniform or random coupling strengths. To implement information-processing functions (e.g., stimulus selection or memory storage), it is necessary to consider symmetry-breaking perturbations of oscillator amplitudes and coupling strengths. We studied whether nonuniformities in amplitude or connection strength could operate in tandem with adaptive rewiring. Throughout network evolution, either amplitude or connection strength of a subset of oscillators was kept different from the rest. In these extreme conditions, subsets might become isolated from the rest of the network or otherwise interfere with the development of network complexity. However, whereas these subsets form distinctive structural and functional communities, they generally maintain connectivity with the rest of the network and allow the development of network complexity. Pathological development was observed only in a small proportion of the models. These results suggest that adaptive rewiring can robustly operate alongside information processing in biological and artificial neural networks.Author Summary. Dynamic synchronization in coupled oscillators has been studied extensively. Previously, it has been shown how these dynamics can adaptively rewire a random network structure into a complex, brain-like one. For biological and artificial networks to benefit from this dynamic self-organization, these networks must have input and memory facilities. Both functions involve breaking the symmetry of uniform network oscillators and network connectivity strength. We show that adaptive rewiring is generally robust against such perturbations. Notably, we show—via novel methods of comparing network structures—that local symmetry-breaking perturbations can develop discernible anatomical and functional connectivity structures at the global level. Our research qualifies adaptive rewiring as a potential tool for optimizing connectivity in biological and artificial neural networks.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Stroke frequently produces attentional dysfunctions including symptoms of hemispatial neglect, which is characterized by a breakdown of awareness for the contralesional hemispace. Recent studies with functional MRI (fMRI) suggest that hemineglect patients display abnormal intra- and interhemispheric functional connectivity. However, since stroke is a vascular disorder and fMRI signals remain sensitive to nonneuronal (i.e., vascular) coupling, more direct demonstrations of neural network dysfunction in hemispatial neglect are warranted. Here, we utilize electroencephalogram (EEG) source imaging to uncover differences in resting-state network organization between patients with right hemispheric stroke (N = 15) and age-matched, healthy controls (N = 27), and determine the relationship between hemineglect symptoms and brain network organization. We estimated intra- and interregional differences in cortical communication by calculating the spectral power and amplitude envelope correlations of narrow-band EEG oscillations. We first observed focal frequency-slowing within the right posterior cortical regions, reflected in relative delta/theta power increases and alpha/beta/gamma decreases. Secondly, nodes within the right temporal and parietal cortex consistently displayed anomalous intra- and interhemispheric coupling, stronger in delta and gamma bands, and weaker in theta, alpha, and beta bands. Finally, a significant association was observed between the severity of left-hemispace search deficits (e.g., cancellation test omissions) and reduced functional connectivity within the alpha and beta bands. In sum, our novel results validate the hypothesis of large-scale cortical network disruption following stroke and reinforce the proposal that abnormal brain oscillations may be intimately involved in the pathophysiology of visuospatial neglect.Author Summary. Stroke patients often exhibit a disabling deficit of visual awareness in the hemifield opposite to their brain lesion, known as hemineglect. Recent studies with functional MRI (fMRI) suggest that hemineglect patients display abnormal functional coupling (i.e., connectivity) within and between brain hemispheres. However, since stroke is a vascular disorder and fMRI measures nonneuronal (i.e., vascular) coupling, we here provide direct evidence of neural network dysfunction in hemineglect by using electroencephalogram (EEG) source imaging, which measures the electrical fluctuations of large neuronal populations. Overall, we observed a breakdown of interhemispheric network connectivity within alpha/beta rhythms, which specifically correlated with the degree of patients’ hemispatial errors. The high temporal resolution and frequency content of EEG signals could lead to more sensitive markers and targeted rehabilitation approaches of hemineglect.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Analyzing brain networks has long been a prominent research topic in neuroimaging. However, statistical methods to detect differences between these networks and relate them to phenotypic traits are still sorely needed. Our previous work developed a novel permutation testing framework to detect differences between two groups. Here we advance that work to allow both assessing differences by continuous phenotypes and controlling for confounding variables. To achieve this, we propose an innovative regression framework to relate distances (or similarities) between brain network features to functions of absolute differences in continuous covariates and indicators of difference for categorical variables. We explore several similarity metrics for comparing distances (or similarities) between connection matrices, and adapt several standard methods for estimation and inference within our framework: standard F test, F test with individual level effects (ILE), feasible generalized least squares (FGLS), and permutation. Via simulation studies, we assess all approaches for estimation and inference while comparing them with existing multivariate distance matrix regression (MDMR) methods. We then illustrate the utility of our framework by analyzing the relationship between fluid intelligence and brain network distances in Human Connectome Project (HCP) data.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this critical review, we examine the application of predictive models, for example, classifiers, trained using machine learning (ML) to assist in interpretation of functional neuroimaging data. Our primary goal is to summarize how ML is being applied and critically assess common practices. Our review covers 250 studies published using ML and resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) to infer various dimensions of the human functional connectome. Results for holdout (“lockbox”) performance was, on average, ∼13\% less accurate than performance measured through cross-validation alone, highlighting the importance of lockbox data, which was included in only 16\% of the studies. There was also a concerning lack of transparency across the key steps in training and evaluating predictive models. The summary of this literature underscores the importance of the use of a lockbox and highlights several methodological pitfalls that can be addressed by the imaging community. We argue that, ideally, studies are motivated both by the reproducibility and generalizability of findings as well as the potential clinical significance of the insights. We offer recommendations for principled integration of machine learning into the clinical neurosciences with the goal of advancing imaging biomarkers of brain disorders, understanding causative determinants for health risks, and parsing heterogeneous patient outcomes.},

So far, most discoveries in network neuroscience have prioritized insights that highlight distinct groupings and specialized functional contributions of network nodes. Importantly, these functional contributions are determined and expressed by the web of their interrelationships, formed by network edges. Here, we underscore the important contributions made by brain network edges for understanding distributed brain organization. Different types of edges represent different types of relationships, including connectivity and similarity among nodes. Adopting a specific definition of edges can fundamentally alter how we analyze and interpret a brain network. Furthermore, edges can associate into collectives and higher order arrangements, describe time series, and form edge communities that provide insights into brain network topology complementary to the traditional node-centric perspective. Focusing on the edges, and the higher order or dynamic information they can provide, discloses previously underappreciated aspects of structural and functional network organization.},
