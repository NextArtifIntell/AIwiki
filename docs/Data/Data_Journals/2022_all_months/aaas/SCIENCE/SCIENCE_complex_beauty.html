  abstract     = {The near-Earth carbonaceous asteroid (162173) Ryugu is expected to contain volatile chemical species that could provide information on the origin of Earth’s volatiles. Samples of Ryugu were retrieved by the Hayabusa2 spacecraft. We measured noble gas and nitrogen isotopes in Ryugu samples and found that they are dominated by presolar and primordial components, incorporated during Solar System formation. Noble gas concentrations are higher than those in Ivuna-type carbonaceous (CI) chondrite meteorites. Several host phases of isotopically distinct nitrogen have different abundances among the samples. Our measurements support a close relationship between Ryugu and CI chondrites. Noble gases produced by galactic cosmic rays, indicating a ~5 million year exposure, and from implanted solar wind record the recent irradiation history of Ryugu after it migrated to its current orbit.},

Carbon dioxide–bearing water inclusions are present within a pyrrhotite crystal, indicating that Ryugu’s parent asteroid formed in the outer Solar System. The samples contain low abundances of materials that formed at high temperatures, such as chondrules and calcium- and aluminum-rich inclusions. The samples are rich in phyllosilicates and carbonates, which formed through aqueous alteration reactions at low temperature, high pH, and water/rock ratios of &lt;1 (by mass). Less altered fragments contain olivine, pyroxene, amorphous silicates, calcite, and phosphide. Numerical simulations, based on the mineralogical and physical properties of the samples, indicate that Ryugu’s parent body formed ~2 million years after the beginning of Solar System formation.},

We measured the mineralogy and bulk chemical and isotopic compositions of Ryugu samples. The samples are mainly composed of materials similar to those of carbonaceous chondrite meteorites, particularly the CI (Ivuna-type) group. The samples consist predominantly of minerals formed in aqueous fluid on a parent planetesimal. The primary minerals were altered by fluids at a temperature of 37° ± 10°C, about 5.2 − 0.7 + 0.8 million (statistical) or 5.2 − 2.1 + 1.6 million (systematic) years after the formation of the first solids in the Solar System. After aqueous alteration, the Ryugu samples were likely never heated above ~100°C. The samples have a chemical composition that more closely resembles that of the Sun’s photosphere than other natural samples do.},

  abstract     = {Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a rare and severe condition that follows benign COVID-19. We report autosomal recessive deficiencies of OAS1 , OAS2 , or RNASEL in five unrelated children with MIS-C. The cytosolic double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)–sensing OAS1 and OAS2 generate 2′-5′-linked oligoadenylates (2-5A) that activate the single-stranded RNA–degrading ribonuclease L (RNase L). Monocytic cell lines and primary myeloid cells with OAS1, OAS2, or RNase L deficiencies produce excessive amounts of inflammatory cytokines upon dsRNA or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) stimulation. Exogenous 2-5A suppresses cytokine production in OAS1-deficient but not RNase L–deficient cells. Cytokine production in RNase L–deficient cells is impaired by MDA5 or RIG-I deficiency and abolished by mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) deficiency. Recessive OAS–RNase L deficiencies in these patients unleash the production of SARS-CoV-2–triggered, MAVS-mediated inflammatory cytokines by mononuclear phagocytes, thereby underlying MIS-C.},

We leverage advances in earthquake monitoring with deep learning algorithms to image the structures underlying a major mantle earthquake swarm of nearly 200,000 events that rapidly accelerated after the 2018 Kīlauea caldera collapse. At depths of 36 to 43 kilometers, we resolve a 15-kilometers-long collection of near-horizontal sheeted structures that we identify as a sill complex. These sills connect to the lower depths of Kīlauea’s plumbing by a 25-kilometers-long belt of seismicity. Additionally, a column of seismicity links the sill complex to a shallow décollement near Mauna Loa. These findings implicate the mantle sill complex as a nexus for magma transport beneath Hawai‘i and furthermore indicate widespread magmatic connectivity in the volcanic system.},

The monkeypox virus (MPXV) has its own DNA polymerase F8, together with the processive cofactors A22 and E4, constituting the polymerase holoenzyme for genome replication. Here, we determined the holoenzyme structure in complex with DNA using cryo–electron microscopy at the global resolution of ~2.8 angstroms. The holoenzyme possesses an architecture that suggests a “forward sliding clamp” processivity mechanism for viral DNA replication. MPXV polymerase has a DNA binding mode similar to that of other B-family DNA polymerases from different species. These findings reveal the mechanism of the MPXV genome replication and may guide the development of anti-poxvirus drugs.},

Here, we report that nearly 200 distinct neurons in the Drosophila visual system can each be defined by unique combinations of on average 10 continuously expressed transcription factors. We show that targeted modifications of this terminal selector code induce predictable conversions of neuronal fates that appear morphologically and transcriptionally complete. Cis-regulatory analysis of open chromatin links one of these genes to an upstream patterning factor that specifies neuronal fates in stem cells. Experimentally validated network models describe the synergistic regulation of downstream effectors by terminal selectors and ecdysone signaling during brain wiring. Our results provide a generalizable framework of how specific fates are implemented in postmitotic neurons.},

  abstract     = {Learning to predict rewards based on environmental cues is essential for survival. It is believed that animals learn to predict rewards by updating predictions whenever the outcome deviates from expectations, and that such reward prediction errors (RPEs) are signaled by the mesolimbic dopamine system—a key controller of learning. However, instead of learning prospective predictions from RPEs, animals can infer predictions by learning the retrospective cause of rewards. Hence, whether mesolimbic dopamine instead conveys a causal associative signal that sometimes resembles RPE remains unknown. We developed an algorithm for retrospective causal learning and found that mesolimbic dopamine release conveys causal associations but not RPE, thereby challenging the dominant theory of reward learning. Our results reshape the conceptual and biological framework for associative learning.},

  abstract     = {Developing high-efficiency cooling with safe, low–global warming potential refrigerants is a grand challenge for tackling climate change. Caloric effect–based cooling technologies, such as magneto- or electrocaloric refrigeration, are promising but often require large applied fields for a relatively low coefficient of performance and adiabatic temperature change. We propose using the ionocaloric effect and the accompanying thermodynamic cycle as a caloric-based, all–condensed-phase cooling technology. Theoretical and experimental results show higher adiabatic temperature change and entropy change per unit mass and volume compared with other caloric effects under low applied field strengths. We demonstrated the viability of a practical system using an ionocaloric Stirling refrigeration cycle. Our experimental results show a coefficient of performance of 30\% relative to Carnot and a temperature lift as high as 25°C using a voltage strength of ~0.22 volts.},

  abstract     = {The primary motor cortex (M1) is involved in the control of voluntary movements and is extensively mapped in this capacity. Although the M1 is implicated in modulation of pain, the underlying circuitry and causal underpinnings remain elusive. We unexpectedly unraveled a connection from the M1 to the nucleus accumbens reward circuitry through a M1 layer 6-mediodorsal thalamus pathway, which specifically suppresses negative emotional valence and associated coping behaviors in neuropathic pain. By contrast, layer 5 M1 neurons connect with specific cell populations in zona incerta and periaqueductal gray to suppress sensory hypersensitivity without altering pain affect. Thus, the M1 employs distinct, layer-specific pathways to attune sensory and aversive-emotional components of neuropathic pain, which can be exploited for purposes of pain relief.},

  abstract     = {The capacity of transition metals to bind and transform carbon monoxide (CO) is critical to its use in many chemical processes as a sustainable, inexpensive C1 building block. By contrast, only few s- and p-block element compounds bind and activate CO, and conversion of CO into useful carbonyl-containing organic compounds in such cases remains elusive. We report that metalated phosphorus ylides provide facile access to ketenyl anions ([RC=C=O] – ) by phosphine displacement with CO. These anions are very stable and storable reagents with a distinctive electronic structure between that of the prototypical ketene (H 2 C=C=O) and that of ethynol (HC≡C–OH). Nonetheless, the ketenyl anions selectively react with a range of electrophiles at the carbon atom, thus offering high-yielding and versatile access to ketenes and related compounds.},

We present a strategy for fabricating arbitrary 3D nanostructures with a library of materials including metals, metal alloys, 2D materials, oxides, diamond, upconversion materials, semiconductors, polymers, biomaterials, molecular crystals, and inks. Specifically, hydrogels patterned by femtosecond light sheets are used as templates that allow for direct assembly of materials to form designed nanostructures. By fine-tuning the exposure strategy and features of the patterned gel, 2D and 3D structures of 20- to 200-nm resolution are realized. We fabricated nanodevices, including encrypted optical storage and microelectrodes, to demonstrate their designed functionality and precision. These results show that our method provides a systematic solution for nanofabrication across different classes of materials and opens up further possibilities for the design of sophisticated nanodevices.},

We demonstrate the ability of high-entropy metal cation mixes to improve ionic conductivity in a compound, which leads to less reliance on specific chemistries and enhanced synthesizability. The local distortions introduced into high-entropy materials give rise to an overlapping distribution of site energies for the alkali ions so that they can percolate with low activation energy. Experiments verify that high entropy leads to orders-of-magnitude higher ionic conductivities in lithium (Li)–sodium (Na) superionic conductor (Li-NASICON), sodium NASICON (Na-NASICON), and Li-garnet structures, even at fixed alkali content. We provide insight into selecting the optimal distortion and designing high-entropy superionic conductors across the vast compositional space.},

  abstract     = {Transparency in animals is a complex form of camouflage involving mechanisms that reduce light scattering and absorption throughout the organism. In vertebrates, attaining transparency is difficult because their circulatory system is full of red blood cells (RBCs) that strongly attenuate light. Here, we document how glassfrogs overcome this challenge by concealing these cells from view. Using photoacoustic imaging to track RBCs in vivo, we show that resting glassfrogs increase transparency two- to threefold by removing ~89\% of their RBCs from circulation and packing them within their liver. Vertebrate transparency thus requires both see-through tissues and active mechanisms that “clear” respiratory pigments from these tissues. Furthermore, glassfrogs’ ability to regulate the location, density, and packing of RBCs without clotting offers insight in metabolic, hemodynamic, and blood-clot research.},

Despite its importance, the essential regulators of ZGA remain largely unknown in mammals. On the basis of de novo motif searches, we identified the orphan nuclear receptor Nr5a2 as a key activator of major ZGA in mouse two-cell embryos. Nr5a2 is required for progression beyond the two-cell stage. It binds to its motif within SINE B1/Alu retrotransposable elements found in cis-regulatory regions of ZGA genes. Chemical inhibition suggests that 72\% of ZGA genes are regulated by Nr5a2 and potentially other orphan nuclear receptors. Nr5a2 promotes chromatin accessibility during ZGA and binds nucleosomal DNA in vitro. We conclude that Nr5a2 is an essential pioneer factor that regulates ZGA.},

Typically, the magnetic field is measured by averaging sequential measurements of single NV centers, or by spatial averaging over ensembles of many NV centers, which provides mean values that contain no nonlocal information about the relationship between two points separated in space or time. Here, we propose and implement a sensing modality whereby two or more NV centers are measured simultaneously, and we extract temporal and spatial correlations in their signals that would otherwise be inaccessible. We demonstrate measurements of correlated applied noise using spin-to-charge readout of two NV centers and implement a spectral reconstruction protocol for disentangling local and nonlocal noise sources.},

However, issues with Br–I phase segregation under solar cell operational conditions (such as light and heat) limit the device voltage and operational stability. This challenge is often exacerbated by the ready defect formation associated with the rapid crystallization of Br-rich perovskite chemistry with antisolvent processes. We combined the rapid Br crystallization with a gentle gas-quench method to prepare highly textured columnar 1.75–electron volt Br–I mixed WBG perovskite films with reduced defect density. With this approach, we obtained 1.75–electron volt WBG PSCs with greater than 20\% power conversion efficiency, approximately 1.33-volt open-circuit voltage ( V oc ), and excellent operational stability (less than 5\% degradation over 1100 hours of operation under 1.2 sun at 65°C). When further integrated with 1.25–electron volt narrow-bandgap PSC, we obtained a 27.1\% efficient, all-perovskite, two-terminal tandem device with a high V oc of 2.2 volts.},

  abstract     = {In the Research Article “Gradual emergence followed by exponential spread of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant in Africa”(1), we reported data from retrospective characterization of viral genomes of putative ancestors of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant from western Africa months before the first detection of Omicron. After several social media posts suggested that these putative early Omicron ancestor sequences may have been false positives, we reanalyzed our data and the residual samples. We found a mixture of different SARS-CoV-2 genomic fragments contaminating some of the samples and sequence data on which we based our analysis. The residual samples are now exhausted, and the reconstruction of evolutionary intermediates cannot be replicated. Therefore, we are retracting our Research Article. The epidemiological data are not called into question and will be made available.},

Most peroxisomal proteins are imported from the cytosol in a folded state by the soluble receptor PEX5. How folded cargo crosses the membrane is unknown. Here, we show that peroxisomal import is similar to nuclear transport. The peroxisomal membrane protein PEX13 contains a conserved tyrosine (Y)– and glycine (G)–rich YG domain, which forms a selective phase resembling that formed by phenylalanine-glycine (FG) repeats within nuclear pores. PEX13 resides in the membrane in two orientations that oligomerize and suspend the YG meshwork within the lipid bilayer. Purified YG domains form hydrogels into which PEX5 selectively partitions, by using conserved aromatic amino acid motifs, bringing cargo along. The YG meshwork thus forms an aqueous conduit through which PEX5 delivers folded proteins into peroxisomes.},

We show that endosomal signaling lipid turnover by MTM1, a phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate [PI(3)P] 3-phosphatase mutated in X-linked centronuclear myopathy in humans, controls mitochondrial morphology and function by reshaping the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Starvation-induced endosomal recruitment of MTM1 impairs PI(3)P-dependent contact formation between tubular ER membranes and early endosomes, resulting in the conversion of ER tubules into sheets, the inhibition of mitochondrial fission, and sustained oxidative metabolism. Our results unravel an important role for early endosomal lipid signaling in controlling ER shape and, thereby, mitochondrial form and function to enable cells to adapt to fluctuating nutrient environments.},

To overcome suppression, we engineered circuits in which tumor-specific synNotch receptors locally induce production of the cytokine IL-2. These circuits potently enhance CAR T cell infiltration and clearance of immune-excluded tumors, without systemic toxicity. The most effective IL-2 induction circuit acts in an autocrine and T cell receptor (TCR)- or CAR-independent manner, bypassing suppression mechanisms including consumption of IL-2 or inhibition of TCR signaling. These engineered cells establish a foothold in the target tumors, with synthetic Notch–induced IL-2 production enabling initiation of CAR-mediated T cell expansion and cell killing. Thus, it is possible to reconstitute synthetic T cell circuits that activate the outputs ultimately required for an antitumor response, but in a manner that evades key points of tumor suppression.},

We used cryogenic transmission electron microscopy and spectroscopy to simultaneously image the structural reconstruction and associated localization of the lowest-energy intralayer exciton in a rotationally aligned WS 2 -WSe 2 moiré superlattice. In conjunction with optical spectroscopy and ab initio calculations, we determined that the exciton center-of-mass wave function is confined to a radius of approximately 2 nanometers around the highest-energy stacking site in the moiré unit cell. Our results provide direct evidence that atomic reconstructions lead to the strongly confining moiré potentials and that engineering strain at the nanoscale will enable new types of excitonic lattices.},

As a proof of principle, we engineered gene switches and circuits that allow precise, user-defined control over therapeutically relevant genes in primary T cells using orthogonal, US Food and Drug Administration–approved small-molecule inducers. Our circuits can instruct T cells to sequentially activate multiple cellular programs such as proliferation and antitumor activity to drive synergistic therapeutic responses.

Clinical bioelectrodes with established electrochemical functionalities are rigid and mechanically mismatched with tissue. Whereas conductive materials with tissue-like softness and stretchability are demonstrated, when applied to electrochemically probe tissue, their performance is distorted by strain and corrosion. We devise a layered architectural composite design that couples strain-induced cracked films with a strain-isolated out-of-plane conductive pathway and in-plane nanowire networks to eliminate strain effects on device electrochemical performance. Accordingly, we developed a library of stretchable, highly conductive, and strain-insensitive bioelectrodes featuring clinically established brittle interfacial materials (iridium-oxide, gold, platinum, and carbon). We paired these bioelectrodes with different electrochemical probing methods (amperometry, voltammetry, and potentiometry) and demonstrated strain-insensitive sensing of multiple biomarkers and in vivo neuromodulation.},

In this work, we identify an emergent dynamical fractal in a disorder-free, stoichiometric, and three-dimensional magnetic crystal in thermodynamic equilibrium. The phenomenon is born from constraints on the dynamics of the magnetic monopole excitations in spin ice, which restrict them to move on the fractal. This observation explains the anomalous exponent found in magnetic noise experiments in the spin ice compound Dy 2 Ti 2 O 7 , and it resolves a long-standing puzzle about its rapidly diverging relaxation time. The capacity of spin ice to exhibit such notable phenomena suggests that there will be further unexpected discoveries in the cooperative dynamics of even simple topological many-body systems.},

  abstract     = {After decades of debate, biologists today largely agree that most speciation events require an allopatric phase (that is, geographic separation), but the role of adaptive ecological divergence during this critical period is still unknown. Here, we show that relatively few allopatric pairs of birds, mammals, or amphibians exhibit trait differences consistent with models of divergent adaptation in each of many ecologically relevant traits. By fitting new evolutionary models to numerous sets of sister-pair trait differences, we find that speciating and recently speciated allopatric taxa seem to overwhelmingly evolve under similar rather than divergent macro–selective pressures. This contradicts the classical view of divergent adaptation as a prominent driver of the early stages of speciation and helps synthesize two historical controversies regarding the ecology and geography of species formation.},

  abstract     = {Aliphatic allylic amines are found in a great variety of complex and biorelevant molecules. The direct allylic C–H amination of alkenes serves as the most straightforward method toward these motifs. However, use of widely available internal alkenes with aliphatic amines in this transformation remains a synthetic challenge. In particular, palladium catalysis faces the twin challenges of inefficient coordination of Pd(II) to internal alkenes but excessively tight and therefore inhibitory coordination of Pd(II) by basic aliphatic amines. We report a general solution to these problems. The developed protocol, in contrast to a classical Pd(II/0) scenario, operates through a blue light–induced Pd(0/I/II) manifold with mild aryl bromide oxidant. This open-shell approach also enables enantio- and diastereoselective allylic C–H amination.},

  abstract     = {Cell death induced by tumor necrosis factor (TNF) can be beneficial during infection by helping to mount proper immune responses. However, TNF-induced death can also drive a variety of inflammatory pathologies. Protectives brakes, or cell-death checkpoints, normally repress TNF cytotoxicity to protect the organism from its potential detrimental consequences. Thus, although TNF can kill, this only occurs when one of the checkpoints is inactivated. Here, we describe a checkpoint that prevents apoptosis through the detoxification of the cytotoxic complex IIa that forms upon TNF sensing. We found that autophagy-related 9A (ATG9A) and 200kD FAK family kinase-interacting protein (FIP200) promote the degradation of this complex through a light chain 3 (LC3)–independent lysosomal targeting pathway. This detoxification mechanism was found to counteract TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1)–mediated embryonic lethality and inflammatory skin disease in mouse models.},

  abstract     = {Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) costimulatory domains derived from native immune receptors steer the phenotypic output of therapeutic T cells. We constructed a library of CARs containing ~2300 synthetic costimulatory domains, built from combinations of 13 signaling motifs. These CARs promoted diverse human T cell fates, which were sensitive to motif combinations and configurations. Neural networks trained to decode the combinatorial grammar of CAR signaling motifs allowed extraction of key design rules. For example, non-native combinations of motifs that bind tumor necrosis factor receptor–associated factors (TRAFs) and phospholipase C gamma 1 (PLCγ1) enhanced cytotoxicity and stemness associated with effective tumor killing. Thus, libraries built from minimal building blocks of signaling, combined with machine learning, can efficiently guide engineering of receptors with desired phenotypes.},

However, truly combining all in one single material has proven very challenging. In this work, we filled a commercial polyimide with ultrahigh loadings of a high–aspect ratio, CO 2 -philic Na-SSZ-39 zeolite with a three-dimensional channel system that precisely separates gas molecules. By carefully designing both zeolite and MMM synthesis, we created a gas-percolation highway across a flexible and aging-resistant (more than 1 year) membrane. The combination of a CO 2 -CH 4 mixed-gas selectivity of ~423 and a CO 2 permeability of ~8300 Barrer outperformed all existing polymer-based membranes and even most zeolite-only membranes.},

Designing better electrolytes and interphases holds the key to the success of these batteries. As the only component that interfaces with every other component in the device, an electrolyte must satisfy multiple criteria simultaneously. These include transporting ions while insulating electrons between the electrodes and maintaining stability against electrodes of extreme chemical natures: the strongly oxidative cathode and the strongly reductive anode. In most advanced batteries, the two electrodes operate at potentials far beyond the thermodynamic stability limits of electrolytes, so the stability therein has to be realized kinetically through an interphase formed from the sacrificial reactions between electrolyte and electrodes.},

Elucidating this interplay is crucial for discerning and designing gene regulatory systems. We quantitatively characterized gene-specific and systemic factors that affect transcription and translation genome-wide for Escherichia coli across many conditions. The results revealed two design principles that make regulation of gene expression insulated from concentrations of shared machineries: RNA polymerase activity is fine-tuned to match translational output, and translational characteristics are similar across most messenger RNAs (mRNAs). Consequently, in bacteria, protein concentration is set primarily at the promoter level. A simple mathematical formula relates promoter activities and protein concentrations across growth conditions, enabling quantitative inference of gene regulation from omics data.},

Most commercial piezoelectric actuators contain lead, posing environmental challenges. We show that a giant strain (1.05\%) and a large-signal piezoelectric strain coefficient (2100 picometer/volt) are achieved in strontium (Sr)–doped (K,Na)NbO 3 lead-free piezoceramics, being synthesized by the conventional solid-state reaction method without any post treatment. The underlying mechanism responsible for the ultrahigh electrostrain is the interaction between defect dipoles and domain switching. The fatigue resistance, thermal stability, and strain value (0.25\%) at 20 kilovolt/centimeter are comparable with or better than those of commercial Pb(Zr,Ti)O 3 -based ceramics, showing great potential for practical applications. This material may provide a lead-free alternative with a simple composition for piezoelectric actuators and a paradigm for the design of high-performance piezoelectrics.},

  abstract     = {In nature, snowflake ice crystals arrange themselves into diverse symmetrical six-sided structures. We show an analogy of this when zinc (Zn) dissolves and crystallizes in liquid gallium (Ga). The low-melting-temperature Ga is used as a “metallic solvent” to synthesize a range of flake-like Zn crystals. We extract these metallic crystals from the liquid metal solvent by reducing its surface tension using a combination of electrocapillary modulation and vacuum filtration. The liquid metal–grown crystals feature high morphological diversity and persistent symmetry. The concept is expanded to other single and binary metal solutes and Ga-based solvents, with the growth mechanisms elucidated through ab initio simulation of interfacial stability. This strategy offers general routes for creating highly crystalline, shape-controlled metallic or multimetallic fine structures from liquid metal solvents.},

Genomic analysis of 51,229 Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( Mtb ) clinical isolates has identified an essential transcriptional regulator, Rv1830 , herein called resR for resilience regulator, as a frequent target of positive (adaptive) selection. resR mutants do not show canonical drug resistance or drug tolerance but instead shorten the post-antibiotic effect, meaning that they enable Mtb to resume growth after drug exposure substantially faster than wild-type strains. We refer to this phenotype as antibiotic resilience. ResR acts in a regulatory cascade with other transcription factors controlling cell growth and division, which are also under positive selection in clinical isolates of Mtb . Mutations of these genes are associated with treatment failure and the acquisition of canonical drug resistance.},

However, emerging therapeutic strategies break traditional drug design rules by employing flexibly linked chemical entities composed of more than one ligand. Using complementary genome-scale chemical-genetic approaches we identified an endogenous chemical uptake pathway involving interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) that modulates the cell permeability of a prototypical biopic inhibitor of MTOR (RapaLink-1, MW: 1784 g/mol). We devised additional linked inhibitors targeting BCR-ABL1 (DasatiLink-1, MW: 1518 g/mol) and EIF4A1 (BisRoc-1, MW: 1466 g/mol), uptake of which was facilitated by IFITMs. We also found that IFITMs moderately assisted some proteolysis-targeting chimeras and examined the physicochemical requirements for involvement of this uptake pathway.},

Although these reactive intermediates are engaged in stereoselective processes in nature, exerting enantiocontrol over carbocations with synthetic catalysts remains challenging. Many resonance-stabilized tricoordinated carbocations, such as iminium and oxocarbenium ions, have been applied in catalytic enantioselective reactions. However, their dicoordinated counterparts (aryl and vinyl carbocations) have not, despite their emerging utility in chemical synthesis. We report the discovery of a highly enantioselective vinyl carbocation carbon–hydrogen (C–H) insertion reaction enabled by imidodiphosphorimidate organocatalysts. Active site confinement featured in this catalyst class not only enables effective enantiocontrol but also expands the scope of vinyl cation C–H insertion chemistry, which broadens the utility of this transition metal–free C(sp 3 )–H functionalization platform.},

Through genome analysis of present-day and historical samples spanning environments over the past two centuries, we studied the effect of these changes in farming on the extent and tempo of evolution across the native range of the common waterhemp ( Amaranthus tuberculatus ), a now pervasive agricultural weed. Modern agriculture has imposed strengths of selection rarely observed in the wild, with notable shifts in allele frequency trajectories since agricultural intensification in the 1960s. An evolutionary response to this extreme selection was facilitated by a concurrent human-mediated range shift. By reshaping genome-wide diversity across the landscape, agriculture has driven the success of this weed in the 21st century.},

Both midranges increased rapidly to 3685 ± 87 m in the Late Miocene (~11 Ma) in the east, and to 3589 ± 62 m at ~7 Ma in the west. Our estimated rises in the east and west parts of the NTP during 15 to 7 Ma, together with data from other TP regions, indicate that during the Late Miocene the entire plateau may have reached a high elevation close to that of today, with consequent impacts on atmospheric precipitation and alpine biodiversity.},

  abstract     = {Since July, China has experienced the most severe heatwave ever recorded in the world, compounded by the worst drought since record-keeping began in the country six decades ago (1). The areas hardest hit by the combined heatwave and drought fall along the Yangtze River basin, a populous and immense industrial economic belt. Impacts range from disruptions in global supply chains (2) to reductions in habitat for critically endangered species such as the Yangtze finless porpoise. Long-term anticipatory policies are needed to mitigate these far-reaching effects, in China and beyond, yet the current policy approach favors short-term solutions that are ill-equipped to tackle persistent climatic extremes in an era of climate catastrophe.},

Massive salmon escapes from sea-based farms in Patagonia are frequent; escapes occur 1 to 16 times per year, and about 5 million salmon escaped between 2010 and 2020 (2). Escapes result in socio-environmental risks (2, 3) and may increase the likelihood that salmon will become invasive in Patagonia (2, 4). Adverse effects of aquaculture salmon on native biodiversity have been well documented, including the declines of native and threatened freshwater fish populations (2, 5, 6). Traditional livelihood fishing activities of local communities have also been disrupted by escaped salmon (6). There is a clear need to reduce these impacts on Patagonia, a valuable global natural reserve (2).},

  abstract     = {Madagascar’s unique biota is heavily affected by human activity and is under intense threat. Here, we review the current state of knowledge on the conservation status of Madagascar’s terrestrial and freshwater biodiversity by presenting data and analyses on documented and predicted species-level conservation statuses, the most prevalent and relevant threats, ex situ collections and programs, and the coverage and comprehensiveness of protected areas. The existing terrestrial protected area network in Madagascar covers 10.4\% of its land area and includes at least part of the range of the majority of described native species of vertebrates with known distributions (97.1\% of freshwater fishes, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals combined) and plants (67.7\%). The overall figures are higher for threatened species (97.7\% of threatened vertebrates and 79.6\% of threatened plants occurring within at least one protected area). International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List assessments and Bayesian neural network analyses for plants identify overexploitation of biological resources and unsustainable agriculture as the most prominent threats to biodiversity. We highlight five opportunities for action at multiple levels to ensure that conservation and ecological restoration objectives, programs, and activities take account of complex underlying and interacting factors and produce tangible benefits for the biodiversity and people of Madagascar.},

We tested 13,097 COVID-19 patients sampled between mid-2021 to early 2022 from 22 African countries for BA.1 by real-time RT-PCR. By November-December 2021, BA.1 had replaced the Delta variant in all African sub-regions following a South-North gradient, with a peak Rt of 4.1. Polymerase chain reaction and near-full genome sequencing data revealed genetically diverse Omicron ancestors already existed across Africa by August 2021. Mutations, altering viral tropism, replication and immune escape, gradually accumulated in the spike gene. Omicron ancestors were therefore present in several African countries months before Omicron dominated transmission. These data also indicate that travel bans are ineffective in the face of undetected and widespread infection.},

  abstract     = {Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) can protect against HIV infection but have not been induced by human vaccination. A key barrier to bnAb induction is vaccine priming of rare bnAb-precursor B cells. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 1 clinical trial, the HIV vaccine–priming candidate eOD-GT8 60mer adjuvanted with AS01 B had a favorable safety profile and induced VRC01-class bnAb precursors in 97\% of vaccine recipients with median frequencies reaching 0.1\% among immunoglobulin G B cells in blood. bnAb precursors shared properties with bnAbs and gained somatic hypermutation and affinity with the boost. The results establish clinical proof of concept for germline-targeting vaccine priming, support development of boosting regimens to induce bnAbs, and encourage application of the germline-targeting strategy to other targets in HIV and other pathogens.},

  abstract     = {Monitoring of cell-cell communication in multicellular organisms is fundamental to understanding diverse biological processes such as embryogenesis and tumorigenesis. To track cell-cell contacts in vivo, we developed an intercellular genetic technology to monitor cell-cell contact and to trace cell contact histories by permanently marking contacts between cells. In mice, we engineered an artificial Notch ligand into one cell (the sender cell) and an artificial receptor into another cell (the receiver cell). Contact between the sender and receiver cells triggered a synthetic Notch signaling that activated downstream transcriptional programs in the receiver cell, thereby transiently or permanently labeling it. In vivo cell-cell contact was observed during development, tissue homeostasis, and tumor growth. This technology may be useful for studying dynamic in vivo cell-cell contacts and cell fate plasticity.},

  abstract     = {Madagascar’s biota is hyperdiverse and includes exceptional levels of endemicity. We review the current state of knowledge on Madagascar’s past and current terrestrial and freshwater biodiversity by compiling and presenting comprehensive data on species diversity, endemism, and rates of species description and human uses, in addition to presenting an updated and simplified map of vegetation types. We report a substantial increase of records and species new to science in recent years; however, the diversity and evolution of many groups remain practically unknown (e.g., fungi and most invertebrates). Digitization efforts are increasing the resolution of species richness patterns and we highlight the crucial role of field- and collections-based research for advancing biodiversity knowledge and identifying gaps in our understanding, particularly as species richness corresponds closely to collection effort. Phylogenetic diversity patterns mirror that of species richness and endemism in most of the analyzed groups. We highlight humid forests as centers of diversity and endemism because of their role as refugia and centers of recent and rapid radiations. However, the distinct endemism of other areas, such as the grassland-woodland mosaic of the Central Highlands and the spiny forest of the southwest, is also biologically important despite lower species richness. The documented uses of Malagasy biodiversity are manifold, with much potential for the uncovering of new useful traits for food, medicine, and climate mitigation. The data presented here showcase Madagascar as a unique “living laboratory” for our understanding of evolution and the complex interactions between people and nature. The gathering and analysis of biodiversity data must continue and accelerate if we are to fully understand and safeguard this unique subset of Earth’s biodiversity.},

The next experimental challenge is the production of ultracold polyatomic molecular gases. Here, we report the creation of an ultracold gas of 23 Na 40 K 2 triatomic molecules from a mixture of ground-state sodium-23–potassium-40 ( 23 Na 40 K) molecules and potassium-40 ( 40 K) atoms. The triatomic molecules were created by adiabatic magneto-association through an atom–diatomic molecule Feshbach resonance. We obtained clear evidence for the creation of triatomic molecules by directly detecting them using radio-frequency dissociation. Approximately 4000 triatomic molecules with a high-peak phase-space density of 0.05 could be created. The ultracold triatomic molecules can serve as a launchpad to probe the three-body potential energy surface and may be used to prepare quantum degenerate triatomic molecular gases.},

Many of these fires burned in permafrost peatlands within the Arctic Circle. We show that early snowmelt together with an anomalous Arctic front jet over northeastern Siberia promoted unusually warm and dry surface conditions, followed by anomalously high lightning and fire activity. Since 1966, spring snowmelt has started 1.7 days earlier each decade. Moreover, Arctic front jet occurrences in summer have more than tripled in frequency over the last 40 years. These interconnected climatological drivers promote extreme fire activity in eastern Siberia, including a northward shift of fires, which may accelerate the degradation of carbon-rich permafrost peatlands.},

The slowest seismic wave speeds (shear wave speed less than 2.3 kilometers per second) are present at depths between 3 and 8 kilometers, overlapping with petrological estimates of the assembly depth of erupted rhyolite bodies. Assuming that Yellowstone’s magmatic system is a crystal mush with broadly distributed melt, we estimate a partial melt fraction of 16 to 20\%.},

In this study, we identify a previously unknown function of the human signal peptidase complex (SPC)—the enzyme that removes endoplasmic reticulum (ER) signal peptides—as a membrane protein quality control factor. We show that the SPC cleaves membrane proteins that fail to correctly fold or assemble into their native complexes at otherwise hidden cleavage sites, which our study reveals to be abundant in the human membrane proteome. This posttranslocational cleavage synergizes with ER-associated degradation to sustain membrane protein homeostasis and contributes to cellular fitness. Cryptic SPC cleavage sites thus serve as predetermined breaking points that, when exposed, help to target misfolded or surplus proteins for degradation, thereby maintaining a healthy membrane proteome.},

Using two systems of postmitotic lineage specification—induced pluripotent stem cell–derived neurons and transdifferentiated macrophages—we show that thymidine DNA glycosylase (TDG)–driven excision of methylcytosines oxidized with ten-eleven translocation enzymes (TET) is a source of SSBs. Although macrophage differentiation favors short-patch base excision repair to fill in single-nucleotide gaps, neurons also frequently use the long-patch subpathway. Disrupting this gap-filling process using anti-neoplastic cytosine analogs triggers a DNA damage response and neuronal cell death, which is dependent on TDG. Thus, TET-mediated active DNA demethylation promotes endogenous DNA damage, a process that normally safeguards cell identity but can also provoke neurotoxicity after anticancer treatments.},

We found exceptionally high crack-initiation fracture toughnesses of 262 and 459 megapascal-meters ½ (MPa·m ½ ) for CrMnFeCoNi and CrCoNi, respectively; CrCoNi displayed a crack-growth toughness exceeding 540 MPa·m ½ after 2.25 millimeters of stable cracking. Crack-tip deformation structures at 20 K are quite distinct from those at higher temperatures. They involve nucleation and restricted growth of stacking faults, fine nanotwins, and transformed epsilon martensite, with coherent interfaces that can promote both arrest and transmission of dislocations to generate strength and ductility. We believe that these alloys develop fracture resistance through a progressive synergy of deformation mechanisms, dislocation glide, stacking-fault formation, nanotwinning, and phase transformation, which act in concert to prolong strain hardening that simultaneously elevates strength and ductility, leading to exceptional toughness.},

In the high–nodule energy state, GmNAS1 and GmNAP1 form homodimers that interact with the nuclear factor-Y C (NF-YC) subunit (GmNFYC10a) on mitochondria and reduce its nuclear accumulation. Less nuclear GmNFYC10a leads to lower expression of glycolytic genes involved in pyruvate production, which modulates phosphoenolpyruvate allocation to favor nitrogen fixation.

Rochmyaningsih describes how the Indonesian government is suppressing conservation scientists, research, and data in pursuit of economic development. Other governments have also restricted domestic and international research on politically sensitive topics, sometimes indirectly by controlling data (1), restricting funding (2), denying access to research sites (3) or specimens (4, 5), or labelling researchers as disruptive protesters, foreign spies, or provocateurs (6–8). To address global environmental challenges, researchers need freedom to collect, analyze, and share data without political constraints. International treaties and organizations could counteract some of these restrictions.},

Parenteral vaccines induce robust systemic immunity but poor immunity at the respiratory mucosa. We developed a vaccine strategy that we call “prime and spike,” which leverages existing immunity generated by primary vaccination (prime) to elicit mucosal immune memory within the respiratory tract by using unadjuvanted intranasal spike boosters (spike). We show that prime and spike induces robust resident memory B and T cell responses, induces immunoglobulin A at the respiratory mucosa, boosts systemic immunity, and completely protects mice with partial immunity from lethal SARS-CoV-2 infection. Using divergent spike proteins, prime and spike enables the induction of cross-reactive immunity against sarbecoviruses.},

  abstract     = {Neurons use local protein synthesis to support their morphological complexity, which requires independent control across multiple subcellular compartments up to the level of individual synapses. We identify a signaling pathway that regulates the local synthesis of proteins required to form excitatory synapses on parvalbumin-expressing (PV + ) interneurons in the mouse cerebral cortex. This process involves regulation of the TSC subunit 2 (Tsc2) by the Erb-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 4 (ErbB4), which enables local control of messenger RNA {mRNA} translation in a cell type–specific and synapse type–specific manner. Ribosome-associated mRNA profiling reveals a molecular program of synaptic proteins downstream of ErbB4 signaling required to form excitatory inputs on PV + interneurons. Thus, specific connections use local protein synthesis to control synapse formation in the nervous system.},

Yet its impacts on ecosystem services remain uncertain because pervasive interactions between grazing pressure, climate, soil properties, and biodiversity may occur but have never been addressed simultaneously. Using a standardized survey at 98 sites across six continents, we show that interactions between grazing pressure, climate, soil, and biodiversity are critical to explain the delivery of fundamental ecosystem services across drylands worldwide. Increasing grazing pressure reduced ecosystem service delivery in warmer and species-poor drylands, whereas positive effects of grazing were observed in colder and species-rich areas. Considering interactions between grazing and local abiotic and biotic factors is key for understanding the fate of dryland ecosystems under climate change and increasing human pressure.},

We investigated the determinants of human WT in 5604 people from the ages of 8 days to 96 years from 23 countries using isotope-tracking ( 2 H) methods. Age, body size, and composition were significantly associated with WT, as were physical activity, athletic status, pregnancy, socioeconomic status, and environmental characteristics (latitude, altitude, air temperature, and humidity). People who lived in countries with a low human development index (HDI) had higher WT than people in high-HDI countries. On the basis of this extensive dataset, we provide equations to predict human WT in relation to anthropometric, economic, and environmental factors.},

Here, clarification is provided by the fossilized nervous system of the lower Cambrian lobopodian Cardiodictyon catenulum , which reveals an unsegmented head and brain comprising three cephalic domains, distinct from the metameric ventral nervous system serving its appendicular trunk. Each domain aligns with one of three components of the foregut and with a pair of head appendages. Morphological correspondences with stem group arthropods and alignments of homologous gene expression patterns with those of extant panarthropods demonstrate that cephalic domains of C. catenulum predate the evolution of the euarthropod head yet correspond to neuromeres defining brains of living chelicerates and mandibulates.},

  abstract     = {Seasonal influenza vaccines offer little protection against pandemic influenza virus strains. It is difficult to create effective prepandemic vaccines because it is uncertain which influenza virus subtype will cause the next pandemic. In this work, we developed a nucleoside-modified messenger RNA (mRNA)–lipid nanoparticle vaccine encoding hemagglutinin antigens from all 20 known influenza A virus subtypes and influenza B virus lineages. This multivalent vaccine elicited high levels of cross-reactive and subtype-specific antibodies in mice and ferrets that reacted to all 20 encoded antigens. Vaccination protected mice and ferrets challenged with matched and mismatched viral strains, and this protection was at least partially dependent on antibodies. Our studies indicate that mRNA vaccines can provide protection against antigenically variable viruses by simultaneously inducing antibodies against multiple antigens.},

  abstract     = {From microcircuits to metamaterials, the micropatterning of surfaces adds valuable functionality. For nonplanar surfaces, incompatibility with conventional microlithography requires the transfer of originally planar micropatterns onto those surfaces; however, existing approaches accommodate only limited curvatures. A microtransfer approach was developed using reflowable materials that transform between solid and liquid on demand, freely stretching to yield transfers that naturally conform down to nanoscale radii of curvature and arbitrarily complex topographies. Such reflow transfer helps generalize microprinting, extending the reach of precision planar microlithography to highly nonplanar substrates and microstructures. With gentle water-based processing, reflow transfer can be applied to a range of materials, with microprinting demonstrated onto metal, plastic, paper, glass, polystyrene, semiconductor, elastomer, hydrogel, and multiple biological surfaces.},

  abstract     = {Catalysts based on platinum group metals have been a major focus of the chemical industry for decades. We show that plasmonic photocatalysis can transform a thermally unreactive, earth-abundant transition metal into a catalytically active site under illumination. Fe active sites in a Cu-Fe antenna-reactor complex achieve efficiencies very similar to Ru for the photocatalytic decomposition of ammonia under ultrafast pulsed illumination. When illuminated with light-emitting diodes rather than lasers, the photocatalytic efficiencies remain comparable, even when the scale of reaction increases by nearly three orders of magnitude. This result demonstrates the potential for highly efficient, electrically driven production of hydrogen from an ammonia carrier with earth-abundant transition metals.},

We report cryo–electron microscopy structures of the Cas7-11–crRNA–Csx29 complex with and without target RNA (tgRNA), and demonstrate that tgRNA binding induces conformational changes in Csx29. Biochemical experiments revealed tgRNA-dependent cleavage of the accessory protein Csx30 by Csx29. Reconstitution of the system in bacteria showed that Csx30 cleavage yields toxic protein fragments that cause growth arrest, which is regulated by Csx31. Csx30 binds Csx31 and the associated sigma factor RpoE (RNA polymerase, extracytoplasmic E), suggesting that Csx30-mediated RpoE inhibition modulates the cellular response to infection. We engineered the Cas7-11–Csx29–Csx30 system for programmable RNA sensing in mammalian cells. Overall, the Cas7-11–Csx29 effector is an RNA-dependent nuclease-protease.},

Recently, additional genes with non-nuclease functions have been found in genetic association with CRISPR systems, suggesting that there may be other RNA-guided non-nucleolytic enzymes. One such gene from Desulfonema ishimotonii encodes the TPR-CHAT protease Csx29, which is associated with the CRISPR effector Cas7-11. Here, we demonstrate that this CRISPR-associated protease (CASP) exhibits programmable RNA-activated endopeptidase activity against a sigma factor inhibitor to regulate a transcriptional response. Cryo–electron microscopy of an active and substrate-bound CASP complex reveals an allosteric activation mechanism that reorganizes Csx29 catalytic residues upon target RNA binding. This work reveals an RNA-guided function in nature that can be leveraged for RNA-sensing applications in vitro and in human cells.},

These efforts are distinct from traditional molecular engineering—their focus is not on optimizing individual genes and proteins as therapeutics, but rather on using molecular components as modules to reprogram how cells make decisions and communicate to achieve higher-order physiological functions in vivo. This cell-centric approach is enabled by a growing tool kit of components that can synthetically control core cell-level functional outputs, such as where in the body a cell should go, what other cells it should interact with, and what messages it should transmit or receive. The power of cell engineering has been clinically validated by the development of immune cells designed to kill cancer. This same tool kit for rewiring cell connectivity is beginning to be used to engineer cell therapies for a host of other diseases and to program the self-organization of tissues and organs. By forcing the conceptual distillation of complex biological functions into a finite set of instructions that operate at the cell level, these efforts also shed light on the fundamental hierarchical logic that links molecular components to higher-order physiological function.},

We used three-dimensional high-resolution imaging of more than 2000 human oocytes to identify a structure that we named the human oocyte microtubule organizing center (huoMTOC). The proteins TACC3, CCP110, CKAP5, and DISC1 were found to be essential components of the huoMTOC. The huoMTOC arises beneath the oocyte cortex and migrates adjacent to the nuclear envelope before nuclear envelope breakdown (NEBD). After NEBD, the huoMTOC fragments and relocates on the kinetochores to initiate microtubule nucleation and spindle assembly. Disrupting the huoMTOC led to spindle assembly defects and oocyte maturation arrest. These results reveal a physiological mechanism of huoMTOC-regulated spindle assembly in human oocytes.},

In this work, we identified a component of immune evasion that involves frequent up-regulation of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) in solid tumors. FMRP represses immune attack, as revealed by cancer cells engineered to lack its expression. FMRP-deficient tumors were infiltrated by activated T cells that impaired tumor growth and enhanced survival in mice. Mechanistically, FMRP’s immunosuppression was multifactorial, involving repression of the chemoattractant C-C motif chemokine ligand 7 (CCL7) concomitant with up-regulation of three immunomodulators—interleukin-33 (IL-33), tumor-secreted protein S (PROS1), and extracellular vesicles. Gene signatures associate FMRP’s cancer network with poor prognosis and response to therapy in cancer patients. Collectively, FMRP is implicated as a regulator that orchestrates a multifaceted barrier to antitumor immune responses.},

Contrary to this model, we show here that removing Hippo transcriptional output did not impair the ability of the mouse liver and Drosophila eyes to grow to their normal size. Moreover, the transcriptional activity of the Hippo pathway effectors Yap/Taz/Yki did not correlate with cell proliferation, and hyperactivation of these effectors induced gene expression programs that did not recapitulate normal development. Concordantly, a functional screen in Drosophila identified several Hippo pathway target genes that were required for ectopic overgrowth but not normal growth. Thus, Hippo signaling does not instruct normal growth, and the Hippo-induced overgrowth phenotypes are caused by the activation of abnormal genetic programs.},

  abstract     = {Vibrational strong coupling (VSC) between molecular vibrations and microcavity photons yields a few polaritons (light-matter modes) and many dark modes (with negligible photonic character). Although VSC is reported to alter thermally activated chemical reactions, its mechanisms remain opaque. To elucidate this problem, we followed ultrafast dynamics of a simple unimolecular vibrational energy exchange in iron pentacarbonyl [Fe(CO) 5 ] under VSC, which showed two competing channels: pseudorotation and intramolecular vibrational-energy redistribution (IVR). We found that under polariton excitation, energy exchange was overall accelerated, with IVR becoming faster and pseudorotation being slowed down. However, dark-mode excitation revealed unchanged dynamics compared with those outside of the cavity, with pseudorotation dominating. Thus, despite controversies around thermally activated VSC modified chemistry, our work shows that VSC can indeed alter chemistry through a nonequilibrium preparation of polaritons.},

Leveraging such protection requires testing its robustness against uncontrolled environmental interactions. Using 47 superconducting qubits, we implement the one-dimensional kicked Ising model, which exhibits nonlocal Majorana edge modes (MEMs) with ℤ 2 parity symmetry. We find that any multiqubit Pauli operator overlapping with the MEMs exhibits a uniform late-time decay rate comparable to single-qubit relaxation rates, irrespective of its size or composition. This characteristic allows us to accurately reconstruct the exponentially localized spatial profiles of the MEMs. Furthermore, the MEMs are found to be resilient against certain symmetry-breaking noise owing to a prethermalization mechanism. Our work elucidates the complex interplay between noise and symmetry-protected edge modes in a solid-state environment.},

Because of the inherent electronic properties of pyridines, selective meta -C−H functionalization is challenging. Here, we present a protocol for highly regioselective meta -C−H trifluoromethylation, perfluoroalkylation, chlorination, bromination, iodination, nitration, sulfanylation, and selenylation of pyridines through a redox-neutral dearomatization-rearomatization process. The introduced dearomative activation mode provides a diversification platform for meta-selective reactions on pyridines and other azaarenes through radical as well as ionic pathways. The broad scope and high selectivity of these catalyst-free reactions render these processes applicable for late-stage functionalization of drugs.},

  abstract     = {Pyridine halogenation reactions are crucial for obtaining the vast array of derivatives required for drug and agrochemical development. However, despite more than a century of synthetic endeavors, halogenation processes that selectively functionalize the carbon–hydrogen bond in the 3-position of a broad range of pyridine precursors remain largely elusive. We report a reaction sequence of pyridyl ring opening, halogenation, and ring closing whereby the acyclic Zincke imine intermediates undergo highly regioselective halogenation reactions under mild conditions. Experimental and computational mechanistic studies indicate that the nature of the halogen electrophile can modify the selectivity-determining step. Using this method, we produced a diverse set of 3-halopyridines and demonstrated late-stage halogenation of complex pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals.},

  abstract     = {Natural materials exhibit emergent mechanical properties as a result of their nanoarchitected, nanocomposite structures with optimized hierarchy, anisotropy, and nanoporosity. Fabrication of such complex systems is currently challenging because high-quality three-dimensional (3D) nanoprinting is mostly limited to simple, homogeneous materials. We report a strategy for the rapid nanoprinting of complex structural nanocomposites using metal nanoclusters. These ultrasmall, quantum-confined nanoclusters function as highly sensitive two-photon activators and simultaneously serve as precursors for mechanical reinforcements and nanoscale porogens. Nanocomposites with complex 3D architectures are printed, as well as structures with tunable, hierarchical, and anisotropic nanoporosity. Nanocluster-polymer nanolattices exhibit high specific strength, energy absorption, deformability, and recoverability. This framework provides a generalizable, versatile approach for the use of photoactive nanomaterials in additive manufacturing of complex systems with emergent mechanical properties.},

  abstract     = {Plant roots exhibit plasticity in their branching patterns to forage efficiently for heterogeneously distributed resources, such as soil water. The xerobranching response represses lateral root formation when roots lose contact with water. Here, we show that xerobranching is regulated by radial movement of the phloem-derived hormone abscisic acid, which disrupts intercellular communication between inner and outer cell layers through plasmodesmata. Closure of these intercellular pores disrupts the inward movement of the hormone signal auxin, blocking lateral root branching. Once root tips regain contact with moisture, the abscisic acid response rapidly attenuates. Our study reveals how roots adapt their branching pattern to heterogeneous soil water conditions by linking changes in hydraulic flux with dynamic hormone redistribution.},

Here, we introduce cross-trait assortative mating (xAM) as an alternative explanation. We observe that xAM affects many phenotypes and that phenotypic cross-mate correlation estimates are strongly associated with genetic correlation estimates ( R 2 = 74\%). We demonstrate that existing xAM plausibly accounts for substantial fractions of genetic correlation estimates and that previously reported genetic correlation estimates between some pairs of psychiatric disorders are congruent with xAM alone. Finally, we provide evidence for a history of xAM at the genetic level using cross-trait even/odd chromosome polygenic score correlations. Together, our results demonstrate that previous reports have likely overestimated the true genetic similarity between many phenotypes.},

We adapted Schelling’s model of segregation to study individual cation migration and found that the initial film inhomogeneity accelerates materials degradation. We fabricated perovskite films (FA 1–x Cs x PbI 3 ; where FA is formamidinium) through the addition of selenophene, which led to homogeneous cation distribution that retarded cation aggregation during materials processing and device operation. The resultant devices achieved enhanced efficiency and retained &gt;91\% of their initial efficiency after 3190 hours at the maximum power point under 1 sun illumination.

Gordon Moore postulated 18 years later that the number of components in an integrated circuit would double every 1 to 2 years with associated reductions in cost per transistor. Transistor density doubling through scaling—the decrease of component sizes—with each new process node continues today, albeit at a slower pace compared with historical rates of scaling. Transistor scaling has resulted in exponential gain in performance and energy efficiency of integrated circuits, which transformed computing from mainframes to personal computers and from mobile computing to cloud computing. Innovations in new materials, transistor structures, and lithographic technologies will enable further scaling. Monolithic 3D integration, design technology co-optimization, alternative switching mechanisms, and cryogenic operation could enable further transistor scaling and improved energy efficiency in the foreseeable future.},

Emphasis is placed on the most broadly impactful advancements that have evolved from single-nanotube devices to implementations with aligned nanotubes and even nanotube thin films. There are obstacles that remain to be addressed, including material synthesis and processing control, device structure design and transport considerations, and further integration demonstrations with improved reproducibility and reliability; however, the integration of more than 10,000 devices in single functional chips has already been realized.},

To identify genes limiting T cell function, we conducted genome-wide CRISPR knockout screens in human chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. Top hits were MED12 and CCNC , components of the Mediator kinase module. Targeted MED12 deletion enhanced antitumor activity and sustained the effector phenotype in CAR- and T cell receptor–engineered T cells, and inhibition of CDK8/19 kinase activity increased expansion of nonengineered T cells. MED12 -deficient T cells manifested increased core Meditator chromatin occupancy at transcriptionally active enhancers—most notably for STAT and AP-1 transcription factors—and increased IL2RA expression and interleukin-2 sensitivity. These results implicate Mediator in T cell effector programming and identify the kinase module as a target for enhancing potency of antitumor T cell responses.},

Thousands of potentially observable FRBs reach Earth every day, which likely originate from highly magnetic and/or rapidly rotating neutron stars in the distant Universe. Some FRBs repeat, with this subclass often occurring in highly magnetic environments. Two repeating FRBs exhibit cyclic activity windows, consistent with an orbital period. One nearby FRB was emitted by a Galactic magnetar during an x-ray outburst. The host galaxies of some FRBs have been located, providing information about the host environments and the total baryonic content of the Universe.},

Using iconic and well-studied fish species such as tunas, billfishes, and sharks, we calculate a continuous Red List Index of yearly changes in extinction risk over 70 years to track progress toward global sustainability and biodiversity targets. We show that this well-established biodiversity indicator is highly sensitive and responsive to fishing mortality. After ~58 years of increasing risk of extinction, effective fisheries management has shifted the biodiversity loss curve for tunas and billfishes, whereas the curve continues to worsen for sharks, which are highly undermanaged. While populations of highly valuable commercial species are being rebuilt, the next management challenge is to halt and reverse the harm afflicted by these same fisheries to broad oceanic biodiversity.},

TERT promoter mutations are acquired in about 75\% of melanomas but are not sufficient to maintain telomeres, suggesting that additional mutations are required. We identified a cluster of variants in the promoter of ACD encoding the shelterin component TPP1. ACD promoter variants are present in about 5\% of cutaneous melanoma and co-occur with TERT promoter mutations. The two most common somatic variants create or modify binding sites for E-twenty-six (ETS) transcription factors, similar to mutations in the TERT promoter. The variants increase the expression of TPP1 and function together with TERT to synergistically lengthen telomeres. Our findings suggest that TPP1 promoter variants collaborate with TERT activation to enhance telomere maintenance and immortalization in melanoma.},

Because grain boundaries (GBs) in materials usually facilitate diffusional processes in creep, eliminating GBs is a primary approach to resisting high-temperature creep in metals, such as in single-crystal superalloy turbo blades. We report a different strategy to inhibiting creep by use of stable GB networks. Plastic deformation triggered structural relaxation of high-density GBs in nanograined single-phased nickel-cobalt-chromium alloys, forming networks of stable GBs interlocked with abundant twin boundaries. The stable GB networks effectively inhibit diffusional creep processes at high temperatures. We obtained an unprecedented creep resistance, with creep rates of ~10 –7 per second under gigapascal stress at 700°C (~61\% melting point), outperforming that of conventional superalloys.},

Previous studies of climate impacts on extreme precipitation have focused mainly on daily rain totals. Subdaily extremes are often generated in small areas that can be missed by gauge networks or satellites and are not resolved by climate models. Here, we show a robust positive trend of at least 20\% per decade in subhourly extreme rainfall near Sydney, Australia, over 20 years, despite no evidence of trends at hourly or daily scales. This trend is seen consistently in storms tracked using multiple independent ground radars, is consistent with rain-gauge data, and does not appear to be associated with known natural variations. This finding suggests that subhourly rainfall extremes may be increasing substantially faster than those on more widely reported time scales.},

We report a polarimetric observation of the XRB Cygnus X-1 using the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer. The electric field position angle aligns with the outflowing jet, indicating that the jet is launched from the inner x-ray–emitting region. The polarization degree is 4.01 ± 0.20\% at 2 to 8 kiloelectronvolts, implying that the accretion disk is viewed closer to edge-on than the binary orbit. These observations reveal that hot x-ray–emitting plasma is spatially extended in a plane perpendicular to, not parallel to, the jet axis.},

  abstract     = {Magnetars are neutron stars with ultrastrong magnetic fields, which can be observed in x-rays. Polarization measurements could provide information on their magnetic fields and surface properties. We observed polarized x-rays from the magnetar 4U 0142+61 using the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer and found a linear polarization degree of 13.5 ± 0.8\% averaged over the 2– to 8–kilo–electron volt band. The polarization changes with energy: The degree is 15.0 ± 1.0\% at 2 to 4 kilo–electron volts, drops below the instrumental sensitivity ~4 to 5 kilo–electron volts, and rises to 35.2 ± 7.1\% at 5.5 to 8 kilo–electron volts. The polarization angle also changes by 90° at ~4 to 5 kilo–electron volts. These results are consistent with a model in which thermal radiation from the magnetar surface is reprocessed by scattering off charged particles in the magnetosphere.},

  abstract     = {The earliest vascular plants had stems with a central cylindrical strand of water-conducting xylem, which rapidly diversified into more complex shapes. This diversification is understood to coincide with increases in plant body size and branching; however, no selection pressure favoring xylem strand-shape complexity is known. We show that incremental changes in xylem network organization that diverge from the cylindrical ancestral form lead to progressively greater drought resistance by reducing the risk of hydraulic failure. As xylem strand complexity increases, independent pathways for embolism spread become fewer and increasingly concentrated in more centrally located conduits, thus limiting the systemic spread of embolism during drought. Selection by drought may thus explain observed trajectories of xylem strand evolution in the fossil record and the diversity of extant forms.},

E-PCBs require elastic conductors that have high conductivity, high stretchability, tough adhesion to various components, and imperceptible resistance changes even under large strain. We present a liquid metal particle network (LMP Net ) assembled by applying an acoustic field to a solid-state insulating liquid metal particle composite as the elastic conductor. The LMP Net conductor satisfies all the aforementioned requirements and enables the fabrication of a multilayered high-density E-PCB, in which numerous electronic components are intimately integrated to create highly stretchable skin electronics. Furthermore, we could generate the LMP Net in various polymer matrices, including hydrogels, self-healing elastomers, and photoresists, thus showing their potential for use in soft electronics.},

The Standard Model of particle physics provides no explanation for its value, which could potentially vary. The wavelengths of stellar absorption lines depend on α but are subject to systematic effects owing to astrophysical processes in stellar atmospheres. We measured precise line wavelengths from observations of 17 stars, selected to have almost identical atmospheric properties to those of the Sun (solar twins), which reduces those systematic effects. We found that α varies by ≲ 50 parts per billion within 50 parsecs from Earth. Combining the results from all 17 stars provides an empirical local reference for stellar measurements of α, with an ensemble precision of 12 parts per billion.},

As retrotransposons, group II introns form ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes that roam the genome, integrating by reversal of forward splicing. Here we show that retrotransposition is achieved by a tertiary complex between a structurally elaborate ribozyme, its protein mobility factor, and a structured DNA substrate. We solved cryo–electron microscopy structures of an intact group IIC intron-maturase retroelement that was poised for integration into a DNA stem-loop motif. By visualizing the RNP before and after DNA targeting, we show that it is primed for attack and fits perfectly with its DNA target. This study reveals design principles of a prototypical retroelement and reinforces the hypothesis that group II introns are ancient elements of genetic diversification.},

We show that hybrid immunity or vaccine boosters elicit plasma-neutralizing antibodies against Omicron BA.1, BA.2, BA.2.12.1, and BA.4/5, and that breakthrough infections, but not vaccination alone, induce neutralizing antibodies in the nasal mucosa. Consistent with immunological imprinting, most antibodies derived from memory B cells or plasma cells of Omicron breakthrough cases cross-react with the Wuhan-Hu-1, BA.1, BA.2, and BA.4/5 receptor-binding domains, whereas Omicron primary infections elicit B cells of narrow specificity up to 6 months after infection. Although most clinical antibodies have reduced neutralization of Omicron, we identified an ultrapotent pan-variant–neutralizing antibody that is a strong candidate for clinical development.},

We identified shared and region-specific astrocytic genes and functions and explored the cellular origins of their regional diversity. We identified gene networks correlated with astrocyte morphology, several of which unexpectedly contained Alzheimer’s disease (AD) risk genes. CRISPR/Cas9–mediated reduction of candidate genes reduced astrocyte morphological complexity and resulted in cognitive deficits. The same genes were down-regulated in human AD, in an AD mouse model that displayed reduced astrocyte morphology, and in other human brain disorders. We thus provide comprehensive molecular data on astrocyte diversity and mechanisms across the CNS and on the molecular basis of astrocyte morphology in health and disease.},

Our indicators enable 0.4- to 1-kilohertz voltage recordings from &gt;50 spiking neurons per field of view in awake mice and ~30-minute continuous imaging in flies. Using dual-polarity multiplexed imaging, we uncovered brain state–dependent antagonism between neocortical somatostatin-expressing (SST + ) and vasoactive intestinal peptide–expressing (VIP + ) interneurons and contributions to hippocampal field potentials from cell ensembles with distinct axonal projections. By combining three mutually compatible indicators, we performed simultaneous triple-population imaging. These approaches will empower investigations of the dynamic interplay between neuronal subclasses at single-spike resolution.},

In May 2022, dozens of non-endemic countries reported hundreds of monkeypox cases, most with no epidemiological link to Africa. We identified two lineages of monkeypox virus (MPXV) among two 2021 and seven 2022 US monkeypox cases: the major 2022 outbreak variant called B.1 and a minor contemporaneously sampled variant called A.2. Analyses of mutations among these two variants revealed an extreme preference for GA-to-AA mutations indicative of human APOBEC3 cytosine deaminase activity among Clade IIb MPXV (previously West African, Nigeria) sampled since 2017. Such mutations were not enriched within other MPXV clades. These findings suggest that APOBEC3 editing may be a recurrent and a dominant driver of MPXV evolution within the current outbreak.},

Our qubit register consists of the SiV electron spin acting as a communication qubit and the strongly coupled silicon-29 nuclear spin acting as a memory qubit with a quantum memory time exceeding 2 seconds. By using a highly strained SiV, we realize electron-photon entangling gates at temperatures up to 1.5 kelvin and nucleus-photon entangling gates up to 4.3 kelvin. We also demonstrate efficient error detection in nuclear spin–photon gates by using the electron spin as a flag qubit, making this platform a promising candidate for scalable quantum repeaters.},

Using geostationary satellite images of the 15 January 2022 eruption of the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai volcano, we find that the volcanic plume produced by this volcano reached an altitude of 57 kilometers at its highest extent. This places the plume in the lower mesosphere and provides observational evidence of a volcanic eruption injecting material through the stratosphere and directly into the mesosphere. We then discuss potential implications of this injection and suggest that the altitude reached by plumes from previous eruptions, such as the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991, may have been underestimated because of a lack of observational data.},

Prior crystallographic studies defined the drug-binding site within CRBN’s thalidomide-binding domain (TBD), but the allostery of drug-induced neosubstrate binding remains unclear. We performed cryo–electron microscopy analyses of the DNA damage-binding protein 1 (DDB1)–CRBN apo complex and compared these structures with DDB1-CRBN in the presence of CELMoD compounds alone and complexed with neosubstrates. Association of CELMoD compounds to the TBD is necessary and sufficient for triggering CRBN allosteric rearrangement from an open conformation to the canonical closed conformation. The neosubstrate Ikaros only stably associates with the closed CRBN conformation, illustrating the importance of allostery for CELMoD compound efficacy and informing structure-guided design strategies to improve therapeutic efficacy.},

We isolated a female-to-male sex transition mutant in melon and identified the causal gene as the carpel identity gene CRABS CLAW (CRC) . We show that the master regulator of sex determination in cucurbits, the transcription factor WIP1 whose expression orchestrates male flower development, recruits the corepressor TOPLESS to the CRC promoter to suppress its expression through histone deacetylation. Impairing TOPLESS-WIP1 physical interaction leads to CRC expression, carpel determination, and consequently the expression of the stamina inhibitor, the aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase 7 ( CmACS7 ), leading to female flower development. Our findings suggest that sex genes evolved to interfere with flower meristematic function, leading to unisexual flower development.},

Neutrinos, which rarely interact with matter, could provide information on the galaxy’s active core. We searched for neutrino emission from astrophysical objects using data recorded with the IceCube neutrino detector between 2011 and 2020. The positions of 110 known gamma-ray sources were individually searched for neutrino detections above atmospheric and cosmic backgrounds. We found that NGC 1068 has an excess of 79 − 20 + 22 neutrinos at tera–electron volt energies, with a global significance of 4.2σ, which we interpret as associated with the active galaxy. The flux of high-energy neutrinos that we measured from NGC 1068 is more than an order of magnitude higher than the upper limit on emissions of tera–electron volt gamma rays from this source.},

  abstract     = {Arctic fires can release large amounts of carbon from permafrost peatlands. Satellite observations reveal that fires burned ~4.7 million hectares in 2019 and 2020, accounting for 44\% of the total burned area in the Siberian Arctic for the entire 1982–2020 period. The summer of 2020 was the warmest in four decades, with fires burning an unprecedentedly large area of carbon-rich soils. We show that factors of fire associated with temperature have increased in recent decades and identified a near-exponential relationship between these factors and annual burned area. Large fires in the Arctic are likely to recur with climatic warming before mid-century, because the temperature trend is reaching a threshold in which small increases in temperature are associated with exponential increases in the area burned.},

  abstract     = {Several neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders are characterized by intermittent episodes of pathological activity. Although genetic therapies offer the ability to modulate neuronal excitability, a limiting factor is that they do not discriminate between neurons involved in circuit pathologies and “healthy” surrounding or intermingled neurons. We describe a gene therapy strategy that down-regulates the excitability of overactive neurons in closed loop, which we tested in models of epilepsy. We used an immediate early gene promoter to drive the expression of Kv1.1 potassium channels specifically in hyperactive neurons, and only for as long as they exhibit abnormal activity. Neuronal excitability was reduced by seizure-related activity, leading to a persistent antiepileptic effect without interfering with normal behaviors. Activity-dependent gene therapy is a promising on-demand cell-autonomous treatment for brain circuit disorders.},

We refactored the structure of the genetic code in Escherichia coli and created orthogonal genetic codes that restrict the escape of synthetic genetic information into natural life. We developed orthogonal and mutually orthogonal horizontal gene transfer systems, which permit the transfer of genetic information between organisms that use the same genetic code but restrict the transfer of genetic information between organisms that use different genetic codes. Moreover, we showed that locking refactored codes into synthetic organisms completely blocks invasion by mobile genetic elements, including viruses, which carry their own translation factors and successfully invade organisms with canonical and compressed genetic codes.},

This requires integration between local and distant areas orchestrated by densely connected networks. Brain connections determine the brain’s functional organization. The imaging of connections in the living brain has provided an opportunity to identify the driving factors behind the neurobiology of cognition. Connectivity differences between species and among humans have furthered the understanding of brain evolution and of diverging cognitive profiles. Brain pathologies amplify this variability through disconnections and, consequently, the disintegration of cognitive functions. The prediction of long-term symptoms is now preferentially based on brain disconnections. This paradigm shift will reshape our brain maps and challenge current brain models.},

Neuroimaging has shaped the way to approaching the human brain’s connectivity on the basis of diffusion magnetic resonance imaging and tractography. At the same time, polarization, fluorescence, and electron microscopy became available, which pushed spatial resolution and sensitivity to the axonal or even to the synaptic level. New methods are mandatory to inform and constrain whole-brain tractography by regional, high-resolution connectivity data and local fiber geometry. Machine learning and simulation can provide predictions where experimental data are missing. Future interoperable atlases require new concepts, including high-resolution templates and directionality, to represent variants of tractography solutions and estimates of their accuracy.},

In this review, we discuss approaches that have been used to date and future directions that can be explored to answer these questions. By combining optogenetic functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with computational modeling, cell type–specific, large-scale brain circuit function and dysfunction are beginning to be quantitatively parameterized. We envision that these developments will pave the path for future therapeutics developments based on a systems engineering approach aimed at directly restoring brain function.},

Three-dimensional reference atlases of the brain provide new opportunities for cumulating, integrating, and reinterpreting research findings across studies.

However, the full spectrum of genotoxic chemicals produced by indigenous gut microbes remains to be defined. We established a pipeline to systematically evaluate the genotoxicity of an extensive collection of gut commensals from inflammatory bowel disease patients. We identified isolates from divergent phylogenies whose metabolites caused DNA damage and discovered a distinctive family of genotoxins—termed the indolimines—produced by the CRC-associated species Morganella morganii. A non–indolimine-producing M. morganii mutant lacked genotoxicity and failed to exacerbate colon tumorigenesis in mice. These studies reveal the existence of a previously unexplored universe of genotoxic small molecules from the microbiome that may affect host biology in homeostasis and disease.},

In several mammals, the envelope proteins encoded by these elements protect against exogenous viruses, but this activity has not been documented with endogenously expressed envelopes in humans. We report that the human genome harbors a large pool of envelope-derived sequences with the potential to restrict retroviral infection. To test this, we characterized an envelope-derived protein, Suppressyn. We found that Suppressyn is expressed in human preimplantation embryos and developing placenta using its ancestral retroviral promoter. Cell culture assays showed that Suppressyn , and its hominoid orthologs, could restrict infection by extant mammalian type D retroviruses. Our data support a generalizable model of retroviral envelope co-option for host immunity and genome defense.},

The crust north of the equatorial dichotomy had a shear wave velocity of approximately 3.2 kilometers per second in the 5- to 30-kilometer depth range, with little depth variation. This implies a higher crustal density than inferred beneath the lander, suggesting either compositional differences or reduced porosity in the volcanic areas traversed by the surface waves. The lower velocities and the crustal layering observed beneath the landing site down to a 10-kilometer depth are not a global feature. Structural variations revealed by surface waves hold implications for models of the formation and thickness of the martian crust.},

  abstract     = {General conditions for organic reactions are important but rare, and efforts to identify them usually consider only narrow regions of chemical space. Discovering more general reaction conditions requires considering vast regions of chemical space derived from a large matrix of substrates crossed with a high-dimensional matrix of reaction conditions, rendering exhaustive experimentation impractical. Here, we report a simple closed-loop workflow that leverages data-guided matrix down-selection, uncertainty-minimizing machine learning, and robotic experimentation to discover general reaction conditions. Application to the challenging and consequential problem of heteroaryl Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling identified conditions that double the average yield relative to a widely used benchmark that was previously developed using traditional approaches. This study provides a practical road map for solving multidimensional chemical optimization problems with large search spaces.},

  abstract     = {Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the most common mental disorders. We designed a fast-onset antidepressant that works by disrupting the interaction between the serotonin transporter (SERT) and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN). Chronic unpredictable mild stress (CMS) selectively increased the SERT-nNOS complex in the DRN in mice. Augmentation of SERT-nNOS interactions in the DRN caused a depression-like phenotype and accounted for the CMS-induced depressive behaviors. Disrupting the SERT-nNOS interaction produced a fast-onset antidepressant effect by enhancing serotonin signaling in forebrain circuits. We discovered a small-molecule compound, ZZL-7, that elicited an antidepressant effect 2 hours after treatment without undesirable side effects. This compound, or analogous reagents, may serve as a new, rapidly acting treatment for MDD.},

  abstract     = {The stereoselective synthesis of complex targets requires the precise orchestration of chemical transformations that simultaneously establish the connectivity and spatial orientation of desired bonds. In this work, we describe a complementary paradigm for the synthesis of chiral molecules and their isomers, which tunes the three-dimensional structure of a molecule at a late stage. Key to the success of this strategy is the development of a mild and highly general photocatalytic method composed of decatungstate polyanion and disulfide cocatalysts, which enable the interconversion of unactivated tertiary stereogenic centers that were previously configurationally fixed. We showcase the versatility of this method—and the implementation of stereoediting logic—by the rapid construction of chiral scaffolds that would be challenging to access using existing tools and by the late-stage stereoediting of complex targets.},

  abstract     = {The Cenozoic diversification of placental mammals is the archetypal adaptive radiation. Yet, discrepancies between molecular divergence estimates and the fossil record fuel ongoing debate around the timing, tempo, and drivers of this radiation. Analysis of a three-dimensional skull dataset for living and extinct placental mammals demonstrates that evolutionary rates peak early and attenuate quickly. This long-term decline in tempo is punctuated by bursts of innovation that decreased in amplitude over the past 66 million years. Social, precocial, aquatic, and herbivorous species evolve fastest, especially whales, elephants, sirenians, and extinct ungulates. Slow rates in rodents and bats indicate dissociation of taxonomic and morphological diversification. Frustratingly, highly similar ancestral shape estimates for placental mammal superorders suggest that their earliest representatives may continue to elude unequivocal identification.},

  abstract     = {Covalently bonded ceramics exhibit preeminent properties—including hardness, strength, chemical inertness, and resistance against heat and corrosion—yet their wider application is challenging because of their room-temperature brittleness. In contrast to the atoms in metals that can slide along slip planes to accommodate strains, the atoms in covalently bonded ceramics require bond breaking because of the strong and directional characteristics of covalent bonds. This eventually leads to catastrophic failure on loading. We present an approach for designing deformable covalently bonded silicon nitride (Si 3 N 4 ) ceramics that feature a dual-phase structure with coherent interfaces. Successive bond switching is realized at the coherent interfaces, which facilitates a stress-induced phase transformation and, eventually, generates plastic deformability.},

Rising temperatures affect the structure and function of marine food webs, exacerbating the vulnerabilities of marine species and the fisheries sector, as well as the challenges in accurately tracking ecosystem health.

In January 2023, the rotating presidency of the European Union will be held by Sweden, whose parliament has already voted against the Commission proposal, arguing that its conservation measures were disproportionate (3). The newly appointed Swedish government terminated on its first day the 35-year-old standalone Ministry of Environment in charge of nature conservation (4). Given its political record of weakening biodiversity laws, Sweden is also likely to counter the proposed European law during its presidency.},

  abstract     = {Full-grown oocytes are transcriptionally silent and must stably maintain the messenger RNAs (mRNAs) needed for oocyte meiotic maturation and early embryonic development. However, where and how mammalian oocytes store maternal mRNAs is unclear. Here, we report that mammalian oocytes accumulate mRNAs in a mitochondria-associated ribonucleoprotein domain (MARDO). MARDO assembly around mitochondria was promoted by the RNA-binding protein ZAR1 and directed by an increase in mitochondrial membrane potential during oocyte growth. MARDO foci coalesced into hydrogel-like matrices that clustered mitochondria. Maternal mRNAs stored in the MARDO were translationally repressed. Loss of ZAR1 disrupted the MARDO, dispersed mitochondria, and caused a premature loss of MARDO-localized mRNAs. Thus, a mitochondria-associated membraneless compartment controls mitochondrial distribution and regulates maternal mRNA storage, translation, and decay to ensure fertility in mammals.},

Using genome-wide CRISPR screens, we identified mitochondrial carrier homolog 2 (MTCH2), and its paralog MTCH1, and showed that it is required for insertion of biophysically diverse tail-anchored (TA), signal-anchored, and multipass proteins, but not outer membrane β-barrel proteins. Purified MTCH2 was sufficient to mediate insertion into reconstituted proteoliposomes. Functional and mutational studies suggested that MTCH2 has evolved from a solute carrier transporter. MTCH2 uses membrane-embedded hydrophilic residues to function as a gatekeeper for the outer membrane, controlling mislocalization of TAs into the endoplasmic reticulum and modulating the sensitivity of leukemia cells to apoptosis. Our identification of MTCH2 as an insertase provides a mechanistic explanation for the diverse phenotypes and disease states associated with MTCH2 dysfunction.},

The controlled growth followed by a surface-coating method effectively produced flexible and defect-free superhydrophobic MOF-NS membranes. The reversible deformation of the flexible MOF-NS and the vertical interlamellar pathways were captured with electron microscopy. Molecular simulations confirmed the structure and revealed transport mechanism. The ultrafast transport channels in MOF-NS exhibited an ultrahigh flux and a separation factor of 8.9 in the pervaporation of 5 weight\% ethanol-water at 40°C, which can be used for biofuel recovery.

It is poorly understood how gene regulatory architectures can accommodate both deep homology and adaptive change. To address this, we characterized the cis-regulatory evolution of the color pattern gene WntA in nymphalid butterflies. Comparative assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) and in vivo deletions spanning 46 cis-regulatory elements across five species revealed deep homology of ground plan–determining sequences, except in monarch butterflies. Furthermore, noncoding deletions displayed both positive and negative regulatory effects that were often broad in nature. Our results provide little support for models predicting rapid enhancer turnover and suggest that deeply ancestral, multifunctional noncoding elements can underlie rapidly evolving trait systems.},

We tested this hypothesis using cross-sectional data from wolf populations across North America that vary in the prevalence of CDV and the allele that makes coats black, longitudinal data from Yellowstone National Park, and modeling. We found that the frequency of CDV outbreaks generates fluctuating selection that results in heterozygote advantage that in turn affects the frequency of the black allele, optimal mating behavior, and black wolf cline across the continent.},

We report a high-performance computational spectrometer based on a single van der Waals junction with an electrically tunable transport-mediated spectral response.

In this study, we show that sex-dependent hepatic gene programs confer a robust (~300\%) survival advantage for male mice during lethal bacterial infection. The transcription factor B cell lymphoma 6 (BCL6), which masculinizes hepatic gene expression at puberty, is essential for this advantage. However, protection by BCL6 protein comes at a cost during conditions of dietary excess, which result in overt fatty liver and glucose intolerance in males. Deleting hepatic BCL6 reverses these phenotypes but markedly lowers male survival during infection, thus establishing a sex-dependent trade-off between host defense and metabolic systems. Our findings offer strong evidence that some current sex-biased diseases are rooted in ancient evolutionary trade-offs between immunity and metabolism.},

TRPM8 activation is controlled by cooling compounds together with the membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP 2 ). Our knowledge of cold sensation and the therapeutic potential of TRPM8 for neuroinflammatory diseases and pain will be enhanced by understanding the structural basis of cooling agonist- and PIP 2 -dependent TRPM8 activation. We present cryo–electron microscopy structures of mouse TRPM8 in closed, intermediate, and open states along the ligand- and PIP 2 -dependent gating pathway. Our results uncover two discrete agonist sites, state-dependent rearrangements in the gate positions, and a disordered-to-ordered transition of the gate-forming S6—elucidating the molecular basis of chemically induced cool sensation in mammals.},

Here we identify the known protein phosphatase PtpB from Mycobacterium tuberculosis as a phospholipid phosphatase inhibiting the host inflammasome-pyroptosis pathway. Mechanistically, PtpB dephosphorylated phosphatidylinositol-4-monophosphate and phosphatidylinositol-(4,5)-bisphosphate in host cell membrane, thus disrupting the membrane localization of the cleaved GSDMD to inhibit cytokine release and pyroptosis of macrophages. Notably, this phosphatase activity requires PtpB binding to ubiquitin. Disrupting phospholipid phosphatase activity or the ubiquitin-interacting motif of PtpB enhanced host GSDMD-dependent immune responses and reduced intracellular pathogen survival. Thus, pathogens inhibit pyroptosis and counteract host immunity by altering host membrane composition.},

These advances hold promise to redefine our view of human disease. Here, we provide an overview of cellular barcoding approaches, discuss applications to gain new insights into disease mechanisms, and provide an outlook on future applications. We discuss unanticipated insights gained through barcoding in studies of cancer and blood cell production and describe how barcoding can be applied to a growing array of medical fields, particularly with the increasing recognition of clonal contributions in human diseases.},

However, synthetic methods to achieve such sophisticated architectures remain elusive. We report a rapid, facile, and environmentally benign method to pattern strong and stiff semicrystalline phases within soft and elastic matrices using stereo-controlled ring-opening metathesis polymerization of an industrial monomer, cis -cyclooctene. Dual polymerization catalysis dictates polyolefin backbone chemistry, which enables patterning of compositionally uniform materials with seamless stiff and elastic interfaces. Visible light–induced activation of a metathesis catalyst results in the formation of semicrystalline trans polyoctenamer rubber, outcompeting the formation of cis polyoctenamer rubber, which occurs at room temperature. This bottom-up approach provides a method for manufacturing polymeric materials with promising applications in soft optoelectronics and robotics.},

Sophisticated phase-shift analysis for the part of the NPs protruding into the vacuum visualized slight potential changes around individual platinum NPs. The analysis revealed the number (only one to six electrons) and sense (positive or negative) of the charge per platinum NP. The underlying mechanism of platinum charging is explained by the work function differences between platinum and titanium dioxide (depending on the orientation relationship and lattice distortion) and by first-principles calculations in terms of the charge transfer processes.},

  abstract     = {We engineered an ultrasensitive reporter of p16 INK4a , a biomarker of cellular senescence. Our reporter detected p16 INK4a -expressing fibroblasts with certain senescent characteristics that appeared shortly after birth in the basement membrane adjacent to epithelial stem cells in the lung. Furthermore, these p16 INK4a+ fibroblasts had enhanced capacity to sense tissue inflammation and respond through their increased secretory capacity to promote epithelial regeneration. In addition, p16 INK4a expression was required in fibroblasts to enhance epithelial regeneration. This study highlights a role for p16 INK4a+ fibroblasts as tissue-resident sentinels in the stem cell niche that monitor barrier integrity and rapidly respond to inflammation to promote tissue regeneration.},

  abstract     = {Studies of the proteome would benefit greatly from methods to directly sequence and digitally quantify proteins and detect posttranslational modifications with single-molecule sensitivity. Here, we demonstrate single-molecule protein sequencing using a dynamic approach in which single peptides are probed in real time by a mixture of dye-labeled N-terminal amino acid recognizers and simultaneously cleaved by aminopeptidases. We annotate amino acids and identify the peptide sequence by measuring fluorescence intensity, lifetime, and binding kinetics on an integrated semiconductor chip. Our results demonstrate the kinetic principles that allow recognizers to identify multiple amino acids in an information-rich manner that enables discrimination of single amino acid substitutions and posttranslational modifications. With further development, we anticipate that this approach will offer a sensitive, scalable, and accessible platform for single-molecule proteomic studies and applications.},

We tailored the three-phase microenvironment by optimizing the ionomer by incorporating ionic covalent organic framework (COF) nanosheets into Nafion. The mesoporous apertures of 2.8 to 4.1 nanometers and appendant sulfonate groups enabled the proton transfer and promoted oxygen permeation. The mass activity of Pt and the peak power density of the fuel cell with Pt/Vulcan (0.07 mg of Pt per square centimeter in the cathode) both reached 1.6 times those values without the COF. This strategy was applied to catalyst layers with various Pt loadings and different commercial catalysts.},

  abstract     = {Deciding whether to grow or to divert energy to stress responses is a major physiological trade-off for plants surviving in fluctuating environments. We show that three leucine-rich repeat receptor kinases (LRR-RKs) act as direct ligand-perceiving receptors for PLANT PEPTIDE CONTAINING SULFATED TYROSINE (PSY)-family peptides and mediate switching between two opposing pathways. By contrast to known LRR-RKs, which activate signaling upon ligand binding, PSY receptors (PSYRs) activate the expression of various genes encoding stress response transcription factors upon depletion of the ligands. Loss of PSYRs results in defects in plant tolerance to both biotic and abiotic stresses. This ligand-deprivation–dependent activation system potentially enables plants to exert tuned regulation of stress responses in the tissues proximal to metabolically dysfunctional damaged sites where ligand production is impaired.},

  abstract     = {Efficient waste heat dissipation has become increasingly challenging as transistor size has decreased to nanometers. As governed by universal Umklapp phonon scattering, the thermal conductivity of semiconductors decreases at higher temperatures and causes heat transfer deterioration under high-power conditions. In this study, we realized simultaneous electrical and thermal rectification (TR) in a monolayer MoSe 2 -WSe 2 lateral heterostructure. The atomically thin MoSe 2 -WSe 2 heterojunction forms an electrical diode with a high ON/OFF ratio up to 10 4 . Meanwhile, a preferred heat dissipation channel was formed from MoSe 2 to WSe 2 in the ON state of the heterojunction diode at high bias voltage with a TR factor as high as 96\%. Higher thermal conductivity was achieved at higher temperatures owing to the TR effect caused by the local temperature gradient. Furthermore, the TR factor could be regulated from maximum to zero by rotating the angle of the monolayer heterojunction interface. This result opens a path for designing novel nanoelectronic devices with enhanced thermal dissipation.},

We present a two-dimensional fast line-scan approach that enables direct imaging of neuronal activity with millisecond precision while retaining the high spatial resolution of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This approach was demonstrated through in vivo mouse brain imaging at 9.4 tesla during electrical whisker-pad stimulation. In vivo spike recording and optogenetics confirmed the high correlation of the observed MRI signal with neural activity. It also captured the sequential and laminar-specific propagation of neuronal activity along the thalamocortical pathway. This high-resolution, direct imaging of neuronal activity will open up new avenues in brain science by providing a deeper understanding of the brain’s functional organization, including the temporospatial dynamics of neural networks.},

We use ancestral sequence reconstruction to recapitulate this event. We show that Rubisco increased its specificity and carboxylation efficiency through the gain of an accessory subunit before atmospheric oxygen was present. Using structural and biochemical approaches, we retrace how this subunit was gained and became essential. Our work illuminates the emergence of an adaptation to rising ambient oxygen levels, provides a template for investigating the function of interactions that have remained elusive because of their essentiality, and sheds light on the determinants of specificity in Rubisco.},

  abstract     = {Investment in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) sequencing in Africa over the past year has led to a major increase in the number of sequences that have been generated and used to track the pandemic on the continent, a number that now exceeds 100,000 genomes. Our results show an increase in the number of African countries that are able to sequence domestically and highlight that local sequencing enables faster turnaround times and more-regular routine surveillance. Despite limitations of low testing proportions, findings from this genomic surveillance study underscore the heterogeneous nature of the pandemic and illuminate the distinct dispersal dynamics of variants of concern—particularly Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Omicron—on the continent. Sustained investment for diagnostics and genomic surveillance in Africa is needed as the virus continues to evolve while the continent faces many emerging and reemerging infectious disease threats. These investments are crucial for pandemic preparedness and response and will serve the health of the continent well into the 21st century.},

  abstract     = {Translational regulation plays a critical role during the oocyte-to-embryo transition (OET) and zygotic genome activation (ZGA). Here, we integrated ultra-low-input ribosome profiling (Ribo-lite) with messenger RNA sequencing to co-profile the translatome and transcriptome in human oocytes and early embryos. Comparison with mouse counterparts identified widespread differentially translated gene functioning in epigenetic reprogramming, transposon defense, and small RNA biogenesis, in part driven by species-specific regulatory elements in 3′ untranslated regions. Moreover, PRD-like homeobox transcription factors, including TPRXL , TPRX1 , and TPRX2 , are highly translated around ZGA. TPRX1/2/L knockdown leads to defective ZGA and preimplantation development. Ectopically expressed TPRXs bind and activate key ZGA genes in human embryonic stem cells. These data reveal the conservation and divergence of translation landscapes during OET and identify critical regulators of human ZGA.},

  abstract     = {Lysosomes are key degradative compartments of the cell. Transport to lysosomes relies on GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase–mediated tagging of soluble enzymes with mannose 6-phosphate (M6P). GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase deficiency leads to the severe lysosomal storage disorder mucolipidosis II (MLII). Several viruses require lysosomal cathepsins to cleave structural proteins and thus depend on functional GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase. We used genome-scale CRISPR screens to identify lysosomal enzyme trafficking factor (LYSET, also named TMEM251) as essential for infection by cathepsin-dependent viruses including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). LYSET deficiency resulted in global loss of M6P tagging and mislocalization of GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase from the Golgi complex to lysosomes. Lyset knockout mice exhibited MLII-like phenotypes, and human pathogenic LYSET alleles failed to restore lysosomal sorting defects. Thus, LYSET is required for correct functioning of the M6P trafficking machinery and mutations in LYSET can explain the phenotype of the associated disorder.},

Through genetic screens in defined nutrient conditions, we characterized LYSET, a transmembrane protein (TMEM251) selectively required when cells consume extracellular proteins. LYSET was found to associate in the Golgi with GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase, which targets catabolic enzymes to lysosomes through mannose-6-phosphate modification. Without LYSET, GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase was unstable because of a hydrophilic transmembrane domain. Consequently, LYSET-deficient cells were depleted of lysosomal enzymes and impaired in turnover of macropinocytic and autophagic cargoes. Thus, LYSET represents a core component of the lysosomal enzyme trafficking pathway, underlies the pathomechanism for hereditary lysosomal storage disorders, and may represent a target to suppress metabolic adaptations in cancer.},

  abstract     = {Frontotemporal dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FTD-ALS) are associated with both a repeat expansion in the C9orf72 gene and mutations in the TANK-binding kinase 1 ( TBK1 ) gene. We found that TBK1 is phosphorylated in response to C9orf72 poly(Gly-Ala) [poly(GA)] aggregation and sequestered into inclusions, which leads to a loss of TBK1 activity and contributes to neurodegeneration. When we reduced TBK1 activity using a TBK1-R228H (Arg 228 →His) mutation in mice, poly(GA)-induced phenotypes were exacerbated. These phenotypes included an increase in TAR DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43) pathology and the accumulation of defective endosomes in poly(GA)-positive neurons. Inhibiting the endosomal pathway induced TDP-43 aggregation, which highlights the importance of this pathway and TBK1 activity in pathogenesis. This interplay between C9orf72 , TBK1 , and TDP-43 connects three different facets of FTD-ALS into one coherent pathway.},

We use a transmission model fitted to empirical sexual partnership data to show that the heavy-tailed sexual partnership distribution, in which a handful of individuals have disproportionately many partners, can explain the sustained growth of monkeypox among MSM despite the absence of such patterns previously. We suggest that the basic reproduction number ( R 0 ) for monkeypox over the MSM sexual network may be substantially above 1, which poses challenges to outbreak containment. Ensuring support and tailored messaging to facilitate prevention and early detection among MSM with high numbers of partners is warranted.},

  abstract     = {From tropical forests to gut microbiomes, ecological communities host notably high numbers of coexisting species. Beyond high biodiversity, communities exhibit a range of complex dynamics that are difficult to explain under a unified framework. Using bacterial microcosms, we performed a direct test of theory predicting that simple community-level features dictate emergent behaviors of communities. As either the number of species or the strength of interactions increases, we show that microbial ecosystems transition between three distinct dynamical phases, from a stable equilibrium in which all species coexist to partial coexistence to emergence of persistent fluctuations in species abundances, in the order predicted by theory. Under fixed conditions, high biodiversity and fluctuations reinforce each other. Our results demonstrate predictable emergent patterns of diversity and dynamics in ecological communities.},

  abstract     = {High-entropy alloys are solid solutions of multiple principal elements that are capable of reaching composition and property regimes inaccessible for dilute materials. Discovering those with valuable properties, however, too often relies on serendipity, because thermodynamic alloy design rules alone often fail in high-dimensional composition spaces. We propose an active learning strategy to accelerate the design of high-entropy Invar alloys in a practically infinite compositional space based on very sparse data. Our approach works as a closed-loop, integrating machine learning with density-functional theory, thermodynamic calculations, and experiments. After processing and characterizing 17 new alloys out of millions of possible compositions, we identified two high-entropy Invar alloys with extremely low thermal expansion coefficients around 2 × 10 −6 per degree kelvin at 300 kelvin. We believe this to be a suitable pathway for the fast and automated discovery of high-entropy alloys with optimal thermal, magnetic, and electrical properties.},

Here, we focus on the single-nucleotide polymorphism rs55705857, which confers a sixfold greater risk of isocitrate dehydrogenase ( IDH) –mutant low-grade glioma (LGG). We reveal that rs55705857 itself is the causal variant and is associated with molecular pathways that drive LGG. Mechanistically, we show that rs55705857 resides within a brain-specific enhancer, where the risk allele disrupts OCT2/4 binding, allowing increased interaction with the Myc promoter and increased Myc expression. Mutating the orthologous mouse rs55705857 locus accelerated tumor development in an Idh1 R132H -driven LGG mouse model from 472 to 172 days and increased penetrance from 30\% to 75\%. Our work reveals mechanisms of the heritable predisposition to lethal glioma in ~40\% of LGG patients.},

The +1 nucleosome is well positioned about 40 base pairs downstream of the transcription start site (TSS) and is commonly known as a barrier of transcription. The +1 nucleosome–bound PIC-Mediator structures show that PIC-Mediator prefers binding to T40N nucleosome located 40 base pairs downstream of TSS and contacts T50N but not the T70N nucleosome. The nucleosome facilitates the organization of PIC-Mediator on the promoter by binding TFIIH subunit p52 and Mediator subunits MED19 and MED26 and may contribute to transcription initiation. PIC-Mediator exhibits multiple nucleosome-binding patterns, supporting a structural role of the +1 nucleosome in the coordination of PIC-Mediator assembly. Our study reveals the molecular mechanism of PIC-Mediator organization on chromatin and underscores the significance of the +1 nucleosome in regulating transcription initiation.},

On native protein backbones, ProteinMPNN has a sequence recovery of 52.4\% compared with 32.9\% for Rosetta. The amino acid sequence at different positions can be coupled between single or multiple chains, enabling application to a wide range of current protein design challenges. We demonstrate the broad utility and high accuracy of ProteinMPNN using x-ray crystallography, cryo–electron microscopy, and functional studies by rescuing previously failed designs, which were made using Rosetta or AlphaFold, of protein monomers, cyclic homo-oligomers, tetrahedral nanoparticles, and target-binding proteins.},

  abstract     = {The dormant state of bacterial spores is generally thought to be devoid of biological activity. We show that despite continued dormancy, spores can integrate environmental signals over time through a preexisting electrochemical potential. Specifically, we studied thousands of individual Bacillus subtilis spores that remain dormant when exposed to transient nutrient pulses. Guided by a mathematical model of bacterial electrophysiology, we modulated the decision to exit dormancy by genetically and chemically targeting potassium ion flux. We confirmed that short nutrient pulses result in step-like changes in the electrochemical potential of persistent spores. During dormancy, spores thus gradually release their stored electrochemical potential to integrate extracellular information over time. These findings reveal a decision-making mechanism that operates in physiologically inactive cells.},

We show that v-cADPR (2′cADPR) and v2-cADPR (3′cADPR) isomers are cyclized by O-glycosidic bond formation between the ribose moieties in ADPR. Structures of 2′cADPR-producing TIR domains reveal conformational changes that lead to an active assembly that resembles those of Toll-like receptor adaptor TIR domains. Mutagenesis reveals a conserved tryptophan that is essential for cyclization. We show that 3′cADPR is an activator of ThsA effector proteins from the bacterial antiphage defense system termed Thoeris and a suppressor of plant immunity when produced by the effector HopAM1. Collectively, our results reveal the molecular basis of cADPR isomer production and establish 3′cADPR in bacteria as an antiviral and plant immunity–suppressing signaling molecule.},

We assessed more than 600,000 single-nucleus transcriptomes from adult human, chimpanzee, macaque, and marmoset dlPFC. Although most cell subtypes defined transcriptomically are conserved, we detected several that exist only in a subset of species as well as substantial species-specific molecular differences across homologous neuronal, glial, and non-neural subtypes. The latter are exemplified by human-specific switching between expression of the neuropeptide somatostatin and tyrosine hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme in dopamine production in certain interneurons. The above molecular differences are also illustrated by expression of the neuropsychiatric risk gene FOXP2 , which is human-specific in microglia and primate-specific in layer 4 granular neurons. We generated a comprehensive survey of the dlPFC cellular repertoire and its shared and divergent features in anthropoid primates.},

We identified 17 ligands with potencies as low as 12 nanomolar, many with partial agonism and preferential G i and G o signaling. Experimental structures of α 2A AR complexed with two of these agonists confirmed the docking predictions and templated further optimization. Several compounds, including the initial docking hit ‘9087 [mean effective concentration (EC 50 ) of 52 nanomolar] and two analogs, ‘7075 and PS75 (EC 50 4.1 and 4.8 nanomolar), exerted on-target analgesic activity in multiple in vivo pain models without sedation.

Pathogens must interact with specific molecules in the vector gut, the microbiota, and the vector immune system to survive and be transmitted. The vertebrate host, in turn, is infected when the pathogen and vector-derived factors, such as salivary proteins, are delivered into the skin by a vector bite. Here, we review recent progress in our understanding of the biology of pathogen transmission from the human to the vector and back, from the vector to the host. We also highlight recent advances in the biology of vector-borne disease transmission, which have translated into additional strategies to prevent human disease by either reducing vector populations or by disrupting their ability to transmit pathogens.},

Neither assumption, however, is based on real-world observations. We calculate flare efficiency using airborne sampling across three basins responsible for &gt;80\% of US flaring and combine these observations with unlit flare prevalence surveys. We find that both unlit flares and inefficient combustion contribute comparably to ineffective methane destruction, with flares effectively destroying only 91.1\% (90.2, 91.8; 95\% confidence interval) of methane. This represents a fivefold increase in methane emissions above present assumptions and constitutes 4 to 10\% of total US oil and gas methane emissions, highlighting a previously underappreciated methane source and mitigation opportunity.},

These polyamide nanofilms provide transport of hydrophobic liquids more than 100 times faster than that of conventional hydrophilic counterparts. In the fractionation of light crude oil, manipulation of the film thickness down to ~10 nanometers achieves permeance one order of magnitude higher than that of current state-of-the-art hydrophobic membranes while retaining comparable size- and class-based separation.

However, its trend toward long-term ocean acidification and the underlying mechanisms remain undocumented. Here, we report rapid acidification there, with rates three to four times higher than in other ocean basins, and attribute it to changing sea ice coverage on a decadal time scale. Sea ice melt exposes seawater to the atmosphere and promotes rapid uptake of atmospheric carbon dioxide, lowering its alkalinity and buffer capacity and thus leading to sharp declines in pH and Ω arag . We predict a further decrease in pH, particularly at higher latitudes where sea ice retreat is active, whereas Arctic warming may counteract decreases in Ω arag in the future.},

Whereas the origins of strong correlations and nontrivial topology can be directly linked to flat bands, the nature of superconductivity remains enigmatic. We demonstrate that magic-angle devices made of twisted tri-, quadri-, and pentalayer graphene placed on monolayer tungsten diselenide exhibit flavor polarization and superconductivity. We also observe insulating states in the tril- and quadrilayer arising at finite electric displacement fields. As the number of layers increases, superconductivity emerges over an enhanced filling-factor range, and in the pentalayer it extends well beyond the filling of four electrons per moiré unit cell. Our results highlight the role of the interplay between flat and more dispersive bands in extending superconducting regions in graphene moiré superlattices.},

  abstract     = {Protein synthesis generally starts with a methionine that is removed during translation. However, cytoplasmic actin defies this rule because its synthesis involves noncanonical excision of the acetylated methionine by an unidentified enzyme after translation. Here, we identified C19orf54, named ACTMAP (actin maturation protease), as this enzyme. Its ablation resulted in viable mice in which the cytoskeleton was composed of immature actin molecules across all tissues. However, in skeletal muscle, the lengths of sarcomeric actin filaments were shorter, muscle function was decreased, and centralized nuclei, a common hallmark of myopathies, progressively accumulated. Thus, ACTMAP encodes the missing factor required for the synthesis of mature actin and regulates specific actin-dependent traits in vivo.},

  abstract     = {The samarium-146 ( 146 Sm)–neodymium-142 ( 142 Nd) short-lived decay system (half-life of 103 million years) is a powerful tracer of the early mantle-crust evolution of planetary bodies. However, an increased 142 Nd/ 144 Nd in modern terrestrial rocks relative to chondrite meteorites has been proposed to be caused by nucleosynthetic anomalies, obscuring early Earth’s differentiation history. We use stepwise dissolution of primitive chondrites to quantify nucleosynthetic contributions on the composition of chondrites. After correction for nucleosynthetic anomalies, Earth and the silicate parts of differentiated planetesimals contain resolved excesses of 142 Nd relative to chondrites. We conclude that only collisional erosion of primordial crusts can explain such compositions. This process associated with planetary accretion must have produced substantial loss of incompatible elements, including long-term heat-producing elements such as uranium, thorium, and potassium.},

  abstract     = {Gain-of-function mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) in human cancers result in the production of d -2-hydroxyglutarate ( d -2HG), an oncometabolite that promotes tumorigenesis through epigenetic alterations. The cancer cell–intrinsic effects of d -2HG are well understood, but its tumor cell–nonautonomous roles remain poorly explored. We compared the oncometabolite d -2HG with its enantiomer, l -2HG, and found that tumor-derived d -2HG was taken up by CD8 + T cells and altered their metabolism and antitumor functions in an acute and reversible fashion. We identified the glycolytic enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) as a molecular target of d -2HG. d -2HG and inhibition of LDH drive a metabolic program and immune CD8 + T cell signature marked by decreased cytotoxicity and impaired interferon-γ signaling that was recapitulated in clinical samples from human patients with IDH1 mutant gliomas.},

We investigated the petrology of olivine and carbonate-bearing rocks of the Séítah formation in the floor of Jezero. Using multispectral images and x-ray fluorescence data, acquired by the Perseverance rover, we performed a petrographic analysis of the Bastide and Brac outcrops within this unit. We found that these outcrops are composed of igneous rock, moderately altered by aqueous fluid. The igneous rocks are mainly made of coarse-grained olivine, similar to some martian meteorites. We interpret them as an olivine cumulate, formed by settling and enrichment of olivine through multistage cooling of a thick magma body.},

  abstract     = {Recent evidence has shown that even mild mutations in the Huntingtin gene that are associated with late-onset Huntington’s disease (HD) disrupt various aspects of human neurodevelopment. To determine whether these seemingly subtle early defects affect adult neural function, we investigated neural circuit physiology in newborn HD mice. During the first postnatal week, HD mice have less cortical layer 2/3 excitatory synaptic activity than wild-type mice, express fewer glutamatergic receptors, and show sensorimotor deficits. The circuit self-normalizes in the second postnatal week but the mice nonetheless develop HD. Pharmacologically enhancing glutamatergic transmission during the neonatal period, however, rescues these deficits and preserves sensorimotor function, cognition, and spine and synapse density as well as brain region volume in HD adult mice.},

Rotation begins with tissue deformation of the dorsal mesentery, which is dependent on left-sided expression of the Paired-like transcription factor Pitx2 . The conserved morphogen Nodal induces asymmetric Pitx2 to govern embryonic laterality, but organ-level regulation of Pitx2 during gut asymmetry remains unknown. We found Nodal to be dispensable for Pitx2 expression during mesentery deformation. Intestinal rotation instead required a mechanosensitive latent transforming growth factor–β (TGFβ), tuning a second wave of Pitx2 that induced reciprocal tissue stiffness in the left mesentery as mechanical feedback with the right side. This signaling regulator, an accelerator (right) and brake (left), combines biochemical and biomechanical inputs to break gut morphological symmetry and direct intestinal rotation.},

In this work, we prove that classical ML algorithms can efficiently predict ground-state properties of gapped Hamiltonians after learning from other Hamiltonians in the same quantum phase of matter. By contrast, under a widely accepted conjecture, classical algorithms that do not learn from data cannot achieve the same guarantee. We also prove that classical ML algorithms can efficiently classify a wide range of quantum phases. Extensive numerical experiments corroborate our theoretical results in a variety of scenarios, including Rydberg atom systems, two-dimensional random Heisenberg models, symmetry-protected topological phases, and topologically ordered phases.},

All cerebral blood flow passes through these retia, and we hypothesize that they protect cetacean brains from locomotion-generated pulsatile blood pressures. We propose that cetaceans have evolved a pulse-transfer mechanism that minimizes pulsatility in cerebral arterial-to-venous pressure differentials without dampening the pressure pulses themselves. We tested this hypothesis using a computational model based on morphology from 11 species and found that the large arterial capacitance in the retia, coupled with the small extravascular capacitance in the cranium and vertebral canal, could protect the cerebral vasculature from 97\% of systemic pulsatility. Evolution of the retial complex in cetaceans—likely linked to the development of dorsoventral fluking—offers a distinctive solution to adverse locomotion-generated vascular pulsatility.},

This sparse activation results from widespread synaptic inhibition in conjunction with neuron-specific synaptic excitation. We report the selective recruitment of hippocampal pyramidal cells into patterned network activity. During ripple oscillations in awake mice, spiking is much more likely in cells in which the axon originates from a basal dendrite rather than from the soma. High-resolution recordings in vitro and computer modeling indicate that these spikes are elicited by synaptic input to the axon-carrying dendrite and thus escape perisomatic inhibition. Pyramidal cells with somatic axon origin can be activated during ripple oscillations by blocking their somatic inhibition. The recruitment of neurons into active ensembles is thus determined by axonal morphological features.},

Microbial wood decay rates are known to respond to changing temperature and precipitation. Termites are also important decomposers in the tropics but are less well studied. An understanding of their climate sensitivities is needed to estimate climate change effects on wood carbon pools. Using data from 133 sites spanning six continents, we found that termite wood discovery and consumption were highly sensitive to temperature (with decay increasing &gt;6.8 times per 10°C increase in temperature)—even more so than microbes. Termite decay effects were greatest in tropical seasonal forests, tropical savannas, and subtropical deserts. With tropicalization (i.e., warming shifts to tropical climates), termite wood decay will likely increase as termites access more of Earth’s surface.},

However, its actual climatic benefits are uncertain because the forests’ reduced albedo can produce large warming effects. Using high-resolution spatial analysis of global drylands, we found 448 million hectares suitable for afforestation. This area’s carbon sequestration potential until 2100 is 32.3 billion tons of carbon (Gt C), but 22.6 Gt C of that is required to balance albedo effects. The net carbon equivalent would offset ~1\% of projected medium-emissions and business-as-usual scenarios over the same period. Focusing forestation only on areas with net cooling effects would use half the area and double the emissions offset. Although such smart forestation is clearly important, its limited climatic benefits reinforce the need to reduce emissions rapidly.},

We introduce a mathematical framework that bridges biodiversity theory and population genetics to understand the loss of naturally occurring DNA mutations with decreasing habitat. By analyzing genomic variation of 10,095 georeferenced individuals from 20 plant and animal species, we show that genome-wide diversity follows a mutations-area relationship power law with geographic area, which can predict genetic diversity loss from local population extinctions. We estimate that more than 10\% of genetic diversity may already be lost for many threatened and nonthreatened species, surpassing the United Nations’ post-2020 targets for genetic preservation.},

Thickness dependence of the 2D perovskite layer reveals the anticipated trends for n-i-p and p-i-n architectures, which is consistent with band alignment and carrier transport limits for 2D perovskites.

Analyses of NIN-NLP7 chimeras and nitrate binding revealed that NLP7 is derepressed upon nitrate perception via its amino terminus. A genetically encoded fluorescent split biosensor, mCitrine-NLP7, enabled visualization of single-cell nitrate dynamics in planta. The nitrate sensor domain of NLP7 resembles the bacterial nitrate sensor NreA. Substitutions of conserved residues in the ligand-binding pocket impaired the ability of nitrate-triggered NLP7 to control transcription, transport, metabolism, development, and biomass.

  abstract     = {Colloidal lead halide perovskite nanocrystals are of interest as photoluminescent quantum dots (QDs) whose properties depend on the size and shape. They are normally synthesized on subsecond time scales through hard-to-control ionic metathesis reactions. We report a room-temperature synthesis of monodisperse, isolable, spheroidal APbBr 3 QDs (“A” indicates cesium, formamidinium, and methylammonium) that are size tunable from 3 to &gt;13 nanometers. The kinetics of both nucleation and growth are temporally separated and substantially slowed down by the intricate equilibrium between the precursor (PbBr 2 ) and the A[PbBr 3 ] solute, with the latter serving as a monomer. QDs of all these compositions exhibit up to four excitonic transitions in their linear absorption spectra, and we demonstrate that the size-dependent confinement energy for all transitions is independent of the A-site cation.},

  abstract     = {Tissue-tissue communication by endocrine factors is a vital mechanism for physiologic homeostasis. A systems genetics analysis of transcriptomic and functional data from a cohort of diverse, inbred strains of mice predicted that coagulation factor XI (FXI), a liver-derived protein, protects against diastolic dysfunction, a key trait of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. This was confirmed using gain- and loss-of-function studies, and FXI was found to activate the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)–SMAD1/5 pathway in the heart. The proteolytic activity of FXI is required for the cleavage and activation of extracellular matrix–associated BMP7 in the heart, thus inhibiting genes involved in inflammation and fibrosis. Our results reveal a protective role of FXI in heart injury that is distinct from its role in coagulation.},

However, the steps linking DSB formation to DSB ligation remain undeciphered. We report that DNA replication timing (RT) directly regulates lymphomagenic Myc translocations during antibody maturation in B cells downstream of DSBs and independently of DSB frequency. Depletion of minichromosome maintenance complexes alters replication origin activity, decreases translocations, and deregulates global RT. Ablating a single origin at Myc causes an early-to-late RT switch, loss of translocations, and reduced proximity with the immunoglobulin heavy chain ( Igh ) gene, its major translocation partner. These phenotypes were reversed by restoring early RT. Disruption of early RT also reduced tumorigenic translocations in human leukemic cells. Thus, RT constitutes a general mechanism in translocation biogenesis linking DSB formation to DSB ligation.},

In nanophotonics, it remains challenging to generate, manipulate, and measure such a quantum state with the performance required for a wide range of scalable quantum information systems. Here, we report the development of a lithium niobate–based nanophotonic platform to demonstrate the generation and all-optical measurement of squeezed states on the same chip. The generated squeezed states span more than 25 terahertz of bandwidth supporting just a few optical cycles. The measured 4.9 decibels of squeezing surpass the requirements for a wide range of quantum information systems, demonstrating a practical path toward scalable ultrafast quantum nanophotonics.},

  abstract     = {The gut microbiomes of human populations worldwide have many core microbial species in common. However, within a species, some strains can show remarkable population specificity. The question is whether such specificity arises from a shared evolutionary history (codiversification) between humans and their microbes. To test for codiversification of host and microbiota, we analyzed paired gut metagenomes and human genomes for 1225 individuals in Europe, Asia, and Africa, including mothers and their children. Between and within countries, a parallel evolutionary history was evident for humans and their gut microbes. Moreover, species displaying the strongest codiversification independently evolved traits characteristic of host dependency, including reduced genomes and oxygen and temperature sensitivity. These findings all point to the importance of understanding the potential role of population-specific microbial strains in microbiome-mediated disease phenotypes.},

In this work, we demonstrate a distinct reactivity mode enabled by quantum mechanical tunneling that uses the cyclohexadiene derivative γ-terpinene as the abstractor under mild photochemical conditions. This protocol activates alkyl and aryl halides as well as several alcohol and thiol derivatives. Experimental and computational studies unveiled a noncanonical pathway whereby a cyclohexadienyl radical undergoes concerted aromatization and halogen-atom or group abstraction through the reactivity of an effective H atom. This activation mechanism is seemingly thermodynamically and kinetically unfavorable but is rendered feasible through quantum tunneling.},

Ultracold atoms in optical lattices have been used to indirectly characterize such points in the band structure. We measured the non-Abelian transformation produced by transport directly through the singularities. We accelerated atoms along a quasi-momentum trajectory that enters, turns, and then exits the singularities at linear and quadratic band-touching points of a honeycomb lattice. Measurements after transport identified the topological winding numbers of these singularities to be 1 and 2, respectively. Our work introduces a distinct method for probing singularities that enables the study of non-Dirac singularities in ultracold-atom quantum simulators.},

This groundwater pumpage increases available subsurface storage that under favorable conditions amplifies groundwater replenishment during the subsequent monsoon. We empirically quantified this nature-based solution to seasonal freshwater storage capture described as the “Bengal Water Machine,” revealing its potential and limitations. On the basis of a million piezometric observations from 465 monitoring wells, we show that the collective operation of ~16 million smallholder farmers in the Bengal Basin of Bangladesh from 1988 to 2018 has induced cumulative freshwater capture that volumetrically (75 to 90 cubic kilometers) is equivalent to twice the reservoir capacity of the Three Gorges Dam.},

We describe the only known example of a three-dimensionally mineralized heart, thick-walled stomach, and bilobed liver from arthrodire placoderms, stem gnathostomes from the Late Devonian Gogo Formation in Western Australia. The application of synchrotron and neutron microtomography to this material shows evidence of a flat S-shaped heart, which is well separated from the liver and other abdominal organs, and the absence of lungs. Arthrodires thus show the earliest phylogenetic evidence for repositioning of the gnathostome heart associated with the evolution of the complex neck region in jawed vertebrates.},

The experiments randomly varied the prevalence of weak ties in the networks of over 20 million people over a 5-year period, during which 2 billion new ties and 600,000 new jobs were created. The results provided experimental causal evidence supporting the strength of weak ties and suggested three revisions to the theory. First, the strength of weak ties was nonlinear. Statistical analysis found an inverted U-shaped relationship between tie strength and job transmission such that weaker ties increased job transmission but only to a point, after which there were diminishing marginal returns to tie weakness. Second, weak ties measured by interaction intensity and the number of mutual connections displayed varying effects. Moderately weak ties (measured by mutual connections) and the weakest ties (measured by interaction intensity) created the most job mobility. Third, the strength of weak ties varied by industry. Whereas weak ties increased job mobility in more digital industries, strong ties increased job mobility in less digital industries.},

Here, we report the cryo–electron microscopy structures of human TAS2R46 complexed with chimeric mini–G protein gustducin, in both strychnine-bound and apo forms. Several features of TAS2R46 are disclosed, including distinct receptor structures that compare with known GPCRs, a new “toggle switch,” activation-related motifs, and precoupling with mini–G protein gustducin. Furthermore, the dynamic extracellular and more-static intracellular parts of TAS2R46 suggest possible diverse ligand-recognition and activation processes.

  abstract     = {Lysosomes coordinate cellular metabolism and growth upon sensing of essential nutrients, including cholesterol. Through bioinformatic analysis of lysosomal proteomes, we identified lysosomal cholesterol signaling (LYCHOS, previously annotated as G protein–coupled receptor 155), a multidomain transmembrane protein that enables cholesterol-dependent activation of the master growth regulator, the protein kinase mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). Cholesterol bound to the amino-terminal permease-like region of LYCHOS, and mutating this site impaired mTORC1 activation. At high cholesterol concentrations, LYCHOS bound to the GATOR1 complex, a guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase)–activating protein for the Rag GTPases, through a conserved cytoplasm-facing loop. By sequestering GATOR1, LYCHOS promotes cholesterol- and Rag-dependent recruitment of mTORC1 to lysosomes. Thus, LYCHOS functions in a lysosomal pathway for cholesterol sensing and couples cholesterol concentrations to mTORC1-dependent anabolic signaling.},

We use Cassini data to refine estimates of Saturn’s moment of inertia, finding that it is just outside the range required for the resonance. We propose that Saturn previously had an additional satellite, which we name Chrysalis, that caused Saturn’s obliquity to increase through the Neptune resonance. Destabilization of Chrysalis’s orbit ~100 million years ago can then explain the proximity of the system to the resonance and the formation of the rings through a grazing encounter with Saturn.},

Here, we use cryo–electron microscopy snapshots of Craspase to explain its target RNA cleavage and protease activation mechanisms. Target-guide pairing extending into the 5′ region of the guide RNA displaces a gating loop in gRAMP, which triggers an extensive conformational relay that allosterically aligns the protease catalytic dyad and opens an amino acid side-chain–binding pocket. We further define Csx30 as the endogenous protein substrate that is site-specifically proteolyzed by RNA-activated Craspase. This protease activity is switched off by target RNA cleavage by gRAMP and is not activated by RNA targets containing a matching protospacer flanking sequence. We thus conclude that Craspase is a target RNA–activated protease with self-regulatory capacity.},

Handelsman et al. explain that past interventions have not resulted in equitable representation for students from historically excluded communities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). We agree that implementation of their suggested classroom changes would likely contribute to greater persistence and retention in STEM throughout college. However, fixing the classroom alone will not be sufficient. If we are to achieve a fully inclusive workforce (1, 2), we need a comprehensive approach that simultaneously and collaboratively addresses factors both within and outside the classroom (3).},

Using cryo–electron microscopy, we obtained structures of the RNAPII elongation complex (EC) passing through a nucleosome in the presence of the transcription elongation factors Spt6, Spn1, Elf1, Spt4/5, and Paf1C and the histone chaperone FACT (facilitates chromatin transcription). The structures show snapshots of EC progression on DNA mediating downstream nucleosome disassembly, followed by its reassembly upstream of the EC, which is facilitated by FACT. FACT dynamically adapts to successively occurring subnucleosome intermediates, forming an interface with the EC. Spt6, Spt4/5, and Paf1C form a “cradle” at the EC DNA-exit site and support the upstream nucleosome reassembly. These structures explain the mechanism by which the EC traverses nucleosomes while maintaining the chromatin structure and epigenetic information.},

Synthesizing paleoclimate, observational, and model-based studies, we provide a revised shortlist of global “core” tipping elements and regional “impact” tipping elements and their temperature thresholds. Current global warming of ~1.1°C above preindustrial temperatures already lies within the lower end of some tipping point uncertainty ranges. Several tipping points may be triggered in the Paris Agreement range of 1.5 to &lt;2°C global warming, with many more likely at the 2 to 3°C of warming expected on current policy trajectories. This strengthens the evidence base for urgent action to mitigate climate change and to develop improved tipping point risk assessment, early warning capability, and adaptation strategies.},

Although it is well established that agriculture is a dominant driver of deforestation, rates and mechanisms remain disputed and often lack a clear evidence base. We synthesize the best available pantropical evidence to provide clarity on how agriculture drives deforestation. Although most (90 to 99\%) deforestation across the tropics 2011 to 2015 was driven by agriculture, only 45 to 65\% of deforested land became productive agriculture within a few years. Therefore, ending deforestation likely requires combining measures to create deforestation-free supply chains with landscape governance interventions. We highlight key remaining evidence gaps including deforestation trends, commodity-specific land-use dynamics, and data from tropical dry forests and forests across Africa.},

Modern human transketolase-like 1 (TKTL1) differs from Neanderthal TKTL1 by a lysine-to-arginine amino acid substitution. Using overexpression in developing mouse and ferret neocortex, knockout in fetal human neocortical tissue, and genome-edited cerebral organoids, we found that the modern human variant, hTKTL1, but not the Neanderthal variant, increases the abundance of basal radial glia (bRG) but not that of intermediate progenitors (bIPs). bRG generate more neocortical neurons than bIPs. The hTKTL1 effect requires the pentose phosphate pathway and fatty acid synthesis. Inhibition of these metabolic pathways reduces bRG abundance in fetal human neocortical tissue. Our data suggest that neocortical neurogenesis in modern humans differs from that in Neanderthals.},

The target layer exhibited a hole conductivity that was 80 times higher than that of the conventional lithium-doped layer. Moreover, after extreme iodide invasion caused by light-soaking at 85°C for 200 hours, the target layer maintained high hole conductivity and well-matched band alignment. This ion-exchange strategy enabled fabrication of perovskite solar cells with a certified power conversion efficiency of 23.9\% that maintained 92\% under standard illumination at 85°C after 1000 hours.},

The activity was comparable to that of recently reported bisphosphine-coordinated cobalt(II) catalysts, which we could not reproduce under the reported conditions. Kinetic and in situ infrared spectroscopic studies confirmed the stability of the unmodified cobalt tetracarbonyl hydride [HCo(CO) 4 ]. Branched internal olefins were converted to aldehydes with high regioselectivity under low syngas pressures without phosphorus ligands.

  abstract     = {Incorporating relativistic physics into quantum tunneling can lead to exotic behavior such as perfect transmission through Klein tunneling. Here, we probed the tunneling properties of spin-momentum-locked relativistic fermions by designing and implementing a tunneling geometry that uses nanowires of the topological Kondo insulator candidate samarium hexaboride. The nanowires are attached to the end of scanning tunneling microscope tips and used to image the bicollinear stripe spin order in the antiferromagnet Fe 1.03 Te with a Neel temperature of about 50 kelvin. The antiferromagnetic stripes become invisible above 10 kelvin concomitant with the suppression of the topological surface states in the tip. We further demonstrate that the direction of spin polarization is tied to the tunneling direction. Our technique establishes samarium hexaboride nanowires as ideal conduits for spin-polarized currents.},

  abstract     = {Ultracompact sources of circularly polarized light are important for classical and quantum optical information processing. Conventional approaches for generating chiral emission are restricted to excitation power ranges and fail to provide high-quality radiation with perfect polarization conversion. We used the physics of chiral quasi-bound states in the continuum to demonstrate the efficient and controllable emission of circularly polarized light from resonant metasurfaces. Exploiting intrinsic chirality and giant field enhancement, we revealed how to simultaneously modify and control spectra, radiation patterns, and spin angular momentum of photoluminescence and lasing without any spin injection. The superior characteristics of chiral emission and lasing promise multiple applications in nanophotonics and quantum optics.},

We analyze the masses and radii of all known small transiting planets around M dwarfs, identifying three populations: rocky, water-rich, and gas-rich. Our results are inconsistent with the previously known bimodal radius distribution arising from atmospheric loss of a hydrogen/helium envelope. Instead, we propose that a density gap separates rocky from water-rich exoplanets. Formation models that include orbital migration can explain the observations: Rocky planets form within the snow line, whereas water-rich worlds form outside it and later migrate inward.},

  abstract     = {Parasites impose fitness costs on their hosts. Biologists often assume that natural selection favors infection-resistant hosts. Yet, when the immune response itself is costly, theory suggests that selection may sometimes favor loss of resistance, which may result in alternative stable states where some populations are resistant and others are tolerant. Intraspecific variation in immune costs is rarely surveyed in a manner that tests evolutionary patterns, and there are few examples of adaptive loss of resistance. Here, we show that when marine threespine stickleback colonized freshwater lakes, they gained resistance to the freshwater-associated cestode Schistocephalus solidus . Extensive peritoneal fibrosis and inflammation are a commonly observed phenotype that contributes to suppression of cestode growth and viability but also imposes a substantial cost on fecundity. Combining genetic mapping and population genomics, we find that opposing selection generates immune system differences between tolerant and resistant populations, consistent with divergent optimization.},

The state at the filling of ν = 5/2, predicted to host non-abelian anyons, supports a variety of edge modes (integer, fractional, neutral). To ensure thermal equilibration between the edge modes and thus accurately determine the state’s nature, it is advantageous to isolate the fractional channel (1/2 and neutral modes). In this study, we gapped out the integer modes by interfacing the ν = 5/2 state with integer states ν = 2 and ν = 3 and measured the thermal conductance of the isolated-interface channel. Our measured half-quantized thermal conductance confirms the non-abelian nature of the ν = 5/2 state and its particle-hole Pfaffian topological order. Such an isolated channel may be more amenable to braiding experiments.},

We uncover microscopic trends in the electron correlations and reveal the link between the material composition and magnetic energy scales through a many-body picture of excitation processes involving the buffer layers.

Using murine organoid and genetically engineered mouse models, we investigated the causes of lineage plasticity in prostate cancer and its relationship to antiandrogen resistance. We found that plasticity initiates in an epithelial population defined by mixed luminal-basal phenotype and that it depends on increased Janus kinase (JAK) and fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) activity. Organoid cultures from patients with castration-resistant disease harboring mixed-lineage cells reproduce the dependency observed in mice by up-regulating luminal gene expression upon JAK and FGFR inhibitor treatment. Single-cell analysis confirms the presence of mixed-lineage cells with increased JAK/STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription) and FGFR signaling in a subset of patients with metastatic disease, with implications for stratifying patients for clinical trials.},

To elucidate their domestication history, we constructed a comprehensive genome panel of 207 modern and 31 ancient donkeys, as well as 15 wild equids. We found a strong phylogeographic structure in modern donkeys that supports a single domestication in Africa ~5000 BCE, followed by further expansions in this continent and Eurasia and ultimately returning to Africa. We uncover a previously unknown genetic lineage in the Levant ~200 BCE, which contributed increasing ancestry toward Asia.

We show in a DS model (Ts65Dn mice) that these progressive nonreproductive neurological symptoms closely parallel a postpubertal decrease in hypothalamic as well as extrahypothalamic expression of a master molecule that controls reproduction—gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)—and appear related to an imbalance in a microRNA-gene network known to regulate GnRH neuron maturation together with altered hippocampal synaptic transmission. Epigenetic, cellular, chemogenetic, and pharmacological interventions that restore physiological GnRH levels abolish olfactory and cognitive defects in Ts65Dn mice, whereas pulsatile GnRH therapy improves cognition and brain connectivity in adult DS patients. GnRH thus plays a crucial role in olfaction and cognition, and pulsatile GnRH therapy holds promise to improve cognitive deficits in DS.},

We performed spatial enhanced resolution omics sequencing (Stereo-seq) to capture spatially resolved single-cell transcriptomes of axolotl telencephalon sections during development and regeneration. Annotated cell types exhibited distinct spatial distribution, molecular features, and functions. We identified an injury-induced ependymoglial cell cluster at the wound site as a progenitor cell population for the potential replenishment of lost neurons, through a cell state transition process resembling neurogenesis during development. Transcriptome comparisons indicated that these induced cells may originate from local resident ependymoglial cells. We further uncovered spatially defined neurons at the lesion site that may regress to an immature neuron–like state. Our work establishes spatial transcriptome profiles of an anamniote tetrapod brain and decodes potential neurogenesis from ependymoglial cells for development and regeneration, thus providing mechanistic insights into vertebrate brain regeneration.},

We identified glutamatergic neurons with similarities to amniote neurons of hippocampus, dorsal and lateral cortex, and conserved γ-aminobutyric acid–releasing (GABAergic) neuron classes. We inferred transcriptional dynamics and gene regulatory relationships of postembryonic, region-specific neurogenesis and unraveled conserved differentiation signatures. After brain injury, ependymoglia activate an injury-specific state before reestablishing lost neuron populations and axonal connections.

To reconstruct forebrain evolution in tetrapods, we built a cell-type atlas of the telencephalon of the salamander Pleurodeles waltl . Our molecular, developmental, and connectivity data indicate that parts of the sauropsid DVR trace back to tetrapod ancestors. By contrast, the salamander dorsal pallium is devoid of cellular and molecular characteristics of the mammalian neocortex yet shares similarities with the entorhinal cortex and subiculum. Our findings chart the series of innovations that resulted in the emergence of the mammalian six-layered neocortex and the sauropsid DVR.},

The rules and constraints underlying the evolution of neuron types, however, remain poorly understood. To compare neuron types across brain regions and species, we generated a cell type atlas of the brain of a bearded dragon and compared it with mouse datasets. Conserved classes of neurons could be identified from the expression of hundreds of genes, including homeodomain-type transcription factors and genes involved in connectivity. Within these classes, however, there are both conserved and divergent neuron types, precluding a simple categorization of the brain into ancestral and novel areas. In the thalamus, neuronal diversification correlates with the evolution of the cortex, suggesting that developmental origin and circuit allocation are drivers of neuronal identity and evolution.},

However, 3D manufacturing of inorganic nanostructures typically requires nanomaterial-polymer composites and is limited by a photopolymerization mechanism, resulting in a reduction of material purity and degradation of intrinsic properties. We developed a polymerization-independent, laser direct writing technique called photoexcitation-induced chemical bonding. Without any additives, the holes excited inside semiconductor quantum dots are transferred to the nanocrystal surface and improve their chemical reactivity, leading to interparticle chemical bonding. As a proof of concept, we printed arbitrary 3D quantum dot architectures at a resolution beyond the diffraction limit. Our strategy will enable the manufacturing of free-form quantum dot optoelectronic devices such as light-emitting devices or photodetectors.},

A magnetic field transfers a ferromagnetic domain pattern into an identical ferroelectric domain pattern while erasing it at its magnetic origin. Reverse transfer completes the cycle.

  abstract     = {In most organisms, reproduction is correlated with shorter life span. However, the reproductive queen in eusocial insects exhibits a much longer life span than that of workers. In Harpegnathos ants, when the queen dies, workers can undergo an adult caste switch to reproductive pseudo-queens (gamergates), exhibiting a five-times prolonged life span. To explore the relation between reproduction and longevity, we compared gene expression during caste switching. Insulin expression is increased in the gamergate brain that correlates with increased lipid synthesis and production of vitellogenin in the fat body, both transported to the egg. This results from activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) branch of the insulin signaling pathway. By contrast, the production in the gamergate developing ovary of anti-insulin Imp-L2 leads to decreased signaling of the AKT/forkhead box O (FOXO) branch in the fat body, which is consistent with their extended longevity.},

  abstract     = {The hypothalamic–pituitary (HP) unit can produce various hormones to regulate immune responses, and some of its downstream hormones or effectors are elevated in cancer patients. We show that the HP unit can promote myelopoiesis and immunosuppression to accelerate tumor growth. Subcutaneous implantation of tumors induced hypothalamus activation and pituitary α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH) production in mice. α-MSH acted on bone marrow progenitors to promote myelopoiesis, myeloid cell accumulation, immunosuppression, and tumor growth through its melanocortin receptor MC5R. MC5R peptide antagonist boosted antitumor immunity and anti–programmed cell death protein 1 (anti–PD-1) immunotherapy. Serum α-MSH concentration was elevated and correlated with circulating myeloid-derived suppressor cells in cancer patients. Our results reveal a neuroendocrine pathway that suppresses tumor immunity and suggest MC5R as a potential target for cancer immunotherapy.},

We combine multiplexed CRISPRi screening with machine learning to define quantitative enhancer-enhancer interactions. We find that the ultralong distance enhancer network has a nested multilayer architecture that confers functional robustness of gene expression. Experimental characterization reveals that enhancer epistasis is maintained by three-dimensional chromosomal interactions and BRD4 condensation. Machine learning prediction of synergistic enhancers provides an effective strategy to identify noncoding variant pairs associated with pathogenic genes in diseases beyond genome-wide association studies analysis. Our work unveils nested epistasis enhancer networks, which can better explain enhancer functions within cells and in diseases.},

  abstract     = {Hydroxyl (OH) radicals are highly reactive species that can oxidize most pollutant gases. In this study, high concentrations of OH radicals were found when people were exposed to ozone in a climate-controlled chamber. OH concentrations calculated by two methods using measurements of total OH reactivity, speciated alkenes, and oxidation products were consistent with those obtained from a chemically explicit model. Key to establishing this human-induced oxidation field is 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one (6-MHO), which forms when ozone reacts with the skin-oil squalene and subsequently generates OH efficiently through gas-phase reaction with ozone. A dynamic model was used to show the spatial extent of the human-generated OH oxidation field and its dependency on ozone influx through ventilation. This finding has implications for the oxidation, lifetime, and perception of chemicals indoors and, ultimately, human health.},

We discerned the physical origins of fatigue strength in a large set of face-centered cubic, hexagonal close-packed, and body-centered cubic metallic materials by considering cyclic deformation processes at nanometer resolution over large volumes of individual materials at the earliest stages of cycling. We identified quantitative relations between the yield strength and the ultimate tensile strength, fatigue strength, and physical characteristics of early slip localization events. The fatigue strength of metallic alloys that deform by slip could be predicted by the amplitude of slip localization during the first cycle of loading. Our observations provide a physical basis for well-known empirical fatigue laws and enable a rapid method of predicting fatigue strength as reflected by measurement of slip localization amplitude.},

  abstract     = {By sequencing 727 ancient individuals from the Southern Arc (Anatolia and its neighbors in Southeastern Europe and West Asia) over 10,000 years, we contextualize its Chalcolithic period and Bronze Age (about 5000 to 1000 BCE), when extensive gene flow entangled it with the Eurasian steppe. Two streams of migration transmitted Caucasus and Anatolian/Levantine ancestry northward, and the Yamnaya pastoralists, formed on the steppe, then spread southward into the Balkans and across the Caucasus into Armenia, where they left numerous patrilineal descendants. Anatolia was transformed by intra–West Asian gene flow, with negligible impact of the later Yamnaya migrations. This contrasts with all other regions where Indo-European languages were spoken, suggesting that the homeland of the Indo-Anatolian language family was in West Asia, with only secondary dispersals of non-Anatolian Indo-Europeans from the steppe.},

Contemporary defaunation has reduced food web complexity, but simplification caused by past defaunation is difficult to reconstruct given the sparse paleorecord of predator-prey interactions. We identified changes to terrestrial mammal food webs globally over the past ~130,000 years using extinct and extant mammal traits, geographic ranges, observed predator-prey interactions, and deep learning models. Food webs underwent steep regional declines in complexity through loss of food web links after the arrival and expansion of human populations. We estimate that defaunation has caused a 53\% decline in food web links globally. Although extinctions explain much of this effect, range losses for extant species degraded food webs to a similar extent, highlighting the potential for food web restoration via extant species recovery.},

We report the development of interconnected and structurally integrated carbon tube grid–based electric double-layer capacitors with high areal capacitance and rapid frequency response. These capacitors exhibit excellent line filtering of 120-hertz voltage signal and volumetric advantages under low-voltage operations for digital circuits, portable electronics, and electrical appliances. These findings provide a sound technological basis for developing electric double-layer capacitors for miniaturizing filter and power devices.},

We harnessed the head direction (HD) system of the mouse thalamus, a neuronal population whose activity reports, in awake mice, their actual HD as they explore their environment and, in sleeping mice, their virtual HD. We discovered that the direction and amplitude of rapid eye movements during REM sleep reveal the direction and amplitude of the ongoing changes in virtual HD. Thus, rapid eye movements disclose gaze shifts in the virtual world of REM sleep, thereby providing a window into the cognitive processes of the sleeping brain.},

  abstract     = {One of the key insights of non-Hermitian photonics is that well-established concepts such as the laser can be operated in reverse to realize a coherent perfect absorber (CPA). Although conceptually appealing, such CPAs are limited so far to a single, judiciously shaped wavefront or mode. Here, we demonstrate how this limitation can be overcome by time-reversing a degenerate cavity laser based on a unique cavity that self-images any incident light field onto itself. Placing a weak, critically coupled absorber into this cavity, any incoming wavefront, even a complex and dynamically varying speckle pattern, is absorbed with close to perfect efficiency in a massively parallel interference process. These characteristics open up interesting new possibilities for applications in light harvesting, energy delivery, light control, and imaging.},

  abstract     = {Quantum state engineering, the cornerstone of quantum photonic technologies, mainly relies on spontaneous parametric downconversion and four-wave mixing, where one or two pump photons spontaneously decay into a photon pair. Both of these nonlinear effects require momentum conservation for the participating photons, which strongly limits the versatility of the resulting quantum states. Nonlinear metasurfaces have subwavelength thickness and allow the relaxation of this constraint; when combined with resonances, they greatly expand the possibilities of quantum state engineering. Here, we generated entangled photons via spontaneous parametric downconversion in semiconductor metasurfaces with high–quality factor, quasi-bound state in the continuum resonances. By enhancing the quantum vacuum field, our metasurfaces boost the emission of nondegenerate entangled photons within multiple narrow resonance bands and over a wide spectral range. A single resonance or several resonances in the same sample, pumped at multiple wavelengths, can generate multifrequency quantum states, including cluster states. These features reveal metasurfaces as versatile sources of complex states for quantum information.},

Analogous to atomic many-body systems, one of the crucial ingredients is the ability to precisely control the interactions between particles. However, the optical interactions studied thus far only provide conservative optical binding forces of limited tunability. In this work, we exploit the phase coherence between the optical fields that drive the light-induced dipole-dipole interaction to couple two nanoparticles. In addition, we effectively switch off the optical interaction and observe electrostatic coupling between charged particles. Our results provide a route to developing fully programmable many-body systems of interacting nanoparticles with tunable nonreciprocal interactions, which are instrumental for exploring entanglement and topological phases in arrays of levitated nanoparticles.},

Understanding the role of irregularity in determining material properties offers a new path to engineer materials with superior functionalities, such as imperfection insensitivity, enhanced impact absorption, and stress redirection. We uncover fundamental, probabilistic structure–property relationships using a growth-inspired program that evokes the formation of stochastic architectures in natural systems. This virtual growth program imposes a set of local rules on a limited number of basic elements. It generates materials that exhibit a large variation in functional properties starting from very limited initial resources, which echoes the diversity of biological systems. We identify basic rules to control mechanical properties by independently varying the microstructure’s topology and geometry in a general, graph-based representation of irregular materials.},

  abstract     = {Understanding the circumstances that lead to pandemics is important for their prevention. We analyzed the genomic diversity of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) early in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. We show that SARS-CoV-2 genomic diversity before February 2020 likely comprised only two distinct viral lineages, denoted “A” and “B.” Phylodynamic rooting methods, coupled with epidemic simulations, reveal that these lineages were most probably the result of at least two separate cross-species transmission events into humans. The first zoonotic transmission likely involved lineage B viruses around 18 November 2019 (23 October to 8 December), and the separate introduction of lineage A likely occurred within weeks of this event. These findings indicate that it is unlikely that SARS-CoV-2 circulated widely in humans before November 2019 and define the narrow window between when SARS-CoV-2 first jumped into humans and when the first cases of COVID-19 were reported. As with other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 emergence likely resulted from multiple zoonotic events.},

  abstract     = {Understanding how severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in 2019 is critical to preventing future zoonotic outbreaks before they become the next pandemic. The Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, China, was identified as a likely source of cases in early reports, but later this conclusion became controversial. We show here that the earliest known COVID-19 cases from December 2019, including those without reported direct links, were geographically centered on this market. We report that live SARS-CoV-2–susceptible mammals were sold at the market in late 2019 and that within the market, SARS-CoV-2–positive environmental samples were spatially associated with vendors selling live mammals. Although there is insufficient evidence to define upstream events, and exact circumstances remain obscure, our analyses indicate that the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 occurred through the live wildlife trade in China and show that the Huanan market was the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic.},

Mycenaean period elites in Greece did not differ from the general population and included both people with some steppe ancestry and others, like the Griffin Warrior, without it. Similarly, people in the central area of the Urartian Kingdom around Lake Van lacked the steppe ancestry characteristic of the kingdom’s northern provinces. Anatolia exhibited extraordinary continuity down to the Roman and Byzantine periods, with its people serving as the demographic core of much of the Roman Empire, including the city of Rome itself. During medieval times, migrations associated with Slavic and Turkic speakers profoundly affected the region.},

The 2006 Nature paper discussed in the Letter—only one of nearly two dozen papers now in doubt—was cited at least 90 times annually as recently as 2021, according to Springer Nature. Over the past 5 years, Cummings and Selkoe continued to cite it and other work by Lesné on the amyloid-b (Aβ) Aβ*56 molecule. The story’s assertion that the suspect work may have misdirected other Alzheimer’s research was not ours alone; multiple experts in the field told us that it jump-started the search for soluble forms of amyloid-β that might explain neuron death and cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s. Those efforts have not yielded any effective therapies to date. As for the broader amyloid hypothesis, to which both authors have devoted decades of effort, it does not depend on Lesné’s work, and our story quotes Selkoe to that effect. But the doubts about work that once seemed a milestone in the effort to link amyloid to cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s are surely a setback for the field.},

In cells, glycoprotein nonmetastatic melanoma protein B (GPNMB) coimmunoprecipitated and colocalized with α-synuclein (aSyn). In induced pluripotent stem cell–derived neurons, loss of GPNMB resulted in loss of ability to internalize aSyn fibrils and develop aSyn pathology. In 731 PD and 59 control biosamples, GPNMB was elevated in PD plasma, associating with disease severity. Thus, GPNMB represents a PD risk gene with potential for biomarker development and therapeutic targeting.},

In this study, we used massively parallel reporter assays to screen 5706 variants identified from genome-wide association studies for both Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), identifying 320 functional regulatory variants (frVars) across 27 loci, including the complex 17q21.31 region. We identified and validated multiple risk loci using CRISPR interference or excision, including complement 4 ( C4A ) and APOC1 in AD and PLEKHM1 and KANSL1 in PSP. Functional variants disrupt transcription factor binding sites converging on enhancers with cell type–specific activity in PSP and AD, implicating a neuronal SP1-driven regulatory network in PSP pathogenesis. These analyses suggest that noncoding genetic risk is driven by common genetic variants through their aggregate activity on specific transcriptional programs.},

We show that the large number of Omicron sublineage spike mutations leads to enhanced angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) binding, reduced fusogenicity, and severe dampening of plasma neutralizing activity elicited by infection or seven clinical vaccines relative to the ancestral virus. Administration of a homologous or heterologous booster based on the Wuhan-Hu-1 spike sequence markedly increased neutralizing antibody titers and breadth against BA.1, BA.2, BA.2.12.1, BA.4, and BA.5 across all vaccines evaluated. Our data suggest that although Omicron sublineages evade polyclonal neutralizing antibody responses elicited by primary vaccine series, vaccine boosters may provide sufficient protection against Omicron-induced severe disease.},

To leverage the computational power of these walks, it is important to be able to programmably modify the graph a walker traverses while maintaining coherence. We do this by combining the fast, programmable control provided by optical tweezers with the scalable, homogeneous environment of an optical lattice. With these tools we study continuous-time quantum walks of single atoms on a square lattice and perform proof-of-principle demonstrations of spatial search with these walks. When scaled to more particles, the capabilities demonstrated can be extended to study a variety of problems in quantum information science, including performing more effective versions of spatial search using a larger graph with increased connectivity.},

We determined the cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of human IgG-BCR and IgM-BCR, which consist of membrane-bound immunoglobulin molecules (mIg) and Igα/β subunits at a 1:1 stoichiometry. Assembly of both BCR complexes involves their extracellular domains, membrane-proximal connection peptides, and transmembrane (TM) helices. The TM helices of mIgG and mIgM share a conserved set of hydrophobic and polar interactions with Igα/β TM helices. By contrast, the IgG-Cγ3 and IgM-Cμ4 domains interact with extracellular Ig-like domains of Igα/β through head-to-tail and side-by-side modes, respectively. This work reveals the structural basis for BCR assembly and provides insights into BCR triggering.},

The ectodomains of the heavy chains closely stack against those of Igα/Igβ, with one heavy chain locked between Igα and Igβ in the juxtamembrane region. Extracellular interactions may determine isotype specificity of the BCR. The transmembrane helices of IgM-BCR form a four-helix bundle that appears to be conserved among all BCR isotypes. This structure contains 14 glycosylation sites on the IgM-BCR ectodomains and reveals three potential surface binding sites.

Interparticle sintering was used to engineer kinetic barriers in the phase transformation to produce ambient-pressure metastable rock-salt structures in a controllable manner. Interconnected nanocrystal networks were identified as an essential structure that hosted metastable high-energy phases at ambient conditions. These findings suggest general rules for transformation-barrier engineering that are useful in the rational design of next-generation materials.},

We report a series of high-performance p-type ductile thermoelectric materials based on the composition-performance phase diagram in AgCu(Se,S,Te) pseudoternary solid solutions, with high figure-of-merit values (0.45 at 300 kelvin and 0.68 at 340 kelvin) compared with other flexible thermoelectric materials. We further demonstrate thin and flexible π-shaped devices with a maximum normalized power density that reaches 30 μW cm −2 K −2 . This output is promising for the use of flexible thermoelectrics in wearable electronics.},

  abstract     = {Crop leaves in full sunlight dissipate damaging excess absorbed light energy as heat. This protective dissipation continues after the leaf transitions to shade, reducing crop photosynthesis. A bioengineered acceleration of this adjustment increased photosynthetic efficiency and biomass in tobacco in the field. But could that also translate to increased yield in a food crop? Here we bioengineered the same change into soybean. In replicated field trials, photosynthetic efficiency in fluctuating light was higher and seed yield in five independent transformation events increased by up to 33\%. Despite increased seed quantity, seed protein and oil content were unaltered. This validates increasing photosynthetic efficiency as a much needed strategy toward sustainably increasing crop yield in support of future global food security.},

  abstract     = {Whereas sensory perception relies on specialized sensory pathways, it is unclear whether these pathways originate as modality-specific circuits. We demonstrated that somatosensory and visual circuits are not by default segregated but require the earliest retinal activity to do so. In the embryo, somatosensory and visual circuits are intermingled in the superior colliculus, leading to cortical multimodal responses to whisker pad stimulation. At birth, these circuits segregate, and responses switch to unimodal. Blocking stage I retinal waves prolongs the multimodal configuration into postnatal life, with the superior colliculus retaining a mixed somato-visual molecular identity and defects arising in the spatial organization of the visual system. Hence, the superior colliculus mediates the timely segregation of sensory modalities in an input-dependent manner, channeling specific sensory cues to their appropriate sensory pathway.},

Whereas current PFAS destruction strategies use nonselective destruction mechanisms, we found that perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs) could be mineralized through a sodium hydroxide–mediated defluorination pathway. PFCA decarboxylation in polar aprotic solvents produced reactive perfluoroalkyl ion intermediates that degraded to fluoride ions (78 to ~100\%) within 24 hours. The carbon-containing intermediates and products were inconsistent with oft-proposed one-carbon-chain shortening mechanisms, and we instead computationally identified pathways consistent with many experiments. Degradation was also observed for branched perfluoroalkyl ether carboxylic acids and might be extended to degrade other PFAS classes as methods to activate their polar headgroups are identified.},

  abstract     = {Organisms use energy to grow and reproduce, so the processes of energy metabolism and biological production should be tightly bound. On the basis of this tenet, we developed and tested a new theory that predicts the relationships among three fundamental aspects of life: metabolic rate, growth, and reproduction. We show that the optimization of these processes yields the observed allometries of metazoan life, particularly metabolic scaling. We conclude that metabolism, growth, and reproduction are inextricably linked; that together they determine fitness; and, in contrast to longstanding dogma, that no single component drives another. Our model predicts that anthropogenic change will cause animals to evolve decreased scaling exponents of metabolism, increased growth rates, and reduced lifetime reproductive outputs, with worrying consequences for the replenishment of future populations.},

The availability of large-scale seismic datasets and the suitability of deep-learning techniques for seismic data processing have pushed deep learning to the forefront of fundamental, long-standing research investigations in seismology. However, some aspects of applying deep learning to seismology are likely to prove instructive for the geosciences, and perhaps other research areas more broadly. Deep learning is a powerful approach, but there are subtleties and nuances in its application. We present a systematic overview of trends, challenges, and opportunities in applications of deep-learning methods in seismology.},

Although the roles of NLRs in eukaryotic immunity are well established, it is unknown whether prokaryotes use similar defense mechanisms. Here, we show that antiviral STAND (Avs) homologs in bacteria and archaea detect hallmark viral proteins, triggering Avs tetramerization and the activation of diverse N-terminal effector domains, including DNA endonucleases, to abrogate infection. Cryo–electron microscopy reveals that Avs sensor domains recognize conserved folds, active-site residues, and enzyme ligands, allowing a single Avs receptor to detect a wide variety of viruses. These findings extend the paradigm of pattern recognition of pathogen-specific proteins across all three domains of life.},

Here, we report that the RNA binding protein FXR1, a member of the fragile X–related (FXR) family, is highly expressed in late spermatids and undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) to merge messenger ribonucleoprotein granules with the translation machinery to convert stored mRNAs into a translationally activated state. Germline-specific Fxr1 ablation in mice impaired the translation of target mRNAs and caused defective spermatid development and male infertility, and a phase separation–deficient FXR1 L351P mutation in Fxr1 knock-in mice produced the same developmental defect. These findings uncover a mechanism for translational reprogramming with LLPS as a key driver in spermiogenesis.},

Spontaneous inelastic scattering produces intracavity photons coincident with energy-shifted electrons, which we employ for noise-suppressed optical mode imaging.

Our results show that rates of introgression between species decrease with time since divergence and suggest that species must attain a threshold of evolutionary divergence before hybridization results in transitions to unisexuality. Rates of hybridization also predict genome-wide patterns of genetic diversity in whiptail lizards.

Traditionally, this is accomplished with surface-modifying chemical agents. Using experiment and theory, we studied how mechanical activity shapes soft interfaces that separate an active and a passive fluid. Chaotic flows in the active fluid give rise to giant interfacial fluctuations and noninertial propagating active waves. At high activities, stresses disrupt interface continuity and drive droplet generation, producing an emulsion-like active state composed of finite-sized droplets. When in contact with a solid boundary, active interfaces exhibit nonequilibrium wetting transitions, in which the fluid climbs the wall against gravity. These results demonstrate the promise of mechanically driven interfaces for creating a new class of soft active matter.},

These movements are relatively well understood at a population level, but how individual insects achieve them remains elusive. Behavioral responses to conditions en route are little studied, primarily owing to the challenges of tracking individual insects. Using a light aircraft and individual radio tracking, we show that nocturnally migrating death’s-head hawkmoths maintain control of their flight trajectories over long distances. The moths did not just fly with favorable tailwinds; during a given night, they also adjusted for head and crosswinds to precisely hold course. This behavior indicates that the moths use a sophisticated internal compass to maintain seasonally beneficial migratory trajectories independent of wind conditions, illuminating how insects traverse long distances to take advantage of seasonal resources.},

To understand speech evolution, we examined a wide range of primates, combining observations of phonation with mathematical modeling. We found that source stability relies upon simplifications in laryngeal anatomy, specifically the loss of air sacs and vocal membranes. We conclude that the evolutionary loss of vocal membranes allows human speech to mostly avoid the spontaneous nonlinear phenomena and acoustic chaos common in other primate vocalizations. This loss allows our larynx to produce stable, harmonic-rich phonation, ideally highlighting formant changes that convey most phonetic information. Paradoxically, the increased complexity of human spoken language thus followed simplification of our laryngeal anatomy.},

Combined experiments and theoretical modeling suggest that the key mechanism is US-induced cavitation, which propels and immobilizes anchoring primers into tissues with mitigated barrier effects. Our strategy achieves spatial patterning of tough bioadhesion, on-demand detachment, and transdermal drug delivery.

Direct excitation of phenol-pyridine would have required ~330-nm light, but the coupled proton transfer within the phenol-pyridine unit lowered its excited-state energy so that it could accept excitation energy from anthracene. Singlet-singlet energy transfer thus occurred despite the lack of spectral overlap between the anthracene ﬂuorescence and the phenol-pyridine absorption. Moreover, theoretical calculations indicated negligible charge transfer between the anthracene and phenol-pyridine units.

  abstract     = {In a move heralded by conservationists and tech policy reformists alike, Brazil’s environmental regulatory agency has penalized Meta, the parent company of Facebook and WhatsApp, for failing to remove thousands of online posts that had been flagged for selling illegal wildlife (1). The ∼US$2 million fine will not materially affect the world’s largest social media company, which in 2021 earned more than US$117 billion in global revenue (2), but it was nonetheless an important salvo in the fight to hold Meta responsible for vast amounts of illegal wildlife trading occurring on its platforms (3). To the best of our knowledge, the July ruling marked the first time any tech company has been sanctioned for hosting wildlife crime. The decision should set a precedent for holding tech companies accountable.},

Cattle ranching is an ever-increasing threat to the Pantanal (3, 4), and a new bill has just been approved by the state of Mato Grasso that will open the protected portions of ranches within the Pantanal to use for livestock. If the policies in this bill are implemented, the changes will be devastating to the Pantanal’s biodiversity and ecosystems.},

We compared immune responses elicited by mosaic-8 (SARS-CoV-2 and seven animal sarbecoviruses) and homotypic (only SARS-CoV-2) RBD nanoparticles in mice and macaques and observed stronger responses elicited by mosaic-8 to mismatched (not on nanoparticles) strains, including SARS-CoV and animal sarbecoviruses. Mosaic-8 immunization showed equivalent neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 variants, including Omicrons, and protected from SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV challenges, whereas homotypic SARS-CoV-2 immunization protected only from SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Epitope mapping demonstrated increased targeting of conserved epitopes after mosaic-8 immunization. Together, these results suggest that mosaic-8 RBD nanoparticles could protect against SARS-CoV-2 variants and future sarbecovirus spillovers.},

Using single-nucleus RNA sequencing, we characterized the transcriptome of 880,000 nuclei from 18 control and 61 failing, nonischemic human hearts with pathogenic variants in DCM and ACM genes or idiopathic disease. We performed genotype-stratified analyses of the ventricular cell lineages and transcriptional states. The resultant DCM and ACM ventricular cell atlas demonstrated distinct right and left ventricular responses, highlighting genotype-associated pathways, intercellular interactions, and differential gene expression at single-cell resolution. Together, these data illuminate both shared and distinct cellular and molecular architectures of human heart failure and suggest candidate therapeutic targets.},

  abstract     = {Drosophila melanogaster is a powerful, long-standing model for metazoan development and gene regulation. We profiled chromatin accessibility in almost 1 million and gene expression in half a million nuclei from overlapping windows spanning the entirety of embryogenesis. Leveraging developmental asynchronicity within embryo collections, we applied deep neural networks to infer the age of each nucleus, resulting in continuous, multimodal views of molecular and cellular transitions in absolute time. We identify cell lineages; infer their developmental relationships; and link dynamic changes in enhancer usage, transcription factor (TF) expression, and the accessibility of TFs’ cognate motifs. With these data, the dynamics of enhancer usage and gene expression can be explored within and across lineages at the scale of minutes, including for precise transitions like zygotic genome activation.},

However, their morphology, size, and orientation are difficult to control because of their highly kinetic growth character. We report a methodology to achieve synchronous, uniaxial, and stepwise growth of micrometer-scale skeletal single crystals from planar-chiral double-decker molecules. Upon drop-casting of a heated ethanol solution onto a quartz substrate, the molecules spontaneously assemble into standing vessel-shaped single crystals uniaxially and synchronously over the wide area of the substrate, with small size polydispersity. The crystal edge is active even after consumption of the molecules and resumes stereoselective growth with successive feeding. The resultant morphology can be packed into polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon–like microarchitectures and behaves as a microscopic container.},

We report the observation of a limit cycle phase in a continuously pumped dissipative atom-cavity system that is characterized by emergent oscillations in the intracavity photon number. The phase of the oscillation was found to be random for different realizations, and hence, this dynamical many-body state breaks continuous time translation symmetry spontaneously. Furthermore, the observed limit cycles are robust against temporal perturbations and therefore demonstrate the realization of a continuous time crystal.},

Although we know that innate immune cells infiltrate the niche in response to injury, it remains unclear how MuSCs adapt to this altered environment for initiating repair. Here, we demonstrate that inflammatory cytokine signaling from the regenerative niche impairs the ability of quiescent MuSCs to reenter the cell cycle. The histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) demethylase JMJD3, but not UTX, allowed MuSCs to overcome inhibitory inflammation signaling by removing trimethylated H3K27 (H3K27me3) marks at the Has2 locus to initiate production of hyaluronic acid, which in turn established an extracellular matrix competent for integrating signals that direct MuSCs to exit quiescence. Thus, JMJD3-driven hyaluronic acid synthesis plays a proregenerative role that allows MuSC adaptation to inflammation and the initiation of muscle repair.},

Signaling nodes in a network displayed adaptive information processing, which led to heterogeneous growth factor responses and enabled nodes to capture partially nonredundant information about the cellular state. Collectively, as a multimodal percept this gives individual cells a large information processing capacity to accurately place growth factor concentration within the context of their cellular state and make cellular state–dependent decisions. Heterogeneity and complexity in signaling networks may have coevolved to enable specific and context-aware cellular decision-making in a multicellular setting.},

We combined 50 years of field observations of immigration and group demography with genomic data from ~9 generations of hybrid baboons to investigate the consequences of admixture in the wild. Despite no obvious fitness costs to hybrids, we found signatures of selection against admixture similar to those described for archaic hominins. These patterns were concentrated near genes where ancestry is strongly associated with gene expression. Our analyses also show that introgression is partially predictable across the genome. This study demonstrates the value of integrating genomic and field data for revealing how “genomic signatures of selection” (e.g., reduced introgression in low-recombination regions) manifest in nature; moreover, it underscores the importance of other primates as living models for human evolution.},

We show that, in Arabidopsis , this transition is driven by inhibition of translation, achieved by a mechanism that involves processing bodies (P-bodies). During the second meiotic division, the meiosis-specific protein THREE-DIVISION MUTANT 1 (TDM1) is incorporated into P-bodies through interaction with SUPPRESSOR WITH MORPHOGENETIC EFFECTS ON GENITALIA 7 (SMG7). TDM1 attracts eIF4F, the main translation initiation complex, temporarily sequestering it in P-bodies and inhibiting translation. The failure of tdm1 mutants to terminate meiosis can be overcome by chemical inhibition of translation. We propose that TDM1-containing P-bodies down-regulate expression of meiotic transcripts to facilitate transition of cell fates to postmeiotic gametophyte differentiation.},

Here, we show that GPR35 activation was necessary and sufficient for ischemic protection by KynA. When bound by KynA, GPR35 activated G i - and G 12/13 -coupled signaling and trafficked to the outer mitochondria membrane, where it bound, apparently indirectly, to ATP synthase inhibitory factor subunit 1 (ATPIF1). Activated GPR35, in an ATPIF1-dependent and pertussis toxin–sensitive manner, induced ATP synthase dimerization, which prevented ATP loss upon ischemia.

Recent studies show that plant diversity increases soil organic carbon (SOC) storage by elevating carbon inputs to belowground biomass and promoting microbial necromass contribution to SOC storage. Climate change affects grassland SOC storage by modifying the processes of plant carbon inputs and microbial catabolism and anabolism. Improved grazing management and biodiversity restoration can provide low-cost and/or high-carbon-gain options for natural climate solutions in global grasslands. The achievable SOC sequestration potential in global grasslands is 2.3 to 7.3 billion tons of carbon dioxide equivalents per year (CO 2 e year −1 ) for biodiversity restoration, 148 to 699 megatons of CO 2 e year −1 for improved grazing management, and 147 megatons of CO 2 e year −1 for sown legumes in pasturelands.},

  abstract     = {Humans have cultivated grasses for food, feed, beverages, and construction materials for millennia. Grasses also dominate the landscape in vast parts of the world, where they have adapted morphologically and physiologically, diversifying to form ~12,000 species. Sequences of hundreds of grass genomes show that they are essentially collinear; nonetheless, not all species have the same complement of genes. Here, we focus on the molecular, cellular, and developmental bases of grain yield and dispersal—traits that are essential for domestication. Distinct genes, networks, and pathways were selected in different crop species, reflecting underlying genomic diversity. With increasing genomic resources becoming available in nondomesticated species, we anticipate advances in coming years that illuminate the ecological and economic success of the grasses.},

  abstract     = {Grasslands, which constitute almost 40\% of the terrestrial biosphere, provide habitat for a great diversity of animals and plants and contribute to the livelihoods of more than 1 billion people worldwide. Whereas the destruction and degradation of grasslands can occur rapidly, recent work indicates that complete recovery of biodiversity and essential functions occurs slowly or not at all. Grassland restoration—interventions to speed or guide this recovery—has received less attention than restoration of forested ecosystems, often due to the prevailing assumption that grasslands are recently formed habitats that can reassemble quickly. Viewing grassland restoration as long-term assembly toward old-growth endpoints, with appreciation of feedbacks and threshold shifts, will be crucial for recognizing when and how restoration can guide recovery of this globally important ecosystem.},

Yet loss of primary forests continues all over the world, and governments have failed to protect them (4).

TIR-encoded nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide hydrolase (NADase) produces signaling molecules to promote exclusive EDS1-PAD4 and EDS1-SAG101 interactions with helper NLR subclasses. In this work, we show that TIR-containing proteins catalyze adenosine diphosphate (ADP)–ribosylation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and ADP ribose (ADPR) through ADPR polymerase–like and NADase activity, forming ADP-ribosylated ATP (ADPr-ATP) and ADPr-ADPR (di-ADPR), respectively. Specific binding of ADPr-ATP or di-ADPR allosterically promotes EDS1-SAG101 interaction with helper NLR N requirement gene 1A (NRG1A) in vitro and in planta. Our data reveal an enzymatic activity of TIRs that enables specific activation of the EDS1-SAG101-NRG1 immunity branch.},

  abstract     = {Plant nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat-containing (NLR) receptors with an N-terminal Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain sense pathogen effectors to enable TIR-encoded nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide hydrolase (NADase) activity for immune signaling. TIR-NLR signaling requires the helper NLRs N requirement gene 1 (NRG1), Activated Disease Resistance 1 (ADR1), and Enhanced Disease Susceptibility 1 (EDS1), which forms a heterodimer with each of its paralogs Phytoalexin Deficient 4 (PAD4) and Senescence-Associated Gene 101 (SAG101). Here, we show that TIR-containing proteins catalyze the production of 2′-(5′′-phosphoribosyl)-5′-adenosine monophosphate (pRib-AMP) and diphosphate (pRib-ADP) in vitro and in planta. Biochemical and structural data demonstrate that EDS1-PAD4 is a receptor complex for pRib-AMP and pRib-ADP, which allosterically promote EDS1-PAD4 interaction with ADR1-L1 but not NRG1A. Our study identifies TIR-catalyzed pRib-AMP and pRib-ADP as a missing link in TIR signaling through EDS1-PAD4 and as likely second messengers for plant immunity.},

  abstract     = {In the 20th century, researchers studying animal and plant signaling pathways discovered a protein domain that is shared across diverse innate immune systems: the Toll/interleukin-1/resistance gene (TIR) domain. The TIR domain is found in several protein architectures and was defined as an adaptor that mediates protein-protein interactions in animal innate immunity and developmental signaling pathways. However, studies of nerve degeneration in animals—and subsequent breakthroughs in plant, bacterial, and archaeal systems—revealed that TIR domains possess enzymatic activities. We provide a synthesis of TIR functions and the role of various related TIR enzymatic products in evolutionarily diverse immune systems. These studies may ultimately guide interventions that would span the tree of life, from treating human neurodegenerative disorders and bacterial infections to preventing plant diseases.},

The base of the cilium contains a selective barrier that regulates the entry of large intraflagellar transport (IFT) trains, which carry cargo proteins required for ciliary assembly and maintenance. However, the native architecture of the ciliary base and the process of IFT train assembly remain unresolved. In this work, we used in situ cryo–electron tomography to reveal native structures of the transition zone region and assembling IFT trains at the ciliary base in Chlamydomonas . We combined this direct cellular visualization with ultrastructure expansion microscopy to describe the front-to-back stepwise assembly of IFT trains: IFT-B forms the backbone, onto which bind IFT-A, dynein-1b, and finally kinesin-2 before entry into the cilium.},

Scaling analyses of ionic transport and charge-transfer reaction rates point to operation in the nonlinear regime, where extreme electric fields are present within the solid electrolyte and its interfaces. In this work, we generated silicon-compatible nanoscale protonic programmable resistors with highly desirable characteristics under extreme electric fields. This operation regime enabled controlled shuttling and intercalation of protons in nanoseconds at room temperature in an energy-efficient manner. The devices showed symmetric, linear, and reversible modulation characteristics with many conductance states covering a 20× dynamic range. Thus, the space-time-energy performance of the all–solid-state artificial synapses can greatly exceed that of their biological counterparts.},

However, keeping modification sites in registration with a nanotube lattice is challenging. We report a solution using DNA-directed, guanine (G)-specific cross-linking chemistry. Through DNA screening we identify a sequence, C 3 GC 7 GC 3 , whose reaction with an (8,3) enantiomer yields minimum disorder-induced Raman mode intensities and photoluminescence Stokes shift, suggesting ordered defect array formation. Single-particle cryo–electron microscopy shows that the C 3 GC 7 GC 3 functionalized (8,3) has an ordered helical structure with a 6.5 angstroms periodicity. Reaction mechanism analysis suggests that the helical periodicity arises from an array of G-modified carbon-carbon bonds separated by a fixed distance along an armchair helical line.

By analyzing globally distributed contemporary data, we found that marsh sediment accretion increases in parity with sea level rise, seemingly confirming previously claimed marsh resilience. However, subsidence of the substrate shows a nonlinear increase with accretion. As a result, marsh elevation gain is constrained in relation to sea level rise, and deficits emerge that are consistent with Holocene observations of tidal marsh vulnerability.},

Hypermutability was associated with age and damaging mutations in genes implicated in cancers and, in some brains, reflected in vivo clonal expansions. Somatic duplications, likely arising during development, were found in ~5\% of normal and diseased brains, reflecting background mutagenesis. Brains with autism were associated with mutations creating putative transcription factor binding motifs in enhancer-like regions in the developing brain.

These agents deposit a dynamic DNA lesion that can be reversed by MGMT but slowly evolves into an interstrand cross-link in MGMT-deficient settings, resulting in MMR-independent cell death with low toxicity in vitro and in vivo.

Conventional doping of spiro-OMeTAD with hygroscopic lithium salts and volatile 4- tert -butylpyridine is a time-consuming process and also leads to poor device stability. We developed a new doping strategy for spiro-OMeTAD that avoids post-oxidation by using stable organic radicals as the dopant and ionic salts as the doping modulator (referred to as ion-modulated radical doping). We achieved PCEs of &gt;25\% and much-improved device stability under harsh conditions. The radicals provide hole polarons that instantly increase the conductivity and work function (WF), and ionic salts further modulate the WF by affecting the energetics of the hole polarons. This organic semiconductor doping strategy, which decouples conductivity and WF tunability, could inspire further optimization in other optoelectronic devices.},

We developed a massively parallel screen that leverages barcoded, pooled cancer cell lines annotated with multiomic data to investigate cell association patterns across a nanoparticle library spanning a range of formulations with clinical potential. We identified both materials properties and cell-intrinsic features that mediate nanoparticle-cell association. Using machine learning algorithms, we constructed genomic nanoparticle trafficking networks and identified nanoparticle-specific biomarkers. We validated one such biomarker: gene expression of SLC46A3 , which inversely predicts lipid-based nanoparticle uptake in vitro and in vivo. Our work establishes the power of integrated screens for nanoparticle delivery and enables the identification and utilization of biomarkers to rationally design nanoformulations.},

  abstract     = {Many pathogens exploit host cell-surface glycans. However, precise analyses of glycan ligands binding with heavily modified pathogen proteins can be confounded by overlapping sugar signals and/or compounded with known experimental constraints. Universal saturation transfer analysis (uSTA) builds on existing nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to provide an automated workflow for quantitating protein-ligand interactions. uSTA reveals that early-pandemic, B-origin-lineage severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike trimer binds sialoside sugars in an “end-on” manner. uSTA-guided modeling and a high-resolution cryo–electron microscopy structure implicate the spike N-terminal domain (NTD) and confirm end-on binding. This finding rationalizes the effect of NTD mutations that abolish sugar binding in SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. Together with genetic variance analyses in early pandemic patient cohorts, this binding implicates a sialylated polylactosamine motif found on tetraantennary N-linked glycoproteins deep in the human lung as potentially relevant to virulence and/or zoonosis.},

Here, by screening candidate photosynthesis-related transcription factors in rice, we identified a DREB (Dehydration Responsive Element Binding) family member, OsDREB1C, in which expression is induced by both light and low nitrogen status. We show that OsDREB1C drives functionally diverse transcriptional programs determining photosynthetic capacity, nitrogen utilization, and flowering time. Field trials with OsDREB1C -overexpressing rice revealed yield increases of 41.3 to 68.3\% and, in addition, shortened growth duration, improved nitrogen use efficiency, and promoted efficient resource allocation, thus providing a strategy toward achieving much-needed increases in agricultural productivity.},

  abstract     = {Semiconductors with high thermal conductivity and electron-hole mobility are of great importance for electronic and photonic devices as well as for fundamental studies. Among the ultrahigh–thermal conductivity materials, cubic boron arsenide (c-BAs) is predicted to exhibit simultaneously high electron and hole mobilities of &gt;1000 centimeters squared per volt per second. Using the optical transient grating technique, we experimentally measured thermal conductivity of 1200 watts per meter per kelvin and ambipolar mobility of 1600 centimeters squared per volt per second at the same locations on c-BAs samples at room temperature despite spatial variations. Ab initio calculations show that lowering ionized and neutral impurity concentrations is key to achieving high mobility and high thermal conductivity, respectively. The high ambipolar mobilities combined with the ultrahigh thermal conductivity make c-BAs a promising candidate for next-generation electronics.},

  abstract     = {Semiconducting cubic boron arsenide (c-BAs) has been predicted to have carrier mobility of 1400 square centimeters per volt-second for electrons and 2100 square centimeters per volt-second for holes at room temperature. Using pump-probe transient reflectivity microscopy, we monitored the diffusion of photoexcited carriers in single-crystal c-BAs to obtain their mobility. With near-bandgap 600-nanometer pump pulses, we found a high ambipolar mobility of 1550 ± 120 square centimeters per volt-second, in good agreement with theoretical prediction. Additional experiments with 400-nanometer pumps on the same spot revealed a mobility of &gt;3000 square centimeters per volt-second, which we attribute to hot electrons. The observation of high carrier mobility, in conjunction with high thermal conductivity, enables an enormous number of device applications for c-BAs in high-performance electronics and optoelectronics.},

We compared these virological attributes of this new variant of concern (VOC) with those of the Delta (B.1.617.2) variant in a Syrian hamster model of COVID-19. Omicron-infected hamsters lost significantly less body weight and exhibited reduced clinical scores, respiratory tract viral burdens, cytokine and chemokine dysregulation, and lung damage than Delta-infected hamsters. Both variants were highly transmissible through contact transmission. In noncontact transmission studies Omicron demonstrated similar or higher transmissibility than Delta. Delta outcompeted Omicron without selection pressure, but this scenario changed once immune selection pressure with neutralizing antibodies—active against Delta but poorly active against Omicron—was introduced. Next-generation vaccines and antivirals effective against this new VOC are therefore urgently needed.},

We study theoretically the emission of light from a radiation source placed inside a PTC and find that radiation corresponding to the momentum bandgap is exponentially amplified, whether initiated by a macroscopic source, an atom, or vacuum fluctuations, drawing the amplification energy from the modulation. The radiation linewidth becomes narrower with time, eventually becoming monochromatic in the middle of the bandgap, which enables us to propose the concept of nonresonant tunable PTC laser. Finally, we find that the spontaneous decay rate of an atom embedded in a PTC vanishes at the band edge because of the low density of photonic states.},

  abstract     = {Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has evolved variants with substitutions in the spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) that affect its affinity for angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and recognition by antibodies. These substitutions could also shape future evolution by modulating the effects of mutations at other sites—a phenomenon called epistasis. To investigate this possibility, we performed deep mutational scans to measure the effects on ACE2 binding of all single–amino acid mutations in the Wuhan-Hu-1, Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Eta variant RBDs. Some substitutions, most prominently Asn 501 →Tyr (N501Y), cause epistatic shifts in the effects of mutations at other sites. These epistatic shifts shape subsequent evolutionary change—for example, enabling many of the antibody-escape substitutions in the Omicron RBD. These epistatic shifts occur despite high conservation of the overall RBD structure. Our data shed light on RBD sequence-function relationships and facilitate interpretation of ongoing SARS-CoV-2 evolution.},

We test contrasting predictions of these hypotheses by conducting a global comparative test of birds’ elevational range sizes within 31 montane regions, using more than 4.4 million citizen science records from eBird to define species’ elevational ranges in each region. We find strong support that competition, not climate, is the leading driver of narrow elevational ranges.

Here, we present a stereoselective synthesis of TTX that proceeds in 22 steps from a glucose derivative. The central cyclohexane ring of TTX and its α-tertiary amine moiety were established by the intramolecular 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of a nitrile oxide, followed by alkynyl addition to the resultant isoxazoline. A ruthenium-catalyzed hydroxylactonization set the stage for the formation of the dioxa-adamantane core. Installation of the guanidine, oxidation of a primary alcohol, and a late-stage epimerization gave a mixture of TTX and anhydro-TTX. This synthetic approach could give ready access to biologically active derivatives.},

We were able to shift the water-sorption equilibrium on the catalyst surface, leading to a greater proportion of free surface that in turn raised the rate of syngas conversion by nearly a factor of 2. The carbon monoxide conversion reached 63.5\%, and 71.4\% of the hydrocarbon products were light olefins at 250°C, outperforming poly(divinylbenzene)-free catalyst under equivalent reaction conditions.

Using forest and prairie ecotypes of deer mice ( Peromyscus maniculatus ), we characterized the genetic basis of variation in two defining traits—tail length and coat color—and discovered a 41-megabase chromosomal inversion linked to both. The inversion frequency is 90\% in the dark, long-tailed forest ecotype; decreases across a habitat transition; and is absent from the light, short-tailed prairie ecotype. We implicate divergent selection in maintaining the inversion at frequencies observed in the wild, despite high levels of gene flow, and explore fitness benefits that arise from suppressed recombination within the inversion. We uncover a key role for a large, previously uncharacterized inversion in the evolution and maintenance of classic mammalian ecotypes.},

Conventional methods contain many approximations that lack experimental validation. In practice, there are few reactions where sufficiently accurate experimental data exist to even allow meaningful comparisons to theory. Here, we present experimentally derived thermal rate constants for hydrogen atom recombination on platinum single-crystal surfaces, which are accurate enough to test established theoretical approximations. A quantum rate model is also presented, making possible a direct evaluation of the accuracy of commonly used approximations to adsorbate entropy. We find that neglecting the wave nature of adsorbed hydrogen atoms and their electronic spin degeneracy leads to a 10× to 1000× overestimation of the rate constant for temperatures relevant to heterogeneous catalysis. These quantum effects are also found to be important for nanoparticle catalysts.},

We investigated T and B cell immunity against B.1.1.529 in triple BioNTech BNT162b2 messenger RNA–vaccinated health care workers (HCWs) with different SARS-CoV-2 infection histories. B and T cell immunity against previous variants of concern was enhanced in triple-vaccinated individuals, but the magnitude of T and B cell responses against B.1.1.529 spike protein was reduced. Immune imprinting by infection with the earlier B.1.1.7 (Alpha) variant resulted in less durable binding antibody against B.1.1.529. Previously infection-naïve HCWs who became infected during the B.1.1.529 wave showed enhanced immunity against earlier variants but reduced nAb potency and T cell responses against B.1.1.529 itself. Previous Wuhan Hu-1 infection abrogated T cell recognition and any enhanced cross-reactive neutralizing immunity on infection with B.1.1.529.},

Its distinct temperature-adsorbate–dependent adsorption behavior enables full separation of p -, m -, and o -xylene isomers in both vapor and liquid phases. The delicate stimuli-responsive swelling of the structure imparts this porous material with exceptionally high flexibility and stability, well-balanced adsorption capacity, high selectivity, and fast kinetics at conditions mimicking industrial settings. This study may offer an alternative approach for energy-efficient and adsorption-based industrial xylene separation and purification processes.},

  abstract     = {Human NLRP1 (NACHT, LRR, and PYD domain-containing protein 1) is an innate immune sensor predominantly expressed in the skin and airway epithelium. Here, we report that human NLRP1 senses the ultraviolet B (UVB)- and toxin-induced ribotoxic stress response (RSR). Biochemically, RSR leads to the direct hyperphosphorylation of a human-specific disordered linker region of NLRP1 (NLRP1 DR ) by MAP3K20/ZAKα kinase and its downstream effector, p38. Mutating a single ZAKα phosphorylation site in NLRP1 DR abrogates UVB- and ribotoxin-driven pyroptosis in human keratinocytes. Moreover, fusing NLRP1 DR to CARD8, which is insensitive to RSR by itself, creates a minimal inflammasome sensor for UVB and ribotoxins. These results provide insight into UVB sensing by human skin keratinocytes, identify several ribotoxins as NLRP1 agonists, and establish inflammasome-driven pyroptosis as an integral component of the RSR.},

  abstract     = {Effective communication across brain areas requires distributed neuronal networks to dynamically synchronize or decouple their ongoing activity. GABA ergic interneurons lock ensembles to network oscillations, but there remain questions regarding how synchrony is actively disengaged to allow for new communication partners. We recorded the activity of identified interneurons in the CA1 hippocampus of awake mice. Neurogliaform cells (NGFCs)—which provide GABA ergic inhibition to distal dendrites of pyramidal cells—strongly coupled their firing to those gamma oscillations synchronizing local networks with cortical inputs. Rather than strengthening such synchrony, action potentials of NGFCs decoupled pyramidal cell activity from cortical gamma oscillations but did not reduce their firing nor affect local oscillations. Thus, NGFCs regulate information transfer by temporarily disengaging the synchrony without decreasing the activity of communicating networks.},

  abstract     = {Volatile elements are thought to have been delivered to Solar System terrestrial planets late in their formation through accretion of chondritic meteorites. Mars can provide information on inner Solar System volatile delivery during the earliest planet formation stages. We measured krypton isotopes in the martian meteorite Chassigny, representative of the planet’s interior. We found chondritic krypton isotope ratios, which imply early incorporation of chondritic volatiles. The atmosphere of Mars has different (solar-type) krypton isotope ratios, indicating that it is not a product of magma ocean outgassing or fractionation of interior volatiles. Atmospheric krypton instead originates from accretion of solar nebula gas after formation of the mantle but before nebular dissipation. Our observations contradict the common hypothesis that during planet formation, chondritic volatile delivery occurred after solar gas acquisition.},

  abstract     = {The nature of hydrated proton on solid surfaces is of vital importance in electrochemistry, proton channels, and hydrogen fuel cells but remains unclear because of the lack of atomic-scale characterization. We directly visualized Eigen- and Zundel-type hydrated protons within the hydrogen bonding water network on Au(111) and Pt(111) surfaces, using cryogenic qPlus-based atomic force microscopy under ultrahigh vacuum. We found that the Eigen cations self-assembled into monolayer structures with local order, and the Zundel cations formed long-range ordered structures stabilized by nuclear quantum effects. Two Eigen cations could combine into one Zundel cation accompanied with a simultaneous proton transfer to the surface. Moreover, we revealed that the Zundel configuration was preferred over the Eigen on Pt(111), and such a preference was absent on Au(111).},

We perform quantum simulations of the unitary dynamics of a U(1) symmetric gauge field theory and demonstrate emergent irreversible behavior. The highly constrained gauge theory dynamics are encoded in a one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard simulator, which couples fermionic matter fields through dynamical gauge fields. We investigated global quantum quenches and the equilibration to a steady state well approximated by a thermal ensemble. Our work may enable the investigation of elusive phenomena, such as Schwinger pair production and string breaking, and paves the way for simulating more complex, higher-dimensional gauge theories on quantum synthetic matter devices.},

Incorporating a two-dimensional (2D) Cs 2 PbI 2 Cl 2 capping layer between the perovskite active layer and hole-transport layer stabilizes the interface while increasing power conversion efficiency of the all-inorganic PSCs from 14.9 to 17.4\%. Devices with this 2D capping layer did not degrade at 35°C and required &gt;2100 hours at 110°C under constant illumination to degrade by 20\% of their initial efficiency.

A MgF x interlayer with thickness of ~1 nanometer at the perovskite/C 60 interface favorably adjusts the surface energy of the perovskite layer through thermal evaporation, which facilitates efficient electron extraction and displaces C 60 from the perovskite surface to mitigate nonradiative recombination. These effects enable a champion open-circuit voltage of 1.92 volts, an improved fill factor of 80.7\%, and an independently certified stabilized PCE of 29.3\% for a monolithic perovskite-silicon tandem solar cell ~1 square centimeter in area.

In this work, we demonstrate reversible and selective bond formation and dissociation promoted by tip-induced reduction-oxidation reactions on a surface. Molecular rearrangements leading to different constitutional isomers are selected by the polarity and magnitude of applied voltage pulses from the tip of a combined scanning tunneling and atomic force microscope. Characterization of voltage dependence of the reactions and determination of reaction rates demonstrate selectivity in constitutional isomerization reactions and provide insight into the underlying mechanisms. With support of density functional theory calculations, we find that the energy landscape of the isomers in different charge states is important to rationalize the selectivity. Tip-induced selective single-molecule reactions increase our understanding of redox chemistry and could lead to novel molecular machines.},

Cardiac macrophages lacking the Y chromosome exhibited polarization toward a more fibrotic phenotype, and treatment with a transforming growth factor β1–neutralizing antibody ameliorated cardiac dysfunction in mLOY mice. A prospective study revealed that mLOY in blood is associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease and heart failure–associated mortality. Together, these results indicate that hematopoietic mLOY causally contributes to fibrosis, cardiac dysfunction, and mortality in men.},

The bulk density of the displaced subsurface material was 500 to 700 kilograms per cubic meter, which is about half that of the whole asteroid.

Using human CRC samples and murine CRC models, we found that most γδ T cells in premalignant or nontumor colons exhibit cytotoxic markers, whereas tumor-infiltrating γδ T cells express a protumorigenic profile. These contrasting T cell profiles were associated with distinct T cell receptor (TCR)–Vγδ gene usage in both humans and mice. Longitudinal intersectional genetics and antibody-dependent strategies targeting murine γδ T cells enriched in the epithelium at steady state led to heightened tumor development, whereas targeting γδ subsets that accumulate during CRC resulted in reduced tumor growth. Our results uncover temporal pro- and antitumor roles for γδ T cell subsets.},

We used three-dimensional electron microscopy of mouse, macaque, and human cortical samples to study their cell type composition and synaptic circuit architecture. The 2.5-fold increase in interneurons in humans compared with mice was compensated by a change in axonal connection probabilities and therefore did not yield a commensurate increase in inhibitory-versus-excitatory synaptic input balance on human pyramidal cells. Rather, increased inhibition created an expanded interneuron-to-interneuron network, driven by an expansion of interneuron-targeting interneuron types and an increase in their synaptic selectivity for interneuron innervation. These constitute key neuronal network alterations in the human cortex.},

Here, we review a class of materials, known as “strange” metals, that can violate both of these principles. In strange metals, the change in slope of the resistivity as the mean free path drops below the lattice constant, or as T → 0, can be imperceptible, suggesting continuity between the charge carriers at low and high T . We focus on transport and spectroscopic data on candidate strange metals in an effort to isolate and identify a unifying physical principle. Special attention is paid to quantum criticality, Planckian dissipation, Mottness, and whether a new gauge principle is needed to account for the nonlocal transport seen in these materials.},

Instead, multimodal single-cell and spatial transcriptomics analyses and functional studies reveal that retinoic acid–related orphan receptor γt + (RORγt + ) γδ T cell–derived interleukin-17A (IL-17A) is necessary and sufficient to activate HIF1α. Protein kinase B (AKT) and extracellular signal–regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) signaling proximal of IL-17 receptor C (IL-17RC) activates mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and consequently HIF1α. The IL-17A–HIF1α axis drives glycolysis in wound front epithelia. Epithelial-specific loss of IL-17RC, HIF1α, or blockade of glycolysis derails repair. Our findings underscore the coupling of inflammatory, metabolic, and migratory programs to expedite epithelial healing and illuminate the immune cell–derived inputs in cellular adaptation to hypoxic stress during repair.},

DEs are often based on commercial acrylic and silicone elastomers. Acrylics require prestretching to achieve high actuation strains and lack processing flexibility. Silicones allow for processability and rapid response but produce much lower strains. In this work, a processable, high-performance dielectric elastomer (PHDE) with a bimodal network structure is synthesized, and its electromechanical properties are tailored by adjusting cross-linkers and hydrogen bonding within the elastomer network. The PHDE exhibits a maximum areal strain of 190\% and maintains strains higher than 110\% at 2 hertz without prestretching. A dry stacking process with high efficiency, scalability, and yield enables multilayer actuators that maintain the high actuation performance of single-layer films.},

Atypical chemokine receptors (ACKRs) are intrinsically biased GPCRs that engage β-arrestins but not G proteins, making them a model system for investigating the structural basis of β-arrestin recruitment. Here, we performed nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments on 13 CH 3 -ε–methionine–labeled ACKR3, revealing that β-arrestin recruitment is associated with conformational exchange at key regions of the extracellular ligand-binding pocket and intracellular β-arrestin–coupling region. NMR studies of ACKR3 mutants defective in β-arrestin recruitment identified an allosteric hub in the receptor core that coordinates transitions among heterogeneously populated and selected conformational states. Our data suggest that conformational selection guides β-arrestin recruitment by tuning receptor dynamics at intracellular and extracellular regions.},

It has long been hypothesized that the pharyngeal (branchial) arch evolved from an unjointed cartilaginous rod in vertebrate ancestors such as that in the nonvertebrate chordate amphioxus, but whether such ancestral anatomy existed remains unknown. The pharyngeal skeleton of controversial Cambrian animals called yunnanozoans may contain the oldest fossil evidence constraining the early evolution of the arches, yet its correlation with that of vertebrates is still disputed. By examining additional specimens in previously unexplored techniques (for example, x-ray microtomography, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, and energy dispersive spectrometry element mapping), we found evidence that yunnanozoan branchial arches consist of cellular cartilage with an extracellular matrix dominated by microfibrils, a feature hitherto considered specific to vertebrates. Our phylogenetic analysis provides further support that yunnanozoans are stem vertebrates.},

The co-assembly of the water-soluble benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxamide (BTA-EG 4 ) and a surfactant at a specific ratio yielded small-sized aggregates. These interactions were modeled using the competition between self-sorting and co-assembly of both components. The small-sized aggregates were transformed into supramolecular polymer networks by a twofold dilution in water without changing their ratio. Kinetic experiments show the in situ growth of micrometer-long fibers in the dilution process. We were able to create systems that undergo fully reversible hydrogel-solution-hydrogel-solution transitions upon dilution by introducing another orthogonal interaction.},

By increasing the entropy, the increased crystal symmetry delocalized the distribution of electrons in the distorted rhombohedral structure, resulting in band convergence and improved electrical properties. By contrast, the localized phonons from the entropy-induced disorder dampened the propagation of transverse phonons, which was the origin of the increased anharmonicity and largely depressed lattice thermal conductivity. We provide a paradigm for tuning electron and phonon localization by entropy manipulation, but we have also demonstrated a route for improving the performance of high-entropy thermoelectric materials.},

Intentionally depositing traces of platinum nanoparticles on the alumina binder or the outer surface of zeolite crystals, instead of inside the zeolite crystals, enhanced isomer selectivity without compromising activity. Separation between platinum and zeolite acid sites preserved the metal and acid functions by limiting micropore blockage by metal clusters and enhancing access to metal sites.

We discovered that analgesic effects of sound depended on a low (5-decibel) signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) relative to ambient noise in mice. Viral tracing, microendoscopic calcium imaging, and multitetrode recordings in freely moving mice showed that low-SNR sounds inhibited glutamatergic inputs from the auditory cortex (ACx Glu ) to the thalamic posterior (PO) and ventral posterior (VP) nuclei. Optogenetic or chemogenetic inhibition of the ACx Glu →PO and ACx Glu →VP circuits mimicked the low-SNR sound–induced analgesia in inflamed hindpaws and forepaws, respectively. Artificial activation of these two circuits abolished the sound-induced analgesia. Our study reveals the corticothalamic circuits underlying sound-promoted analgesia by deciphering the role of the auditory system in pain processing.},

  abstract     = {Gender-targeted police reforms are frequently proposed to tackle the global problem of rising yet under-reported gender-based violence (GBV)—but with mixed and often disappointing results. We explore this issue in India, a country with alarming rates of GBV and limited police capacity, by studying the impact of Women’s Help Desks (WHDs): dedicated spaces for women in local police stations, staffed by trained officers. Drawing on the largest randomized controlled trial of a police reform to date (180 police stations serving 23.4 million people), we find that officers in stations with WHDs are more likely to register cases of GBV, particularly where female officers run the desks. This suggests that even in resource-constrained and patriarchal environments, police responsiveness can be improved by focusing and mainstreaming attention to women’s cases and by greater gender representation within the police.},

  abstract     = {Two models describe solvent transport through swollen, nonporous membranes. The pore-flow model, based on fluid mechanics, works for porous membranes, whereas the solution-diffusion model invokes molecular diffusion to treat nonporous membranes. Both approaches make valid arguments for swollen polymer membranes, but they disagree in their predictions of intramembrane pressure and concentration profiles. Using a fluid-solid model that treats the solvent and membrane matrix as separate phases, we show both classical models to be valid, to represent complementary approaches to the same phenomenon, and to make identical predictions. The fluid-solid model clarifies recent reverse osmosis measurements; provides a predictive and mechanistic basis for empirical high-pressure limiting flux phenomena, in quantitative agreement with classic measurements; and gives a framework to treat nonporous but mechanically heterogeneous membrane materials.},

  abstract     = {Helical alignments within the heart’s musculature have been speculated to be important in achieving physiological pumping efficiencies. Testing this possibility is difficult, however, because it is challenging to reproduce the fine spatial features and complex structures of the heart’s musculature using current techniques. Here we report focused rotary jet spinning (FRJS), an additive manufacturing approach that enables rapid fabrication of micro/nanofiber scaffolds with programmable alignments in three-dimensional geometries. Seeding these scaffolds with cardiomyocytes enabled the biofabrication of tissue-engineered ventricles, with helically aligned models displaying more uniform deformations, greater apical shortening, and increased ejection fractions compared with circumferential alignments. The ability of FRJS to control fiber arrangements in three dimensions offers a streamlined approach to fabricating tissues and organs, with this work demonstrating how helical architectures contribute to cardiac performance.},

We present an automatically executable chemical reaction database of 100 molecules representative of the range of reactions found in contemporary organic synthesis. These reactions include transition metal–catalyzed coupling reactions, heterocycle formations, functional group interconversions, and multicomponent reactions. The chemical reaction codes or χDLs for the reactions have been stored in a database for version control, validation, collaboration, and data mining. Of these syntheses, more than 50 entries from the database have been downloaded and robotically run in seven modular chemputers with yields and purities comparable to those achieved by an expert chemist. We also demonstrate the automatic purification of a range of compounds using a chromatography module seamlessly coupled to the platform and programmed with the same language.},

  abstract     = {Changes in the composition of the gut microbiota are associated with many human diseases. So far, however, we have failed to define homeostasis or dysbiosis by the presence or absence of specific microbial species. The composition and function of the adult gut microbiota is governed by diet and host factors that regulate and direct microbial growth. The host delivers oxygen and nitrate to the lumen of the small intestine, which selects for bacteria that use respiration for energy production. In the colon, by contrast, the host limits the availability of oxygen and nitrate, which results in a bacterial community that specializes in fermentation for growth. Although diet influences microbiota composition, a poor diet weakens host control mechanisms that regulate the microbiota. Hence, quantifying host parameters that control microbial growth could help define homeostasis or dysbiosis and could offer alternative strategies to remediate dysbiosis.},

  abstract     = {Protein domains of low sequence complexity do not fold into stable, three-dimensional structures. Nevertheless, proteins with these sequences assist in many aspects of cell organization, including assembly of nuclear and cytoplasmic structures not surrounded by membranes. The dynamic nature of these cellular assemblies is caused by the ability of low-complexity domains (LCDs) to transiently self-associate through labile, cross-β structures. Mechanistic studies useful for the study of LCD self-association have evolved over the past decade in the form of simple assays of phase separation. Here, we have used such assays to demonstrate that the interactions responsible for LCD self-association can be dictated by labile protein structures poised close to equilibrium between the folded and unfolded states. Furthermore, missense mutations causing Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, frontotemporal dementia, and Alzheimer’s disease manifest their pathophysiology in vitro and in cultured cell systems by enhancing the stability of otherwise labile molecular structures formed upon LCD self-association.},

However, quantifying their relative contributions has remained elusive. Here, we introduce “synthetic regulatory reconstitution,” a conceptual framework for studying gene regulation, and apply it to the HoxA cluster. We synthesized and delivered variant rat HoxA clusters (130 to 170 kilobases) to an ectopic location in the mouse genome. We found that a minimal HoxA cluster recapitulated correct patterns of chromatin remodeling and transcription in response to patterning signals, whereas the addition of distal enhancers was needed for full transcriptional output. Synthetic regulatory reconstitution could provide a generalizable strategy for deciphering the regulatory logic of gene expression in complex genomes.},

A synthesis of marine paleotemperature records shows that the MCO was a local maximum in global sea surface temperature superimposed on a period from at least 19 Ma to 10 Ma, during which global temperatures were on the order of 10°C warmer than at present. Our high-resolution global reconstruction of ocean crustal production, a proxy for tectonic degassing of carbon, suggests that crustal production rates were ~35\% higher than modern rates until ~14 Ma, when production began to decline steeply along with global temperatures. The magnitude and timing of the inferred changes in tectonic degassing can account for the majority of long-term ice sheet and global temperature evolution since 20 Ma.},

Construction with water-soluble, biocompatible materials leads to dissolution and bioresorption as a mechanism to eliminate unnecessary device load and risk to the patient without additional surgeries.

Cis- and trans-regulatory mutations had different effects on gene expression with pleiotropic effects of trans-regulatory mutants affecting expression of genes both in parallel to and downstream of the focal gene.

The event generated a broad range of atmospheric waves observed globally by various ground-based and spaceborne instrumentation networks. Most prominent was the surface-guided Lamb wave (≲0.01 hertz), which we observed propagating for four (plus three antipodal) passages around Earth over 6 days. As measured by the Lamb wave amplitudes, the climactic Hunga explosion was comparable in size to that of the 1883 Krakatau eruption. The Hunga eruption produced remarkable globally detected infrasound (0.01 to 20 hertz), long-range (~10,000 kilometers) audible sound, and ionospheric perturbations. Seismometers worldwide recorded pure seismic and air-to-ground coupled waves. Air-to-sea coupling likely contributed to fast-arriving tsunamis. Here, we highlight exceptional observations of the atmospheric waves.},

Tsunamis arriving later than the conventionally expected travel time are composed of various waves generated from both moving and static sources, which makes the tsunami, due to this eruption, much more complex and longer-lasting than ordinary earthquake-induced tsunamis.},

We discovered that after peripheral nerve injury, microglia degrade extracellular matrix structures, perineuronal nets (PNNs), in lamina I of the spinal cord dorsal horn. Lamina I PNNs selectively enwrap spinoparabrachial projection neurons, which integrate nociceptive information in the spinal cord and convey it to supraspinal brain regions to induce pain sensation. Degradation of PNNs by microglia enhances the activity of projection neurons and induces pain-related behaviors. Thus, nerve injury–induced degradation of PNNs is a mechanism by which microglia selectively augment the output of spinal nociceptive circuits and cause pain hypersensitivity.},

Three are East Asian related, one is Polynesian, and a fifth is a Papuan source related to mainland New Guineans that is different from the New Britain–related Papuan source for southwest Pacific populations but is similarly derived from male migrants ~2500 to 2000 years ago. People of the Mariana Archipelago may derive all of their precolonial ancestry from East Asian sources, making them the only Remote Oceanians without Papuan ancestry. Female-inherited mitochondrial DNA was highly differentiated across early Remote Oceanian communities but homogeneous within, implying matrilocal practices whereby women almost never raised their children in communities different from the ones in which they grew up.},

  abstract     = {In mice, social defeat stress (SDS), an ethological model for psychosocial stress, induces sleep. Such sleep could enable resilience, but how stress promotes sleep is unclear. Activity-dependent tagging revealed a subset of ventral tegmental area γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)–somatostatin (VTA Vgat-Sst ) cells that sense stress and drive non–rapid eye movement (NREM) and REM sleep through the lateral hypothalamus and also inhibit corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) release in the paraventricular hypothalamus. Transient stress enhances the activity of VTA Vgat-Sst cells for several hours, allowing them to exert their sleep effects persistently. Lesioning of VTA Vgat-Sst cells abolished SDS-induced sleep; without it, anxiety and corticosterone concentrations remained increased after stress. Thus, a specific circuit allows animals to restore mental and body functions by sleeping, potentially providing a refined route for treating anxiety disorders.},

How different cell types are organized in the human cortex and how cellular organization varies across species remain unclear. In this study, we performed spatially resolved single-cell profiling of 4000 genes using multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH), identified more than 100 transcriptionally distinct cell populations, and generated a molecularly defined and spatially resolved cell atlas of the human middle and superior temporal gyrus. We further explored cell-cell interactions arising from soma contact or proximity in a cell type–specific manner. Comparison of the human and mouse cortices showed conservation in the laminar organization of cells and differences in somatic interactions across species. Our data revealed human-specific cell-cell proximity patterns and a markedly increased enrichment for interactions between neurons and non-neuronal cells in the human cortex.},

  abstract     = {The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) kinase controls growth in response to nutrients, including the amino acid leucine. In cultured cells, mTORC1 senses leucine through the leucine-binding Sestrin proteins, but the physiological functions and distribution of Sestrin-mediated leucine sensing in mammals are unknown. We find that mice lacking Sestrin1 and Sestrin2 cannot inhibit mTORC1 upon dietary leucine deprivation and suffer a rapid loss of white adipose tissue (WAT) and muscle. The WAT loss is driven by aberrant mTORC1 activity and fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) production in the liver. Sestrin expression in the liver lobule is zonated, accounting for zone-specific regulation of mTORC1 activity and FGF21 induction by leucine. These results establish the mammalian Sestrins as physiological leucine sensors and reveal a spatial organization to nutrient sensing by the mTORC1 pathway.},

  abstract     = {Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a critical host resistance factor against tuberculosis. However, excess TNF produces susceptibility by increasing mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mROS), which initiate a signaling cascade to cause pathogenic necrosis of mycobacterium-infected macrophages. In zebrafish, we identified the mechanism of TNF-induced mROS in tuberculosis. Excess TNF in mycobacterium-infected macrophages elevates mROS production by reverse electron transport (RET) through complex I. TNF-activated cellular glutamine uptake leads to an increased concentration of succinate, a Krebs cycle intermediate. Oxidation of this elevated succinate by complex II drives RET, thereby generating the mROS superoxide at complex I. The complex I inhibitor metformin, a widely used antidiabetic drug, prevents TNF-induced mROS and necrosis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis –infected zebrafish and human macrophages; metformin may therefore be useful in tuberculosis therapy.},

Here, we statistically reconstructed changes in woody biomass across the upper Midwestern region of the United States over the past 10,000 years using a Bayesian model calibrated to preindustrial forest biomass estimates and fossil pollen records. After an initial postglacial decline, woody biomass nearly doubled during the past 8000 years, sequestering 1800 teragrams. This steady accumulation of carbon was driven by two separate ecological responses to regionally changing climate: the spread of forested biomes and the population expansion of high-biomass tree species within forests. What took millennia to accumulate took less than two centuries to remove: Industrial-era logging and agriculture have erased this carbon accumulation.},

We analyzed 930 lipid samples across the global ocean using a uniform high-resolution accurate-mass mass spectrometry analytical workflow, revealing previously unknown characteristics of ocean planktonic lipidomes. Focusing on 10 molecularly diverse glycerolipid classes, we identified 1151 distinct lipid species, finding that fatty acid unsaturation (i.e., number of carbon-carbon double bonds) is fundamentally constrained by temperature. We predict substantial declines in the essential fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid over the next century, which are likely to have serious deleterious effects on economically critical fisheries.},

TH10785 controls the catalytic activity mediated by a nitrogen base within its molecular structure. In cells, TH10785 increases OGG1 recruitment to and repair of oxidative DNA damage. This alters the repair process, which no longer requires APE1 but instead is dependent on polynucleotide kinase phosphatase (PNKP1) activity.

Although evidence generally supports this hypothesis, it has been proposed that certain species, such as turtles and tortoises, may exhibit slow or even negligible senescence—i.e., avoiding the increasing risk of death from gradual deterioration with age. In an extensive comparative study of turtles and tortoises living in zoos and aquariums, we show that ~75\% of 52 species exhibit slow or negligible senescence. For ~80\% of species, aging rates are lower than those in modern humans. We find that body weight positively relates to adult life expectancy in both sexes, and sexual size dimorphism explains sex differences in longevity. Unlike humans and other species, we show that turtles and tortoises may reduce senescence in response to improvements in environmental conditions.},

We test hypotheses of how thermoregulatory mode, environmental temperature, protective phenotypes, and pace of life history contribute to demographic aging. Controlling for phylogeny and body size, ectotherms display a higher diversity of aging rates compared with endotherms and include phylogenetically widespread evidence of negligible aging. Protective phenotypes and life-history strategies further explain macroevolutionary patterns of aging.

Sediment trapping by dams in the global hydrologic north has contributed to global sediment flux declines to 49\% of pre-dam conditions. Recently, intensive land-use change in the global hydrologic south has increased erosion, with river suspended sediment concentration on average 41 ± 7\% greater than in the 1980s.

Furthermore, via single-cell sequencing of morphologically defined astrocyte subtypes using Patch-seq, we identify molecular distinctions between VZ-derived cortical plate astrocytes and OSVZ-derived white matter astrocytes that persist into adulthood.

  abstract     = {Changing the course of Earth’s climate is increasingly urgent, but there is also a concurrent need for proactive stewardship of the adaptive capacity of the rapidly changing biosphere. Adaptation ultimately underpins the resilience of Earth’s complex systems; species, communities, and ecosystems shift and evolve over time. Yet oncoming changes will seriously challenge current natural resource management and conservation efforts. We review forward-looking conservation approaches to enable adaptation and resilience. Key opportunities include expanding beyond preservationist approaches by including those that enable and facilitate ecological change. Conservation should not just focus on climate change losers but also on proactive management of emerging opportunities. Local efforts to conserve biodiversity and generate habitat complexity will also help to maintain a diversity of future options for an unpredictable future.},

Food systems are one of the most important contributors to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, but they also need to be adapted to cope with climate change impacts. Although many options exist to reduce GHG emissions in the food system, efforts to develop implementable transformation pathways are hampered by a combination of structural challenges such as fragmented decision-making, vested interests, and power imbalances in the climate policy and food communities, all of which are compounded by a lack of joint vision. New processes and governance arrangements are urgently needed for dealing with potential trade-offs among mitigation options and their food security implications.},

This pushback is fueled by (i) critical uncertainties about when, where, how, and for whom nature-based solutions are effective and (ii) controversies surrounding their misuse in greenwashing, violations of human rights, and threats to biodiversity. To clarify how the scientific community can help address these issues, I provide an overview of recent research on the benefits and limits of nature-based solutions, including how they compare with technological approaches, and highlight critical areas for future research.},

Though the growth rate of global carbon dioxide emissions has slowed and many countries have strengthened their emissions targets, current midcentury net zero goals are insufficient to limit global warming to 1.5°C above preindustrial temperatures. The primary barriers to the achievement of a 1.5°C-compatible pathway are not geophysical but rather reflect inertia in our political and technological systems. Both political and corporate leadership are needed to overcome this inertia, supported by increased societal recognition of the need for system-level and individual lifestyle changes. The available evidence does not yet indicate that the world has seriously committed to achieving the 1.5°C goal.},

Russia produces 6 to 20\% of the world’s potash, phosphate, and ammonia, and the trade embargo implemented in response to the invasion has led to increased demand for these important sources of fertilizer macronutrients (2). In addition, Russia and Ukraine together account for 18 to 70\% of global wheat, maize, and sunflower exports (3), and Ukraine maintains a large seed bank that is now at risk of destruction (4). The fall in exports has led to food shortages and increased prices, including maize and wheat price hikes that are, respectively, 55\% and 91\% higher than prices for those products in 2021 (5). In the face of these challenges, strategies to ensure food security should be explored, including the prevention of food loss and waste.},

  abstract     = {The molecular basis of interindividual clinical variability upon infection with Staphylococcus aureus is unclear. We describe patients with haploinsufficiency for the linear deubiquitinase OTULIN, encoded by a gene on chromosome 5p. Patients suffer from episodes of life-threatening necrosis, typically triggered by S. aureus infection. The disorder is phenocopied in patients with the 5p− (Cri-du-Chat) chromosomal deletion syndrome. OTULIN haploinsufficiency causes an accumulation of linear ubiquitin in dermal fibroblasts, but tumor necrosis factor receptor–mediated nuclear factor κB signaling remains intact. Blood leukocyte subsets are unaffected. The OTULIN-dependent accumulation of caveolin-1 in dermal fibroblasts, but not leukocytes, facilitates the cytotoxic damage inflicted by the staphylococcal virulence factor α-toxin. Naturally elicited antibodies against α-toxin contribute to incomplete clinical penetrance. Human OTULIN haploinsufficiency underlies life-threatening staphylococcal disease by disrupting cell-intrinsic immunity to α-toxin in nonleukocytic cells.},

  abstract     = {A hallmark of meiosis is chromosomal pairing, which requires telomere tethering and rotation on the nuclear envelope through microtubules, driving chromosome homology searches. Telomere pulling toward the centrosome forms the “zygotene chromosomal bouquet.” Here, we identified the “zygotene cilium” in oocytes. This cilium provides a cable system for the bouquet machinery and extends throughout the germline cyst. Using zebrafish mutants and live manipulations, we demonstrate that the cilium anchors the centrosome to counterbalance telomere pulling. The cilium is essential for bouquet and synaptonemal complex formation, oogenesis, ovarian development, and fertility. Thus, a cilium represents a conserved player in zebrafish and mouse meiosis, which sheds light on reproductive aspects in ciliopathies and suggests that cilia can control chromosomal dynamics.},

Analysis of neurodevelopmental disease cohorts identified a significant overrepresentation of NSC centrosome proteins with variants in patients with periventricular heterotopia (PH). Expressing the PH-associated mutant pre-mRNA-processing factor 6 (PRPF6) reproduced the periventricular misplacement in the developing mouse brain, highlighting missplicing of transcripts of a microtubule-associated kinase with centrosomal location as essential for the phenotype.

We identify the monocyte- and macrophage-derived cytokine METRNL (meteorin-like) as a driver of postinfarction angiogenesis and high-affinity ligand for the stem cell factor receptor KIT (KIT receptor tyrosine kinase). METRNL mediated angiogenic effects in cultured human endothelial cells through KIT-dependent signaling pathways. In a mouse model of myocardial infarction, METRNL promoted infarct repair by selectively expanding the KIT-expressing endothelial cell population in the infarct border zone. Metrnl -deficient mice failed to mount this KIT-dependent angiogenic response and developed severe postinfarction heart failure. Our data establish METRNL as a KIT receptor ligand in the context of ischemic tissue repair.},

A complex between the noncoding Sec-insertion sequence (SECIS), SECIS-binding protein 2 (SBP2), and 40 S ribosomal subunit enables Sec-specific elongation factor eEFSec to deliver Sec. eEFSec and SBP2 do not interact directly but rather deploy their carboxyl-terminal domains to engage with the opposite ends of the SECIS. By using its Lys-rich and carboxyl-terminal segments, the ribosomal protein eS31 simultaneously interacts with Sec-specific transfer RNA (tRNA Sec ) and SBP2, which further stabilizes the assembly. eEFSec is indiscriminate toward l -serine and facilitates its misincorporation at Sec UGA codons. Our results support a fundamentally distinct mechanism of Sec UGA recoding in eukaryotes from that in bacteria.},

These bears occupy sea-ice conditions resembling those projected for the High Arctic in the late 21st century, with an annual ice-free period that is &gt;100 days longer than the estimated fasting threshold for the species. Whereas polar bears in most of the Arctic depend on annual sea ice to catch seals, Southeast Greenland bears have a year-round hunting platform in the form of freshwater glacial mélange. This suggests that marine-terminating glaciers, although of limited availability, may serve as previously unrecognized climate refugia. Conservation of Southeast Greenland polar bears, which meet criteria for recognition as the world’s 20th polar bear subpopulation, is necessary to preserve the genetic diversity and evolutionary potential of the species.},

We apply ion implantation to ultralow–loss silicon nitride (Si 3 N 4 ) photonic integrated circuits, which are able to increase the soliton microcomb output power by 100 times, achieving power requirements for low-noise photonic microwave generation and wavelength-division multiplexing optical communications. Endowing Si 3 N 4 photonic integrated circuits with gain enables the miniaturization of various fiber-based devices such as high–pulse-energy femtosecond mode-locked lasers.},

  abstract     = {Ultracold atoms confined to periodic potentials have proven to be a powerful tool for quantum simulation of complex many-body systems. We confine fermions to one dimension to realize the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid model, which describes the highly collective nature of their low-energy excitations. We use Bragg spectroscopy to directly excite either the spin or charge waves for various strengths of repulsive interaction. We observe that the velocity of the spin and charge excitations shift in opposite directions with increasing interaction, a hallmark of spin-charge separation. The excitation spectra are in quantitative agreement with the exact solution of the Yang-Gaudin model and the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid theory. Furthermore, we identify effects of nonlinear corrections to this theory that arise from band curvature and back-scattering.},

  abstract     = {Ocean oil slicks can be attributed to natural seepages or to anthropogenic discharges. To date, the global picture of their distribution and relative natural and anthropogenic contributions remains unclear. Here, by analyzing 563,705 Sentinel-1 images from 2014–2019, we provide the first global map of oil slicks and a detailed inventory of static-and-persistent sources (natural seeps, platforms, and pipelines). About 90\% of oil slicks were within 160 kilometers of shorelines, with 21 high-density slick belts coinciding well with shipping routes. Quantified by slick area, the proportion of anthropogenic discharges was an order of magnitude greater than natural seepages (94 versus 6\%), in contrast to the previous estimate quantified by volume during 1990–1999 (54 versus 46\%). Our findings reveal that the present-day anthropogenic contribution to marine oil pollution may have been substantially underestimated.},

We identified a quantitative trait locus, Thermo-tolerance 3 ( TT3 ), consisting of two genes, TT3.1 and TT3.2 , that interact together to enhance rice thermotolerance and reduce grain-yield losses caused by heat stress. Upon heat stress, plasma membrane–localized E3 ligase TT3.1 translocates to the endosomes, on which TT3.1 ubiquitinates chloroplast precursor protein TT3.2 for vacuolar degradation, implying that TT3.1 might serve as a potential thermosensor. Lesser accumulated, mature TT3.2 proteins in chloroplasts are essential for protecting thylakoids from heat stress. Our findings not only reveal a TT3.1-TT3.2 genetic module at one locus that transduces heat signals from plasma membrane to chloroplasts but also provide the strategy for breeding highly thermotolerant crops.},

Unlike biological systems in which functions such as sensing, actuation, and control are closely integrated, few architected materials have comparable system complexity. We report a design and manufacturing route to create a class of robotic metamaterials capable of motion with multiple degrees of freedom, amplification of strain in a prescribed direction in response to an electric field (and vice versa), and thus, programmed motions with self-sensing and feedback control. These robotic metamaterials consist of networks of piezoelectric, conductive, and structural elements interwoven into a designed 3D lattice. The resulting architected materials function as proprioceptive microrobots that actively sense and move.},

Although the arrangement of the structured scaffold nucleoporins in the NPC’s symmetric core has been determined, their cohesion by multivalent unstructured linker nucleoporins has remained elusive. Combining biochemical reconstitution, high-resolution structure determination, docking into cryo–electron tomographic reconstructions, and physiological validation, we elucidated the architecture of the evolutionarily conserved linker-scaffold, yielding a near-atomic composite structure of the human NPC’s ~64-megadalton symmetric core. Whereas linkers generally play a rigidifying role, the linker-scaffold of the NPC provides the plasticity and robustness necessary for the reversible constriction and dilation of its central transport channel and the emergence of lateral channels. Our results substantially advance the structural characterization of the NPC symmetric core, providing a basis for future functional studies.},

Here, we report a 70-megadalton model of the human NPC scaffold with explicit membrane and in multiple conformational states. We combined artificial intelligence (AI)–based structure prediction with in situ and in cellulo cryo–electron tomography and integrative modeling. We show that linker nucleoporins spatially organize the scaffold within and across subcomplexes to establish the higher-order structure. Microsecond-long molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the scaffold is not required to stabilize the inner and outer nuclear membrane fusion but rather widens the central pore. Our work exemplifies how AI-based modeling can be integrated with in situ structural biology to understand subcellular architecture across spatial organization levels.},

Certain molecular interactions were further built or confirmed by complex prediction by using AlphaFold. We identified the binding modes of five copies of Nup358, the largest NPC subunit with Phe-Gly repeats for cargo transport, and predicted it to contain a coiled-coil domain that may provide avidity to assist its role as a nucleation center for NPC formation under certain conditions.},

Although stereospecific nucleophilic substitution at P(V) provides a general strategy for elaborating optically active P(V) compounds, existing methods for accessing the requisite chiral building blocks rely almost entirely on diastereocontrol using chiral auxiliaries. Catalytic, enantioselective methods for the synthesis of synthetically versatile stereogenic P(V) building blocks offer an alternative approach to stereogenic-at-P(V) targets without requiring stoichiometric quantities of chiral control elements. Here, we report an enantioselective hydrogen-bond-donor–catalyzed synthesis of aryl chlorophosphonamidates and the development of these products as versatile chiral P(V) building blocks. We demonstrate that the two leaving groups on these chlorophosphonamidates can be displaced sequentially and stereospecifically to access a wide variety of stereogenic-at-P(V) compounds featuring diverse substitution patterns.},

The sequence controls three stereogenic centers, two of which are stereochemically labile.

Infant microbiomes develop along lifestyle-associated trajectories, with more than 20\% of genomes detected in the Hadza infant gut representing novel species. Industrialized infants—even those who are breastfed—have microbiomes characterized by a paucity of Bifidobacterium infantis and gene cassettes involved in human milk utilization. Strains within lifestyle-associated taxonomic groups are shared between mother-infant dyads, consistent with early life inheritance of lifestyle-shaped microbiomes.

Several studies have measured consumption rates across latitude at large scales, with variable results. Moreover, how predation affects prey community composition at such geographic scales remains unknown. Using standardized experiments that spanned 115° of latitude, at 36 nearshore sites along both coasts of the Americas, we found that marine predators have both higher consumption rates and consistently stronger impacts on biomass and species composition of marine invertebrate communities in warmer tropical waters, likely owing to fish predators. Our results provide robust support for a temperature-dependent gradient in interaction strength and have potential implications for how marine ecosystems will respond to ocean warming.},

We use a hardware-efficient encoding associated with Rydberg blockade, realize closed-loop optimization to test several variational algorithms, and subsequently apply them to systematically explore a class of graphs with programmable connectivity. We find that the problem hardness is controlled by the solution degeneracy and number of local minima, and we experimentally benchmark the quantum algorithm’s performance against classical simulated annealing.

Our analyses revealed four ecological zones, latitudinal and depth diversity patterns, and environmental correlates for RNA viruses. Our findings only partially parallel those of cosampled plankton and show unexpectedly high polar ecological interactions. The influence of RNA viruses on ecosystems appears to be large, as predicted hosts are ecologically important. Moreover, the occurrence of auxiliary metabolic genes indicates that RNA viruses cause reprogramming of diverse host metabolisms, including photosynthesis and carbon cycling, and that RNA virus abundances predict ocean carbon export.},

We show here that 30\% CR was sufficient to extend the life span by 10\%; however, a daily fasting interval and circadian alignment of feeding acted together to extend life span by 35\% in male C57BL/6J mice. These effects were independent of body weight. Aging induced widespread increases in gene expression associated with inflammation and decreases in the expression of genes encoding components of metabolic pathways in liver from ad libitum–fed mice. CR at night ameliorated these aging-related changes. Our results show that circadian interventions promote longevity and provide a perspective to further explore mechanisms of aging.},

These phenotypes include the expression of a set of effectors normally observed only during biotrophic development, as well as the formation of melanin associated with sporulation in plant tumors. U. maydis and other hemibiotrophic fungi also respond to a combination of carbon sources with enhanced proliferation.

  abstract     = {Quantum technology promises to revolutionize how we learn about the physical world. An experiment that processes quantum data with a quantum computer could have substantial advantages over conventional experiments in which quantum states are measured and outcomes are processed with a classical computer. We proved that quantum machines could learn from exponentially fewer experiments than the number required by conventional experiments. This exponential advantage is shown for predicting properties of physical systems, performing quantum principal component analysis, and learning about physical dynamics. Furthermore, the quantum resources needed for achieving an exponential advantage are quite modest in some cases. Conducting experiments with 40 superconducting qubits and 1300 quantum gates, we demonstrated that a substantial quantum advantage is possible with today’s quantum processors.},

Mason et al. argue that nitrogen has decreased in availability worldwide over the past century and that the decline is best explained by human-driven elevated temperatures and CO2. This conclusion conflicts with previous studies showing strong increases in nitrogen availability compared to preindustrial levels (1, 2). Mason et al. present two main types of observational trends as evidence that nitrogen has declined: a decline in Europe and the United States since 1990 in various nitrogen availability indices, and a worldwide decline of nitrogen isotope ratios (δ15N) in plant leaves, tree rings, and lake sediments since 1920. We disagree that rising temperatures and CO2 levels are the best explanation for these trends.},

This revealed the late acquisition of immune-effector functions by myeloid and lymphoid cell subsets and the maturation of monocytes and T cells before peripheral tissue seeding. Moreover, we uncovered system-wide blood and immune cell development beyond primary hematopoietic organs, characterized human prenatal B1 cells, and shed light on the origin of unconventional T cells.

We encapsulate individual microbes in droplets with microfluidics and liberate their DNA, which we then amplify, tag with droplet-specific barcodes, and sequence. We explore the human gut microbiome, sequencing more than 20,000 microbial single-amplified genomes (SAGs) from a single human donor and coassembling genomes of almost 100 bacterial species, including several with multiple subspecies strains. We use these genomes to probe microbial interactions, reconstructing the horizontal gene transfer (HGT) network and observing HGT between 92 species pairs; we also identify a significant in vivo host-phage association between crAssphage and one strain of Bacteroides vulgatus . Microbe-seq contributes high-throughput culture-free capabilities to investigate genomic blueprints of complex microbial communities with single-microbe resolution.},

Here we report on an unusual fossil giraffoid, Discokeryx xiezhi , from the early Miocene, which has an unusual disk-shaped headgear and the most complicated head-neck joints in known mammals. The distinctive morphology and our finite element analyses indicate an adaptation for fierce head-butting behavior. Tooth enamel isotope data suggest that D. xiezhi occupied a niche different from that of other herbivores, comparable to the characteristic high-level browsing niche of modern giraffes. The study shows that giraffoids exhibit a higher headgear diversity than other ruminants and that living in specific ecological niches may have fostered various intraspecific combat behaviors that resulted in extreme head-neck morphologies in different giraffoid lineages.},

  abstract     = {Insects are facing a multitude of anthropogenic stressors, and the recent decline in their biodiversity is threatening ecosystems and economies across the globe. We investigated the impact of glyphosate, the most commonly used herbicide worldwide, on bumblebees. Bumblebee colonies maintain their brood at high temperatures via active thermogenesis, a prerequisite for colony growth and reproduction. Using a within-colony comparative approach to examine the effects of long-term glyphosate exposure on both individual and collective thermoregulation, we found that whereas effects are weak at the level of the individual, the collective ability to maintain the necessary high brood temperatures is decreased by more than 25\% during periods of resource limitation. For pollinators in our heavily stressed ecosystems, glyphosate exposure carries hidden costs that have so far been largely overlooked.},

Climate change may reduce alpine snow cover and increase vegetation productivity, as in the Arctic. Here, we demonstrate that 77\% of the European Alps above the tree line experienced greening (productivity gain) and &lt;1\% browning (productivity loss) over the past four decades. Snow cover declined significantly during this time, but in &lt;10\% of the area. These trends were only weakly correlated: Greening predominated in warmer areas, driven by climatic changes during summer, while snow cover recession peaked at colder temperatures, driven by precipitation changes. Greening could increase carbon sequestration, but this is unlikely to outweigh negative implications, including reduced albedo and water availability, thawing permafrost, and habitat loss.},

Conventional wisdom regards the insulating bulk as essential, because the invariants that describe the topological properties of the system are defined therein. Here, we study fractal topological insulators based on exact fractals composed exclusively of edge sites. We present experimental proof that, despite the lack of bulk bands, photonic lattices of helical waveguides support topologically protected chiral edge states. We show that light transport in our topological fractal system features increased velocities compared with the corresponding honeycomb lattice. By going beyond the confines of the bulk-boundary correspondence, our findings pave the way toward an expanded perception of topological insulators and open a new chapter of topological fractals.},

Ecological success is often proposed to derive from hybridization through enhanced genetic diversity from repetitive origins or enhanced phenotypic breadth from heterosis. Here, we tested and rejected both hypotheses in a classic parthenogen, the diploid grasshopper Warramaba virgo . Genetic data revealed a single hybrid mating origin at least 0.25 million years ago, and comparative analyses of 14 physiological and life history traits showed no evidence for altered fitness relative to its sexual progenitors. Our findings imply that the rarity of parthenogenesis is due to constraints on origin rather than to rapid extinction.},

We report a versatile strategy to fabricate polytriazole membranes with 10-nanometer-thin selective layers containing subnanometer channels for the separation of hydrocarbons. The process involves the use of the classical nonsolvent-induced phase separation method and thermal cross-linking. The membrane selectivity can be tuned to the lower end of the typical nanofiltration range (200 to 1000 gram mole −1 ). The polytriazole membrane can enrich up to 80 to 95\% of the hydrocarbon content with less than 10 carbon atoms (140 gram mole −1 ). These membranes preferentially separate paraffin over aromatic components, making them suitable for integration in hybrid distillation systems for crude oil fractionation.},

We find that mitigating the human footprint may improve connectivity more than adding new PAs, although both strategies together maximize benefits. The most globally important areas of concentrated mammal movement remain unprotected, with 71\% of these overlapping with global biodiversity priority areas and 6\% occurring on land with moderate to high human modification.

In this study, we estimate the minimum land area to secure important biodiversity areas, ecologically intact areas, and optimal locations for representation of species ranges and ecoregions. We discover that at least 64 million square kilometers (44\% of terrestrial area) would require conservation attention (ranging from protected areas to land-use policies) to meet this goal. More than 1.8 billion people live on these lands, so responses that promote autonomy, self-determination, equity, and sustainable management for safeguarding biodiversity are essential. Spatially explicit land-use scenarios suggest that 1.3 million square kilometers of this land is at risk of being converted for intensive human land uses by 2030, which requires immediate attention. However, a sevenfold difference exists between the amount of habitat converted in optimistic and pessimistic land-use scenarios, highlighting an opportunity to avert this crisis. Appropriate targets in the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework to encourage conservation of the identified land would contribute substantially to safeguarding biodiversity.},

We show that the active condensin complex entraps the bases of a DNA loop transiently in two separate chambers. Single-molecule imaging and cryo–electron microscopy suggest a putative power-stroke movement at the first chamber that feeds DNA into the SMC–kleisin ring upon adenosine triphosphate binding, whereas the second chamber holds on upstream of the same DNA double helix. Unlocking the strict separation of “motor” and “anchor” chambers turns condensin from a one-sided into a bidirectional DNA loop extruder. We conclude that the orientation of two topologically bound DNA segments during the SMC reaction cycle determines the directionality of DNA loop extrusion.},

ML901 exerts whole-life-cycle–killing activity with low nanomolar potency and single-dose efficacy in a mouse model of malaria.

ASD-specific variation correlated with individual differences in symptoms. The structure of this ASD-specific variation also addresses a long-standing debate about the nature of ASD: At least in terms of neuroanatomy, individuals do not cluster into distinct subtypes; instead, they are organized along continuous dimensions that affect distinct sets of regions.},

Despite some progress, the degradation of many Chinese wetlands habitats continues. Renewed efforts, supported by more international collaboration, are required to protect the nation’s remaining wetland environments.},

We used ATAC-seq (assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing), RNA-seq, and DNA sequencing to investigate 22 organoids, six patient-derived xenografts, and 12 cell lines. We identified the well-characterized AR-dependent and neuroendocrine subtypes, as well as two AR-negative/low groups: a Wnt-dependent subtype, and a stem cell–like (SCL) subtype driven by activator protein–1 (AP-1) transcription factors. We used transcriptomic signatures to classify 366 patients, which showed that SCL is the second most common subtype of CRPC after AR-dependent. Our data suggest that AP-1 interacts with the YAP/TAZ and TEAD proteins to maintain subtype-specific chromatin accessibility and transcriptomic landscapes in this group. Together, this molecular classification reveals drug targets and can potentially guide therapeutic decisions.},

To date, there are few robust estimates of this parameter for natural populations, and it is therefore unclear whether adaptive evolution can play a meaningful role in short-term population dynamics. We developed and applied quantitative genetic methods to long-term datasets from 19 wild bird and mammal populations and found that, while estimates vary between populations, additive genetic variance in relative fitness is often substantial and, on average, twice that of previous estimates. We show that these rates of contemporary adaptive evolution can affect population dynamics and hence that natural selection has the potential to partly mitigate effects of current environmental change.},

This hardware introduces risks for infection, limitations on patient mobility, and requirements for surgical extraction procedures. Bioresorbable pacemakers mitigate some of these disadvantages, but they demand pairing with external, wired systems and secondary mechanisms for control. We present a transient closed-loop system that combines a time-synchronized, wireless network of skin-integrated devices with an advanced bioresorbable pacemaker to control cardiac rhythms, track cardiopulmonary status, provide multihaptic feedback, and enable transient operation with minimal patient burden. The result provides a range of autonomous, rate-adaptive cardiac pacing capabilities, as demonstrated in rat, canine, and human heart studies. This work establishes an engineering framework for closed-loop temporary electrotherapy using wirelessly linked, body-integrated bioelectronic devices.},

We performed a large-scale meta-analysis including 103 papers and used it to develop a mechanistic, agent-based model of Microcystis growth and microcystin production. Simulations for Lake Erie suggest that the observed toxigenic-to-nontoxigenic strain succession during the 2014 Toledo drinking water crisis was controlled by different cellular oxidative stress mitigation strategies (protection by microcystin versus degradation by enzymes) and the different susceptibility of those mechanisms to nitrogen limitation. This model, as well as a simpler empirical one, predicts that the planned phosphorus load reduction will lower biomass but make nitrogen and light more available, which will increase toxin production, favor toxigenic cells, and increase toxin concentrations.},

We show here that CD8α is critical for the maintenance of CD8 + T cells in a physiologically quiescent state in peripheral lymphoid organs. Upon inducible deletion of CD8α, both naïve and memory CD8 + T cells spontaneously acquired activation phenotypes and subsequently died without exposure to specific antigens. PILRα was identified as a ligand for CD8α in both mice and humans, and disruption of this interaction was able to break CD8 + T cell quiescence. Thus, peripheral T cell pool size is actively maintained by the CD8α–PILRα interaction in the absence of antigen exposure.},

  abstract     = {Emerging resistance to currently used antibiotics is a global public health crisis. Because most of the biosynthetic capacity within the bacterial kingdom has remained silent in previous antibiotic discovery efforts, uncharacterized biosynthetic gene clusters found in bacterial genome–sequencing studies remain an appealing source of antibiotics with distinctive modes of action. Here, we report the discovery of a naturally inspired lipopeptide antibiotic called cilagicin, which we chemically synthesized on the basis of a detailed bioinformatic analysis of the cil biosynthetic gene cluster. Cilagicin’s ability to sequester two distinct, indispensable undecaprenyl phosphates used in cell wall biosynthesis, together with the absence of detectable resistance in laboratory tests and among multidrug-resistant clinical isolates, makes it an appealing candidate for combating antibiotic-resistant pathogens.},

  abstract     = {Rivers can abruptly shift pathways in rare events called avulsions, which cause devastating floods. The controls on avulsion locations are poorly understood as a result of sparse data on such features. We analyzed nearly 50 years of satellite imagery and documented 113 avulsions across the globe that indicate three distinct controls on avulsion location. Avulsions on fans coincide with valley-confinement change, whereas avulsions on deltas are primarily clustered within the backwater zone, indicating a control by spatial flow deceleration or acceleration during floods. However, 38\% of avulsions on deltas occurred upstream of backwater effects. These events occurred in steep, sediment-rich rivers in tropical and desert environments. Our results indicate that avulsion location on deltas is set by the upstream extent of flood-driven erosion, which is typically limited to the backwater zone but can extend far upstream in steep, sediment-laden rivers. Our findings elucidate how avulsion hazards might respond to land use and climate change.},

  abstract     = {The dynamic interactions between noble metal particles and reducible metal-oxide supports can depend on redox reactions with ambient gases. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that the strong metal-support interaction (SMSI)–induced encapsulation of platinum particles on titania observed under reducing conditions is lost once the system is exposed to a redox-reactive environment containing oxygen and hydrogen at a total pressure of ~1 bar. Destabilization of the metal–oxide interface and redox-mediated reconstructions of titania lead to particle dynamics and directed particle migration that depend on nanoparticle orientation. A static encapsulated SMSI state was reestablished when switching back to purely oxidizing conditions. This work highlights the difference between reactive and nonreactive states and demonstrates that manifestations of the metal-support interaction strongly depend on the chemical environment.},

Previously, it has been speculated that they are formed in the atmosphere through the gas-phase reaction of organic peroxy radicals (RO 2 ) with hydroxyl radicals (OH). Here, we report direct observation of ROOOH formation from several atmospherically relevant RO 2 radicals. Kinetic analysis confirmed rapid RO 2 + OH reactions forming ROOOH, with rate coefficients close to the collision limit. For the OH-initiated degradation of isoprene, global modeling predicts molar hydrotrioxide formation yields of up to 1\%, which represents an annual ROOOH formation of about 10 million metric tons. The atmospheric lifetime of ROOOH is estimated to be minutes to hours. Hydrotrioxides represent a previously omitted substance class in the atmosphere, the impact of which needs to be examined.},

We show d 33 piezoelectric constants of 1.95 to 2.09 picometers per volt that are larger than the natural OOP piezoelectric constant of monolayer In 2 Se 3 by a factor of ~6. We demonstrate the modulation of tunneling current by about three orders of magnitude in ferroelectric tunnel junction devices by changing the polarization state of MoS 2 /WS 2 heterobilayers.

It is installed by a writer complex and can be reversed by erasers such as the fat mass and obesity-associated protein FTO. Despite extensive research, the primary physiological substrates of FTO in mammalian tissues and development remain elusive. Here, we show that FTO mediates m 6 A demethylation of long-interspersed element-1 (LINE1) RNA in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), regulating LINE1 RNA abundance and the local chromatin state, which in turn modulates the transcription of LINE1-containing genes. FTO-mediated LINE1 RNA m 6 A demethylation also plays regulatory roles in shaping chromatin state and gene expression during mouse oocyte and embryonic development. Our results suggest broad effects of LINE1 RNA m 6 A demethylation by FTO in mammals.},

  abstract     = {Prior to ~1 million years ago (Ma), variations in global ice volume were dominated by changes in obliquity; however, the role of precession remains unresolved. Using a record of North Atlantic ice rafting spanning the past 1.7 million years, we find that the onset of ice rafting within a given glacial cycle (reflecting ice sheet expansion) consistently occurred during times of decreasing obliquity whereas mass ice wasting (ablation) events were consistently tied to minima in precession. Furthermore, our results suggest that the ubiquitous association between precession-driven mass wasting events and glacial termination is a distinct feature of the mid to late Pleistocene. Before then, (increasing) obliquity alone was sufficient to end a glacial cycle, before losing its dominant grip on deglaciation with the southward extension of Northern Hemisphere ice sheets since ~1 Ma.},

Microbe-host communication is actively maintained across physiological barriers of various body sites and is mediated by a range of bidirectional secreted proteins and small molecules. So far, a range of “omics” methods have succeeded in revealing the multiplicity of associations between members of a microbiota and a wide range of host processes and diseases. Although these advances point to possibilities for treating disease, there has not been much translational success thus far. We know little about which organisms are key contributors to host health, the importance of strain differences, and the activities of much of the chemical “soup” that is produced by the microbiota. Adding to this complexity are emerging hints of the role of interkingdom interactions between bacteria, phages, protozoa, and/or fungi in regulating the microbiota-host interactions. Functional approaches, although experimentally challenging, could be the next step to unlocking the power of the microbiota.},

Such immune-microbe mutualism, and perturbations thereof, is most likely a root cause of increasing incidences of immune-mediated disorders such as allergies and autoimmunity across many industrialized nations during the past century. In this Review, I discuss our current understanding of immune development and propose that mismatches among ancestral, early-life, and adult environments can explain perturbations to immune-microbe interactions, immune dysregulation, and increased risks of immune-mediated diseases.},

These building blocks also serve as the substrates for libraries of more than 40 billion readily accessible or “tangible” molecules, which can be constructed by stitching the building blocks into larger molecules and are synthesized as needed. Drawing from these molecules has revealed novel leads for multiple drug targets (2–6). More than 90\% of this tangible chemical space also comes from Ukraine. The Russian invasion of Ukraine endangers both the unique building block library and the 40 billion–molecule tangible library that derives from it.},

Sustainable Development Goal 14—Life Below Water—is the least-funded and most-underrepresented objective in the European Union (2), with decades of budget allocation delay for ocean research and conservation. Benthic ecosystems suffer from the effects of bottom trawling, urban and agricultural pollution, bioinvasions, climate change, and other anthropogenic pressures (5). Among these ecosystems, marine animal forests, which are dominated by benthic suspension feeders such as sponges, hard corals, and gorgonians, form three-dimensional habitats (6) that are particularly vulnerable to disturbances (7).},

Here, we tested in the mouse whether these populations interact during embryogenesis while migrating. By coupling histological analysis of genetic models with live imaging, we show that although they are both attracted by the chemokine Cxcl12, vOPCs and cortical interneurons occupy mutually exclusive forebrain territories enriched in this chemokine. Moreover, first-wave vOPC depletion selectively disrupts the migration and distribution of cortical interneurons. At the cellular level, we found that by promoting unidirectional contact repulsion, first-wave vOPCs steered the migration of cortical interneurons away from the blood vessels to which they were both attracted, thereby allowing interneurons to reach their proper cortical territories.},

The vasohibin–small vasohibin-binding protein (SVBP) complex underlies much, but not all, detyrosination. We used haploid genetic screens to identify an unannotated protein, microtubule associated tyrosine carboxypeptidase (MATCAP), as a remaining detyrosinating enzyme. X-ray crystallography and cryo–electron microscopy structures established MATCAP’s cleaving mechanism, substrate specificity, and microtubule recognition. Paradoxically, whereas abrogation of tyrosine religation is lethal in mice, codeletion of MATCAP and SVBP is not. Although viable, defective detyrosination caused microcephaly, associated with proliferative defects during neurogenesis, and abnormal behavior. Thus, MATCAP is a missing component of the detyrosination-tyrosination cycle, revealing the importance of this modification in brain formation.},

High-dimensional cytokine dynamics could be compressed onto a low-dimensional latent space in an antigen-specific manner (so-called “antigen encoding”). We used antigen encoding to model and reconstruct patterns of T cell immune activation. The model delineated six classes of antigens eliciting distinct T cell responses. We generalized antigen encoding to multiple immune settings, including drug perturbations and activation of chimeric antigen receptor T cells. Such universal antigen encoding for T cell activation may enable further modeling of immune responses and their rational manipulation to optimize immunotherapies.},

Previous interferometric and polarization-based techniques demonstrated environmental sensing over cable lengths up to 10,500 kilometers. However, measurements were limited to the integrated changes over the entire length of the cable. We demonstrate the detection of earthquakes and ocean signals on individual spans between repeaters of a 5860-kilometer-long transatlantic cable rather than the whole cable. By applying this technique to the existing undersea communication cables, which have a repeater-to-repeater span length of 45 to 90 kilometers, the largely unmonitored ocean floor could be instrumented with thousands of permanent real-time environmental sensors without changes to the underwater infrastructure.},

This biocatalytic transformation uses amidyl radicals as hydrogen atom abstractors and Fe(III)‒N 3 intermediates as radical trapping agents. We established a high-throughput screening platform based on click chemistry for rapid evolution of the catalytic performance of identified enzymes. The final optimized variants deliver a range of azidation products with up to 10,600 total turnovers and 93\% enantiomeric excess. Given the prevalence of radical relay reactions in organic synthesis and the diversity of nonheme iron enzymes, we envision that this discovery will stimulate future development of metalloenzyme catalysts for synthetically useful transformations unexplored by natural evolution.},

We compiled a global dataset of matched single-species and multispecies plantations to evaluate the impact of multispecies planting on stand growth. Average tree height, diameter at breast height, and aboveground biomass were 5.4, 6.8, and 25.5\% higher, respectively, in multispecies stands compared with single-species stands. These positive effects were mainly the result of interspecific complementarity and were modulated by differences in leaf morphology and leaf life span, stand age, planting density, and temperature. Our results have implications for designing afforestation and reforestation strategies and bridging experimental studies of biodiversity–ecosystem functioning relationships with real-world practices.},

We use ultrafast resonant soft x-ray scattering to track the transient evolution of CDW correlations in YBa 2 Cu 3 O 6+ x after the quench of superconductivity by an infrared laser pulse. We observe a nonthermal response of the CDW order characterized by a near doubling of the correlation length within ≈1 picosecond of the superconducting quench. Our results are consistent with a model in which the interaction between superconductivity and CDWs manifests inhomogeneously through disruption of spatial coherence, with superconductivity playing the dominant role in stabilizing CDW topological defects, such as discommensurations.},

Pi-Cer D is cleaved by an Arabidopsis apoplastic ceramidase, NEUTRAL CERAMIDASE 2 (NCER2), and the resulting 9-methyl–branched sphingoid base is recognized by a plasma membrane lectin receptor–like kinase, RESISTANT TO DFPM-INHIBITION OF ABSCISIC ACID SIGNALING 2 (RDA2). 9-Methyl–branched sphingoid base is specific to microbes and induces plant immune responses by physically interacting with RDA2.

Declines in calcium carbonate (CaCO 3 ) and nannofossil abundance through several past global warming events have been interpreted as biocalcification crises caused by ocean acidification and related factors. We present a global record of imprint—or “ghost”—nannofossils that contradicts this view, revealing exquisitely preserved nannoplankton throughout an inferred Jurassic biocalcification crisis. Imprints from two further Cretaceous warming events confirm that the fossil records of these intervals have been strongly distorted by CaCO 3 dissolution. Although the rapidity of present-day climate change exceeds the temporal resolution of most fossil records, complicating direct comparison with past warming events, our findings demonstrate that nannoplankton were more resilient to past events than traditional fossil evidence suggests.},

We describe cryo–electron microscopy structures of the human inner kinetochore constitutive centromere associated network (CCAN) complex bound to CENP-A Nuc reconstituted onto α-satellite DNA. CCAN forms edge-on contacts with CENP-A Nuc , and a linker DNA segment of the α-satellite repeat emerges from the fully wrapped end of the nucleosome to thread through the central CENP-LN channel that tightly grips the DNA. The CENP-TWSX histone-fold module further augments DNA binding and partially wraps the linker DNA in a manner reminiscent of canonical nucleosomes. Our study suggests that the topological entrapment of the linker DNA by CCAN provides a robust mechanism by which kinetochores withstand both pushing and pulling forces exerted by the mitotic spindle.},

Benefits of aboveground carbon storage, water provisioning, and especially soil erosion control and biodiversity are better delivered by native forests, with compositionally simpler, younger plantations in drier regions performing particularly poorly. However, plantations exhibit an advantage in wood production.

Here, we use phylogenetic deep mutational scanning to measure the functional effect of every possible amino acid mutation in a series of ancestral and extant steroid receptor DNA binding domains. Across 700 million years of evolution, epistatic interactions caused the effects of most mutations to become decorrelated from their initial effects and their windows of evolutionary accessibility to open and close transiently. Most effects changed gradually and without bias at rates that were largely constant across time, indicating a neutral process caused by many weak epistatic interactions. Our findings show that protein sequences drift inexorably into contingency and unpredictability, but that the process is statistically predictable, given sufficient phylogenetic and experimental data.},

We found that loss of the deubiquitinase USP8 gene in Drosophila can transform incomplete divisions of germline cells into complete divisions. Conversely, overexpression of USP8 in germline stem cells is sufficient for the reverse transformation from complete to incomplete cytokinesis. The ESCRT-III proteins CHMP2B and Shrub/CHMP4 are targets of USP8 deubiquitinating activity. In Usp8 mutant sister cells, ectopic recruitment of ESCRT proteins at intercellular bridges causes cysts to break apart. A Shrub/CHMP4 variant that cannot be ubiquitinated does not localize at abscission bridges and cannot complete abscission. Our results uncover ubiquitination of ESCRT-III as a major switch between two types of cell division.},

We demonstrate multiplexed recording using barcoded CRISPR arrays, enabling the reconstruction of transcriptional histories of isogenic bacterial strains in vivo. Record-seq therefore provides a scalable, noninvasive platform for interrogating intestinal and microbial physiology throughout the length of the intestine without manipulations to host physiology and can determine how single microbial genetic differences alter the way in which the microbe adapts to the host intestinal environment.},

To systematically resolve immune cell heterogeneity across tissues, we developed CellTypist, a machine learning tool for rapid and precise cell type annotation. Using this approach, combined with detailed curation, we determined the tissue distribution of finely phenotyped immune cell types, revealing hitherto unappreciated tissue-specific features and clonal architecture of T and B cells. Our multitissue approach lays the foundation for identifying highly resolved immune cell types by leveraging a common reference dataset, tissue-integrated expression analysis, and antigen receptor sequencing.},

Using the resulting cross-tissue atlas, we highlight shared and tissue-specific features of tissue-resident cell populations; identify cell types that might contribute to neuromuscular, metabolic, and immune components of monogenic diseases and the biological processes involved in their pathology; and determine cell types and gene modules that might underlie disease mechanisms for complex traits analyzed by genome-wide association studies.},

  abstract     = {Aging is associated with increased prevalence of axonal injuries characterized by poor regeneration and disability. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In our experiments, RNA sequencing of sciatic dorsal root ganglia (DRG) revealed significant aging-dependent enrichment in T cell signaling both before and after sciatic nerve injury (SNI) in mice. Lymphotoxin activated the transcription factor NF-κB, which induced expression of the chemokine CXCL13 by neurons. This in turn recruited CXCR5 + CD8 + T cells to injured DRG neurons overexpressing major histocompatibility complex class I. CD8 + T cells repressed the axonal regeneration of DRG neurons via caspase 3 activation. CXCL13 neutralization prevented CXCR5 + CD8 + T cell recruitment to the DRG and reversed aging-dependent regenerative decline, thereby promoting neurological recovery after SNI. Thus, axonal regeneration can be facilitated by antagonizing cross-talk between immune cells and neurons.},

  abstract     = {Challenges in fabricating all-perovskite tandem solar cells as modules rather than as single-junction configurations include growing high-quality wide-bandgap perovskites and mitigating irreversible degradation caused by halide and metal interdiffusion at the interconnecting contacts. We demonstrate efficient all-perovskite tandem solar modules using scalable fabrication techniques. By systematically tuning the cesium ratio of a methylammonium-free 1.8–electron volt mixed-halide perovskite, we improve the homogeneity of crystallization for blade-coated films over large areas. An electrically conductive conformal “diffusion barrier” is introduced between interconnecting subcells to improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability of all-perovskite tandem solar modules. Our tandem modules achieve a certified PCE of 21.7\% with an aperture area of 20 square centimeters and retain 75\% of their initial efficiency after 500 hours of continuous operation under simulated 1-sun illumination.},

The prevalence and extent to which carbon assimilation (source) or cambial activity (sink) mediate wood production are fundamentally important and remain elusive. We quantified source-sink relations across biomes by combining eddy-covariance gross primary production with extensive on-site and regional tree ring observations. We found widespread temporal decoupling between carbon assimilation and tree growth, underpinned by contrasting climatic sensitivities of these two processes. Substantial differences in assimilation-growth decoupling between angiosperms and gymnosperms were determined, as well as stronger decoupling with canopy closure, aridity, and decreasing temperatures. Our results reveal pervasive sink control over tree growth that is likely to be increasingly prominent under global climate change.},

  abstract     = {Insects have evolved sophisticated reflexes to right themselves in mid-air. Their recovery mechanisms involve complex interactions among the physical senses, muscles, body, and wings, and they must obey the laws of flight. We sought to understand the key mechanisms involved in dragonfly righting reflexes and to develop physics-based models for understanding the control strategies of flight maneuvers. Using kinematic analyses, physical modeling, and three-dimensional flight simulations, we found that a dragonfly uses left-right wing pitch asymmetry to roll its body 180 degrees to recover from falling upside down in ~200 milliseconds. Experiments of dragonflies with blocked vision further revealed that this rolling maneuver is initiated by their ocelli and compound eyes. These results suggest a pathway from the dragonfly’s visual system to the muscles regulating wing pitch that underly the recovery. The methods developed here offer quantitative tools for inferring insects’ internal actions from their acrobatics, and are applicable to a broad class of natural and robotic flying systems.},

Although methods for the synthesis of thermodynamically favored, disubstituted cyclohexanes are well established, a reliable and modular protocol for the synthesis of their stereoisomers is still elusive. Herein, we report a general strategy for the modular synthesis of disubstituted cyclohexanes with excellent kinetic stereocontrol from readily accessible substituted methylenecyclohexanes by the implementation of chain-walking catalysis. Mechanistically, the initial introduction of a sterically demanding boron ester group adjacent to the cyclohexane is key to guiding the stereochemical outcome. The synthetic potential of this methodology has been highlighted in late-stage modification of complex bioactive molecules and in comparison with current cross-coupling techniques.},

We developed a global analysis of satellite data to simultaneously monitor change in three highly interconnected intertidal ecosystem types—tidal flats, tidal marshes, and mangroves—from 1999 to 2019. Globally, 13,700 square kilometers of tidal wetlands have been lost, but these have been substantially offset by gains of 9700 km 2 , leading to a net change of −4000 km 2 over two decades. We found that 27\% of these losses and gains were associated with direct human activities such as conversion to agriculture and restoration of lost wetlands. All other changes were attributed to indirect drivers, including the effects of coastal processes and climate change.},

These nanorings undergo supramolecular polymerization in phospholipid bilayer membranes to form fluorous nanochannels, the interior walls of which are densely covered with fluorine atoms. The nanochannel with the smallest diameter exhibits a water permeation flux that is two orders of magnitude greater than those of aquaporins and carbon nanotubes. The proposed nanochannel exhibits negligible chloride ion (Cl – ) permeability caused by a powerful electrostatic barrier provided by the electrostatically negative fluorous interior surface.

However, the origins of ferroelectricity and pathways to controlling it in HfO 2 are still mysterious. We demonstrate that local helium (He) implantation can activate ferroelectricity in these materials. The possible competing mechanisms, including He ion–induced molar volume changes, vacancy redistribution, vacancy generation, and activation of vacancy mobility, are analyzed. These findings both reveal the origins of ferroelectricity in this system and open pathways for nanoengineered binary ferroelectrics.},

We found that REM sleep is associated with a somatodendritic decoupling in pyramidal neurons of the prefrontal cortex. This decoupling reflects a shift of inhibitory balance between parvalbumin neuron–mediated somatic inhibition and vasoactive intestinal peptide–mediated dendritic disinhibition, mostly driven by neurons from the central medial thalamus. REM-specific optogenetic suppression of dendritic activity led to a loss of danger-versus-safety discrimination during associative learning and a lack of synaptic plasticity, whereas optogenetic release of somatic inhibition resulted in enhanced discrimination and synaptic potentiation. Somatodendritic decoupling during REM sleep promotes opposite synaptic plasticity mechanisms that optimize emotional responses to future behavioral stressors.},

A fascinating prediction is that classical hydrodynamics emerges universally in the evolution of any interacting quantum system. We experimentally probed the quantum dynamics of 51 individually controlled ions, realizing a long-range interacting spin chain. By measuring space-time–resolved correlation functions in an infinite temperature state, we observed a whole family of hydrodynamic universality classes, ranging from normal diffusion to anomalous superdiffusion, that are described by Lévy flights. We extracted the transport coefficients of the hydrodynamic theory, reflecting the microscopic properties of the system. Our observations demonstrate the potential for engineered quantum systems to provide key insights into universal properties of nonequilibrium states of quantum matter.},

Surprisingly, KPZ universality was recently conjectured to also describe spin transport in the one-dimensional quantum Heisenberg model. We tested this conjecture by experimentally probing transport in a cold-atom quantum simulator via the relaxation of domain walls in spin chains of up to 50 spins. We found that domain-wall relaxation is indeed governed by the KPZ dynamical exponent z = 3/2 and that the occurrence of KPZ scaling requires both integrability and a nonabelian SU(2) symmetry. Finally, we leveraged the single-spin–sensitive detection enabled by the quantum gas microscope to measure an observable based on spin-transport statistics. Our results yield a clear signature of the nonlinearity that is a hallmark of KPZ universality.},

This disproportional share is fueled by high carbon sequestration rates and effective storage in peatlands, mangroves, salt marshes, and seagrass meadows, which greatly exceed those of oceanic and forest ecosystems. Here, we review how feedbacks between geomorphology and landscape-building vegetation underlie these qualities and how feedback disruption can switch wetlands from carbon sinks into sources. Currently, human activities are driving rapid declines in the area of major carbon-storing wetlands (1\% annually). Our findings highlight the urgency to stop through conservation ongoing losses and to reestablish landscape-forming feedbacks through restoration innovations that recover the role of biogeomorphic wetlands as the world’s biotic carbon hotspots.},

It is unknown how performance monitoring can be both flexible, to support different tasks, and specialized, to perform each task well. We recorded single neurons in the human medial frontal cortex while subjects performed two tasks that involve three types of cognitive conflict. Neurons encoding conflict probability, conflict, and error in one or both tasks were intermixed, forming a representational geometry that simultaneously allowed task specialization and generalization. Neurons encoding conflict retrospectively served to update internal estimates of conflict probability. Population representations of conflict were compositional. These findings reveal how representations of evaluative signals can be both abstract and task-specific and suggest a neuronal mechanism for estimating control demand.},

Here, we explore the relative importance of six drivers of vegetation change in western Africa over the past ~500,000 years (moisture availability, fire activity, mammalian herbivore density, temperature, temperature seasonality, CO 2 ) by coupling past environmental change data from Lake Bosumtwi (Ghana) with global data. We found that moisture availability and fire activity were the most important factors in determining woody cover, whereas the effect of CO 2 was small. Our findings suggest that the role of eCO 2 effects on tropical vegetation in predictive models must be reconsidered.},

The emergent ferroelectricity and hysteretic polarization switching in ultrathin ZrO 2 , conventionally a paraelectric material, notably persists down to a film thickness of 5 angstroms, the fluorite-structure unit-cell size. This approach to exploit three-dimensional centrosymmetric materials deposited down to the two-dimensional thickness limit, particularly within this model fluorite-structure system that possesses unconventional ferroelectric size effects, offers substantial promise for electronics, demonstrated by proof-of-principle atomic-scale nonvolatile ferroelectric memory on silicon. Additionally, it is also indicative of hidden electronic phenomena that are achievable across a wide class of simple binary materials.},

However, oxybenzone’s toxicity mechanism(s) are not understood, hampering development of safer sunscreens. We found that oxybenzone caused high mortality of a sea anemone under simulated sunlight including ultraviolet (UV) radiation (290 to 370 nanometers). Although oxybenzone itself protected against UV-induced photo-oxidation, both the anemone and a mushroom coral formed oxybenzone–glucoside conjugates that were strong photo-oxidants. Algal symbionts sequestered these conjugates, and mortality correlated with conjugate concentrations in animal cytoplasm. Higher mortality in anemones that lacked symbionts suggests an enhanced risk from oxybenzone to corals bleached by rising temperatures. Because many commercial sunscreens contain structurally related chemicals, understanding metabolite phototoxicity should facilitate the development of coral-safe products.},

Here, we use magnetotelluric and passive seismic data from Whillans Ice Stream, West Antarctica, to provide the first observations of deep sub–ice stream groundwater. Our data reveal a volume of groundwater within a &gt;1-kilometer-thick sedimentary basin that is more than an order of magnitude larger than the known subglacial system. A vertical salinity gradient indicates exchange between paleo seawater at depth and contemporary basal meltwater above. Our results provide new constraints for subglacial water systems that affect ice streaming and subglacial biogeochemical processes.},

  abstract     = {In cases of severe wildlife population decline, a key question is whether recovery efforts will be impeded by genetic factors, such as inbreeding depression. Decades of excess mortality from gillnet fishing have driven Mexico’s vaquita porpoise ( Phocoena sinus ) to ~10 remaining individuals. We analyzed whole-genome sequences from 20 vaquitas and integrated genomic and demographic information into stochastic, individual-based simulations to quantify the species’ recovery potential. Our analysis suggests that the vaquita’s historical rarity has resulted in a low burden of segregating deleterious variation, reducing the risk of inbreeding depression. Similarly, genome-informed simulations suggest that the vaquita can recover if bycatch mortality is immediately halted. This study provides hope for vaquitas and other naturally rare endangered species and highlights the utility of genomics in predicting extinction risk.},

  abstract     = {Epistasis can markedly affect evolutionary trajectories. In recent decades, protein-level fitness landscapes have revealed extensive idiosyncratic epistasis among specific mutations. By contrast, other work has found ubiquitous and apparently nonspecific patterns of global diminishing-returns and increasing-costs epistasis among mutations across the genome. Here, we used a hierarchical CRISPR gene drive system to construct all combinations of 10 missense mutations from across the genome in budding yeast and measured their fitness in six environments. We show that the resulting fitness landscapes exhibit global fitness–correlated trends but that these trends emerge from specific idiosyncratic interactions. We thus provide experimental validation of recent theoretical work arguing that fitness-correlated trends can emerge as the generic consequence of idiosyncratic epistasis.},

  abstract     = {Bioelectronics needs to continuously monitor mechanical and electrophysiological signals for patients. However, the signals always include artifacts by patients’ unexpected movement (such as walking and respiration under approximately 30 hertz). The current method to remove them is a signal process that uses a bandpass filter, which may cause signal loss. We present an unconventional bandpass filter material—viscoelastic gelatin-chitosan hydrogel damper, inspired by the viscoelastic cuticular pad in a spider—to remove dynamic mechanical noise artifacts selectively. The hydrogel exhibits frequency-dependent phase transition that results in a rubbery state that damps low-frequency noise and a glassy state that transmits the desired high-frequency signals. It serves as an adaptable passfilter that enables the acquisition of high-quality signals from patients while minimizing signal process for advanced bioelectronics.},

Most current approaches offer only very small frequency shifts and limited tunability, while suffering from high insertion loss and Raman noise originating in the materials used. We introduce a route to quantum-correlation–preserving frequency conversion using hydrogen-filled antiresonant-reflecting photonic crystal fibers. Transient optical phonons generated by stimulated Raman scattering enable selective frequency up-conversion by 125 terahertz of the idler photon of an entangled pair, with efficiencies up to 70\%. This threshold-less molecular modulation process preserves quantum correlations, making it ideal for applications in quantum information.},

The ammoximation of several additional simple ketones is also demonstrated. Our approach eliminates the need to transport and store highly concentrated, stabilized H 2 O 2 , potentially achieving substantial environmental and economic savings.

If global warming continues, heatstroke might become a more prominent cause of mortality worldwide, but its pathogenic mechanism is not well understood. We found that Z-DNA binding protein 1 (ZBP1), a Z–nucleic acid receptor, mediated heatstroke by triggering receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3)–dependent cell death. Heat stress increased the expression of ZBP1 through heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1) and activated ZBP1 through a mechanism independent of the nucleic acid sensing action. Deletion of ZBP1, RIPK3, or both mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL) and caspase-8 decreased heat stress–induced circulatory failure, organ injury, and lethality. Thus, ZBP1 appears to have a second function that orchestrates host responses to heat stress.},

We used x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy at 180 to 500 millibar to probe the nature of Zn and reaction intermediates during CO 2 /CO hydrogenation over Zn/ZnO/Cu(211), where the temperature is sufficiently high for the reaction to rapidly turn over, thus creating an almost adsorbate-free surface. Tuning of the grazing incidence angle makes it possible to achieve either surface or bulk sensitivity. Hydrogenation of CO 2 gives preference to ZnO in the form of clusters or nanoparticles, whereas in pure CO a surface Zn-Cu alloy becomes more prominent. The results reveal a specific role of CO in the formation of the Zn-Cu surface alloy as an active phase that facilitates efficient CO 2 methanol synthesis.},

Annually, 27\% of land-use emissions and 22\% of agricultural land are related to agricultural products ultimately consumed in a different region from where they were produced. Roughly three-quarters of embodied emissions are from land-use change, with the largest transfers from lower-income countries such as Brazil, Indonesia, and Argentina to more industrialized regions such as Europe, the United States, and China. Mitigation of global land-use emissions and sustainable development may thus depend on improving the transparency of supply chains.},

We interrogated breed stereotypes by surveying owners of 18,385 purebred and mixed-breed dogs and genotyping 2155 dogs. Most behavioral traits are heritable [heritability ( h 2 ) &gt; 25\%], and admixture patterns in mixed-breed dogs reveal breed propensities. Breed explains just 9\% of behavioral variation in individuals. Genome-wide association analyses identify 11 loci that are significantly associated with behavior, and characteristic breed behaviors exhibit genetic complexity. Behavioral loci are not unusually differentiated in breeds, but breed propensities align, albeit weakly, with ancestral function. We propose that behaviors perceived as characteristic of modern breeds derive from thousands of years of polygenic adaptation that predates breed formation, with modern breeds distinguished primarily by aesthetic traits.},

We sequentially introduced mutations into healthy human melanocytes in up to five genes spanning six commonly disrupted melanoma pathways, forming nine genetically distinct cellular models of melanoma. We connected mutant melanocyte genotypes to malignant cell expression programs in vitro and in vivo, replicative immortality, malignancy, rapid tumor growth, pigmentation, metastasis, and histopathology. Mutations in malignant cells also affected tumor microenvironment composition and cell states. Our melanoma models shared genotype-associated expression programs with patient melanomas, and a deep learning model showed that these models partially recapitulated genotype-associated histopathological features as well. Thus, a progressive series of genome-edited human cancer models can causally connect genotypes carrying multiple mutations to phenotype.},

This is because many of the necessary chemical transformations required to modify compound cores in a straightforward fashion are not applicable in complex contexts. We report a method that addresses one facet of this problem by allowing chemists to hop directly between chemically distinct heteroaromatic scaffolds. Specifically, we show that selective photolysis of quinoline N -oxides with 390-nanometer light followed by acid-promoted rearrangement affords N -acylindoles while showing broad compatibility with medicinally relevant functionality. Applications to late-stage skeletal modification of compounds of pharmaceutical interest and more complex transformations involving serial single-atom changes are demonstrated.},

With accelerating greenhouse gas emissions, species losses from warming and oxygen depletion alone become comparable to current direct human impacts within a century and culminate in a mass extinction rivaling those in Earth’s past. Polar species are at highest risk of extinction, but local biological richness declines more in the tropics. Reversing greenhouse gas emissions trends would diminish extinction risks by more than 70\%, preserving marine biodiversity accumulated over the past ~50 million years of evolutionary history.},

Their orbital motion should generate a gravitational wave background (GWB) at nanohertz frequencies. Searches for this background use pulsar timing arrays, which perform long-term monitoring of millisecond pulsars at radio wavelengths. We used 12.5 years of Fermi Large Area Telescope data to form a gamma-ray pulsar timing array. Results from 35 bright gamma-ray pulsars place a 95\% credible limit on the GWB characteristic strain of 1.0 × 10 −14 at a frequency of 1 year –1 . The sensitivity is expected to scale with t obs , the observing time span, as t obs − 13 / 6 . This direct measurement provides an independent probe of the GWB while offering a check on radio noise models.},

Through statistical analysis of thousands of particles using x-ray phase contrast holotomography in a LiNi 0.8 Mn 0.1 Co 0.1 O 2 -based cathode, we found that the local network heterogeneity results in asynchronous activities in the early cycles, and subsequently the particle assemblies move toward a synchronous behavior.

Canine rabies is a fatal zoonosis that circulates endemically at low prevalence among domestic dogs in low- and middle-income countries. We traced rabies transmission in a population of 50,000 dogs in Tanzania from 2002 to 2016 and applied individual-based models to these spatially resolved data to investigate the mechanisms modulating transmission and the scale over which they operate. Although rabies prevalence never exceeded 0.15\%, the best-fitting models demonstrated appreciable depletion of susceptible animals that occurred at local scales because of clusters of deaths and dogs already incubating infection. Individual variation in rabid dog behavior facilitated virus dispersal and cocirculation of virus lineages, enabling metapopulation persistence. These mechanisms have important implications for prediction and control of pathogens that circulate in spatially structured populations.},

In this study, we focused on honey bees, which perform intensive foraging activities to satisfy colony needs, and sought to determine whether foragers leave the hive driven by specific expectations about reward and whether they recollect these expectations during their waggle dances. We monitored foraging and dance behavior and simultaneously quantified and interfered with biogenic amine signaling in the bee brain. We show that a dopamine-dependent wanting system is activated transiently in the bee brain by increased appetite and individual recollection of profitable food sources, both en route to the goal and during waggle dances. Our results show that insects share with mammals common neural mechanisms for encoding wanting of stimuli with positive hedonic value.},

We investigate hydrogels that similarly transduce pressure into ionic currents, forming a piezoionic skin. As in rapid- and slow-adapting mechanoreceptors, piezoionic currents can vary widely in duration, from milliseconds to hundreds of seconds. These currents are shown to elicit direct neuromodulation and muscle excitation, suggesting a path toward bionic sensory interfaces. The signal magnitude and duration depend on cationic and anionic mobility differences. Patterned hydrogel films with gradients of fixed charge provide voltage offsets akin to cell potentials. The combined effects enable the creation of self-powered and ultrasoft piezoionic mechanoreceptors that generate a charge density four to six orders of magnitude higher than those of triboelectric and piezoelectric devices.},

  abstract     = {Animal genomes are folded into loops and topologically associating domains (TADs) by CTCF and loop-extruding cohesins, but the live dynamics of loop formation and stability remain unknown. Here, we directly visualized chromatin looping at the Fbn2 TAD in mouse embryonic stem cells using super-resolution live-cell imaging and quantified looping dynamics by Bayesian inference. Unexpectedly, the Fbn2 loop was both rare and dynamic, with a looped fraction of approximately 3 to 6.5\% and a median loop lifetime of approximately 10 to 30 minutes. Our results establish that the Fbn2 TAD is highly dynamic, and about 92\% of the time, cohesin-extruded loops exist within the TAD without bridging both CTCF boundaries. This suggests that single CTCF boundaries, rather than the fully CTCF-CTCF looped state, may be the primary regulators of functional interactions.},

  abstract     = {The crystallographic pore sizes of zeolites are substantially smaller than those inferred from catalytic transformation and molecular sieving capabilities, which reflects flexible variation in zeolite opening pores. Using in situ electron microscopy, we imaged the straight channels of ZSM-5 zeolite with benzene as a probe molecule and observed subcell flexibility of the framework. The opening pores stretched along the longest direction of confined benzene molecules with a maximum aspect change of 15\%, and the Pnma space group symmetry of the MFI framework caused adjacent channels to deform. This compensation maintained the stability and rigidity of the overall unit cell within 0.5\% deformation. The subcell flexibility originates mainly from the topologically soft silicon-oxygen-silicon hinges between rigid tetrahedral SiO 4 units, with inner angles varying from 135° to 153°, as confirmed by ab initio molecular dynamics simulations.},

  abstract     = {Pleasant touch provides emotional and psychological support that helps mitigate social isolation and stress. However, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Using a pleasant touch–conditioned place preference (PT-CPP) test, we show that genetic ablation of spinal excitatory interneurons expressing prokineticin receptor 2 (PROKR2), or its ligand PROK2 in sensory neurons, abolishes PT-CPP without impairing pain and itch behaviors in mice. Mutant mice display profound impairments in stress response and prosocial behaviors. Moreover, PROKR2 neurons respond most vigorously to gentle stroking and encode reward value. Collectively, we identify PROK2 as a long-sought neuropeptide that encodes and transmits pleasant touch to spinal PROKR2 neurons. These findings may have important implications for elucidating mechanisms by which pleasant touch deprivation contributes to social avoidance behavior and mental disorders.},

  abstract     = {Genotoxic therapy such as radiation serves as a frontline cancer treatment, yet acquired resistance that leads to tumor reoccurrence is frequent. We found that cancer cells maintain viability during irradiation by reversibly increasing genome-wide DNA breaks, thereby limiting premature mitotic progression. We identify caspase-activated DNase (CAD) as the nuclease inflicting these de novo DNA lesions at defined loci, which are in proximity to chromatin-modifying CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) sites. CAD nuclease activity is governed through phosphorylation by DNA damage response kinases, independent of caspase activity. In turn, loss of CAD activity impairs cell fate decisions, rendering cancer cells vulnerable to radiation-induced DNA double-strand breaks. Our observations highlight a cancer-selective survival adaptation, whereby tumor cells deploy regulated DNA breaks to delimit the detrimental effects of therapy-evoked DNA damage.},

At current prices, these are estimated at around US$1 billion per day (4), representing an important lifeline for an economy under heavy financial sanctions in response to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. The European Union (EU) buys 75\% of Russian gas exports and 50\% of Russian oil exports (5). An EU embargo on Russia would substantially undermine Putin’s geopolitical and economic positions. However, given a full embargo’s potential impacts on the EU, securing the approval of all EU countries is difficult. To limit Russia’s oil and gas revenues while keeping up the flows, the EU should instead introduce a tariff on Russian oil and gas imports. The tariff can be adapted to the economic and political dynamics of the conflicts.},

To provide insight into effective neutralization, we determined cryo–electron microscopy structures and evaluated receptor binding domain (RBD) antibodies for their ability to bind and neutralize B.1.1.529. Mutations altered 16\% of the B.1.1.529 RBD surface, clustered on an RBD ridge overlapping the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)–binding surface and reduced binding of most antibodies. Substantial inhibitory activity was retained by select monoclonal antibodies—including A23-58.1, B1-182.1, COV2-2196, S2E12, A19-46.1, S309, and LY-CoV1404—that accommodated these changes and neutralized B.1.1.529.

Although its first generation has revolutionized conventional lenses and enabled anomalous refraction, new classes of meta-optics can now shape light and dark features of an optical field with an unprecedented level of complexity and multifunctionality. Here, we review these efforts with a focus on metasurfaces that use different properties of input light—angle of incidence and direction, polarization, phase distribution, wavelength, and nonlinear behavior—as optical knobs for tuning the output response. We discuss ongoing advances in this area as well as future challenges and prospects. These recent developments indicate that optically tunable flat optics is poised to advance adaptive camera systems, microscopes, holograms, and portable and wearable devices and may suggest new possibilities in optical communications and sensing.},

However, identifying the evolutionary impacts of human activities is challenging because of a lack of temporal data and limited knowledge of the genetic basis of most traits. Here, we identify the drivers of evolution toward maturity at an earlier age in Atlantic salmon through two types of fisheries-induced evolution acting in opposing directions: an indirect effect linked with harvest of a salmon prey species (capelin) at sea (selection against late maturation) and a direct effect due to net fishing in rivers (selection against early maturation). Because capelin are harvested as an aquaculture feed protein source, we hereby determine an indirect path by which salmon aquaculture may influence wild salmon populations.},

Reactions rely on the merger of an electrochemically active complex that selectively reacts with alkyl bromides through 1e – processes and an electrochemically inactive Ni 0 (phosphine) complex that selectively reacts with aryl electrophiles through 2e – processes. Accessing Ni 0 (phosphine) intermediates is critical to the strategy but is often challenging. We uncover a previously unknown pathway for electrochemically generating these key complexes at mild potentials through a choreographed series of ligand-exchange reactions.

Because such excitons display weak electron-hole overlap, most studies have examined only the lowest-energy excitons through photoluminescence. We directly measured the dielectric response of interlayer excitons, which we accessed using their static electric dipole moment. We thereby determined an intrinsic radiative lifetime of 0.40 nanoseconds for the lowest direct-gap interlayer exciton in a tungsten diselenide/molybdenum diselenide heterostructure. We found that differences in electric field and twist angle induced trends in exciton transition strengths and energies, which could be related to wave function overlap, moiré confinement, and atomic reconstruction. Through comparison with photoluminescence spectra, this study identifies a momentum-indirect emission mechanism. Characterization of the absorption is key for applications relying on light-matter interactions.},

A peculiar example of such a state is the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state, induced by a time-reversal symmetry–breaking magnetic field applied to spin-singlet superconductors. This state is intrinsically accompanied by the superconducting spin smecticity, spin density–modulated fluidity with spontaneous translational-symmetry breaking. Detection of such spin smecticity provides unambiguous evidence for the FFLO state, but its observation has been challenging. Here, we report the characteristic “double-horn” nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum in the layered superconductor Sr 2 RuO 4 near its upper critical field, indicating the spatial sinusoidal modulation of spin density that is consistent with superconducting spin smecticity. Our work reveals that Sr 2 RuO 4 provides a versatile platform for studying FFLO physics.},

Although migration through pores and tracks in the extracellular matrix (ECM) has been well studied, little is known about cellular traversal into confining cell-dense tissues. We find that embryonic tissue invasion by Drosophila macrophages requires division of an epithelial ectodermal cell at the site of entry. Dividing ectodermal cells disassemble ECM attachment formed by integrin-mediated focal adhesions next to mesodermal cells, allowing macrophages to move their nuclei ahead and invade between two immediately adjacent tissues. Invasion efficiency depends on division frequency, but reduction of adhesion strength allows macrophage entry independently of division. This work demonstrates that tissue dynamics can regulate cellular infiltration.},

  abstract     = {Natural molecular machines contain protein components that undergo motion relative to each other. Designing such mechanically constrained nanoscale protein architectures with internal degrees of freedom is an outstanding challenge for computational protein design. Here we explore the de novo construction of protein machinery from designed axle and rotor components with internal cyclic or dihedral symmetry. We find that the axle-rotor systems assemble in vitro and in vivo as designed. Using cryo–electron microscopy, we find that these systems populate conformationally variable relative orientations reflecting the symmetry of the coupled components and the computationally designed interface energy landscape. These mechanical systems with internal degrees of freedom are a step toward the design of genetically encodable nanomachines.},

  abstract     = {Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and natural killer cells kill virus-infected and tumor cells through the polarized release of perforin and granzymes. Perforin is a pore-forming toxin that creates a lesion in the plasma membrane of the target cell through which granzymes enter the cytosol and initiate apoptosis. Endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) proteins are involved in the repair of small membrane wounds. We found that ESCRT proteins were precisely recruited in target cells to sites of CTL engagement immediately after perforin release. Inhibition of ESCRT machinery in cancer-derived cells enhanced their susceptibility to CTL-mediated killing. Thus, repair of perforin pores by ESCRT machinery limits granzyme entry into the cytosol, potentially enabling target cells to resist cytolytic attack.},

  abstract     = {Relaxor-lead titanate (PbTiO 3 ) crystals, which exhibit extremely high piezoelectricity, are believed to possess high electro-optic (EO) coefficients. However, the optical transparency of relaxor-PbTiO 3 crystals is severely reduced as a result of light scattering and reflection by domain walls, limiting electro-optic applications. Through synergistic design of a ferroelectric phase, crystal orientation, and poling technique, we successfully removed all light-scattering domain walls and achieved an extremely high transmittance of 99.6\% in antireflection film–coated crystals, with an ultrahigh EO coefficient r 33 of 900 picometers per volt (pm V −1 ), &gt;30 times as high as that of conventionally used EO crystals. Using these crystals, we fabricated ultracompact EO Q-switches that require very low driving voltages, with superior performance to that of commercial Q-switches. Development of these materials is important for the portability and low driving voltage of EO devices.},

In addition, previously banned substances could then be reevaluated under these new rules.

Over the past century, humans have more than doubled the global supply of reactive N through industrial and agricultural activities. However, long-term records demonstrate that N availability is declining in many regions of the world. Reactive N inputs are not evenly distributed, and global changes—including elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) levels and rising temperatures—are affecting ecosystem N supply relative to demand. Declining N availability is constraining primary productivity, contributing to lower leaf N concentrations, and reducing the quality of herbivore diets in many ecosystems. We outline the current state of knowledge about declining N availability and propose actions aimed at characterizing and responding to this emerging challenge.},

We found that the cell-to-cell variations of specific lipid metabolic pathways contribute to the establishment of cell states involved in the organization of skin architecture. Sphingolipid composition is shown to define fibroblast subpopulations, with sphingolipid metabolic rewiring driving cell-state transitions. Therefore, cell-to-cell lipid heterogeneity affects the determination of cell states, adding a new regulatory component to the self-organization of multicellular systems.},

The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway is a potential therapeutic target, but conflicting interpretations have been proposed for how mTORC1 controls lipid homeostasis. We show that selective inhibition of mTORC1 signaling in mice, through deletion of the RagC/D guanosine triphosphatase–activating protein folliculin (FLCN), promotes activation of transcription factor E3 (TFE3) in the liver without affecting other mTORC1 targets and protects against NAFLD and NASH. Disease protection is mediated by TFE3, which both induces lipid consumption and suppresses anabolic lipogenesis. TFE3 inhibits lipogenesis by suppressing proteolytic processing and activation of sterol regulatory element–binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) and by interacting with SREBP-1c on chromatin. Our data reconcile previously conflicting studies and identify selective inhibition of mTORC1 as a potential approach to treat NASH and NAFLD.},

Activity-dependent plasticity of synaptic input is a major underlying cellular process. Although we have a detailed understanding of synaptic and dendritic plasticity in vitro, little is known about the functional and plastic properties of active dendrites in behaving animals. Using deep brain two-photon Ca 2+ imaging, we investigated how sensory responses in amygdala principal neurons develop upon classical fear conditioning, a form of associative learning. Fear conditioning induced differential plasticity in dendrites and somas regulated by compartment-specific inhibition. Our results indicate that learning-induced plasticity can be uncoupled between soma and dendrites, reflecting distinct synaptic and microcircuit-level mechanisms that increase the computational capacity of amygdala circuits.},

However, many organisms form crystals with intricate morphologies, as exemplified by coccoliths, microscopic calcite crystal arrays produced by unicellular algae. The complex morphologies of the coccolith crystals were hypothesized to materialize from numerous crystallographic facets, stabilized by fine-tuned interactions between organic molecules and the growing crystals. Using electron tomography, we examined multiple stages of coccolith development in three dimensions. We found that the crystals express only one set of symmetry-related crystallographic facets, which grow differentially to yield highly anisotropic shapes. Morphological chirality arises from positioning the crystals along specific edges of these same facets. Our findings suggest that growth rate manipulations are sufficient to yield complex crystalline morphologies.},

We used turgor pressure and electroosmosis to realize a strong and fast hydrogel-based actuator. A turgor actuator fabricated with a gel confined by a selectively permeable membrane can retain a high osmotic pressure that drives gel swelling; thus, our actuator exerts large stress [0.73 megapascals (MPa) in 96 minutes (min)] with a 1.16 cubic centimeters of hydrogel. With the accelerated water transport caused by electroosmosis, the gel swells rapidly, enhancing the actuation speed (0.79 MPa in 9 min).

Tumor necrosis factor signaling can eliminate clonal malignancies from Drosophila imaginal epithelia, but why this pathway is activated in tumor cells but not normal tissue is unknown. We show that the ligand that drives elimination is present in basolateral circulation but remains latent because it is spatially segregated from its apically localized receptor. Polarity defects associated with malignant transformation cause receptor mislocalization, allowing ligand binding and subsequent apoptotic signaling. This process occurs irrespective of the neighboring cells’ genotype and is thus distinct from cell competition. Related phenomena at epithelial wound sites are required for efficient repair. This mechanism of polarized compartmentalization of ligand and receptor can generally monitor epithelial integrity to promote tissue homeostasis.},

Here, x-ray spectromicroscopic imaging complemented by modeling provides direct evidence for OC-induced patterning inside photoactive particles. Single iron(III)–citrate particles were probed using the iron oxidation state as a photochemical marker. Based on these results, we predict an overall acceleration of photochemical reactions by a factor of two to three for most classes of atmospheric aerosol particles. Rotation of free aerosol particles and intraparticle molecular transport generally accelerate the photochemistry.

Hydrogenation of dimethyl oxalate over a C 60 -Cu/SiO 2 catalyst at ambient pressure and temperatures of 180° to 190°C had an EG yield of up to 98 ± 1\%. In a kilogram-scale reaction, no deactivation of the catalyst was seen after 1000 hours.

  abstract     = {On 14 August 2021, the moment magnitude ( M w ) 7.2 Nippes earthquake in Haiti occurred within the same fault zone as its devastating 2010 M w 7.0 predecessor, but struck the country when field access was limited by insecurity and conventional seismometers from the national network were inoperative. A network of citizen seismometers installed in 2019 provided near-field data critical to rapidly understand the mechanism of the mainshock and monitor its aftershock sequence. Their real-time data defined two aftershock clusters that coincide with two areas of coseismic slip derived from inversions of conventional seismological and geodetic data. Machine learning applied to data from the citizen seismometer closest to the mainshock allows us to forecast aftershocks as accurately as with the network-derived catalog. This shows the utility of citizen science contributing to our understanding of a major earthquake.},

  abstract     = {Intermolecular cross-coupling of terminal olefins with secondary amines to form complex tertiary amines—a common motif in pharmaceuticals—remains a major challenge in chemical synthesis. Basic amine nucleophiles in nondirected, electrophilic metal–catalyzed aminations tend to bind to and thereby inhibit metal catalysts. We reasoned that an autoregulatory mechanism coupling the release of amine nucleophiles with catalyst turnover could enable functionalization without inhibiting metal-mediated heterolytic carbon-hydrogen cleavage. Here, we report a palladium(II)-catalyzed allylic carbon-hydrogen amination cross-coupling using this strategy, featuring 48 cyclic and acyclic secondary amines (10 pharmaceutically relevant cores) and 34 terminal olefins (bearing electrophilic functionality) to furnish 81 tertiary allylic amines, including 12 drug compounds and 10 complex drug derivatives, with excellent regio- and stereoselectivity (&gt;20:1 linear:branched, &gt;20:1 E : Z ).},

  abstract     = {Tuft dendrites of layer 5 pyramidal neurons form specialized compartments important for motor learning and performance, yet their computational capabilities remain unclear. Structural-functional mapping of the tuft tree from the motor cortex during motor tasks revealed two morphologically distinct populations of layer 5 pyramidal tract neurons (PTNs) that exhibit specific tuft computational properties. Early bifurcating and large nexus PTNs showed marked tuft functional compartmentalization, representing different motor variable combinations within and between their two tuft hemi-trees. By contrast, late bifurcating and smaller nexus PTNs showed synchronous tuft activation. Dendritic structure and dynamic recruitment of the N -methyl- d -aspartate (NMDA)–spiking mechanism explained the differential compartmentalization patterns. Our findings support a morphologically dependent framework for motor computations, in which independent amplification units can be combinatorically recruited to represent different motor sequences within the same tree.},

Sizing and targeting sanctions to ensure that their impact on Putin and his designs exceeds the downsides for Western and global interests requires some reflection, however. Such reflection should not be pushed aside in the understandable heat and anguish of the moment. As Western scientists who have engaged in international collaborations in many forms on many topics, we welcome the outpouring of support across the West for Ukrainian scientists, including the introduction of protected visa status for Ukrainians (1). At the same time, we urge that our nations’ policy-makers and our science and technology communities avoid shunning all Russian scientists for the actions of the Russian government.},

Follow-up observations by another team (2) showed that the detection could have been a false positive. The object might instead have been an unusually fast-moving background source, whose motion is coincidentally aligned with HD 131399, causing it to pass our common proper motion tests. We have now obtained additional observations of the system, spanning a longer time period (3). These show that the primary star, HD 131399A, has a parallax at least several times greater than the putative exoplanet, indicating that they are at substantially different distances. This confirms that the object is a background source, not an exoplanet associated with HD 131399. We are therefore retracting the Research Article. All authors agree with this retraction.},

Because of their multielemental compositions and unique high-entropy mixing states (i.e., solid-solution) that can lead to tunable activity and enhanced stability, these nanoparticles have received notable attention for catalyst design and exploration. However, this strong potential is also accompanied by grand challenges originating from their vast compositional space and complex atomic structure, which hinder comprehensive exploration and fundamental understanding. Through a multidisciplinary view of synthesis, characterization, catalytic applications, high-throughput screening, and data-driven materials discovery, this review is dedicated to discussing the important progress of high-entropy nanoparticles and unveiling the critical needs for their future development for catalysis, energy, and sustainability applications.},

Affinity-matured TCRs can enhance the efficacy of TCR–T cell therapy but can also cross-react with off-target antigens, resulting in organ immunopathology. We developed an alternative strategy to isolate TCR mutants that exhibited high activation signals coupled with low-affinity pMHC binding through the acquisition of catch bonds. Engineered analogs of a tumor antigen MAGE-A3–specific TCR maintained physiological affinities while exhibiting enhanced target killing potency and undetectable cross-reactivity, compared with a high-affinity clinically tested TCR that exhibited lethal cross-reactivity with a cardiac antigen. Catch bond engineering is a biophysically based strategy to tune high-sensitivity TCRs for T cell therapy with reduced potential for adverse cross-reactivity.},

Noncoding events near tissue-specific genes, such as ALB in the liver or KLK3 in the prostate, characterized localized passenger mutation patterns and may reflect tumor-cell-of-origin imprinting. Noncoding events in regulatory promoter and enhancer regions frequently involved cancer-relevant genes such as BCL6 , FGFR2 , RAD51B , SMC6 , TERT , and XBP1 and represent possible drivers. Unlike most noncoding regulatory events, XBP1 mutations primarily accumulated outside the gene’s promoter, and we validated their effect on gene expression using CRISPR-interference screening and luciferase reporter assays. Broadly, our study provides a blueprint for capturing mutation events across the entire genome to guide advances in biological discovery, therapies, and diagnostics.},

For 14 cell types, we identified 26,597 independent cis-expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and 990 trans-eQTLs, with most showing cell type–specific effects on gene expression. We subsequently show how eQTLs have dynamic allelic effects in B cells that are transitioning from naïve to memory states and demonstrate how commonly segregating alleles lead to interindividual variation in immune function. Finally, using a Mendelian randomization approach, we identify the causal route by which 305 risk loci contribute to autoimmune disease at the cellular level.

Cases exhibited elevated expression of type 1 interferon–stimulated genes (ISGs) in monocytes, reduction of naïve CD4 + T cells that correlated with monocyte ISG expression, and expansion of repertoire-restricted cytotoxic GZMH + CD8 + T cells. Cell type–specific expression features predicted case-control status and stratified patients into two molecular subtypes. We integrated dense genotyping data to map cell type–specific cis–expression quantitative trait loci and to link SLE-associated variants to cell type–specific expression.

Leveraging advances in nano-focused hard x-rays, DNA-programmable nanoparticle assembly, and nanoscale inorganic templating, we demonstrate nondestructive three-dimensional imaging of complexly organized nanoparticles and multimaterial frameworks. In a three-dimensional lattice with a size of 2 micrometers, we determined the positions of about 10,000 individual nanoparticles with 7-nanometer resolution, and identified arrangements of assembly motifs and a resulting multimaterial framework with elemental sensitivity. The real-space reconstruction permits direct three-dimensional imaging of lattices, which reveals their imperfections and interfaces and also clarifies the relationship between lattices and assembly motifs.},

One particularly powerful experimental observable that tests QED independently of traditional energy level measurements is the “tune-out” frequency, where the dynamic polarizability vanishes and the atom does not interact with applied laser light. In this work, we measure the tune-out frequency for the 2 3 S 1 state of helium between transitions to the 2 3 P and 3 3 P manifolds and compare it with new theoretical QED calculations. The experimentally determined value of 725,736,700(260) megahertz differs from theory [725,736,252(9) megahertz] by 1.7 times the measurement uncertainty and resolves both the QED contributions and retardation corrections.},

We reveal the normal-state structural and electronic properties of TTG using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy at twist angles for which superconductivity has been observed. Real trilayer samples undergo a strong reconstruction of the moiré lattice, which locks layers into near–magic-angle, mirror symmetric domains comparable in size with the superconducting coherence length. This relaxation introduces an array of localized twist-angle faults, termed twistons and moiré solitons, whose electronic structure deviates strongly from the background regions, leading to a doping-dependent, spatially granular electronic landscape. The Fermi-level density of states is maximally uniform at dopings for which superconductivity has been observed in transport measurements.},

The magnitude of the stress depends on the type and amount of mineral. Using in-operando synchrotron x-ray scattering, we analyzed the kinetics of mineral deposition. Whereas no contraction occurs when the mineral deposits outside fibrils only, intrafibrillar mineralization generates fibril contraction. This chemomechanical effect occurs with collagen fully immersed in water and generates a mineral-collagen composite with tensile fibers, reminiscent of the principle of reinforced concrete.},

Our electrically tunable system allows reconstruction of the Riemann surface associated with the complex energy landscape and provides topological control of light by tuning the loss imbalance and frequency detuning of interacting modes.

The gonadal somatic cells support maturation and epigenetic reprogramming of the PGCLCs. When rat PGCLCs are transplanted into the seminiferous tubules of germline-less rats, functional spermatids—that is, those capable of siring viable offspring—are generated.

We measure the W boson mass, M W , using data corresponding to 8.8 inverse femtobarns of integrated luminosity collected in proton-antiproton collisions at a 1.96 tera–electron volt center-of-mass energy with the CDF II detector at the Fermilab Tevatron collider. A sample of approximately 4 million W boson candidates is used to obtain M W = 80 , 433.5 ± 6.4 stat ± 6.9 syst = 80 , 433.5 ± 9.4 MeV / c 2 , the precision of which exceeds that of all previous measurements combined (stat, statistical uncertainty; syst, systematic uncertainty; MeV, mega–electron volts; c , speed of light in a vacuum). This measurement is in significant tension with the standard model expectation.},

  abstract     = {Cytokines signal through cell surface receptor dimers to initiate activation of intracellular Janus kinases (JAKs). We report the 3.6-angstrom–resolution cryo–electron microscopy structure of full-length JAK1 complexed with a cytokine receptor intracellular domain Box1 and Box2 regions captured as an activated homodimer bearing the valine→phenylalanine (VF) mutation prevalent in myeloproliferative neoplasms. The seven domains of JAK1 form an extended structural unit, the dimerization of which is mediated by close-packing of the pseudokinase (PK) domains from the monomeric subunits. The oncogenic VF mutation lies within the core of the JAK1 PK interdimer interface, enhancing packing complementarity to facilitate ligand-independent activation. The carboxy-terminal tyrosine kinase domains are poised for transactivation and to phosphorylate the receptor STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription)–recruiting motifs projecting from the overhanging FERM (four-point-one, ezrin, radixin, moesin)–SH2 (Src homology 2)-domains. Mapping of constitutively active JAK mutants supports a two-step allosteric activation mechanism and reveals opportunities for selective therapeutic targeting of oncogenic JAK signaling.},

  abstract     = {Whereas DNA viruses are known to be abundant, diverse, and commonly key ecosystem players, RNA viruses are insufficiently studied outside disease settings. In this study, we analyzed ≈28 terabases of Global Ocean RNA sequences to expand Earth’s RNA virus catalogs and their taxonomy, investigate their evolutionary origins, and assess their marine biogeography from pole to pole. Using new approaches to optimize discovery and classification, we identified RNA viruses that necessitate substantive revisions of taxonomy (doubling phyla and adding &gt;50\% new classes) and evolutionary understanding. “Species”-rank abundance determination revealed that viruses of the new phyla “ Taraviricota ,” a missing link in early RNA virus evolution, and “ Arctiviricota ” are widespread and dominant in the oceans. These efforts provide foundational knowledge critical to integrating RNA viruses into ecological and epidemiological models.},

Now, a complete, telomere-to-telomere human genome assembly (T2T-CHM13) has enabled us to comprehensively characterize pericentromeric and centromeric repeats, which constitute 6.2\% of the genome (189.9 megabases). Detailed maps of these regions revealed multimegabase structural rearrangements, including in active centromeric repeat arrays. Analysis of centromere-associated sequences uncovered a strong relationship between the position of the centromere and the evolution of the surrounding DNA through layered repeat expansions. Furthermore, comparisons of chromosome X centromeres across a diverse panel of individuals illuminated high degrees of structural, epigenetic, and sequence variation in these complex and rapidly evolving regions.},

We identify hundreds of thousands of variants per sample in previously unresolved regions, showcasing the promise of the T2T-CHM13 reference for evolutionary and biomedical discovery. Simultaneously, this reference eliminates tens of thousands of spurious variants per sample, including reduction of false positives in 269 medically relevant genes by up to a factor of 12.

SDs account for nearly one-third of the additional sequence, increasing the genome-wide estimate from 5.4 to 7.0\% [218 million base pairs (Mbp)]. An analysis of 268 human genomes shows that 91\% of the previously unresolved T2T-CHM13 SD sequence (68.3 Mbp) better represents human copy number variation. Comparing long-read assemblies from human ( n = 12) and nonhuman primate ( n = 5) genomes, we systematically reconstruct the evolution and structural haplotype diversity of biomedically relevant and duplicated genes. This analysis reveals patterns of structural heterozygosity and evolutionary differences in SD organization between humans and other primates.},

Probing CpG methylation across human centromeres from six diverse individuals generated an estimate of variability in kinetochore localization.

Cultural accumulation of innovative algorithms is hard to explain because complex concepts are difficult to pass on. We found that selective social learning preserved rare discoveries of exceptional algorithms in a large experimental simulation of cultural evolution. Participants ( N = 3450) faced a difficult sequential decision problem (sorting an unknown sequence of numbers) and transmitted solutions across 12 generations in 20 populations. Several known sorting algorithms were discovered. Complex algorithms persisted when participants could choose who to learn from but frequently became extinct in populations lacking this selection process, converging on highly transmissible lower-performance algorithms. These results provide experimental evidence for hypothesized links between sociality and cognitive function in humans.},

We introduce a hybrid-integrated membrane strategy wherein a high-permeability thin film is chemically functionalized with a patchy CO 2 -philic grafted chain surface layer. A high-solubility mechanism enriches the concentration of CO 2 in the surface layer hydrated by water vapor naturally present in target gas streams, followed by fast CO 2 transport through a highly permeable (but low-selectivity) polymer substrate. Analytical methods confirm the existence of an amine surface layer. Integrated multilayer membranes prepared in this way are not diffusion limited and retain much of their high CO 2 permeability, and their CO 2 selectivity is concurrently increased in some cases by more than ~150-fold.},

Although pain development has been well studied, pain recovery mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we found that CD11c-expressing spinal microglia appear after the development of behavioral pain hypersensitivity following nerve injury. Nerve-injured mice with spinal CD11c + microglial depletion failed to recover spontaneously from this hypersensitivity. CD11c + microglia expressed insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1), and interference with IGF1 signaling recapitulated the impairment in pain recovery. In pain-recovered mice, the depletion of CD11c + microglia or the interruption of IGF1 signaling resulted in a relapse in pain hypersensitivity. Our findings reveal a mechanism for the remission and recurrence of neuropathic pain, providing potential targets for therapeutic strategies.},

We used computed tomography scans of newly discovered Paleocene fossils to show that contrary to the convention that mammal brains have steadily enlarged over time, early placentals initially decreased their relative brain sizes because body mass increased at a faster rate. Later in the Eocene, multiple crown lineages independently acquired highly encephalized brains through marked growth in sensory regions. We argue that the placental radiation initially emphasized increases in body size as extinction survivors filled vacant niches. Brains eventually became larger as ecosystems saturated and competition intensified.},

We report very-high-energy (VHE; ≳ 100 giga–electron volts ) gamma rays from the recurrent nova RS Ophiuchi, up to 1 month after its 2021 outburst, observed using the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.). The temporal profile of VHE emission is similar to that of lower-energy giga–electron volt emission, indicating a common origin, with a 2-day delay in peak flux. These observations constrain models of time-dependent particle energization, favoring a hadronic emission scenario over the leptonic alternative. Shocks in dense winds provide favorable environments for efficient acceleration of cosmic rays to very high energies.},

  abstract     = {If perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) are to be commercialized, they must achieve long-term stability, which is usually assessed with accelerated degradation tests. One of the persistent obstacles for PSCs has been successfully passing the damp-heat test (85°C and 85\% relative humidity), which is the standard for verifying the stability of commercial photovoltaic (PV) modules. We fabricated damp heat–stable PSCs by tailoring the dimensional fragments of two-dimensional perovskite layers formed at room temperature with oleylammonium iodide molecules; these layers passivate the perovskite surface at the electron-selective contact. The resulting inverted PSCs deliver a 24.3\% PCE and retain &gt;95\% of their initial value after &gt;1000 hours at damp-heat test conditions, thereby meeting one of the critical industrial stability standards for PV modules.},

Yet we know little about whether genes of one species influence the persistence of interacting species in an ecological community. Here, we experimentally tested the effect of three plant defense genes on the persistence of an insect food web and found that a single allele at a single gene promoted coexistence by increasing plant growth rate, which in turn increased the intrinsic growth rates of species across multiple trophic levels. Our discovery of a “keystone gene” illustrates the need to bridge between biological scales, from genes to ecosystems, to understand community persistence.},

By sequencing 201 ancient genomes from 39 archaeological sites, we clarify the complex demographic history of this region. Bronze Age Xinjiang populations are characterized by four major ancestries related to Early Bronze Age cultures from the central and eastern Steppe, Central Asian, and Tarim Basin regions. Admixtures between Middle and Late Bronze Age Steppe cultures continued during the Late Bronze and Iron Ages, along with an inflow of East and Central Asian ancestry. Historical era populations show similar admixed and diverse ancestries as those of present-day Xinjiang populations. These results document the influence that East and West Eurasian populations have had over time in the different regions of Xinjiang.},

Selective AMYR agonists and dual AMYR/CTR agonists are being developed as obesity treatments; however, the molecular basis for peptide binding and selectivity is unknown. We determined the structure and dynamics of active AMYRs with amylin, AMY 1 R with salmon CT (sCT), AMY 2 R with sCT or human CT (hCT), and CTR with amylin, sCT, or hCT. The conformation of amylin-bound complexes was similar for all AMYRs, constrained by the RAMP, and an ordered midpeptide motif that we call the bypass motif. The CT-bound AMYR complexes were distinct, overlapping the CT-bound CTR complexes. Our findings indicate that activation of AMYRs by CT-based peptides is distinct from their activation by amylin-based peptides. This has important implications for the development of AMYR therapeutics.},

These orthologs encode WD40 proteins and interact with a gene of unknown function, DUF1644, to negatively regulate grain number in both crops. Knockout of KRN2 in maize or OsKRN2 in rice increased grain yield by ~10\% and ~8\%, respectively, with no apparent trade-offs in other agronomic traits. Furthermore, genome-wide scans identified 490 pairs of orthologous genes that underwent convergent selection during maize and rice evolution, and these were enriched for two shared molecular pathways. KRN2 , together with other convergently selected genes, provides an excellent target for future crop improvement.},

We reversibly self-assembled colloidal nanocrystals of gold, platinum, nickel, lead sulfide, and lead selenide with conductive inorganic ligands into supercrystals exhibiting optical and electronic properties consistent with strong electronic coupling between the constituent nanocrystals. The phase behavior of charge-stabilized nanocrystals can be rationalized and navigated with phase diagrams computed for particles interacting through short-range attractive potentials. By finely tuning interparticle interactions, the assembly was directed either through one-step nucleation or nonclassical two-step nucleation pathways. In the latter case, the nucleation was preceded by the formation of two metastable colloidal fluids.},

We obtained simultaneously high conductivity and crack-onset strain in a physiological environment, with direct photopatternability down to the cellular scale. We further collected stable electromyography signals on soft and malleable octopus and performed localized neuromodulation down to single-nucleus precision for controlling organ-specific activities through the delicate brainstem.},

We demonstrate a measurement of the compressibility of a two-dimensional quantum gas of light in a box potential and obtain the equation of state for the optical medium. The experiment was carried out in a nanostructured dye-filled optical microcavity. We observed signatures of Bose-Einstein condensation at high phase-space densities in the finite-size system.

We report the direct observation of in situ tunable valley-selective Hall effect (VSHE), where inversion symmetry, and thus the geometric phase of electrons, is controllable by an out-of-plane electric field. We use high-quality bilayer graphene with an intrinsic and tunable bandgap, illuminated by circularly polarized midinfrared light, and confirm that the observed Hall voltage arises from an optically induced valley population. Compared with molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ), we find orders of magnitude larger VSHE, attributed to the inverse scaling of the Berry curvature with bandgap. By monitoring the valley-selective Hall conductivity, we study the Berry curvature’s evolution with bandgap. This in situ manipulation of VSHE paves the way for topological and quantum geometric optoelectronic devices, such as more robust switches and detectors.},

  abstract     = {Thermoelectric materials allow for direct conversion between heat and electricity, offering the potential for power generation. The average dimensionless figure of merit ZT ave determines device efficiency. N-type tin selenide crystals exhibit outstanding three-dimensional charge and two-dimensional phonon transport along the out-of-plane direction, contributing to a high maximum figure of merit Z max of ~3.6 × 10 −3 per kelvin but a moderate ZT ave of ~1.1. We found an attractive high Z max of ~4.1 × 10 −3 per kelvin at 748 kelvin and a ZT ave of ~1.7 at 300 to 773 kelvin in chlorine-doped and lead-alloyed tin selenide crystals by phonon-electron decoupling. The chlorine-induced low deformation potential improved the carrier mobility. The lead-induced mass and strain fluctuations reduced the lattice thermal conductivity. Phonon-electron decoupling plays a critical role to achieve high-performance thermoelectrics.},

  abstract     = {Information flow in neurons proceeds by integrating inputs in dendrites, generating action potentials near the soma, and releasing neurotransmitters from nerve terminals in the axon. We found that in the striatum, acetylcholine-releasing neurons induce action potential firing in distal dopamine axons. Spontaneous activity of cholinergic neurons produced dopamine release that extended beyond acetylcholine-signaling domains, and traveling action potentials were readily recorded from dopamine axons in response to cholinergic activation. In freely moving mice, dopamine and acetylcholine covaried with movement direction. Local inhibition of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors impaired dopamine dynamics and affected movement. Our findings uncover an endogenous mechanism for action potential initiation independent of somatodendritic integration and establish that this mechanism segregates the control of dopamine signaling between axons and somata.},

  abstract     = {Nipah virus (NiV) and Hendra virus (HeV) are zoonotic henipaviruses (HNVs) responsible for outbreaks of encephalitis and respiratory illness. The entry of HNVs into host cells requires the attachment (G) and fusion (F) glycoproteins, which are the main targets of antibody responses. To understand viral infection and host immunity, we determined a cryo–electron microscopy structure of the NiV G homotetrameric ectodomain in complex with the nAH1.3 broadly neutralizing antibody Fab fragment. We show that a cocktail of two nonoverlapping G-specific antibodies neutralizes NiV and HeV synergistically and limits the emergence of escape mutants. Analysis of polyclonal serum antibody responses elicited by vaccination of macaques with NiV G indicates that the receptor binding head domain is immunodominant. These results pave the way for implementing multipronged therapeutic strategies against these deadly pathogens.},

  abstract     = {Dendritic calcium signaling is central to neural plasticity mechanisms that allow animals to adapt to the environment. Intracellular calcium release (ICR) from the endoplasmic reticulum has long been thought to shape these mechanisms. However, ICR has not been investigated in mammalian neurons in vivo. We combined electroporation of single CA1 pyramidal neurons, simultaneous imaging of dendritic and somatic activity during spatial navigation, optogenetic place field induction, and acute genetic augmentation of ICR cytosolic impact to reveal that ICR supports the establishment of dendritic feature selectivity and shapes integrative properties determining output-level receptive fields. This role for ICR was more prominent in apical than in basal dendrites. Thus, ICR cooperates with circuit-level architecture in vivo to promote the emergence of behaviorally relevant plasticity in a compartment-specific manner.},

We tracked the evolution of fitness-associated phenotypes and allele frequencies genome-wide in 10 replicate field populations of Drosophila melanogaster over 10 generations from summer to late fall. Adaptation was evident over each sampling interval (one to four generations), with exceptionally rapid phenotypic adaptation and large allele frequency shifts at many independent loci. The direction and basis of the adaptive response shifted repeatedly over time, consistent with the action of strong and rapidly fluctuating selection. Overall, we found clear phenotypic and genomic evidence of adaptive tracking occurring contemporaneously with environmental change, thus demonstrating the temporally dynamic nature of adaptation.},

Early detection of cancer or precancerous change allows early intervention to try to slow or prevent cancer development and lethality. To achieve early detection of all cancers, numerous challenges must be overcome. It is vital to better understand who is at greatest risk of developing cancer. We also need to elucidate the biology and trajectory of precancer and early cancer to identify consequential disease that requires intervention. Insights must be translated into sensitive and specific early detection technologies and be appropriately evaluated to support practical clinical implementation. Interdisciplinary collaboration is key; advances in technology and biological understanding highlight that it is time to accelerate early detection research and transform cancer survival.},

Using an electric field gradient, we demonstrated layer-resolved state preparation and imaging of ultracold potassium-rubidium molecules confined to two-dimensional planes in an optical lattice. The rotational coherence was maximized by rotating the electric field relative to the light polarization for state-insensitive trapping. Spatially separated molecules in adjacent layers interact through dipolar spin exchange of rotational angular momentum; by adjusting these interactions, we regulated the local chemical reaction rate. The resonance width of the exchange process vastly exceeded the dipolar interaction energy, an effect attributed to thermal energy. This work realized precise control of interacting molecules, enabling electric field microscopy on subwavelength scales and allowing access to unexplored physics in two-dimensional systems.},

We report spectroscopy measurements of dual-gated TLG/hBN using Fourier transform infrared photocurrent spectroscopy. We observed a strong optical transition between moiré minibands that narrows continuously as a bandgap is opened by gating, indicating a reduction of the single-particle bandwidth. At half-filling of the valence flat band, a broad absorption peak emerges at ~18 milli–electron volts, indicating direct optical excitation across an emerging Mott gap. Similar photocurrent spectra are observed in two other correlated insulating states at quarter- and half-filling of the first conduction band. Our findings provide key parameters of the Hubbard model for the understanding of electron correlation in TLG/hBN.},

These injected smoke particles have produced unexpected and extreme perturbations in stratospheric gases beyond any seen in the previous 15 years of measurements, including increases in formaldehyde, chlorine nitrate, chlorine monoxide, and hypochlorous acid and decreases in ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and hydrochloric acid. These perturbations in stratospheric composition have the potential to affect ozone chemistry in unexpected ways.},

Crystal structures determined using inactive, detergent-solubilized pMMO lack several conserved regions neighboring the proposed active site. We show that reconstituting pMMO in nanodiscs with lipids extracted from the native organism restores methane oxidation activity. Multiple nanodisc-embedded pMMO structures determined by cryo–electron microscopy to 2.14- to 2.46-angstrom resolution reveal the structure of pMMO in a lipid environment. The resulting model includes stabilizing lipids, regions of the PmoA and PmoC subunits not observed in prior structures, and a previously undetected copper-binding site in the PmoC subunit with an adjacent hydrophobic cavity. These structures provide a revised framework for understanding and engineering pMMO function.},

We found that TONSOKU (TSK/TONSL), which rescues broken replication forks, specifically interacts with H3.1 via recognition of alanine 31 by its tetratricopeptide repeat domain. Our results indicate that genomic instability in the absence of ATXR5/ATXR6-catalyzed histone H3 lysine 27 monomethylation in plants depends on H3.1, TSK, and DNA polymerase theta (Pol θ). This work reveals an H3.1-specific function during replication and a common strategy used in multicellular eukaryotes for regulating post-replicative chromatin maturation and TSK, which relies on histone monomethyltransferases and reading of the H3.1 variant.},

We examined whether urban environmental change drives parallel evolution by sampling 110,019 white clover plants from 6169 populations in 160 cities globally. Plants were assayed for a Mendelian antiherbivore defense that also affects tolerance to abiotic stressors. Urban-rural gradients were associated with the evolution of clines in defense in 47\% of cities throughout the world. Variation in the strength of clines was explained by environmental changes in drought stress and vegetation cover that varied among cities. Sequencing 2074 genomes from 26 cities revealed that the evolution of urban-rural clines was best explained by adaptive evolution, but the degree of parallel adaptation varied among cities. Our results demonstrate that urbanization leads to adaptation at a global scale.},

Previous syntheses of complex congeners such as himgaline have relied on iterative, stepwise installation of multiple methine stereocenters. We decreased the synthetic burden of himgaline chemical space to nearly one-third of the prior best (7 to 9 versus 19 to 31 steps) by cross-coupling high fraction aromatic building blocks (high F sp 2) followed by complete, stereoselective reduction to high fraction sp 3 products (high F sp 3).

  abstract     = {The polarization of fast radio bursts (FRBs), which are bright astronomical transient phenomena, contains information about their environments. Using wide-band observations with two telescopes, we report polarization measurements of five repeating FRBs and find a trend of lower polarization at lower frequencies. This behavior is modeled as multipath scattering, characterized by a single parameter, σ RM , the rotation measure (RM) scatter. Sources with higher σ RM have higher RM magnitude and scattering time scales. The two sources with the highest σ RM , FRB 20121102A and FRB 20190520B, are associated with compact persistent radio sources. These properties indicate a complex environment near the repeating FRBs, such as a supernova remnant or a pulsar wind nebula, consistent with their having arisen from young stellar populations.},

  abstract     = {Grain boundaries (GBs) play an important role in the mechanical behavior of polycrystalline materials. Despite decades of investigation, the atomic-scale dynamic processes of GB deformation remain elusive, particularly for the GBs in polycrystals, which are commonly of the asymmetric and general type. We conducted an in situ atomic-resolution study to reveal how sliding-dominant deformation is accomplished at general tilt GBs in platinum bicrystals. We observed either direct atomic-scale sliding along the GB or sliding with atom transfer across the boundary plane. The latter sliding process was mediated by movements of disconnections that enabled the transport of GB atoms, leading to a previously unrecognized mode of coupled GB sliding and atomic plane transfer. These results enable an atomic-scale understanding of how general GBs slide in polycrystalline materials.},

  abstract     = {Copper is an essential cofactor for all organisms, and yet it becomes toxic if concentrations exceed a threshold maintained by evolutionarily conserved homeostatic mechanisms. How excess copper induces cell death, however, is unknown. Here, we show in human cells that copper-dependent, regulated cell death is distinct from known death mechanisms and is dependent on mitochondrial respiration. We show that copper-dependent death occurs by means of direct binding of copper to lipoylated components of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. This results in lipoylated protein aggregation and subsequent iron-sulfur cluster protein loss, which leads to proteotoxic stress and ultimately cell death. These findings may explain the need for ancient copper homeostatic mechanisms.},

We applied a massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) to functionally evaluate genetic variants in high, local LD for independent cis-expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL). We found that 17.7\% of eQTLs exhibit more than one major allelic effect in tight LD. The detected regulatory variants were highly and specifically enriched for activating chromatin structures and allelic transcription factor binding. Integration of MPRA profiles with eQTL/complex trait colocalizations across 114 human traits and diseases identified causal variant sets demonstrating how genetic association signals can manifest through multiple, tightly linked causal variants.},

In 2020, the Brazilian government approved legislation that would have eliminated mangrove protection for the benefit of real estate development (4). Fortunately, in December 2021, the Brazilian Supreme Court found the controversial policy unconstitutional (5). Brazil must continue to protect its mangroves despite an administration that has shown disregard for the environment (6).},

Through its application, we reveal principles that relate cell type to synaptic properties and intralaminar circuit organization in the mouse and human cortex. The dynamics of excitatory synapses align with the postsynaptic cell subclass, whereas inhibitory synapse dynamics partly align with presynaptic cell subclass but with considerable overlap. Synaptic properties are heterogeneous in most subclass-to-subclass connections. The two main axes of heterogeneity are strength and variability. Cell subclasses divide along the variability axis, whereas the strength axis accounts for substantial heterogeneity within the subclass. In the human cortex, excitatory-to-excitatory synaptic dynamics are distinct from those in the mouse cortex and vary with depth across layers 2 and 3.},

Our approach provides a data-driven description of the molecular and spatial networks that organize the proteome. Unsupervised clustering of these networks delineates functional communities that facilitate biological discovery. We found that remarkably precise functional information can be derived from protein localization patterns, which often contain enough information to identify molecular interactions, and that RNA binding proteins form a specific subgroup defined by unique interaction and localization properties.

Here, we report an in situ visualization of ethylene polymerization by scanning tunneling microscopy on a carburized iron single-crystal surface. We observed that ethylene polymerization proceeds on a specific triangular iron site at the boundary between two carbide domains. Without an activator, an intermediate, attributed to surface-anchored ethylidene (CHCH 3 ), serves as the chain initiator (self-initiation), which subsequently grows by ethylene insertion. Our finding provides direct experimental evidence of the ethylene polymerization pathway at the molecular level.},

Using Drosophila expressing CharON, we uncovered multiple qualitative and quantitative features of coordinated clearance of apoptotic corpses during embryonic development. When confronted with high rates of emerging apoptotic corpses, the macrophages displayed heterogeneity in engulfment behaviors, leading to some efferocytic macrophages carrying high corpse burden. Overburdened macrophages were compromised in clearing wound debris. These findings reveal known and unexpected features of apoptosis and macrophage efferocytosis in vivo.},

We found that ACE degrades an unconventional enkephalin heptapeptide, Met-enkephalin-Arg-Phe, in the nucleus accumbens of mice. ACE inhibition enhanced µ-opioid receptor activation by Met-enkephalin-Arg-Phe, causing a cell type–specific long-term depression of glutamate release onto medium spiny projection neurons expressing the Drd1 dopamine receptor. Systemic ACE inhibition was not intrinsically rewarding, but it led to a decrease in conditioned place preference caused by fentanyl administration and an enhancement of reciprocal social interaction. Our results raise the enticing prospect that central ACE inhibition can boost endogenous opioid signaling for clinical benefit while mitigating the risk of addiction.},

Our structures define interactions between telomerase and TPP1-POT1 that are crucial for telomerase recruitment to telomeres. The presence of TPP1-POT1 stabilizes the DNA, revealing an unexpected path by which DNA exits the telomerase active site and a DNA anchor site on telomerase that is important for telomerase processivity.

Below active arc volcanoes, observed magma storage depths vary widely (~0 to 20 kilometers) and are commonly assumed to represent levels of neutral buoyancy. Here we show that geophysically observed magma depths (6 ± 3 kilometers) are greater than depths of neutral buoyancy, ruling out this commonly assumed control. Observed depths are instead consistent with predicted depths of water degassing. Intrinsically wetter magmas degas water and crystallize deeper than dry magmas, resulting in viscosity increases that lead to deeper stalling of ascending magma. The water–depth relationship provides a critical constraint for forecasting models by connecting depth of eruption initiation to its volatile fuel.},

Here, we locally probe the magnetic excitations in a soft magnetic material by optical methods and show that megahertz-range excitation frequencies cause switching effects on the micrometer scale, leading to phase-locked spin-wave emission in the GHz range. Indeed, the frequency multiplication process inside the magnetic medium covers six octaves and opens exciting perspectives for spintronic applications, such as all-magnetic mixers or on-chip GHz sources.},

Yet by the end of 2021, more than 5 million people had died, and the pandemic continues to evolve and rage globally. This Review will describe how each of the vaccines, antibody therapies, and antiviral drugs that have been approved to date were built on decades of investment in technology and basic science. We will caution that the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus has so far proven a straightforward test of our pandemic preparedness, and we will recommend steps we should undertake now to prepare for, to minimize the effects of, and ideally to prevent future pandemics. Other Reviews in this series describe the interactions of SARS-CoV-2 with the immune system and those therapies that target the host response to infection.},

Additional challenges loom for the next phase. These include optimizing the immunological rationale for boosting—how often and with what—and the best approaches for building a future-proofed, durable immune repertoire to protect against oncoming viral variants, including in children. The landscape of vaccine producers and technologies is likely to become even more heterogeneous. There is a need now for appraisal of future approaches: While some favor frequent boosting with the first-generation, ancestral spike vaccines, others propose frequent readjustment using current variant sequences, polyvalent vaccines, or pan-coronavirus strategies.},

We review the results of almost 2 years of COVID-19 immunology research and discuss definitive findings and remaining questions regarding our understanding of COVID-19 pathophysiology. We discuss emerging understanding of differences in immune responses seen in those with and without Long Covid syndrome, also known as post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2. We hope that the knowledge gained from this COVID-19 research will be applied in studies of inflammatory processes involved in critical and chronic illnesses, which remain a major unmet need.},

Over this period, the global community of epidemiologists and evolutionary biologists has also come a long way in understanding the complex and changing dynamics of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19. In this Review, we retrace our steps through the questions that this community faced as the pandemic unfolded. We focus on the key roles that mathematical modeling and quantitative analyses of empirical data have played in allowing us to address these questions and ultimately to better understand and control the pandemic.},

We provide an in-depth analysis of cell type–related gene signatures and transcription factor markers, as well as sexual dimorphism, across the whole animal. Analysis of common cell types between tissues, such as blood and muscle cells, reveals rare cell types and tissue-specific subtypes. This atlas provides a valuable resource for the Drosophila community and serves as a reference to study genetic perturbations and disease models at single-cell resolution.},

By leveraging this reference, we investigated cellular and molecular perturbations in brain arteriovenous malformations, which are a leading cause of stroke in young people, and identified pathologic endothelial transformations with abnormal vascular patterning and the ontology of vascularly derived inflammation. We illustrate the interplay between vascular and immune cells that contributes to brain hemorrhage and catalog opportunities for targeting angiogenic and inflammatory programs in vascular malformations.},

Underground lateral roots initiate from prepatterned cells in the main root, but cells can also bypass the root-shoot trajectory separation and generate shoot-borne roots through an unknown mechanism. We mapped tomato ( Solanum lycopersicum ) shoot-borne root development at single-cell resolution and showed that these roots initiate from phloem-associated cells through a unique transition state. This state requires the activity of a transcription factor that we named SHOOTBORNE ROOTLESS ( SBRL ) . Evolutionary analysis reveals that SBRL ’s function and cis regulation are conserved in angiosperms and that it arose as an ancient duplication, with paralogs controlling wound-induced and lateral root initiation. We propose that the activation of a common transition state by context-specific regulators underlies the plasticity of plant root systems.},

The cocrystal structure of BEND3 in complex with its target DNA reveals the structural basis for its DNA methylation–sensitive binding property. Mouse embryos ablated of Bend3 died at the pregastrulation stage. Bend3 null embryonic stem cells (ESCs) exhibited severe defects in differentiation, during which hundreds of CGI-containing bivalent genes were prematurely activated. BEND3 is required for the stable association of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) at bivalent genes that are highly occupied by BEND3, which suggests a reining function of BEND3 in maintaining high levels of H3K27me3 at these bivalent genes in ESCs to prevent their premature activation in the forthcoming developmental stage.},

Most Omicron mutations are located on the surface of the spike protein and change binding epitopes to many current antibodies. In the ACE2-binding site, compensating mutations strengthen receptor binding domain (RBD) binding to ACE2. Both the RBD and the apo form of the Omicron spike trimer are thermodynamically unstable. An unusual RBD-RBD interaction in the ACE2-spike complex supports the open conformation and further reinforces ACE2 binding to the spike trimer. A broad-spectrum therapeutic antibody, JMB2002, which has completed a phase 1 clinical trial, maintains neutralizing activity against Omicron. JMB2002 binds to RBD differently from other characterized antibodies and inhibits ACE2 binding.},

Heterologous messenger RNA (mRNA) booster immunization induced higher serum neutralizing antibody and MBC responses against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) compared with that of homologous ChAdOx1 boosting. Specificity mapping of circulating B cells revealed that mRNA-1273 boost immunofocused ChAdOx1-primed responses onto epitopes expressed on prefusion-stabilized S. Monoclonal antibodies isolated from mRNA-1273–boosted participants displayed overall higher binding affinities and increased breadth of reactivity against VOCs relative to those isolated from ChAdOx1-boosted individuals.

We found that the enhancement of vacuum field fluctuations in subwavelength split-ring resonators strongly affects one of the most paradigmatic quantum protectorates, the quantum Hall electron transport in high-mobility two-dimensional electron gases. The observed breakdown of the topological protection of the integer quantum Hall effect is interpreted in terms of a long-range cavity-mediated electron hopping where the anti-resonant terms of the light-matter coupling Hamiltonian develop into a finite resistivity induced by the vacuum fluctuations. Our experimental platform can be used for any two-dimensional material and provides a route to manipulate electron phases in matter by means of vacuum-field engineering.},

We used polarized inelastic neutron scattering to investigate the propagation of magnons (i.e., bosonic collective spin excitations) in a lattice of skyrmion tubes in manganese silicide. For wave vectors perpendicular to the skyrmion tubes, the magnon spectra are consistent with the formation of finely spaced emergent Landau levels that are characteristic of the fictitious magnetic field used to account for the nontrivial topological winding of the skyrmion lattice. This provides evidence of a topological magnon band structure in reciprocal space, which is borne out of the nontrivial real-space topology of a magnetic order.},

  abstract     = {Magnetic monopoles play a central role in areas of physics that range from electromagnetism to topological matter. String theory promotes conventional vector gauge fields of electrodynamics to tensor gauge fields and predicts the existence of more exotic tensor monopoles. Here, we report the synthesis of a tensor monopole in a four-dimensional parameter space defined by the spin degrees of freedom of a single solid-state defect in diamond. Using two complementary methods, we characterized the tensor monopole by measuring its quantized topological charge and its emanating Kalb-Ramond field. By introducing a fictitious external field that breaks chiral symmetry, we further observed an intriguing spectral transition, characterized by spectral rings protected by mirror symmetries. Our work demonstrates the possibility of emulating exotic topological structures inspired by string theory.},

  abstract     = {The Hayabusa2 spacecraft investigated the C-type (carbonaceous) asteroid (162173) Ryugu. The mission performed two landing operations to collect samples of surface and subsurface material, the latter exposed by an artificial impact. We present images of the second touchdown site, finding that ejecta from the impact crater was present at the sample location. Surface pebbles at both landing sites show morphological variations ranging from rugged to smooth, similar to Ryugu’s boulders, and shapes from quasi-spherical to flattened. The samples were returned to Earth on 6 December 2020. We describe the morphology of &gt;5 grams of returned pebbles and sand. Their diverse color, shape, and structure are consistent with the observed materials of Ryugu; we conclude that they are a representative sample of the asteroid.},

  abstract     = {In this study, we achieved magnetic control of reactive scattering in an ultracold mixture of 23 Na atoms and 23 Na 6 Li molecules. In most molecular collisions, particles react or are lost near short range with unity probability, leading to the so-called universal rate. By contrast, the Na + NaLi system was shown to have only ~4\% loss probability in a fully spin-polarized state. By controlling the phase of the scattering wave function via a Feshbach resonance, we modified the loss rate by more than a factor of 100, from far below to far above the universal limit. The results are explained in analogy with an optical Fabry-Perot resonator by interference of reflections at short and long range. Our work demonstrates quantum control of chemistry by magnetic fields with the full dynamic range predicted by our models.},

  abstract     = {Sequence features of genes and their flanking regulatory regions are determinants of RNA transcript isoform expression and have been used as context-independent plug-and-play modules in synthetic biology. However, genetic context—including the adjacent transcriptional environment—also influences transcript isoform expression levels and boundaries. We used synthetic yeast strains with stochastically repositioned genes to systematically disentangle the effects of sequence and context. Profiling 120 million full-length transcript molecules across 612 genomic perturbations, we observed sequence-independent alterations to gene expression levels and transcript isoform boundaries that were influenced by neighboring transcription. We identified features of transcriptional context that could predict these alterations and used these features to engineer a synthetic circuit where transcript length was controlled by neighboring transcription. This demonstrates how positional context can be leveraged in synthetic genome engineering.},

  abstract     = {The sleep cycle is characterized by alternating non–rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleeps. The mechanisms by which this cycle is generated are incompletely understood. We found that a transient increase of dopamine (DA) in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) during NREM sleep terminates NREM sleep and initiates REM sleep. DA acts on dopamine receptor D2 (Drd2)–expressing neurons in the BLA to induce the NREM-to-REM transition. This mechanism also plays a role in cataplectic attacks—a pathological intrusion of REM sleep into wakefulness—in narcoleptics. These results show a critical role of DA signaling in the BLA in initiating REM sleep and provide a neuronal basis for sleep cycle generation.},

By wasting food, Iran is also wasting the 300 million liters of fuel and the 13.7 billion cubic meters of water that were required to produce it (1). Because of drought conditions and a climate with three times the global average evaporation rate (1), Iran devotes 90\% of its water consumption to agriculture.

Scintillation has widespread applications in medical imaging, x-ray nondestructive inspection, electron microscopy, and high-energy particle detectors. Most research focuses on finding materials with brighter, faster, and more controlled scintillation. We developed a unified theory of nanophotonic scintillators that accounts for the key aspects of scintillation: energy loss by high-energy particles, and light emission by non-equilibrium electrons in nanostructured optical systems. We then devised an approach based on integrating nanophotonic structures into scintillators to enhance their emission, obtaining nearly an order-of-magnitude enhancement in both electron-induced and x-ray–induced scintillation. Our framework should enable the development of a new class of brighter, faster, and higher-resolution scintillators with tailored and optimized performance.},

Here, we address this challenge with nonparametric methods that enable us to infer a unified genealogy of modern and ancient humans. This compact representation of multiple datasets explores the challenges of missing and erroneous data and uses ancient samples to constrain and date relationships. We demonstrate the power of the method to recover relationships between individuals and populations as well as to identify descendants of ancient samples. Finally, we introduce a simple nonparametric estimator of the geographical location of ancestors that recapitulates key events in human history.},

In aged mice, Hcrt neurons exhibited more frequent neuronal activity epochs driving wake bouts, and optogenetic activation of Hcrt neurons elicited more prolonged wakefulness. Aged Hcrt neurons showed hyperexcitability with lower KCNQ2 expression and impaired M-current, mediated by KCNQ2/3 channels. Single-nucleus RNA-sequencing revealed adaptive changes to Hcrt neuron loss in the aging brain. Disruption of Kcnq2/3 genes in Hcrt neurons of young mice destabilized sleep, mimicking aging-associated sleep fragmentation, whereas the KCNQ-selective activator flupirtine hyperpolarized Hcrt neurons and rejuvenated sleep architecture in aged mice. Our findings demonstrate a mechanism underlying sleep instability during aging and a strategy to improve sleep continuity.},

Combining whole-genome sequencing of 1113 pre- and posttreatment bacterial isolates with machine-learning analysis of 140,349 urinary tract infections and 7365 wound infections, we found that treatment-induced emergence of resistance could be predicted and minimized at the individual-patient level. Emergence of resistance was common and driven not by de novo resistance evolution but by rapid reinfection with a different strain resistant to the prescribed antibiotic. As most infections are seeded from a patient’s own microbiota, these resistance-gaining recurrences can be predicted using the patient’s past infection history and minimized by machine learning–personalized antibiotic recommendations, offering a means to reduce the emergence and spread of resistant pathogens.},

In a typical lasing arrangement, the transverse spatial profile of a laser mode tends to remain self-similar throughout the entire cavity. Going beyond this paradigm, we demonstrate here how to shape a spatially evolving mode such that it faithfully settles into a pair of bi-orthogonal states at the two opposing facets of a laser cavity. This was achieved by purposely designing a structure that allows the lasing mode to encircle a non-Hermitian exceptional point while deliberately avoiding non-adiabatic jumps. The resulting state transfer reflects the unique topology of the associated Riemann surfaces associated with this singularity. Our approach provides a route to developing versatile mode-selective active devices and sheds light on the interesting topological features of exceptional points.},

Neoantigen-specific TILs exhibited tumor-specific expansion with dysfunctional phenotypes, distinct from blood-emigrant bystanders and regulatory TILs. Prospective prediction and testing of 73 NeoTCR signature–derived clonotypes demonstrated that half of the tested TCRs recognized tumor antigens or autologous tumors. NeoTCR signatures identified TCRs that target driver neoantigens and nonmutated viral or tumor-associated antigens, suggesting a common metastatic TIL exhaustion program. NeoTCR signatures delineate the landscape of TILs across metastatic tumors, enabling successful TCR prediction based purely on TIL transcriptomic states for use in cancer immunotherapy.},

Combining this with previous determinations of the relativistic jet orientation, which traces the black hole spin, and the inclination of the orbit, we determine a lower limit of 40° on the spin-orbit misalignment angle. The misalignment must originate from either the binary evolution or black hole formation stages. If other x-ray binaries have similarly large misalignments, these would bias measurements of black hole masses and spins from x-ray observations.},

We provide a blueprint for understanding the marked reduction of binding of other therapeutic mAbs that leads to dampened neutralizing activity.

Here, we assess the impact of a time-restricted enterobacterial challenge to long-term ILC3 activation in mice. We found that intestinal ILC3s persist for months in an activated state after exposure to Citrobacter rodentium . Upon rechallenge, these “trained” ILC3s proliferate, display enhanced interleukin-22 (IL-22) responses, and have a superior capacity to control infection compared with naïve ILC3s. Metabolic changes occur in C. rodentium –exposed ILC3s, but only trained ILC3s have an enhanced proliferative capacity that contributes to increased IL-22 production. Accordingly, a limited encounter with a pathogen can promote durable phenotypic and functional changes in intestinal ILC3s that contribute to long-term mucosal defense.},

  abstract     = {The conformal integration of electronic systems with irregular, soft objects is essential for many emerging technologies. We report the design of van der Waals thin films consisting of staggered two-dimensional nanosheets with bond-free van der Waals interfaces. The films feature sliding and rotation degrees of freedom among the staggered nanosheets to ensure mechanical stretchability and malleability, as well as a percolating network of nanochannels to endow permeability and breathability. With an excellent mechanical match to soft biological tissues, the freestanding films can naturally adapt to local surface topographies and seamlessly merge with living organisms with highly conformal interfaces, rendering living organisms with electronic functions, including leaf-gate and skin-gate transistors. On-skin transistors allow high-fidelity monitoring and local amplification of skin potentials and electrophysiological signals.},

  abstract     = {Chloride transport by microbial rhodopsins is an essential process for which molecular details such as the mechanisms that convert light energy to drive ion pumping and ensure the unidirectionality of the transport have remained elusive. We combined time-resolved serial crystallography with time-resolved spectroscopy and multiscale simulations to elucidate the molecular mechanism of a chloride-pumping rhodopsin and the structural dynamics throughout the transport cycle. We traced transient anion-binding sites, obtained evidence for how light energy is used in the pumping mechanism, and identified steric and electrostatic molecular gates ensuring unidirectional transport. An interaction with the π-electron system of the retinal supports transient chloride ion binding across a major bottleneck in the transport pathway. These results allow us to propose key mechanistic features enabling finely controlled chloride transport across the cell membrane in this light-powered chloride ion pump.},

  abstract     = {The nascent polypeptide–associated complex (NAC) interacts with newly synthesized proteins at the ribosomal tunnel exit and competes with the signal recognition particle (SRP) to prevent mistargeting of cytosolic and mitochondrial polypeptides to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). How NAC antagonizes SRP and how this is overcome by ER targeting signals are unknown. Here, we found that NAC uses two domains with opposing effects to control SRP access. The core globular domain prevented SRP from binding to signal-less ribosomes, whereas a flexibly attached domain transiently captured SRP to permit scanning of nascent chains. The emergence of an ER-targeting signal destabilized NAC’s globular domain and facilitated SRP access to the nascent chain. These findings elucidate how NAC hands over the signal sequence to SRP and imparts specificity of protein localization.},

We agree with King et al. that the updated Paris Agreement pledges could paint an overly optimistic picture of the future, especially if their success depends on postponing deeper reductions until after 2030. To illustrate a less-optimistic future, our Policy Forum includes scenarios showing what would happen if countries continued to implement current policies alone. The “Current policy” scenarios in the Policy Forum result in less than a 10\% chance of limiting global warming to below 2°C this century, whereas the “Updated pledges” scenarios result in at least a 33\% chance of achieving the same temperature goal. Additional policy measures could help bridge emission gaps between current policies, updated pledges, and the global emission levels needed to cost-effectively achieve the Paris Agreement’s climate goals (1).},

  abstract     = {After publication of the Report “A ubiquitous tire rubber–derived chemical induces acute mortality in coho salmon,” which revealed 6PPD-quinone to be the primary causal toxicant toward coho salmon, a commercial standard of this molecule became available, and the authors developed and published an isotopic analytical method for more accurate quantification of extracts, environmental samples, and fish exposures (1). The authors found a ~15-fold increase in peak areas using the commercial standard, indicating that the previous standards overestimated both the reported median lethal concentration (LC50) and the environmental concentrations of 6PPD-quinone in the study by a factor of 8.3. Using new exposures with the commercial standard and the isotopic method for quantification, LC50 values to juvenile coho salmon were subsequently revised to a lower value of 95 ng/L. Although the absolute concentrations in Figs. 3 and 4 of the Report shift lower when using the updated calibration, the relative relationship between environmental concentrations and LC50 presented in Fig. 4A are not changed, and the conclusions and implications of the paper are otherwise not affected.},

In this work, we used cryo–electron tomography and subtomogram averaging to reveal structures of native nebulin bound to thin filaments within intact sarcomeres. This in situ reconstruction provided high-resolution details of the interaction between nebulin and actin, demonstrating the stabilizing role of nebulin. Myosin bound to the thin filaments exhibited different conformations of the neck domain, highlighting its inherent structural variability in muscle. Unexpectedly, nebulin did not interact with myosin or tropomyosin, but it did interact with a troponin T linker through two potential binding motifs on nebulin, explaining its regulatory role. Our structures support the role of nebulin as a thin filament “molecular ruler” and provide a molecular basis for studying nemaline myopathies.},

Although BBB dysfunction is a hallmark of several neurological disorders, therapies to restore BBB function are lacking. An attractive strategy is to repurpose developmental BBB regulators, such as Wnt7a, into BBB-protective agents. However, safe therapeutic use of Wnt ligands is complicated by their pleiotropic Frizzled signaling activities. Taking advantage of the Wnt7a/b-specific Gpr124/Reck co-receptor complex, we genetically engineered Wnt7a ligands into BBB-specific Wnt activators. In a “hit-and-run” adeno-associated virus–assisted CNS gene delivery setting, these new Gpr124/Reck-specific agonists protected BBB function, thereby mitigating glioblastoma expansion and ischemic stroke infarction. This work reveals that the signaling specificity of Wnt ligands is adjustable and defines a modality to treat CNS disorders by normalizing the BBB.},

Here, we developed a mixture-centered risk assessment strategy that integrates epidemiological and experimental evidence. We identified that exposure to an EDC mixture in early pregnancy is associated with language delay in offspring. At human-relevant concentrations, this mixture disrupted hormone-regulated and disease-relevant regulatory networks in human brain organoids and in the model organisms Xenopus leavis and Danio rerio , as well as behavioral responses. Reinterrogating epidemiological data, we found that up to 54\% of the children had prenatal exposures above experimentally derived levels of concern, reaching, for the upper decile compared with the lowest decile of exposure, a 3.3 times higher risk of language delay.},

We find that in the fat body of fasting Drosophila , lysosomal export of cystine coordinates remobilization of internal nutrient stores with reactivation of the growth regulator target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1). Mechanistically, cystine was reduced to cysteine and metabolized to acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) by promoting CoA metabolism. In turn, acetyl-CoA retained carbons from alternative amino acids in the form of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates and restricted the availability of building blocks required for growth. This process limited TORC1 reactivation to maintain autophagy and allowed animals to cope with starvation periods. We propose that cysteine metabolism mediates a communication between lysosomes and mitochondria, highlighting how changes in diet divert the fate of an amino acid into a growth suppressive program.},

In this study, serum of Beta-infected patients revealed reduced cross-neutralization of wild-type virus. From these patients, we isolated Beta-specific and cross-reactive receptor-binding domain (RBD) antibodies. The Beta-specificity results from recruitment of VOC-specific clonotypes and accommodation of mutations present in Beta and Omicron into a major antibody class that is normally sensitive to these mutations. The Beta-elicited cross-reactive antibodies share genetic and structural features with wild type–elicited antibodies, including a public VH1-58 clonotype that targets the RBD ridge.

The biomimetic experiments showed adhesion enhancement when combining nanoporous interfacial surfaces with flexible micropillars in tensile and peel modes. The fracture modeling identified micro- and nanostructure-based toughening mechanisms as the critical factor. Under wet conditions, capillarity-assisted energy dissipation pertaining to liquid-filled microgaps and nanopores further increased the adhesion performance. This research presents insights on lizard tail autotomy and provides new biomimetic ideas to solve adhesion problems.},

To correct this survivorship bias, we applied unseen species models from ecology to gauge the loss of narratives from medieval Europe, such as the romances about King Arthur. The estimates obtained are compatible with the scant historic evidence. In addition to events such as library fires, we identified the original evenness of cultural populations as an overlooked factor in these assemblages’ stability in the face of immaterial loss. We link the elevated evenness in island literatures to analogous accounts of ecological and cultural diversity in insular communities.

Cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structural analysis of the Omicron variant spike protein in complex with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) reveals new salt bridges and hydrogen bonds formed by mutated residues arginine-493, serine-496, and arginine-498 in the receptor binding domain with ACE2. These interactions appear to compensate for other Omicron mutations such as the substitution of asparagine for lysine at position 417 (K417N) that are known to reduce ACE2 binding affinity, resulting in similar biochemical ACE2 binding affinities for the Delta and Omicron variants. Neutralization assays show that pseudoviruses that display the Omicron spike protein exhibit increased antibody evasion. The increase in antibody evasion and the retention of strong interactions at the ACE2 interface thus represent important molecular features that likely contribute to the rapid spread of the Omicron variant.},

  abstract     = {Proposed hydropower dams at more than 350 sites throughout the Amazon require strategic evaluation of trade-offs between the numerous ecosystem services provided by Earth’s largest and most biodiverse river basin. These services are spatially variable, hence collective impacts of newly built dams depend strongly on their configuration. We use multiobjective optimization to identify portfolios of sites that simultaneously minimize impacts on river flow, river connectivity, sediment transport, fish diversity, and greenhouse gas emissions while achieving energy production goals. We find that uncoordinated, dam-by-dam hydropower expansion has resulted in forgone ecosystem service benefits. Minimizing further damage from hydropower development requires considering diverse environmental impacts across the entire basin, as well as cooperation among Amazonian nations. Our findings offer a transferable model for the evaluation of hydropower expansion in transboundary basins.},

  abstract     = {The synthesis of terpenes is a large field of research that is woven deeply into the history of chemistry. Terpene biosynthesis is a case study of how the logic of a modular design can lead to diverse structures with unparalleled efficiency. This work leverages modern nickel-catalyzed electrochemical sp 2 –sp 3 decarboxylative coupling reactions, enabled by silver nanoparticle–modified electrodes, to intuitively assemble terpene natural products and complex polyenes by using simple modular building blocks. The step change in efficiency of this approach is exemplified through the scalable preparation of 13 complex terpenes, which minimized protecting group manipulations, functional group interconversions, and redox fluctuations. The mechanistic aspects of the essential functionalized electrodes are studied in depth through a variety of spectroscopic and analytical techniques.},

  abstract     = {High–energy density lithium (Li) metal batteries (LMBs) are promising for energy storage applications but suffer from uncontrollable electrolyte degradation and the consequently formed unstable solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI). In this study, we designed self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) with high-density and long-range–ordered polar carboxyl groups linked to an aluminum oxide–coated separator to provide strong dipole moments, thus offering excess electrons to accelerate the degradation dynamics of carbon-fluorine bond cleavage in Li bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide. Hence, an SEI with enriched lithium fluoride (LiF) nanocrystals is generated, facilitating rapid Li + transfer and suppressing dendritic Li growth. In particular, the SAMs endow the full cells with substantially enhanced cyclability under high cathode loading, limited Li excess, and lean electrolyte conditions. As such, our work extends the long-established SAMs technology into a platform to control electrolyte degradation and SEI formation toward LMBs with ultralong life spans.},

Our Report was not meant to suggest that cold extremes in the United States are increasing in frequency overall, although a mid-winter cooling trend is observed over the period of Arctic amplification. Rather, we argued that an increasing trend in polar vortex disruptions related to Arctic amplification could resolve discrepancies between the observations and models.},

  abstract     = {Epithelial cells migrate across wounds to repair injured tissue. Leader cells at the front of migrating sheets often drive this process. However, it is unclear how leaders emerge from an apparently homogeneous epithelial cell population. We characterized leaders emerging from epithelial monolayers in cell culture and found that they activated the stress sensor p53, which was sufficient to initiate leader cell behavior. p53 activated the cell cycle inhibitor p21 WAF1/CIP1 , which in turn induced leader behavior through inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase activity. p53 also induced crowding hypersensitivity in leader cells such that, upon epithelial closure, they were eliminated by cell competition. Thus, mechanically induced p53 directs emergence of a transient population of leader cells that drive migration and ensures their clearance upon epithelial repair.},

We found that NUMA (nuclear mitotic apparatus protein)–mediated clustering of microtubule minus ends focused the spindle poles in human, bovine, and porcine oocytes and in mouse oocytes depleted of acentriolar microtubule-organizing centers (aMTOCs). However, unlike human oocytes, bovine, porcine, and aMTOC-free mouse oocytes have stable spindles. We identified the molecular motor KIFC1 (kinesin superfamily protein C1) as a spindle-stabilizing protein that is deficient in human oocytes. Depletion of KIFC1 recapitulated spindle instability in bovine and aMTOC-free mouse oocytes, and the introduction of exogenous KIFC1 rescued spindle instability in human oocytes. Thus, the deficiency of KIFC1 contributes to spindle instability in human oocytes.},

We found that type-2 conventional DCs (cDC2s) in the spleen depend on Gα 13 and adhesion G protein–coupled receptor family member-E5 (Adgre5, or CD97) for positioning in blood-exposed locations. CD97 function required its autoproteolytic cleavage. CD55 is a CD97 ligand, and cDC2 interaction with CD55-expressing red blood cells (RBCs) under shear stress conditions caused extraction of the regulatory CD97 N-terminal fragment. Deficiency in CD55-CD97 signaling led to loss of splenic cDC2s into the circulation and defective lymphocyte responses to blood-borne antigens. Thus, CD97 mechanosensing of RBCs establishes a migration and gene expression program that optimizes the antigen capture and presentation functions of splenic cDC2s.},

We describe the trogocytic acquisition of these molecules from conventional dendritic cells (cDCs). Complement component 3 (C3) binds to murine and human MHC II on cDCs. MZ B cells recognize C3 with complement receptor 2 (CR2) and trogocytose the MHC II–C3 complexes, which become exposed on their cell surface. The ubiquitin ligase MARCH1 limits the number of MHC II–C3 complexes displayed on cDCs to prevent their elimination through excessive trogocytosis. Capture of C3 by MHC II thus enables the transfer of cDC-like properties to MZ B cells.},

CR-induced transcriptional reprogramming in adipose tissue implicated pathways regulating mitochondrial bioenergetics, anti-inflammatory responses, and longevity. Expression of the gene Pla2g7 encoding platelet activating factor acetyl hydrolase (PLA2G7) is inhibited in humans undergoing CR. Deletion of Pla2g7 in mice showed decreased thymic lipoatrophy, protection against age-related inflammation, lowered NLRP3 inflammasome activation, and improved metabolic health. Therefore, the reduction of PLA2G7 may mediate the immunometabolic effects of CR and could potentially be harnessed to lower inflammation and extend the health span.},

A subsurvey of 57,000 adults showed similar temporal increases in mortality, with COVID and non-COVID deaths peaking similarly. Two government data sources found that, when compared to prepandemic periods, all-cause mortality was 27\% (23 to 32\%) higher in 0.2 M health facilities and 26\% (21 to 31\%) higher in civil registration deaths in 10 states; both increases occurred mostly in 2021.

We investigate a model of sex chromosome evolution that incorporates the coevolution of cis and trans regulators of gene expression. We show that the early emergence of dosage compensation favors the maintenance of Y-linked inversions by creating sex-antagonistic regulatory effects. This is followed by degeneration of these nonrecombining inversions caused by regulatory divergence between the X and Y chromosomes. In contrast to current theory, the whole process occurs without any selective pressure related to sexual dimorphism.},

Our results show the generation of extraordinarily large piezoelectric responses [with piezoelectric strain coefficients ( d 33 ) of ~200,000 picometers per volt at millihertz frequencies] in cubic fluorite gadolinium-doped CeO 2− x films, which are two orders of magnitude larger than the responses observed in the presently best-known lead-based piezoelectric relaxor–ferroelectric oxide at kilohertz frequencies.

The rank subspaces were distributed across large overlapping neural groups, and the integration of ordinal and spatial information occurred at the collective level rather than within single neurons. Thus, a simple representational geometry underlies sequence working memory.},

Empoasca leafhoppers, serious agricultural pests, identify host plants by eavesdropping on unknown outputs of jasmonate (JA)–mediated signaling. Forward- and reverse-genetics lines of a native tobacco plant were screened in native habitats with native herbivores using high-throughput genomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic tools to reveal an Empoasca -elicited JA-JAZi module. This module induces an uncharacterized caffeoylputrescine–green leaf volatile compound, catalyzed by a polyphenol oxidase in a Michael addition reaction, which we reconstitute in vitro; engineer in crop plants, where it requires a berberine bridge enzyme-like 2 (BBL2) for its synthesis; and show that it confers resistance to leafhoppers. Natural history–guided forward genetics reveals a conserved nonhost resistance mechanism useful for crop protection.},

Systematic discovery of stimulation-dependent cytokine regulators requires both loss-of-function and gain-of-function studies, which have been challenging in primary human cells. We now report genome-wide CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) and interference (CRISPRi) screens in primary human T cells to identify gene networks controlling interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) production. Arrayed CRISPRa confirmed key hits and enabled multiplexed secretome characterization, revealing reshaped cytokine responses. Coupling CRISPRa screening with single-cell RNA sequencing enabled deep molecular characterization of screen hits, revealing how perturbations tuned T cell activation and promoted cell states characterized by distinct cytokine expression profiles. These screens reveal genes that reprogram critical immune cell functions, which could inform the design of immunotherapies.},

PFAS are synthesized by two processes, direct fluorination (e.g., electrochemical fluorination) and oligomerization (e.g., fluorotelomerization). More than a megatonne of PFAS is produced yearly, and thousands of PFAS wind up in end-use products. Atmospheric and aqueous fugitive releases during manufacturing, use, and disposal have resulted in the global distribution of these compounds. Volatile PFAS facilitate long-range transport, commonly followed by complex transformation schemes to recalcitrant terminal PFAS, which do not degrade under environmental conditions and thus migrate through the environment and accumulate in biota through multiple pathways. Efforts to remediate PFAS-contaminated matrices still are in their infancy, with much current research targeting drinking water.},

Although embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and trophoblast stem cells (TSCs) retain the functional properties of epiblast and TB, respectively, stem cells that fully recapitulate the developmental potential of PrE have not been established. Here, we report derivation of primitive endoderm stem cells (PrESCs) in mice. PrESCs recapitulate properties of embryonic day 4.5 founder PrE, are efficiently incorporated into PrE upon blastocyst injection, generate functionally competent PrE-derived tissues, and support fetal development of PrE-depleted blastocysts in chimeras. Furthermore, PrESCs can establish interactions with ESCs and TSCs and generate descendants with yolk sac–like structures in utero. Establishment of PrESCs will enable the elucidation of the mechanisms for PrE specification and subsequent pre- and postimplantation development.},

  abstract     = {Understanding how excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) inputs are integrated by neurons requires monitoring their subthreshold behavior. We probed the subthreshold dynamics using optogenetic depolarizing pulses in hippocampal neuronal assemblies in freely moving mice. Excitability decreased during sharp-wave ripples coupled with increased I. In contrast to this “negative gain,” optogenetic probing showed increased within-field excitability in place cells by weakening I and unmasked stable place fields in initially non–place cells. Neuronal assemblies active during sharp-wave ripples in the home cage predicted spatial overlap and sequences of place fields of both place cells and unmasked preexisting place fields of non–place cells during track running. Thus, indirect probing of subthreshold dynamics in neuronal populations permits the disclosing of preexisting assemblies and modes of neuronal operations.},

  abstract     = {Past studies offer contradictory claims for the role of genome organization in the regulation of gene activity. Here, we show through high-resolution chromosome conformation analysis that the Drosophila genome is organized by two independent classes of regulatory sequences, tethering elements and insulators. Quantitative live imaging and targeted genome editing demonstrate that this two-tiered organization is critical for the precise temporal dynamics of Hox gene transcription during development. Tethering elements mediate long-range enhancer-promoter interactions and foster fast activation kinetics. Conversely, the boundaries of topologically associating domains (TADs) prevent spurious interactions with enhancers and silencers located in neighboring TADs. These two levels of genome organization operate independently of one another to ensure precision of transcriptional dynamics and the reliability of complex patterning processes.},

  abstract     = {Isoprene is emitted mainly by terrestrial vegetation and is the dominant volatile organic compound (VOC) in Earth’s atmosphere. It plays key roles in determining the oxidizing capacity of the troposphere and the formation of organic aerosol. Daytime infrared satellite observations of isoprene reported here broadly agree with emission inventories, but we found substantial differences in the locations and magnitudes of isoprene hotspots, consistent with a recent study. The corresponding nighttime infrared observations reveal unexpected hotspots over tropical South America, the Congo basin, and Southeast Asia. We used an atmospheric chemistry model to link these nighttime isoprene measurements to low-NO x regions with high biogenic VOC emissions; at sunrise the remaining isoprene can lead to the production of epoxydiols and subsequently to the widespread seasonal production of organic aerosol in the tropical upper troposphere.},

  abstract     = {Methane emissions from oil and gas (O&amp;G) production and transmission represent a considerable contribution to climate change. These emissions comprise sporadic releases of large amounts of methane during maintenance operations or equipment failures not accounted for in current inventory estimates. We collected and analyzed hundreds of very large releases from atmospheric methane images sampled by the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) between 2019 and 2020. Ultra-emitters are primarily detected over the largest O&amp;G basins throughout the world. With a total contribution equivalent to 8 to 12\% (~8 million metric tons of methane per year) of the global O&amp;G production methane emissions, mitigation of ultra-emitters is largely achievable at low costs and would lead to robust net benefits in billions of US dollars for the six major O&amp;G-producing countries when considering societal costs of methane.},

We engineered an enamel analog with the essential hierarchical structure at multiple scales through assembly of amorphous intergranular phase (AIP)–coated hydroxyapatite nanowires intertwined with polyvinyl alcohol. The nanocomposite simultaneously exhibited high stiffness, hardness, strength, viscoelasticity, and toughness, exceeding the properties of enamel and previously manufactured bulk enamel-inspired materials. The presence of AIP, polymer confinement, and strong interfacial adhesion are all needed for high mechanical performance. This multiscale design is suitable for scalable production of high-performance materials.},

This broad reaction platform enabled the functionalization of postconsumer polyolefins in infrastructure used to process plastic waste. Furthermore, the chemoselective placement of ionic functionality onto a branched polyolefin using carbon–hydrogen bond functionalization upcycled the material from a thermoplastic into a tough elastomer with the tensile properties of high-value polyolefin ionomers.},

  abstract     = {We discovered a highly virulent variant of subtype-B HIV-1 in the Netherlands. One hundred nine individuals with this variant had a 0.54 to 0.74 log 10 increase (i.e., a ~3.5-fold to 5.5-fold increase) in viral load compared with, and exhibited CD4 cell decline twice as fast as, 6604 individuals with other subtype-B strains. Without treatment, advanced HIV—CD4 cell counts below 350 cells per cubic millimeter, with long-term clinical consequences—is expected to be reached, on average, 9 months after diagnosis for individuals in their thirties with this variant. Age, sex, suspected mode of transmission, and place of birth for the aforementioned 109 individuals were typical for HIV-positive people in the Netherlands, which suggests that the increased virulence is attributable to the viral strain. Genetic sequence analysis suggests that this variant arose in the 1990s from de novo mutation, not recombination, with increased transmissibility and an unfamiliar molecular mechanism of virulence.},

In this work, we demonstrated on-demand creation of artificial neurons, synapses, and memory capacitors in post-fabricated perovskite NdNiO 3 devices that can be simply reconfigured for a specific purpose by single-shot electric pulses. The sensitivity of electronic properties of perovskite nickelates to the local distribution of hydrogen ions enabled these results. With experimental data from our memory capacitors, simulation results of a reservoir computing framework showed excellent performance for tasks such as digit recognition and classification of electrocardiogram heartbeat activity. Using our reconfigurable artificial neurons and synapses, simulated dynamic networks outperformed static networks for incremental learning scenarios. The ability to fashion the building blocks of brain-inspired computers on demand opens up new directions in adaptive networks.},

  abstract     = {Second sound attenuation, a distinctive dissipative hydrodynamic phenomenon in a superfluid, is crucial for understanding superfluidity and elucidating critical phenomena. Here, we report the observation of second sound attenuation in a homogeneous Fermi gas of lithium-6 atoms at unitarity by performing Bragg spectroscopy with high energy resolution in the long-wavelength limit. We successfully obtained the temperature dependence of second sound diffusivity D 2 and thermal conductivity κ. Furthermore, we observed a sudden rise—a precursor of critical divergence—in both D 2 and κ at a temperature of about 0.95 superfluid transition temperature T c . This suggests that the unitary Fermi gas has a much larger critical region than does liquid helium. Our results pave the way for determining the universal critical scaling functions near quantum criticality.},

We uncovered 440 genome-wide significant loci in the discovery cohort and 800 from a post hoc combined meta-analysis. Loci in adulthood were largely captured in childhood, showing signatures of negative selection, and were linked to early neurodevelopment and pathways associated with neuropsychiatric risk. Opposing gradations of decreased surface area and increased thickness were associated with common inversion polymorphisms. Inferior frontal regions, encompassing Broca’s area, which is important for speech, were enriched for human-specific genomic elements. Thus, a mixed genetic landscape of conserved and human-specific features is concordant with brain hierarchy and morphogenetic gradients.},

However, some studies have highlighted confounding factors that challenge the prevalence of 6mA in eukaryotes. We developed a metagenomic method to quantitatively deconvolve 6mA events from a genomic DNA sample into species of interest, genomic regions, and sources of contamination. Applying this method, we observed high-resolution 6mA deposition in two protozoa. We found that commensal or soil bacteria explained the vast majority of 6mA in insect and plant samples. We found no evidence of high abundance of 6mA in Drosophila , Arabidopsis , or humans. Plasmids used for genetic manipulation, even those from Dam methyltransferase mutant Escherichia coli , could carry abundant 6mA, confounding the evaluation of candidate 6mA methyltransferases and demethylases. On the basis of this work, we advocate for a reassessment of 6mA in eukaryotes.},

Although they have usefully highlighted the effect of acidity of PM2.5 on human health, there is no definitive evidence that quantification of the effects of PM2.5 components separately should be recommended in policy-making (1) or that emission controls of ammonia like those we suggest would substantially change the aerosol acidity. We are not arguing for NH3 controls in isolation; rather, we contend that NH3 abatement can play an important role in reducing exposure to PM2.5 and associated health impacts in the context of continued mitigation of other pollutants, such as sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx).},

How this germinal zone generates sufficient interneurons for the human brain remains unclear. We found that the human MGE (hMGE) contains nests of proliferative neuroblasts with ultrastructural and transcriptomic features that distinguish them from other progenitors in the hMGE. When dissociated hMGE cells are transplanted into the neonatal mouse brain, they reform into nests containing proliferating neuroblasts that generate young neurons that migrate extensively into the mouse forebrain and mature into different subtypes of functional interneurons. Together, these results indicate that the nest organization and sustained proliferation of neuroblasts in the hMGE provide a mechanism for the extended production of interneurons for the human forebrain.},

We generated a human cerebral organoid model for tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) and identified a specific neural stem cell type, caudal late interneuron progenitor (CLIP) cells. In TSC, CLIP cells over-proliferate, generating excessive interneurons, brain tumors, and cortical malformations. Epidermal growth factor receptor inhibition reduces tumor burden, identifying potential treatment options for TSC and related disorders. The identification of CLIP cells reveals the extended interneuron generation in the human brain as a vulnerability for disease. In addition, this work demonstrates that analyzing MCDs can reveal fundamental insights into human-specific aspects of brain development.},

Fasting mitigates winter food scarcity but eliminates dietary nitrogen, jeopardizing body protein balance. Here, we reveal gut microbiome–mediated urea nitrogen recycling in hibernating thirteen-lined ground squirrels ( Ictidomys tridecemlineatus ). Ureolytic gut microbes incorporate urea nitrogen into metabolites that are absorbed by the host, with the nitrogen reincorporated into the squirrel’s protein pool. Urea nitrogen recycling is greatest after prolonged fasting in late winter, when urea transporter abundance in gut tissue and urease gene abundance in the microbiome are highest. These results reveal a functional role for the gut microbiome during hibernation and suggest mechanisms by which urea nitrogen recycling may contribute to protein balance in other monogastric animals.},

The India-Asia collision further facilitated the dispersal of dipterocarps from India to similar climatic zones in Southeast Asia, which supports their out-of-India migration. The dispersal pathway suggested for Dipterocarpaceae may provide a framework for an alternative biogeographic hypothesis for several megathermal angiosperm families that are presently widely distributed in Southeast Asia.},

We describe the isolation and characterization of a human monoclonal antibody, designated S2K146, that broadly neutralizes viruses belonging to SARS-CoV– and SARS-CoV-2–related sarbecovirus clades, which use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as an entry receptor. Structural and functional studies show that most of the virus residues that directly bind S2K146 are also involved in binding to ACE2. This allows the antibody to potently inhibit receptor attachment. S2K146 protects against SARS-CoV-2 Beta variant challenge in hamsters, and viral passaging experiments reveal a high barrier for emergence of escape mutants, making it a good candidate for clinical development. The conserved ACE2-binding residues present a site of vulnerability that might be leveraged for developing vaccines eliciting broad sarbecovirus immunity.},

Using nearly a century’s worth of Eurasian reed warbler ( Acrocephalus scirpaceus ) ringing recoveries, we investigated whether fluctuations in Earth’s magnetic field predict variation in the sites to which birds return. Ringing recoveries suggest that magnetic inclination is learned before departure and is subsequently used as a uni-coordinate “stop sign” when relocating the natal or breeding site. However, many locations have the same inclination angle. Data from populations with different migratory directions indicate that birds solve this ambiguity by stopping at the first place where the right inclination is encountered on an inherited return vector.},

We tested the model for thousands of different lac operator sequences with a protein binding microarray and by observing kinetics for individual lac repressor molecules in single-molecule experiments. We found that sequence specificity is mainly governed by the efficiency with which the protein recognizes different targets. The variation in probability of recognizing different targets is at least 1.7 times as large as the variation in microscopic dissociation rates. Modulating the rate of binding instead of the rate of dissociation effectively reduces the risk of the protein being retained on nontarget sequences while searching.},

We examined their combined influence on a two-dimensional electronic system at the atomic interface between magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene and a tungsten diselenide crystal. We found that strong electron correlation within the moiré flatband stabilizes correlated insulating states at both quarter and half filling, and that SOC transforms these Mott-like insulators into ferromagnets, as evidenced by a robust anomalous Hall effect with hysteretic switching behavior. The coupling between spin and valley degrees of freedom could be demonstrated through control of the magnetic order with an in-plane magnetic field or a perpendicular electric field. Our findings establish an experimental knob to engineer topological properties of moiré bands in twisted bilayer graphene and related systems.},

Here, we describe a very different regime in which carrier distribution in graphene and its superlattices is shifted so far from equilibrium that the filled bands start playing an essential role, leading to a critical-current behavior. The criticalities develop upon the velocity of electron flow reaching the Fermi velocity. Key signatures of the out-of-equilibrium state are current-voltage characteristics that resemble those of superconductors, sharp peaks in differential resistance, sign reversal of the Hall effect, and a marked anomaly caused by the Schwinger-like production of hot electron-hole plasma.

  abstract     = {Flowering plants alternate between multicellular haploid (gametophyte) and diploid (sporophyte) generations. Pollen actively transcribes its haploid genome, providing phenotypic diversity even among pollen grains from a single plant. In this study, we used allele-specific RNA sequencing of single pollen precursors to follow the shift to haploid expression in maize pollen. We observed widespread biallelic expression for 11 days after meiosis, indicating that transcripts synthesized by the diploid sporophyte persist long into the haploid phase. Subsequently, there was a rapid and global conversion to monoallelic expression at pollen mitosis I, driven by active new transcription from the haploid genome. Genes showed evidence of increased purifying selection if they were expressed after (but not before) pollen mitosis I. This work establishes the timing during which haploid selection may act in pollen.},

  abstract     = {The “sign problem” (SP) is a fundamental limitation to simulations of strongly correlated matter. It is often argued that the SP is not intrinsic to the physics of particular Hamiltonians because its behavior can be influenced by the choice of algorithm. By contrast, we show that the SP in determinant quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) is quantitatively linked to quantum critical behavior. We demonstrate this through simulations of several models with critical properties that are relatively well understood. We propose a reinterpretation of the low average sign for the Hubbard model on the square lattice away from half filling in terms of the onset of pseudogap behavior and exotic superconductivity. Our study charts a path for exploiting the average sign in QMC simulations to understand quantum critical behavior.},

Here, we present the primary structures of ~30,000 unique proteoforms, nearly 10 times more than in previous studies, expressed from 1690 human genes across 21 cell types and plasma from human blood and bone marrow. The results, compiled in the Blood Proteoform Atlas (BPA), indicate that proteoforms better describe protein-level biology and are more specific indicators of differentiation than their corresponding proteins, which are more broadly expressed across cell types. We demonstrate the potential for clinical application, by interrogating the BPA in the context of liver transplantation and identifying cell and proteoform signatures that distinguish normal graft function from acute rejection and other causes of graft dysfunction.},

Here, we present structures of 5-HT 2A R complexed with the psychedelic drugs psilocin (the active metabolite of psilocybin) and d -lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), as well as the endogenous neurotransmitter serotonin and the nonhallucinogenic psychedelic analog lisuride. Serotonin and psilocin display a second binding mode in addition to the canonical mode, which enabled the design of the psychedelic IHCH-7113 (a substructure of antipsychotic lumateperone) and several 5-HT 2A R β-arrestin–biased agonists that displayed antidepressant-like activity in mice but without hallucinogenic effects. The 5-HT 2A R complex structures presented herein and the resulting insights provide a solid foundation for the structure-based design of safe and effective nonhallucinogenic psychedelic analogs with therapeutic effects.},

We use implicit negative design to generate β sheet–mediated heterodimers that can be assembled into a wide variety of complexes. The designs are stable, folded, and soluble in isolation and rapidly assemble upon mixing, and crystal structures are close to the computational models. We construct linearly arranged hetero-oligomers with up to six different components, branched hetero-oligomers, closed C4-symmetric two-component rings, and hetero-oligomers assembled on a cyclic homo-oligomeric central hub and demonstrate that such complexes can readily reconfigure through subunit exchange. Our approach provides a general route to designing asymmetric reconfigurable protein systems.},

  abstract     = {Darwin’s theory of sexual selection fundamentally changed how we think about sex and evolution. The struggle over mating and fertilization is a powerful driver of diversification within and among species. Contemporaries dismissed Darwin’s conjecture of a “taste for the beautiful” as favoring particular mates over others, but there is now overwhelming evidence for a primary role of both male and female mate choice in sexual selection. Darwin’s misogyny precluded much analysis of the “taste”; an increasing focus on mate choice mechanisms before, during, and after mating reveals that these often evolve in response to selection pressures that have little to do with sexual selection on chosen traits. Where traits and preferences do coevolve, they can do so whether fitness effects on choosers are positive, neutral, or negative. The spectrum of selection on traits and preferences, and how traits and preferences respond to social effects, determine how sexual selection and mate choice influence broader-scale processes like reproductive isolation and population responses to environmental change.},

Designing synthetic multistable circuits would provide insight into natural cell fate control circuit architectures and would allow engineering of multicellular programs that require interactions among distinct cell types. We created MultiFate, a naturally inspired, synthetic circuit that supports long-term, controllable, and expandable multistability in mammalian cells. MultiFate uses engineered zinc finger transcription factors that transcriptionally self-activate as homodimers and mutually inhibit one another through heterodimerization. Using a model-based design, we engineered MultiFate circuits that generate as many as seven states, each stable for at least 18 days. MultiFate permits controlled state switching and modulation of state stability through external inputs and can be expanded with additional transcription factors. These results provide a foundation for engineering multicellular behaviors in mammalian cells.},

Still, considerable gaps in our understanding of the spatial ecology of ecosystem services remain. We combined spatial information on larval dispersal networks and estimates of human pressure to test the importance of connectivity for ecosystem service provision. We found that reefs receiving larvae from highly connected dispersal corridors were associated with high fish species richness. Generally, larval “sinks” contained twice as much fish biomass as “sources” and exhibited greater resilience to human pressure when protected. Despite their potential to support biodiversity persistence and sustainable fisheries, up to 70\% of important dispersal corridors, sinks, and source reefs remain unprotected, emphasizing the need for increased protection of networks of well-connected reefs.},

Using cryo–electron microscopy and single–molecule imaging, we investigated how MAP7 binds MTs and facilitates kinesin-1 motility. The MT-binding domain (MTBD) of MAP7 bound MTs as an extended α helix between the protofilament ridge and the site of lateral contact. Unexpectedly, the MTBD partially overlapped with the binding site of kinesin-1 and inhibited its motility. However, by tethering kinesin-1 to the MT, the projection domain of MAP7 prevented dissociation of the motor and facilitated its binding to available neighboring sites. The inhibitory effect of the MTBD dominated as MTs became saturated with MAP7. Our results reveal biphasic regulation of kinesin-1 by MAP7 in the context of their competitive binding to MTs.},

Here, we address this by establishing high-speed image-enabled cell sorting (ICS), which records multicolor fluorescence images and sorts cells based on measurements from image data at speeds up to 15,000 events per second. We show that ICS quantifies cell morphology and localization of labeled proteins and increases the resolution of cell cycle analyses by separating mitotic stages. We combine ICS with CRISPR-pooled screens to identify regulators of the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) pathway, enabling the completion of genome-wide image-based screens in about 9 hours of run time. By assessing complex cellular phenotypes, ICS substantially expands the phenotypic space accessible to cell-sorting applications and pooled genetic screening.},

Children expect saliva sharing to happen in nuclear families. Toddlers and infants expect that people who share saliva will respond to one another in distress. Parents confirm that saliva sharing is a valid cue of relationship thickness in their children’s social environments.

  abstract     = {Fertilization of an egg by multiple sperm (polyspermy) leads to lethal genome imbalance and chromosome segregation defects. In Arabidopsis thaliana , the block to polyspermy is facilitated by a mechanism that prevents polytubey (the arrival of multiple pollen tubes to one ovule). We show here that FERONIA, ANJEA, and HERCULES RECEPTOR KINASE 1 receptor-like kinases located at the septum interact with pollen tube–specific RALF6, 7, 16, 36, and 37 peptide ligands to establish this polytubey block. The same combination of RALF (rapid alkalinization factor) peptides and receptor complexes controls pollen tube reception and rupture inside the targeted ovule. Pollen tube rupture releases the polytubey block at the septum, which allows the emergence of secondary pollen tubes upon fertilization failure. Thus, orchestrated steps in the fertilization process in Arabidopsis are coordinated by the same signaling components to guarantee and optimize reproductive success.},

  abstract     = {In quantum systems, coherent superpositions of electronic states evolve on ultrafast time scales (few femtoseconds to attoseconds; 1 attosecond = 0.001 femtoseconds = 10 −18 seconds), leading to a time-dependent charge density. Here we performed time-resolved measurements using attosecond soft x-ray pulses produced by a free-electron laser, to track the evolution of a coherent core-hole excitation in nitric oxide. Using an additional circularly polarized infrared laser pulse, we created a clock to time-resolve the electron dynamics and demonstrated control of the coherent electron motion by tuning the photon energy of the x-ray pulse. Core-excited states offer a fundamental test bed for studying coherent electron dynamics in highly excited and strongly correlated matter.},

Madsen et al . ( 1 ) question the veracity of calibrated radiocarbon ages used to constrain the antiquity of human trackways discovered recently at White Sands National Park (WHSA) Locality 2, New Mexico, USA ( 2 ). The ages were derived from seeds of the aquatic plant Ruppia cirrhosa , which they suggest may suffer from hard-water (or reservoir) effects, making them too old, potentially by thousands of years. We were well aware of this possibility, investigated it, and presented several lines of evidence that argued against such a problem. Here we respond to each of their four primary points.},

  abstract     = {The outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) is essential for cellular homeostasis. Yet little is known of the mechanisms that remodel it during natural stresses. We found that large “SPOTs” (structures positive for OMM) emerge during Toxoplasma gondii infection in mammalian cells. SPOTs mediated the depletion of the OMM proteins mitofusin 1 and 2, which restrict parasite growth. The formation of SPOTs depended on the parasite effector TgMAF1 and the host mitochondrial import receptor TOM70, which is required for optimal parasite proliferation. TOM70 enabled TgMAF1 to interact with the host OMM translocase SAM50. The ablation of SAM50 or the overexpression of an OMM-targeted protein promoted OMM remodeling independently of infection. Thus, Toxoplasma hijacks the formation of SPOTs, a cellular response to OMM stress, to promote its growth.},

Small-molecule inhibitors of CDK4/6 have been used with great success in the treatment of hormone receptor–positive breast cancers and are in clinical trials for many other tumor types. Unexpectedly, recent work indicates that inhibition of CDK4/6 affects a wide range of cellular functions such as tumor cell metabolism and antitumor immunity.

A spatial superposition of a massive particle is predicted to be sensitive to this effect. We measure the gravitational phase shift induced in a matter-wave interferometer by a kilogram-scale source mass close to one of the wave packets. Deflections of each interferometer arm due to the source mass are independently measured. The phase shift deviates from the deflection-induced phase contribution, as predicted by quantum mechanics. In addition, the observed scaling of the phase shift is consistent with Heisenberg’s error-disturbance relation. These results show that gravity creates Aharonov-Bohm phase shifts analogous to those produced by electromagnetic interactions.},

We discovered gasdermin homologs encoded in bacteria that defended against phages and executed cell death. Structures of bacterial gasdermins revealed a conserved pore-forming domain that was stabilized in the inactive state with a buried lipid modification. Bacterial gasdermins were activated by dedicated caspase-like proteases that catalyzed site-specific cleavage and the removal of an inhibitory C-terminal peptide. Release of autoinhibition induced the assembly of large and heterogeneous pores that disrupted membrane integrity. Thus, pyroptosis is an ancient form of regulated cell death shared between bacteria and animals.},

Olfactory receptors (OLFRs) are G protein–coupled chemoreceptors that have a central role in detecting odorants and the sense of smell. We found that mouse vascular macrophages express the olfactory receptor Olfr2 and all associated trafficking and signaling molecules. Olfr2 detects the compound octanal, which activates the NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome and induces interleukin-1β secretion in human and mouse macrophages. We found that human and mouse blood plasma contains octanal, a product of lipid peroxidation, at concentrations sufficient to activate Olfr2 and the human ortholog olfactory receptor 6A2 (OR6A2). Boosting octanal levels exacerbated atherosclerosis, whereas genetic targeting of Olfr2 in mice significantly reduced atherosclerotic plaques.

Seed dispersal interactions lost through defaunation and gained during novel community assembly influence whether plants can adapt to climate change through migration. We develop trait-based models to predict pairwise interactions and dispersal function for fleshy-fruited plants globally. Using interactions with introduced species as an observable proxy for interactions in future novel seed dispersal networks, we find strong potential to forecast their assembly and functioning. We conservatively estimate that mammal and bird defaunation has already reduced the capacity of plants to track climate change by 60\% globally. This strong reduction in the ability of plants to adapt to climate change through range shifts shows a synergy between defaunation and climate change that undermines vegetation resilience.},

Under applied magnetic field, electrons and holes couple across the barrier to form bound magneto-excitons whose pairing strength can be continuously tuned by varying the effective layer separation. Using temperature-dependent Coulomb drag and counterflow current measurements, we were able to tune the magneto-exciton condensate through the entire phase diagram from weak to strong coupling.

A first-order property of iron is its melting point, which is still debated for the conditions of Earth’s interior. We used high-energy lasers at the National Ignition Facility and in situ x-ray diffraction to determine the melting point of iron up to 1000 gigapascals, three times the pressure of Earth’s inner core. We used this melting curve to determine the length of dynamo action during core solidification to the hexagonal close-packed (hcp) structure.

AtRRP44A can interact with plasmodesmata and mediates the cell-to-cell trafficking of KN1 mRNA, and genetic analysis indicates that AtRRP44A is required for the developmental functions of SHOOT MERISTEMLESS, an Arabidopsis KN1 homolog.

  abstract     = {Since its adoption in 1993, the Chemical Weapons Convention has banned the development, possession, and use of weaponized toxic chemicals (1). However, whether this prohibition also applied to law enforcement use of certain agents that act on the central nervous system (CNS) remained the subject of debate. In December 2021, after years of applied scientific research [e.g., (2–5)], public awareness raising, and advocacy, the Conference of States Parties to the Chemical Weapons Convention adopted a landmark Decision to effectively outlaw the aerosolized use of CNS-acting chemical agents for law enforcement purposes (6). This is welcome news for those who want to ensure that benignly intended scientific research is not misused for hostile purposes, but the policy leaves room for improvement.},

We combined two-photon calcium imaging with spatial transcriptomics to functionally and molecularly investigate cortical circuits. We characterized behavior-related responses across major neuronal subclasses in layers 2 or 3 of the primary somatosensory cortex as mice performed a tactile working memory task. We identified an excitatory intratelencephalic cell type, Baz1a, that exhibits high tactile feature selectivity. Baz1a neurons homeostatically maintain stimulus responsiveness during altered experience and show persistent enrichment of subsets of immediately early genes. Functional and anatomical connectivity reveals that Baz1a neurons residing in upper portions of layers 2 or 3 preferentially innervate somatostatin-expressing inhibitory neurons. This motif defines a circuit hub that orchestrates local sensory processing in superficial layers of the neocortex.},

However, the underlying neuronal mechanisms that encode and maintain such specific motivational control of behavior are poorly understood. Here, we used Ca 2+ imaging and optogenetic manipulations in the basolateral amygdala of freely moving mice performing noncued, self-paced instrumental goal-directed actions to receive and consume rewards. We found that distinct neuronal activity patterns sequentially represent the entire action-consumption behavioral sequence. Whereas action-associated patterns integrated the identity, value, and expectancy of pursued goals, consumption-associated patterns reflected the identity and value of experienced outcomes. Thus, the interplay between these patterns allows the maintenance of specific motivational states necessary to adaptively direct behavior toward prospective rewards.},

By definition, they self-organize, but the structures formed are often heterogeneous and irreproducible, which limits their use in the lab and clinic. We describe methodologies for spatially and temporally controlling organoid formation, thereby rendering a stochastic process more deterministic. Bioengineered stem cell microenvironments are used to specify the initial geometry of intestinal organoids, which in turn controls their patterning and crypt formation. We leveraged the reproducibility and predictability of the culture to identify the underlying mechanisms of epithelial patterning, which may contribute to reinforcing intestinal regionalization in vivo. By controlling organoid culture, we demonstrate how these structures can be used to answer questions not readily addressable with the standard, more variable, organoid models.},

  abstract     = {Climate change is expected to result in smaller fish size, but the influence of fishing has made it difficult to substantiate the theorized link between size and ocean warming and deoxygenation. We reconstructed the fish community and oceanographic conditions of the most recent global warm period (last interglacial; 130 to 116 thousand years before present) by using sediments from the northern Humboldt Current system off the coast of Peru, a hotspot of small pelagic fish productivity. In contrast to the present-day anchovy-dominated state, the last interglacial was characterized by considerably smaller (mesopelagic and goby-like) fishes and very low anchovy abundance. These small fish species are more difficult to harvest and are less palatable than anchovies, indicating that our rapidly warming world poses a threat to the global fish supply.},

  abstract     = {Ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) are one of the most abundant groups of microbes in the world’s oceans and are key players in the nitrogen cycle. Their energy metabolism—the oxidation of ammonia to nitrite—requires oxygen. Nevertheless, AOA are abundant in environments where oxygen is undetectable. By carrying out incubations for which oxygen concentrations were resolved to the nanomolar range, we show that after oxygen depletion, Nitrosopumilus maritimus produces dinitrogen and oxygen, which is used for ammonia oxidation. The pathway is not completely resolved but likely has nitric oxide and nitrous oxide as key intermediates. N. maritimus joins a handful of organisms known to produce oxygen in the dark. On the basis of this ability, we reevaluate the role of N. maritimus in oxygen-depleted marine environments.},

We developed a therapeutic approach to generate transient antifibrotic chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells in vivo by delivering modified messenger RNA (mRNA) in T cell–targeted lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). The efficacy of these in vivo–reprogrammed CAR T cells was evaluated by injecting CD5-targeted LNPs into a mouse model of heart failure. Efficient delivery of modified mRNA encoding the CAR to T lymphocytes was observed, which produced transient, effective CAR T cells in vivo. Antifibrotic CAR T cells exhibited trogocytosis and retained the target antigen as they accumulated in the spleen. Treatment with modified mRNA-targeted LNPs reduced fibrosis and restored cardiac function after injury. In vivo generation of CAR T cells may hold promise as a therapeutic platform to treat various diseases.},

This leads to substantial gaps in our understanding of the structure and chemistry of key interfaces in battery systems. We adopt and modify a thin film vitrification method to preserve the sensitive yet critical interfaces in batteries at native liquid electrolyte environments to enable cryo–electron microscopy and spectroscopy. We report substantial swelling of the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) on lithium metal anode in various electrolytes. The swelling behavior is dependent on electrolyte chemistry and is highly correlated to battery performance. Higher degrees of SEI swelling tend to exhibit poor electrochemical cycling.},

This quasi-one-dimensional zeolite is assembled by a bolaform structure-directing agent (SDA) containing a central biphenyl group connected by C 10 alkyl chains to quinuclidinium end groups. High-resolution electron microscopy and diffraction, along with other supporting methods, revealed a unique wall structure that is a hybrid of characteristic building layers from two zeolite structure types, beta and MFI. This hybrid structure arises from minimization of strain energy during the formation of a curved nanotube wall. Nanotube formation involves the early appearance of a mesostructure due to self-assembly of the SDA molecules. The biphenyl core groups of the SDA molecules show evidence of π stacking, whereas the peripheral quinuclidinium groups direct the microporous wall structure.},

However, T ex estimates are limited in geographical coverage and often inconsistent for individual hotspots. We infer the temperature of oceanic hotspots and ridges simultaneously by converting seismic velocity to temperature. We show that while ~45\% of plume-fed hotspots are hot ( T ex ≥ 155°C), ~15\% are cold ( T ex ≤ 36°C) and ~40\% are not hot enough to actively upwell (50°C ≤ T ex ≤ 136°C). Hot hotspots have an extremely high helium-3/helium-4 ratio and buoyancy flux, but cold hotspots do not. The latter may originate at upper mantle depths. Alternatively, the deep plumes that feed them may be entrained and cooled by small-scale convection.},
