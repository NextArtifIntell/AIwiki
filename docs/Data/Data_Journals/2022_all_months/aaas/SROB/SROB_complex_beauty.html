Crawling has been demonstrated previously with thermoresponsive hydrogels but required patterned or constrained gels or substrates to break symmetry for unidirectional motion. Here, we demonstrate a locomotion mechanism for unidirectionally crawling gels driven by spontaneous asymmetries in contact forces during swelling and deswelling of segmented active thermoresponsive poly( N -isopropylacrylamide) (pNIPAM) and passive polyacrylamide (pAAM) bilayers with suspended linkers. Actuation studies demonstrate the consistent unidirectional movement of these gel crawlers across multiple thermal cycles on flat, unpatterned substrates. We explain the mechanism using finite element simulations and by varying experimental parameters such as the linker stiffness and the number of bilayer segments. We elucidate design criteria and validate experiments using image analysis and finite element models. We anticipate that this mechanism could potentially be applied to other shape-changing locomotors.},

  abstract     = {A climbing robot that can rapidly move on diverse surfaces such as floors, walls, and ceilings will have an enlarged operational workspace compared with other terrestrial robots. However, the climbing skill of robots in such environments has been limited to low speeds or simple locomotion tasks. Here, we present an untethered quadrupedal climbing robot called MARVEL (magnetically adhesive robot for versatile and expeditious locomotion), capable of agile and versatile climbing locomotion in ferromagnetic environments. MARVEL excels over prior climbing robots in terms of climbing speed and ability to execute various motions. It demonstrates the fastest vertical and inverted walking speed, whereas its versatile locomotion ability enables the highest number of gaits and locomotion tasks. The key innovations are an integrated foot design using electropermanent magnets and magnetorheological elastomers that provide large adhesion and traction forces, torque control actuators, and a model predictive control framework adapted for stable climbing. In experiments, the robot achieved locomotion on ceilings and vertical walls up to 0.5 meter (1.51 body lengths) per second and 0.7 meter (2.12 body lengths) per second, respectively. Furthermore, the robot exhibited complex behaviors such as stepping over 10-centimeter-wide gaps; overcoming 5-centimeter-high obstacles; and making transitions between floors, walls, and ceilings. We also show that MARVEL could climb on a curved surface of a storage tank covered with up to 0.3-millimeter-thick paint with rust and dust.},

Here, we report the design of a DNA framework nanomachine (DFN) that can autonomously change shape in response to pH variations in single synaptic vesicles, which, in turn, displays adaptive fluorescent colors with a mechano-fluorescence actuation mechanism. To construct a DFN, we used a tetrahedral DNA nanostructure as the framework to incorporate an embedded pH-responsive, i-motif sequence tagged with a Förster resonance energy transfer pair and an affinity cholesterol moiety targeting vesicular membranes. We found that endocytosed DFNs are individually trapped in single endocytic vesicles in living synaptic cells due to the size-exclusion effect. The adaptive fluorescence coloration of DFNs enabled single-vesicle quantification of resting pH values in a processive manner, allowing long-term tracking of the exocytosis and fusion dynamics in intracellular processes and cell-cell communications.},

  abstract     = {Tiny “gnat robots, ” weighing just a few milligrams, were first conjectured in the 1980s. How to stabilize one if it were to hover like a small insect has not been answered. Challenges include the requirement that sensors be both low mass and high bandwidth and that silicon-micromachined rate gyroscopes are too heavy. The smallest robot to perform controlled hovering uses a sensor suite weighing hundreds of milligrams. Here, we demonstrate that an accelerometer represents perhaps the most direct way to stabilize flight while satisfying the extreme size, speed, weight, and power constraints of a flying robot even as it scales down to just a few milligrams. As aircraft scale reduces, scaling physics dictates that the ratio of aerodynamic drag to mass increases. This results in reduced noise in an accelerometer’s airspeed measurement. We show through simulation and experiment on a 30-gram robot that a 2-milligram off-the-shelf accelerometer is able in principle to stabilize a 10-milligram robot despite high noise in the sensor itself. Inspired by wind-vision sensory fusion in the flight controller of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster , we then added a tiny camera and efficient, fly-inspired autocorrelation-based visual processing to allow the robot to estimate and reject wind as well as control its attitude and flight velocity using a Kalman filter. Our biology-inspired approach, validated on a small flying helicopter, has a wind gust response comparable to the fruit fly and is small and efficient enough for a 10-milligram flying vehicle (weighing less than a grain of rice).},

  abstract     = {Robotic leg prostheses promise to improve the mobility and quality of life of millions of individuals with lower-limb amputations by imitating the biomechanics of the missing biological leg. Unfortunately, existing powered prostheses are much heavier and bigger and have shorter battery life than conventional passive prostheses, severely limiting their clinical viability and utility in the daily life of amputees. Here, we present a robotic leg prosthesis that replicates the key biomechanical functions of the biological knee, ankle, and toe in the sagittal plane while matching the weight, size, and battery life of conventional microprocessor-controlled prostheses. The powered knee joint uses a unique torque-sensitive mechanism combining the benefits of elastic actuators with that of variable transmissions. A single actuator powers the ankle and toe joints through a compliant, underactuated mechanism. Because the biological toe dissipates energy while the biological ankle injects energy into the gait cycle, this underactuated system regenerates substantial mechanical energy and replicates the key biomechanical functions of the ankle/foot complex during walking. A compact prosthesis frame encloses all mechanical and electrical components for increased robustness and efficiency. Preclinical tests with three individuals with above-knee amputation show that the proposed robotic leg prosthesis allows for common ambulation activities with close to normative kinematics and kinetics. Using an optional passive mode, users can walk on level ground indefinitely without charging the battery, which has not been shown with any other powered or microprocessor-controlled prostheses. A prosthesis with these characteristics has the potential to improve real-world mobility in individuals with above-knee amputation.},

Electroadhesive clutches can rapidly adhere high stiffness elements, although their low force capacities and high activation voltages have limited their applications. A major challenge in realizing stronger electroadhesive clutches is that current parallel plate models poorly predict clutch force capacity and cannot be used to design better devices. Here, we use a fracture mechanics framework to understand the relationship between clutch design and force capacity. We demonstrate and verify a mechanics-based model that predicts clutch performance across multiple geometries and applied voltages. On the basis of this approach, we build a clutch with 63 times the force capacity per unit electrostatic force of state-of-the-art electroadhesive clutches. Last, we demonstrate the ability of our electroadhesives to increase the load capacity of a soft, pneumatic finger by a factor of 27 times compared with a finger without an electroadhesive.},

Here, we describe a class of architected materials, called mechanical neural networks (MNNs), that achieve such learning capabilities by tuning the stiffness of their constituent beams similar to how artificial neural networks (ANNs) tune their weights. An example lattice was fabricated to demonstrate its ability to learn multiple mechanical behaviors simultaneously, and a study was conducted to determine the effect of lattice size, packing configuration, algorithm type, behavior number, and linear-versus-nonlinear stiffness tunability on MNN learning as proposed. Thus, this work lays the foundation for artificial-intelligent (AI) materials that can learn behaviors and properties.},

When walking (1.25 m/s) unassisted on a treadmill with load carriage weights of 15 and 30\% of body weight, peak Achilles tendon force increased by 11 and 23\%, respectively. Ankle exosuit assistance significantly reduced peak Achilles tendon force relative to unassisted, although the magnitude of change was variable across participants. Peak Achilles tendon force was significantly correlated with peak ankle torque for unassisted walking across load carriage conditions. However, when ankle plantarflexor assistance was applied, the relationship between peak tendon force and peak biological ankle torque was no longer significant. An outdoor pilot study was conducted in which a wearable shear wave tensiometer was used to measure Achilles tendon wave speed and compare across an array of assistance loading profiles. Reductions in tendon loading varied depending on the profile, highlighting the importance of in vivo measurements of muscle and tendon forces when studying and optimizing exoskeletons and exosuits.},

However, reported actuators based on hydrogels generally suffer from slow response speed and/or poor controllability due to intrinsic material limitations and electrode fabrication technologies. Here, we report a hydrogel actuator that operates at low voltages ( 50\%, energy density &gt; 7 × 10 5 joules per cubic meter, and power density &gt; 3 × 10 4 watts per cubic meter), surpassing existing hydrogel actuators and other types of electroactive soft actuators. The enhanced performance of our actuator is due to the formation of wrinkled nanomembrane electrodes that exhibit high conductivity and excellent mechanical deformation through capillary-assisted assembly of metal nanoparticles and deswelling-induced wrinkled structures. By applying an electric potential through the wrinkled nanomembrane electrodes that sandwich the hydrogel, we were able to trigger a reversible and substantial electroosmotic water flow inside a hydrogel film, which drove the controlled swelling of the hydrogel. The high energy efficiency and power density of our wrinkled nanomembrane electrode–induced actuator enabled the fabrication of an untethered insect-scale aquabot integrated with an on-board control unit demonstrating maneuverability with fast locomotion speed (1.02 body length per second), which occupies only 2\% of the total mass of the robot.},

Magnetic fields in particular have been used as a safe means to transfer energy and direct their motion. Thus far, the magnetic control strategies used in this context rely on poorly scalable magnetic field gradients, require active position feedback, or are ill-suited to diffuse distributions within the body. Here, we present a magnetic torque–driven control scheme for enhanced transport through biological barriers that complements the innate taxis toward tumor cores exhibited by a range of bacteria, shown for Magnetospirillum magneticum as a magnetically responsive model organism. This hybrid control strategy is readily scalable, independent of position feedback, and applicable to bacterial microrobots dispersed by the circulatory system. We observed a fourfold increase in translocation of magnetically responsive bacteria across a model of the vascular endothelium and found that the primary mechanism driving increased transport is torque-driven surface exploration at the cell interface. Using spheroids as a three-dimensional tumor model, fluorescently labeled bacteria colonized their core regions with up to 21-fold higher signal in samples exposed to rotating magnetic fields. In addition to enhanced transport, we demonstrated that our control scheme offers further advantages, including the possibility for closed-loop optimization based on inductive detection, as well as spatially selective actuation to reduce off-target effects. Last, after systemic intravenous injection in mice, we showed significantly increased bacterial tumor accumulation, supporting the feasibility of deploying this control scheme clinically for magnetically responsive biohybrid microrobots.},

Microscopic robots are poised for a similar revolution in fields from medicine to environmental remediation. A key hurdle to developing these microscopic robots is the integration of information systems, particularly electronics fabricated at commercial foundries, with microactuators. Here, we develop such an integration process and build microscopic robots controlled by onboard complementary metal oxide semiconductor electronics. The resulting autonomous, untethered robots are 100 to 250 micrometers in size, are powered by light, and walk at speeds greater than 10 micrometers per second. In addition, we demonstrate a microscopic robot that can respond to an optical command. This work paves the way for ubiquitous autonomous microscopic robots that perform complex functions, respond to their environments, and communicate with the outside world.},

Luminal mucus represents the initial steric and dynamic barrier to absorption. To overcome this barrier, we report the development of the RoboCap, an orally ingestible, robotic drug delivery capsule that locally clears the mucus layer, enhances luminal mixing, and topically deposits the drug payload in the small intestine to enhance drug absorption. RoboCap’s mucus-clearing and churning movements are facilitated by an internal motor and by surface features that interact with small intestinal plicae circulares, villi, and mucus. Vancomycin (1.4 kilodaltons of glycopeptide) and insulin (5.8 kilodaltons of peptide) delivery mediated by RoboCap resulted in enhanced bioavailability 20- to 40-fold greater in ex vivo and in vivo swine models when compared with standard oral delivery ( P &lt; 0.05). Further, insulin delivery via the RoboCap resulted in therapeutic hypoglycemia, supporting its potential to facilitate oral delivery of drugs that are normally precluded by absorption limitations.},

  abstract     = {The use of micromotors for active drug delivery via oral administration has recently gained considerable interest. However, efficient motor-assisted delivery into the gastrointestinal (GI) tract remains challenging, owing to the short propulsion lifetime of currently used micromotor platforms. Here, we report on an efficient algae-based motor platform, which takes advantage of the fast and long-lasting swimming behavior of natural microalgae in intestinal fluid to prolong local retention within the GI tract. Fluorescent dye or cell membrane–coated nanoparticle functionalized algae motors were further embedded inside a pH-sensitive capsule to enhance delivery to the small intestines. In vitro, the algae motors displayed a constant motion behavior in simulated intestinal fluid after 12 hours of continuous operation. When orally administered in vivo into mice, the algae motors substantially improved GI distribution of the dye payload compared with traditional magnesium-based micromotors, which are limited by short propulsion lifetimes, and they also enhanced retention of a model chemotherapeutic payload in the GI tract compared with a passive nanoparticle formulation. Overall, combining the efficient motion and extended lifetime of natural algae–based motors with the protective capabilities of oral capsules results in a promising micromotor platform capable of achieving greatly improved cargo delivery in GI tissue for practical biomedical applications.},

  abstract     = {The limited force or torque outputs of miniature magnetic actuators constrain the locomotion performances and functionalities of magnetic millimeter-scale robots. Here, we present a magnetically actuated gearbox with a maximum size of 3 millimeters for driving wireless millirobots. The gearbox is assembled using microgears that have reference diameters down to 270 micrometers and are made of aluminum-filled epoxy resins through casting. With a magnetic disk attached to the input shaft, the gearbox can be driven by a rotating external magnetic field, which is not more than 6.8 millitesla, to produce torque of up to 0.182 millinewton meters at 40 hertz. The corresponding torque and power densities are 12.15 micronewton meters per cubic millimeter and 8.93 microwatt per cubic millimeter, respectively. The transmission efficiency of the gearbox in the air is between 25.1 and 29.2\% at actuation frequencies ranging from 1 to 40 hertz, and it lowers when the gearbox is actuated in viscous liquids. This miniature gearbox can be accessed wirelessly and integrated with various functional modules to repeatedly generate large actuation forces, strains, and speeds; store energy in elastic components; and lock up mechanical linkages. These characteristics enable us to achieve a peristaltic robot that can crawl on a flat substrate or inside a tube, a jumping robot with a tunable jumping height, a clamping robot that can sample solid objects by grasping, a needle-puncture robot that can take samples from the inside of the target, and a syringe robot that can collect or release liquids.},

  abstract     = {Learning to combine control at the level of joint torques with longer-term goal-directed behavior is a long-standing challenge for physically embodied artificial agents. Intelligent behavior in the physical world unfolds across multiple spatial and temporal scales: Although movements are ultimately executed at the level of instantaneous muscle tensions or joint torques, they must be selected to serve goals that are defined on much longer time scales and that often involve complex interactions with the environment and other agents. Recent research has demonstrated the potential of learning-based approaches applied to the respective problems of complex movement, long-term planning, and multiagent coordination. However, their integration traditionally required the design and optimization of independent subsystems and remains challenging. In this work, we tackled the integration of motor control and long-horizon decision-making in the context of simulated humanoid football, which requires agile motor control and multiagent coordination. We optimized teams of agents to play simulated football via reinforcement learning, constraining the solution space to that of plausible movements learned using human motion capture data. They were trained to maximize several environment rewards and to imitate pretrained football-specific skills if doing so led to improved performance. The result is a team of coordinated humanoid football players that exhibit complex behavior at different scales, quantified by a range of analysis and statistics, including those used in real-world sport analytics. Our work constitutes a complete demonstration of learned integrated decision-making at multiple scales in a multiagent setting.},

Increasing the manipulation throughput is thus a key factor for the emergence of robotized microassembly industries. This article presents MiGriBot (Millimeter Gripper Robot), a miniaturized parallel robot with a configurable platform and soft joints, designed to perform pick-and-place operations at the microscale. MiGriBot combines in a single robot the benefits of a parallel kinematic architecture with a configurable platform and the use of soft joints at the millimeter scale. The configurable platform of the robot provides an internal degree of freedom that can be used to actuate microtweezers using piezoelectric bending actuators located at the base of the robot, which notably reduces the robot’s inertia. The soft joints make it possible to miniaturize the mechanism and to avoid friction. These benefits enable MiGriBot to reach a throughput of 10 pick-and-place cycles per second of micrometer-sized objects, with a precision of 1 micrometer.},

Rapid progress has been achieved in developing miniaturized components for microrobotic systems, resulting in a variety of functional microactuators and soft components for creating untethered microrobots. Nevertheless, the integration of microcomponents, especially the assembly of actuators and mechanical components, is still time-consuming and has inherent restrictions, thus limiting efficient fabrications of microrobots and their potential applications. Here, we propose a method for fabricating microrobots in situ inspired by the construction of microsystems in living organisms. In a microfluidic chip, hydrogel mechanical components and artificial muscle actuators are successively photopatterned from hydrogel prepolymer and biomolecular motors, respectively, and integrated in situ into functional microrobots. The proposed method allows the fast fabrication of microrobots through simple operations and affordable materials while providing versatile functions through the precise spatiotemporal control of in situ integration and reconfiguration of artificial muscles. To validate the method, we fabricated microrobots to elicit different motions and on-chip robots with unique characteristics for microfluidic applications. This study may establish a new paradigm for microrobot integration and lead to the production of unique biohybrid microrobots with various advantages.},

Nevertheless, only a few studies have investigated whether and how variability features contribute to the ascription of humanness to robots in a human-robot interaction setting. Here, we tested whether two aspects of behavioral variability, namely, the standard deviation and the shape of distribution of reaction times, affect the ascription of humanness to robots during a joint action scenario. We designed an interactive task in which pairs of participants performed a joint Simon task with an iCub robot placed by their side. Either iCub could perform the task in a preprogrammed manner, or its button presses could be teleoperated by the other member of the pair, seated in the other room. Under the preprogrammed condition, the iCub pressed buttons with reaction times falling within the range of human variability. However, the distribution of the reaction times did not resemble a human-like shape. Participants were sensitive to humanness, because they correctly detected the human agent above chance level. When the iCub was controlled by the computer program, it passed our variation of a nonverbal Turing test. Together, our results suggest that hints of humanness, such as the range of behavioral variability, might be used by observers to ascribe humanness to a humanoid robot.},

Although artificial actuators have reached the contraction performances of muscles, the versatility and grace of the movements realized by the complex arrangements of muscles remain largely unmatched. Here, we present a class of pneumatic artificial muscles, named GeometRy-based Actuators that Contract and Elongate (GRACE). The GRACEs consist of a single-material pleated membrane and do not need any strain-limiting elements. They can contract and extend by design, as described by a mathematical model, and can be realized at different dimensional scales and with different materials and mechanical performances, enabling a wide range of lifelike movements. The GRACEs can be fabricated through low-cost additive manufacturing and even built directly within functional devices, such as a pneumatic artificial hand that is fully three-dimensionally printed in one step. This makes the prototyping and fabrication of pneumatic artificial muscle–based devices faster and more straightforward.},

  abstract     = {Internal computational models of physical bodies are fundamental to the ability of robots and animals alike to plan and control their actions. These “self-models” allow robots to consider outcomes of multiple possible future actions without trying them out in physical reality. Recent progress in fully data-driven self-modeling has enabled machines to learn their own forward kinematics directly from task-agnostic interaction data. However, forward kinematic models can only predict limited aspects of the morphology, such as the position of end effectors or velocity of joints and masses. A key challenge is to model the entire morphology and kinematics without prior knowledge of what aspects of the morphology will be relevant to future tasks. Here, we propose that instead of directly modeling forward kinematics, a more useful form of self-modeling is one that could answer space occupancy queries, conditioned on the robot’s state. Such query-driven self-models are continuous in the spatial domain, memory efficient, fully differentiable, and kinematic aware and can be used across a broader range of tasks. In physical experiments, we demonstrate how a visual self-model is accurate to about 1\% of the workspace, enabling the robot to perform various motion planning and control tasks. Visual self-modeling can also allow the robot to detect, localize, and recover from real-world damage, leading to improved machine resiliency.},

  abstract     = {A prerequisite for social coordination is bidirectional communication between teammates, each playing two roles simultaneously: as receptive listeners and expressive speakers. For robots working with humans in complex situations with multiple goals that differ in importance, failure to fulfill the expectation of either role could undermine group performance due to misalignment of values between humans and robots. Specifically, a robot needs to serve as an effective listener to infer human users’ intents from instructions and feedback and as an expressive speaker to explain its decision processes to users. Here, we investigate how to foster effective bidirectional human-robot communications in the context of value alignment—collaborative robots and users form an aligned understanding of the importance of possible task goals. We propose an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) system in which a group of robots predicts users’ values by taking in situ feedback into consideration while communicating their decision processes to users through explanations. To learn from human feedback, our XAI system integrates a cooperative communication model for inferring human values associated with multiple desirable goals. To be interpretable to humans, the system simulates human mental dynamics and predicts optimal explanations using graphical models. We conducted psychological experiments to examine the core components of the proposed computational framework. Our results show that real-time human-robot mutual understanding in complex cooperative tasks is achievable with a learning model based on bidirectional communication. We believe that this interaction framework can shed light on bidirectional value alignment in communicative XAI systems and, more broadly, in future human-machine teaming systems.},

Previously reported robotic sensing technologies have primarily focused on monitoring physical parameters such as pressure and temperature. Integrating chemical sensors for autonomous dry-phase analyte detection on a robotic platform is rather extremely challenging and substantially underdeveloped. Here, we introduce an artificial intelligence–powered multimodal robotic sensing system (M-Bot) with an all-printed mass-producible soft electronic skin–based human-machine interface. A scalable inkjet printing technology with custom-developed nanomaterial inks was used to manufacture flexible physicochemical sensor arrays for electrophysiology recording, tactile perception, and robotic sensing of a wide range of hazardous materials including nitroaromatic explosives, pesticides, nerve agents, and infectious pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2. The M-Bot decodes the surface electromyography signals collected from the human body through machine learning algorithms for remote robotic control and can perform in situ threat compound detection in extreme or contaminated environments with user-interactive tactile and threat alarm feedback. The printed electronic skin–based robotic sensing technology can be further generalized and applied to other remote sensing platforms. Such diversity was validated on an intelligent multimodal robotic boat platform that can efficiently track the source of trace amounts of hazardous compounds through autonomous and intelligent decision-making algorithms. This fully printed human-machine interactive multimodal sensing technology could play a crucial role in designing future intelligent robotic systems and can be easily reconfigured toward numerous practical wearable and robotic applications.},

Social robots would benefit from whole-body robotic skin (or tactile sensors) resembling human skin in realizing a safe, intuitive, and contact-rich human-robot interaction. However, existing soft tactile sensors show several drawbacks (complex structure, poor scalability, and fragility), which limit their application in whole-body robotic skin. Here, we introduce biomimetic robotic skin based on hydrogel-elastomer hybrids and tomographic imaging. The developed skin consists of a tough hydrogel and a silicone elastomer forming a skin-inspired multilayer structure, achieving sufficient softness and resilience for protection. The sensor structure can also be easily repaired with adhesives even after severe damage (incision). For multimodal tactile sensation, electrodes and microphones are deployed in the sensor structure to measure local resistance changes and vibration due to touch. The ionic hydrogel layer is deformed owing to an external force, and the resulting local conductivity changes are measured via electrodes. The microphones also detect the vibration generated from touch to determine the location and type of dynamic tactile stimuli. The measurement data are then converted into multimodal tactile information through tomographic imaging and deep neural networks. We further implement a sensorized cosmetic prosthesis, demonstrating that our design could be used to implement deformable or complex-shaped robotic skin.},

This is challenging for conventional computing hardware. Parallel processor arrays (PPAs) are a new class of vision sensor devices that exploit advances in semiconductor technology, embedding a processor within each pixel of the image sensor array. Sensed pixel data are processed on the focal plane, and only a small amount of relevant information is transmitted out of the vision sensor. This tight integration of sensing, processing, and memory within a massively parallel computing architecture leads to an interesting trade-off between high performance, low latency, low power, low cost, and versatility in a machine vision system. Here, we review the history of image sensing and processing hardware from the perspective of in-pixel computing and outline the key features of a state-of-the-art smart camera system based on a PPA device, through the description of the SCAMP-5 system. We describe several robotic applications for agile ground and aerial vehicles, demonstrating PPA sensing functionalities including high-speed odometry, target tracking, obstacle detection, and avoidance.

This efficient somatosensation far outperforms the touch-sensing capability of most of the state-of-the-art robots today and suggests the need for neural-like hardware for electronic skin (e-skin). This could be attained through either innovative schemes for developing distributed electronics or repurposing the neuromorphic circuits developed for other sensory modalities such as vision and audio. This Review highlights the hardware implementations of various computational building blocks for e-skin and the ways they can be integrated to potentially realize human skin–like or peripheral nervous system–like functionalities. The neural-like sensing and data processing are discussed along with various algorithms and hardware architectures.

The advantage of insect intelligence stems from its resource efficiency (or parsimony) especially in terms of power and mass. First, we discuss the main aspects of insect intelligence underlying this parsimony: embodiment, sensory-motor coordination, and swarming. Then, we take stock of where insect-inspired AI stands as an alternative to other approaches to important robotic tasks such as navigation and identify open challenges on the road to its more widespread adoption. Last, we reflect on the types of processors that are suitable for implementing insect-inspired AI, from more traditional ones such as microcontrollers and field-programmable gate arrays to unconventional neuromorphic processors.

  abstract     = {Recent advances in artificial intelligence have enhanced the abilities of mobile robots in dealing with complex and dynamic scenarios. However, to enable computationally intensive algorithms to be executed locally in multitask robots with low latency and high efficiency, innovations in computing hardware are required. Here, we report TianjicX, a neuromorphic computing hardware that can support true concurrent execution of multiple cross-computing-paradigm neural network (NN) models with various coordination manners for robotics. With spatiotemporal elasticity, TianjicX can support adaptive allocation of computing resources and scheduling of execution time for each task. Key to this approach is a high-level model, “Rivulet, ” which bridges the gap between robotic-level requirements and hardware implementations. It abstracts the execution of NN tasks through distribution of static data and streaming of dynamic data to form the basic activity context, adopts time and space slices to achieve elastic resource allocation for each activity, and performs configurable hybrid synchronous-asynchronous grouping. Thereby, Rivulet is capable of supporting independent and interactive execution. Building on Rivulet with hardware design for realizing spatiotemporal elasticity, a 28-nanometer TianjicX neuromorphic chip with event-driven, high parallelism, low latency, and low power was developed. Using a single TianjicX chip and a specially developed compiler stack, we built a multi-intelligent-tasking mobile robot, Tianjicat, to perform a cat-and-mouse game. Multiple tasks, including sound recognition and tracking, object recognition, obstacle avoidance, and decision-making, can be concurrently executed. Compared with NVIDIA Jetson TX2, latency is substantially reduced by 79.09 times, and dynamic power is reduced by 50.66\%.},

Currently, soft sensors are capable of detecting some haptic stimuli, but whole-body multimodal perception at scales similar to a human adult (surface area ~17, 000 square centimeters) is still a challenge in artificially intelligent agents due to the lack of encoding. This encoding is needed to reduce the wiring required to send the vast amount of information transmitted to the processor. We created a robotic flesh that could be further developed for use in these agents. This engineered flesh is an optical, elastomeric matrix “innervated” with stretchable lightguides that encodes haptic stimuli into light: temperature into wavelength due to thermochromic dyes and forces into intensity due to mechanical deformation. By exploiting the optical properties of the constitutive materials and using machine learning, we infer spatiotemporal, haptic information from light that is read by an image sensor. We demonstrate the capabilities of our system in various assemblies to estimate temperature, contact location, normal and shear force, gestures, and damage from temporal snapshots of light coming from the entire haptic sensor with errors &lt;5\%.},

The limited classes of structures and materials that can be used in such robots, however, create challenges in achieving desired performance parameters and modes of operation. Here, we introduce approaches in manufacturing and actuation that address these constraints to enable untethered, terrestrial robots with complex, three-dimensional (3D) geometries and heterogeneous material construction. The manufacturing procedure exploits controlled mechanical buckling to create 3D multimaterial structures in layouts that range from arrays of filaments and origami constructs to biomimetic configurations and others. A balance of forces associated with a one-way shape memory alloy and the elastic resilience of an encapsulating shell provides the basis for reversible deformations of these structures. Modes of locomotion and manipulation span from bending, twisting, and expansion upon global heating to linear/curvilinear crawling, walking, turning, and jumping upon laser-induced local thermal actuation. Photonic structures such as retroreflectors and colorimetric sensing materials support simple forms of wireless monitoring and localization. These collective advances in materials, manufacturing, actuation, and sensing add to a growing body of capabilities in this emerging field of technology.},

  abstract     = {In complex systems like aircraft engines and oil refinery machines, pipeline inspection is an essential task for ensuring safety. Here, we proposed a type of smart material–driven pipeline inspection robot (weight, 2.2 grams; length, 47 millimeters; diameter, &lt;10 millimeters) that could fit into pipes with sub-centimeter diameters and different curvatures. We adopted high–power density, long-life dielectric elastomer actuators as artificial muscles and smart composite microstructure–based, high-efficiency anchoring units as transmissions. Fast assembling of components using magnets with an adjustable number of units was used to fit varying pipeline geometries. We analyzed the dynamic characteristics of the robots by considering soft material’s unique properties like viscoelasticity and dynamic vibrations and tuned the activation voltage’s frequency and phase accordingly. Powered by tethered cables from outside the pipe, our peristaltic pipeline robot achieved rapid motions horizontally and vertically (horizontal: 1.19 body lengths per second, vertical: 1.08 body lengths per second) in a subcentimeter-sized pipe (diameter, 9.8 millimeters). Besides, it was capable of moving in pipes with varying geometries (diameter-changing pipe, L-shaped pipe, S-shaped pipe, or spiral-shaped pipe), filled media (air or oil), and materials (glass, metal, or carbon fiber). To demonstrate its capability for pipeline inspection, we installed a miniature camera on its front and controlled the robot manually from outside. The robot successfully finished an inspection task at different speeds.},

  abstract     = {Many real-world applications for robots—such as long-term aerial and underwater observation, cross-medium operations, and marine life surveys—require robots with the ability to move between the air-water boundary. Here, we describe an aerial-aquatic hitchhiking robot that is self-contained for flying, swimming, and attaching to surfaces in both air and water and that can seamlessly move between the two. We describe this robot’s redundant, hydrostatically enhanced hitchhiking device, inspired by the morphology of a remora ( Echeneis naucrates ) disc, which works in both air and water. As with the biological remora disc, this device has separate lamellar compartments for redundant sealing, which enables the robot to achieve adhesion and hitchhike with only partial disc attachment. The self-contained, rotor-based aerial-aquatic robot, which has passively morphing propellers that unfold in the air and fold underwater, can cross the air-water boundary in 0.35 second. The robot can perform rapid attachment and detachment on challenging surfaces both in air and under water, including curved, rough, incomplete, and biofouling surfaces, and achieve long-duration adhesion with minimal oscillation. We also show that the robot can attach to and hitchhike on moving surfaces. In field tests, we show that the robot can record video in both media and move objects across the air/water boundary in a mountain stream and the ocean. We envision that this study can pave the way for future robots with autonomous biological detection, monitoring, and tracking capabilities in a wide variety of aerial-aquatic environments.},

  abstract     = {Executing safe and precise flight maneuvers in dynamic high-speed winds is important for the ongoing commoditization of uninhabited aerial vehicles (UAVs). However, because the relationship between various wind conditions and its effect on aircraft maneuverability is not well understood, it is challenging to design effective robot controllers using traditional control design methods. We present Neural-Fly, a learning-based approach that allows rapid online adaptation by incorporating pretrained representations through deep learning. Neural-Fly builds on two key observations that aerodynamics in different wind conditions share a common representation and that the wind-specific part lies in a low-dimensional space. To that end, Neural-Fly uses a proposed learning algorithm, domain adversarially invariant meta-learning (DAIML), to learn the shared representation, only using 12 minutes of flight data. With the learned representation as a basis, Neural-Fly then uses a composite adaptation law to update a set of linear coefficients for mixing the basis elements. When evaluated under challenging wind conditions generated with the Caltech Real Weather Wind Tunnel, with wind speeds up to 43.6 kilometers/hour (12.1 meters/second), Neural-Fly achieves precise flight control with substantially smaller tracking error than stateof-the-art nonlinear and adaptive controllers. In addition to strong empirical performance, the exponential stability of Neural-Fly results in robustness guarantees. Last, our control design extrapolates to unseen wind conditions, is shown to be effective for outdoor flights with only onboard sensors, and can transfer across drones with minimal performance degradation.},

The Robot Operating System (ROS) was an integral part of the last chapter, demonstrably expediting robotics research with freely available components and a modular framework. However, ROS 1 was not designed with many necessary production-grade features and algorithms. ROS 2 and its related projects have been redesigned from the ground up to meet the challenges set forth by modern robotic systems in new and exploratory domains at all scales.

  abstract     = {Aerial robots are widely deployed, but highly cluttered environments such as dense forests remain inaccessible to drones and even more so to swarms of drones. In these scenarios, previously unknown surroundings and narrow corridors combined with requirements of swarm coordination can create challenges. To enable swarm navigation in the wild, we develop miniature but fully autonomous drones with a trajectory planner that can function in a timely and accurate manner based on limited information from onboard sensors. The planning problem satisfies various task requirements including flight efficiency, obstacle avoidance, and inter-robot collision avoidance, dynamical feasibility, swarm coordination, and so on, thus realizing an extensible planner. Furthermore, the proposed planner deforms trajectory shapes and adjusts time allocation synchronously based on spatial-temporal joint optimization. A high-quality trajectory thus can be obtained after exhaustively exploiting the solution space within only a few milliseconds, even in the most constrained environment. The planner is finally integrated into the developed palm-sized swarm platform with onboard perception, localization, and control. Benchmark comparisons validate the superior performance of the planner in trajectory quality and computing time. Various real-world field experiments demonstrate the extensibility of our system. Our approach evolves aerial robotics in three aspects: capability of cluttered environment navigation, extensibility to diverse task requirements, and coordination as a swarm without external facilities.},

  abstract     = {Among small rotorcraft, the use of multiple compact rotors in a mechanically simple design leads to impressive agility and maneuverability but inevitably results in high energetic demand and acutely restricted endurance. Small spinning propellers used in these vehicles contrast with large lifting surfaces of winged seeds, which spontaneously gyrate into stable autorotation upon falling. The pronounced aerodynamic surfaces and delayed stalls are believed key to efficient unpowered flight. Here, the bioinspired principles are adopted to notably reduce the power consumption of small aerial vehicles by means of a samara-inspired robot. We report a dual-wing 35.1-gram aircraft capable of hovering flight via powered gyration. Equipped with two rotors, the underactuated robot with oversized revolving wings, designed to leverage unsteady aerodynamics, was optimized for boosted flight efficiency. Through the analysis of flight dynamics and stability, the vehicle was designed for passive attitude stability, eliminating the need for fast feedback to stay upright. To this end, the drone demonstrates flight with a twofold decrease in power consumption when compared with benchmark multirotor robots. Exhibiting the power loading of 8.0 grams per watt, the vehicle recorded a flight time of 14.9 minutes and up to 24.5 minutes when equipped with a larger battery. Taking advantage of the fast revolving motion to overcome the severe underactuation, we also realized position-controlled flight and illustrated examples of mapping and surveillance applications with a 21.5-gram payload.},

DNA nanotechnology enables exploration of bottom-up fabrication and has previously been used to design self-assembling components capable of linear and rotary motion. In this work, we combine three independently controllable DNA origami linear actuators to create a nanoscale robotic printer. The two-axis positioning mechanism comprises a moveable gantry, running on parallel rails, threading a mobile sleeve. We show that the device is capable of reversibly positioning a write head over a canvas through the addition of signaling oligonucleotides. We demonstrate “write” functionality by using the head to catalyze a local DNA strand–exchange reaction, selectively modifying pixels on a canvas. This work demonstrates the power of DNA nanotechnology for creating nanoscale robotic components and could find application in surface manufacturing, biophysical studies, and templated chemistry.},

  abstract     = {Assistive robots have the potential to support people with disabilities in a variety of activities of daily living, such as dressing. People who have completely lost their upper limb movement functionality may benefit from robot-assisted dressing, which involves complex deformable garment manipulation. Here, we report a dressing pipeline intended for these people and experimentally validate it on a medical training manikin. The pipeline is composed of the robot grasping a hospital gown hung on a rail, fully unfolding the gown, navigating around a bed, and lifting up the user’s arms in sequence to finally dress the user. To automate this pipeline, we address two fundamental challenges: first, learning manipulation policies to bring the garment from an uncertain state into a configuration that facilitates robust dressing; second, transferring the deformable object manipulation policies learned in simulation to real world to leverage cost-effective data generation. We tackle the first challenge by proposing an active pre-grasp manipulation approach that learns to isolate the garment grasping area before grasping. The approach combines prehensile and nonprehensile actions and thus alleviates grasping-only behavioral uncertainties. For the second challenge, we bridge the sim-to-real gap of deformable object policy transfer by approximating the simulator to real-world garment physics. A contrastive neural network is introduced to compare pairs of real and simulated garment observations, measure their physical similarity, and account for simulator parameters inaccuracies. The proposed method enables a dual-arm robot to put back-opening hospital gowns onto a medical manikin with a success rate of more than 90\%.},

Cooperation increases the robustness and flexibility of the working groups and permits sharing of the workload among individuals. However, the utilization of this strategy in artificial systems at the molecular level, which could enable substantial advances in microrobotics and nanotechnology, remains highly challenging. Here, we demonstrate molecular transportation through the cooperative action of a large number of artificial molecular machines, photoresponsive DNA-conjugated microtubules driven by kinesin motor proteins. Mechanical communication via conjugated photoresponsive DNA enables these microtubules to organize into groups upon photoirradiation. The groups of transporters load and transport cargo, and cargo unloading is achieved by dissociating the groups into single microtubules. The group formation permits the loading and transport of cargoes with larger sizes and in larger numbers over long distances compared with single transporters. We also demonstrate that cargo can be collected at user-determined locations defined by ultraviolet light exposure. This work demonstrates cooperative task performance by molecular machines, which will help to construct molecular robots with advanced functionalities in the future.},

  abstract     = {Current space exploration roadmaps envision exploring the surface geology of celestial bodies with robots for both scientific research and in situ resource utilization. In such unstructured, poorly lit, complex, and remote environments, automation is not always possible, and some tasks, such as geological sampling, require direct teleoperation aided by force-feedback (FF). The operator would be on an orbiting spacecraft, and poor bandwidth, high latency, and packet loss from orbit to ground mean that safe, stable, and transparent interaction is a substantial technical challenge. For this scenario, a control method was developed that ensures stability at high delay without reduction in speed or loss of positioning accuracy. At the same time, a new level of safety is achieved not only through FF itself but also through an intrinsic property of the approach preventing hard impacts. On the basis of this method, a tele-exploration scenario was simulated in the Analog-1 experiment with an astronaut on the International Space Station (ISS) using a 6–degree-of-freedom (DoF) FF capable haptic input device to control a mobile robot with manipulator on Earth to collect rock samples. The 6-DoF FF telemanipulation from space was performed at a round-trip communication delay constantly between 770 and 850 milliseconds and an average packet loss of 1.27\%. This experiment showcases the feasibility of a complete space exploration scenario via haptic telemanipulation under spaceflight conditions. The results underline the benefits of this control method for safe and accurate interactions and of haptic feedback in general.},

  abstract     = {Advances in robotic technology have been adopted in various subspecialties of both open and minimally invasive surgery, offering benefits such as enhanced surgical precision and accuracy with reduced fatigue of the surgeon. Despite the advantages, robotic applications to endovascular neurosurgery have remained largely unexplored because of technical challenges such as the miniaturization of robotic devices that can reach the complex and tortuous vasculature of the brain. Although some commercial systems enable robotic manipulation of conventional guidewires for coronary and peripheral vascular interventions, they remain unsuited for neurovascular applications because of the considerably smaller and more tortuous anatomy of cerebral arteries. Here, we present a teleoperated robotic neurointerventional platform based on magnetic manipulation. Our system consists of a magnetically controlled guidewire, a robot arm with an actuating magnet to steer the guidewire, a set of motorized linear drives to advance or retract the guidewire and a microcatheter, and a remote-control console to operate the system under real-time fluoroscopy. We demonstrate our system’s capability to navigate narrow and winding pathways both in vitro with realistic neurovascular phantoms representing the human anatomy and in vivo in the porcine brachial artery with accentuated tortuosity for preclinical evaluation. We further demonstrate telerobotically assisted therapeutic procedures including coil embolization and clot retrieval thrombectomy for treating cerebral aneurysms and ischemic stroke, respectively. Our system could enable safer and quicker access to hard-to-reach lesions while minimizing the radiation exposure to physicians and open the possibility of remote procedural services to address challenges in current stroke systems of care.},

Economists and technology experts are debating at what rate, and to what extent, technology could be used to replace humans in occupations, and what actions could mitigate the unemployment that would result. To this end, it is important to predict which jobs could be automated in the future and what workers could do to move to occupations at lower risk of automation. Here, we calculate the automation risk of almost 1000 existing occupations by quantitatively assessing to what extent robotics and AI abilities can replace human abilities required for those jobs. Furthermore, we introduce a method to find, for any occupation, alternatives that maximize the reduction in automation risk while minimizing the retraining effort. We apply the method to the U.S. workforce composition and show that it could substantially reduce the workers’ automation risk, while the associated retraining effort would be moderate. Governments could use the proposed method to evaluate the unemployment risk of their populations and to adjust educational policies. Robotics companies could use it as a tool to better understand market needs, and members of the public could use it to identify the easiest route to reposition themselves on the job market.},

  abstract     = {Robots need robust models to effectively perform tasks that humans do on a daily basis. These models often require substantial developmental costs to maintain because they need to be adjusted and adapted over time. Deep reinforcement learning is a powerful approach for acquiring complex real-world models because there is no need for a human to design the model manually. Furthermore, a robot can establish new motions and optimal trajectories that may not have been considered by a human. However, the cost of learning is an issue because it requires a huge amount of trial and error in the real world. Here, we report a method for realizing complicated tasks in the real world with low design and teaching costs based on the principle of prediction error minimization. We devised a module integration method by introducing a mechanism that switches modules based on the prediction error of multiple modules. The robot generates appropriate motions according to the door’s position, color, and pattern with a low teaching cost. We also show that by calculating the prediction error of each module in real time, it is possible to execute a sequence of tasks (opening door outward and passing through) by linking multiple modules and responding to sudden changes in the situation and operating procedures. The experimental results show that the method is effective at enabling a robot to operate autonomously in the real world in response to changes in the environment.},

  abstract     = {User preference is a promising objective for the control of robotic exoskeletons because it may capture the multifactorial nature of exoskeleton use. However, to use it, we must first understand its characteristics in the context of exoskeleton control. Here, we systematically measured the control preferences of individuals wearing bilateral ankle exoskeletons during walking. We investigated users’ repeatability identifying their preferences and how preference changes with walking speed, device exposure, and between individuals with different technical backgrounds. Twelve naive and 12 knowledgeable nondisabled participants identified their preferred assistance in repeated trials by simultaneously self-tuning the magnitude and timing of peak torque. They were blinded to the control parameters and relied solely on their perception of the assistance to guide their tuning. We found that participants’ preferences ranged from 7.9 to 19.4 newton-meters and 54.1 to 59.2 percent of the gait cycle. Across trials, participants repeatably identified their preferences with a mean standard deviation of 1.7 newton-meters and 1.5 percent of the gait cycle. Within a trial, participants converged on their preference in 105 seconds. As the experiment progressed, naive users preferred higher torque magnitude. At faster walking speeds, these individuals were more precise at identifying the magnitude of their preferred assistance. Knowledgeable users preferred higher torque than naive users. These results highlight that although preference is a dynamic quantity, individuals can reliably identify their preferences. This work motivates strategies for the control of lower limb exoskeletons in which individuals customize assistance according to their unique preferences and provides meaningful insight into how users interact with exoskeletons.},

  abstract     = {The metabolic rate of walking can be reduced by applying a constant forward force at the center of mass. It has been shown that the metabolically optimal constant force magnitude minimizes propulsion ground reaction force at the expense of increased braking. This led to the hypothesis that selectively assisting propulsion could lead to greater benefits. We used a robotic waist tether to evaluate the effects of forward forces with different timings and magnitudes. Here, we show that it is possible to reduce the metabolic rate of healthy participants by 48\% with a greater efficiency ratio of metabolic cost reduction per unit of net aiding work compared with other assistive robots. This result was obtained using a sinusoidal force profile with peak timing during the middle of the double support. The same timing could also reduce the metabolic rate in patients with peripheral artery disease. A model explains that the optimal force profile accelerates the center of mass into the inverted pendulum movement during single support. Contrary to the hypothesis, the optimal force timing did not entirely coincide with propulsion. Within the field of wearable robotics, there is a trend to use devices to mimic biological torque or force profiles. Such bioinspired actuation can have relevant benefits; however, our results demonstrate that this is not necessarily optimal for reducing metabolic rate.},

  abstract     = {Designers of legged robots are challenged with creating mechanisms that allow energy-efficient locomotion with robust and minimalistic control. Sources of high energy costs in legged robots include the rapid loading and high forces required to support the robot’s mass during stance and the rapid cycling of the leg’s state between stance and swing phases. Here, we demonstrate an avian-inspired robot leg design, BirdBot, that challenges the reliance on rapid feedback control for joint coordination and replaces active control with intrinsic, mechanical coupling, reminiscent of a self-engaging and disengaging clutch. A spring tendon network rapidly switches the leg’s slack segments into a loadable state at touchdown, distributes load among joints, enables rapid disengagement at toe-off through elastically stored energy, and coordinates swing leg flexion. A bistable joint mediates the spring tendon network’s disengagement at the end of stance, powered by stance phase leg angle progression. We show reduced knee-flexing torque to a 10th of what is required for a nonclutching, parallel-elastic leg design with the same kinematics, whereas spring-based compliance extends the leg in stance phase. These mechanisms enable bipedal locomotion with four robot actuators under feedforward control, with high energy efficiency. The robot offers a physical model demonstration of an avian-inspired, multiarticular elastic coupling mechanism that can achieve self-stable, robust, and economic legged locomotion with simple control and no sensory feedback. The proposed design is scalable, allowing the design of large legged robots. BirdBot demonstrates a mechanism for self-engaging and disengaging parallel elastic legs that are contact-triggered by the foot’s own lever-arm action.},

  abstract     = {Tactile feedback is essential to make robots more agile and effective in unstructured environments. However, high-resolution tactile skins are not widely available; this is due to the large size of robust sensing units and because many units typically lead to fragility in wiring and to high costs. One route toward high-resolution and robust tactile skins involves the embedding of a few sensor units (taxels) into a flexible surface material and the use of signal processing to achieve sensing with superresolution accuracy. Here, we propose a theory for geometric superresolution to guide the development of tactile sensors of this kind and link it to machine learning techniques for signal processing. This theory is based on sensor isolines and allows us to compute the possible force sensitivity and accuracy in contact position and force magnitude as a spatial quantity before building a sensor. We evaluate the influence of different factors, such as elastic properties of the material, structure design, and transduction methods, using finite element simulations and by implementing real sensors. We empirically determine sensor isolines and validate the theory in two custom-built sensors with 1D and 2D measurement surfaces that use barometric units. Using machine learning methods to infer contact information, our sensors obtain an average superresolution factor of over 100 and 1200, respectively. Our theory can guide future tactile sensor designs and inform various design choices.},

Here, inspired by the functional effectiveness of the selected spikes, we propose an artificial dynamic sensory system based on position-encoded spike spectrum. We use a mixed ion-electron conductor to generate a potential spike signal. We design artificial receptors that have different ion relaxation times (τ); thus, a sequence of the spikes from the receptors creates a spike spectrum, providing the spatial information (position and motion trace) and the temporal information (speed and dynamic contact area). The artificial receptors can be incorporated by as much as 132/square centimeters by using only two global signal addressing lines for sensor operation. Structural simplicity of the device opens the possibility of scalable fabrication with dense receptor integration. With computational decoding of the position-encoded spike spectrum, the artificial sensory system can recognize complicated dynamic motions in real time. The high-resolution spatiotemporal tactile perception in the ionic artificial sensory system enables the real-time dynamic robotic manipulation.},

Touch sensations during relative lateral motion between a skin-screen interface are largely dictated by interfacial friction, so controlling interfacial friction has the potential for realistic mimicry of surface texture, shape, and material composition. In this work, we show a large modulation of finger friction by locally changing surface temperature. Experiments showed that finger friction can be increased by ~50\% with a surface temperature increase from 23° to 42°C, which was attributed to the temperature dependence of the viscoelasticity and the moisture level of human skin. Rendering virtual features, including zoning and bump(s), without thermal perception was further demonstrated with surface temperature modulation. This method of modulating finger friction has potential applications in gaming, virtual and augmented reality, and touchscreen human-machine interaction.},

In contrast, the materials involved are often nonbiodegradable or stem from nonrenewable resources, contributing to an ever-growing environmental footprint. Furthermore, conventional manufacturing methods, such as mold casting, are not suitable for replicating or imitating the complexity of nature’s creations. Consequently, the inclusion of sustainability concepts alongside the development of new fabrication procedures is required. We report a customized 3D-printing process based on fused deposition modeling, printing a fully biodegradable gelatin-based hydrogel (biogel) ink into dimensionally stable, complex objects. This process enables fast and cost-effective prototyping of resilient, soft robotic applications from gels that stretch to six times their original length, as well as an accessible recycling procedure with zero waste. We present printed pneumatic actuators performing omnidirectional movement at fast response times (less than a second), featuring integrated 3D-printed stretchable waveguides, capable of both proprio- and exteroception. These soft devices are endowed with dynamic real-time control capable of automated search-and-wipe routines to detect and remove obstacles. They can be reprinted several times or disposed of hazard-free at the end of their lifetime, potentially unlocking a sustainable future for soft robotics.},

  abstract     = {Flapping micro-air vehicles (MAVs) can access a wide range of locations, including confined spaces such as the inside of industrial plants and collapsed buildings, and offer high maneuverability and tolerance to disturbances. However, current flapping MAVs require transmission systems between their actuators and wings, which introduce energetic losses and additional mass, hindering performance. Here, we introduce a high-performance electrostatic flapping actuation system, the liquid-amplified zipping actuator (LAZA), which induces wing movement by direct application of liquid-amplified electrostatic forces at the wing root, eliminating the requirement of any transmission system and their associated downsides. The LAZA allows for accurate control of flapping frequency and amplitude, exhibits no variation in performance over more than 1 million actuation cycles, and delivers peak and average specific powers of 200 and 124 watts per kilogram, respectively, exceeding mammalian and insect flight muscle and on par with modern flapping MAV actuation systems. The inclusion of 50-millimeter-long passively pitching wings in a dragonfly-sized LAZA flapping system allowed the rectification of net directional thrust up to 5.73 millinewtons. This thrust was achieved while consuming only 243 milliwatts of electrical power, implying a thrust-to-power ratio of 23.6 newtons per kilowatt, similar to state-of-the-art flapping MAVs, helicopter rotors, and commercial drone motors. Last, a horizontally moving LAZA flapping system supported by a taut nylon wire was able to accelerate from at-rest and travel at speeds up to 0.71 meters per second. The LAZA enables lightweight, high-performance transmission-free flapping MAVs for long-term remote exploration and search-and-rescue missions.},

Soft pneumatic oscillators can reduce the demand on controllers by generating complex movements required for locomotion from a single, constant input pressure, but either have been constrained to low rates of flow of air or have required complex fabrication processes. Here, we describe a pneumatic oscillator fabricated from flexible, but inextensible, sheets that provides high rates of airflow for practical locomotion by combining three instabilities: out-of-plane buckling of the sheets, kinking of tubing attached to the sheets, and a system-level instability resulting from connection of an odd number of pneumatic inverters made from these sheets in a loop. This device, which we call a “buckling-sheet ring oscillator” (BRO), directly generates movement from its own interaction with its surroundings and consists only of readily available materials assembled in a simple process—specifically, stacking acetate sheets, nylon film, and double-sided tape, and attaching an elastomeric tube. A device incorporating a BRO is capable of both translational and rotational motion over varied terrain (even without a tether) and can climb upward against gravity and downward against the buoyant force encountered under water.},

Their high-speed (15 to 23 micrometer per second; 9.5 ± 5.4 body lengths per second) swimming in multicomponent ionic solutions with concentrations up to 5 M and without dedicated fuels is demonstrated, overcoming one of the bottlenecks of previous light-driven microswimmers. Such high ion tolerance is attributed to a favorable interplay between the particle’s textural and structural nanoporosity and optoionic properties, facilitating ionic interactions in solutions with high salinity. Biocompatibility of these microswimmers is validated by cell viability tests with three different cell lines and primary cells. The nanopores of the swimmers are loaded with a model cancer drug, doxorubicin (DOX), resulting in a high (185\%) loading efficiency without passive release. Controlled drug release is reported under different pH conditions and can be triggered on-demand by illumination. Light-triggered, boosted release of DOX and its active degradation products are demonstrated under oxygen-poor conditions using the intrinsic, environmentally sensitive and light-induced charge storage properties of PHI, which could enable future theranostic applications in oxygen-deprived tumor regions. These organic PHI microswimmers simultaneously address the current light-driven microswimmer challenges of high ion tolerance, fuel-free high-speed propulsion in biological media, biocompatibility, and controlled on-demand cargo release toward their biomedical, environmental, and other potential applications.},

  abstract     = {Legged robots that can operate autonomously in remote and hazardous environments will greatly increase opportunities for exploration into underexplored areas. Exteroceptive perception is crucial for fast and energy-efficient locomotion: Perceiving the terrain before making contact with it enables planning and adaptation of the gait ahead of time to maintain speed and stability. However, using exteroceptive perception robustly for locomotion has remained a grand challenge in robotics. Snow, vegetation, and water visually appear as obstacles on which the robot cannot step or are missing altogether due to high reflectance. In addition, depth perception can degrade due to difficult lighting, dust, fog, reflective or transparent surfaces, sensor occlusion, and more. For this reason, the most robust and general solutions to legged locomotion to date rely solely on proprioception. This severely limits locomotion speed because the robot has to physically feel out the terrain before adapting its gait accordingly. Here, we present a robust and general solution to integrating exteroceptive and proprioceptive perception for legged locomotion. We leverage an attention-based recurrent encoder that integrates proprioceptive and exteroceptive input. The encoder is trained end to end and learns to seamlessly combine the different perception modalities without resorting to heuristics. The result is a legged locomotion controller with high robustness and speed. The controller was tested in a variety of challenging natural and urban environments over multiple seasons and completed an hour-long hike in the Alps in the time recommended for human hikers.},

  abstract     = {The lunar nearside has been investigated by many uncrewed and crewed missions, but the farside of the Moon remains poorly known. Lunar farside exploration is challenging because maneuvering rovers with efficient locomotion in harsh extraterrestrial environment is necessary to explore geological characteristics of scientific interest. Chang’E-4 mission successfully targeted the Moon’s farside and deployed a teleoperated rover (Yutu-2) to explore inside the Von Kármán crater, conveying rich information regarding regolith, craters, and rocks. Here, we report mobile exploration on the lunar farside with Yutu-2 over the initial 2 years. During its journey, Yutu-2 has experienced varying degrees of mild slip and skid, indicating that the terrain is relatively flat at large scales but scattered with local gentle slopes. Cloddy soil sticking on its wheels implies a greater cohesion of the lunar soil than encountered at other lunar landing sites. Further identification results indicate that the regolith resembles dry sand and sandy loam on Earth in bearing properties, demonstrating greater bearing strength than that identified during the Apollo missions. In sharp contrast to the sparsity of rocks along the traverse route, small fresh craters with unilateral moldable ejecta are abundant, and some of them contain high-reflectance materials at the bottom, suggestive of secondary impact events. These findings hint at notable differences in the surface geology between the lunar farside and nearside. Experience gained with Yutu-2 improves the understanding of the farside of the Moon, which, in return, may lead to locomotion with improved efficiency and larger range.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous robotic surgery has the potential to provide efficacy, safety, and consistency independent of individual surgeon’s skill and experience. Autonomous anastomosis is a challenging soft-tissue surgery task because it requires intricate imaging, tissue tracking, and surgical planning techniques, as well as a precise execution via highly adaptable control strategies often in unstructured and deformable environments. In the laparoscopic setting, such surgeries are even more challenging because of the need for high maneuverability and repeatability under motion and vision constraints. Here we describe an enhanced autonomous strategy for laparoscopic soft tissue surgery and demonstrate robotic laparoscopic small bowel anastomosis in phantom and in vivo intestinal tissues. This enhanced autonomous strategy allows the operator to select among autonomously generated surgical plans and the robot executes a wide range of tasks independently. We then use our enhanced autonomous strategy to perform in vivo autonomous robotic laparoscopic surgery for intestinal anastomosis on porcine models over a 1-week survival period. We compared the anastomosis quality criteria—including needle placement corrections, suture spacing, suture bite size, completion time, lumen patency, and leak pressure—of the developed autonomous system, manual laparoscopic surgery, and robot-assisted surgery (RAS). Data from a phantom model indicate that our system outperforms expert surgeons’ manual technique and RAS technique in terms of consistency and accuracy. This was also replicated in the in vivo model. These results demonstrate that surgical robots exhibiting high levels of autonomy have the potential to improve consistency, patient outcomes, and access to a standard surgical technique.},
