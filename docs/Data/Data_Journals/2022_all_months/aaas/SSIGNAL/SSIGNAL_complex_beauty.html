  abstract     = {Histone deacetylases (HDACs) play important roles in immunity and inflammation. Through functional screening, we identified HDAC10 as an inhibitor of the type I interferon (IFN) response mediated by interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3). HDAC10 abundance was decreased in mouse macrophages in response to innate immune stimuli and was reduced in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) compared with that in PBMCs from healthy donors. Deficiency in HDAC10 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and in mice promoted the expression of genes encoding type I IFNs and of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), leading to enhanced antiviral responses in vitro and in vivo. HDAC10 bound in a deacetylase-independent manner to IRF3 in uninfected cells to inhibit the phosphorylation of IRF3 at Ser 396 by TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1). Upon viral infection, HDAC10 was targeted for autophagy-mediated degradation through its interaction with LC3-II. Consequently, IRF3 phosphorylation was increased, which resulted in enhanced type I IFN production and antiviral responses. Our findings identify a potential target for improving host defense responses against pathogen infection and for treating autoimmune disease.},

  abstract     = {Pyroptosis is a mechanism of programmed, necrotic cell death mediated by gasdermins, a family of pore-forming proteins. Caspase-1 activates gasdermin D (GSDMD) under inflammatory conditions, whereas caspase-3 activates GSDME under apoptotic conditions, such as those induced by chemotherapy. These pathways are thought to be separate. However, we found that they are part of an integrated network of gatekeepers that enables pyroptotic cell death. We observed that GSDMD was the primary pyroptotic mediator in cultured blood cells in response to doxorubicin and etoposide, two common chemotherapies for hematopoietic malignancies. Upon treatment, the channel protein pannexin-1 (PANX1), which is stimulated by the initiation of apoptosis, increased membrane permeability to induce K + efflux-driven activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and GSDMD. However, either PANX1 or GSDME could also be the primary mediator of chemotherapy-induced pyroptosis when present at higher amounts. The most abundant pore-forming protein in acute myeloid leukemias from patients predicted the cell death pathway in response to chemotherapy. This interconnected network, a multistep switch that converts apoptosis to pyroptosis, could be clinically titratated to modulate cell death with regard to antitumor immunity or tumor lysis syndrome in patients.},

One such set of genes is stimulated by interferon (IFN) signaling, and the expression of these genes [IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs)] can be further modulated by cell stress–induced pathways. Here, we investigated the global effect of stress-induced p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling on the response of macrophages to IFN. In response to cell stress that coincided with IFN exposure, the p38 MAPK-activated transcription factors CREB and c-Jun, in addition to the IFN-activated STAT family of transcription factors, bound to ISGs. In addition, p38 MAPK signaling induced activating histone modifications at the loci of ISGs and stimulated nuclear translocation of the CREB coactivator CRTC3. These actions synergistically enhanced ISG expression. Disrupting this synergy with p38 MAPK inhibitors improved the viability of macrophages infected with Listeria monocytogenes . Our findings uncover a mechanism of transcriptional synergism and highlight the biological consequences of coincident stress-induced p38 MAPK and IFN-stimulated signal transduction.},

  abstract     = {Dynamic protein S-palmitoylation is critical for neuronal function, development, and synaptic plasticity. Synaptic activity–dependent changes in palmitoylation have been reported for a small number of proteins. Here, we characterized the palmitoylome in the hippocampi of male mice before and after context-dependent fear conditioning. Of the 121 differentially palmitoylated proteins identified, just over half were synaptic proteins, whereas others were associated with metabolic functions, cytoskeletal organization, and signal transduction. The synapse-associated proteins generally exhibited increased palmitoylation after fear conditioning. In contrast, most of the proteins that exhibited decreased palmitoylation were associated with metabolic processes. Similar results were seen in cultured rat hippocampal neurons in response to chemically induced long-term potentiation. Furthermore, we found that the palmitoylation of one of the synaptic proteins, plasticity-related gene-1 (PRG-1), also known as lipid phosphate phosphatase-related protein type 4 (LPPR4), was important for synaptic activity–induced insertion of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs) into the postsynaptic membrane. The findings identify proteins whose dynamic palmitoylation may regulate their role in synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory.},

  abstract     = {Increased proliferation and survival of cells in small pulmonary arteries (PAs) drive pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Because cell growth mediated by the mTOR-containing mTORC1 complex is inhibited by tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2), we investigated the role of this GTPase-activating protein in PAH pathology. TSC2 abundance was decreased in remodeled small PAs and PA vascular smooth muscle cells (PAVSMCs) from patients with PAH or from rodent pulmonary hypertension (PH) models, as well as PAVSMCs maintained on substrates that reproduced pathology-induced stiffness. Accordingly, mice with smooth muscle–specific reduction in TSC2 developed PH. At the molecular level, decreased TSC2 abundance led to stiffness-induced PAVSMC proliferation, increased abundance of the mechanosensitive transcriptional coactivators YAP/TAZ, and enhanced mTOR kinase activity. Moreover, extracellular matrix (ECM) produced by TSC2-deficient PAVSMCs stimulated the proliferation of nondiseased PA adventitial fibroblasts and PAVSMCs through fibronectin and its receptor, the α 5 β 1 integrin. Reconstituting TSC2 in PAVSMCs from patients with PAH through overexpression or treatment with the SIRT1 activator SRT2104 decreased YAP/TAZ abundance, mTOR activity, and ECM production, as well as inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis. In two rodent models of PH, SRT2104 treatment restored TSC2 abundance, attenuated pulmonary vascular remodeling, and ameliorated PH. Thus, TSC2 in PAVSMCs integrates ECM composition and stiffness with pro-proliferative and survival signaling, and restoring TSC2 abundance could be an attractive therapeutic option to treat PH.},

The proximal tubule in the kidney is a key metabolic organ that controls reabsorption of nutrients such as fatty acids, amino acids, sugars, and proteins. Here, by combining metabolomics, proteomics, and phosphoproteomics analyses with functional and superresolution imaging assays of mice with an inducible deficiency in proximal tubular cells, we revealed that VPS34 controlled the metabolome of the proximal tubule. In addition to inhibiting pinocytosis and autophagy, VPS34 depletion induced membrane exocytosis and reduced the abundance of the retromer complex necessary for proper membrane recycling and lipid retention, leading to a loss of fuel and biomass. Integration of omics data into a kidney cell metabolomic model demonstrated that VPS34 deficiency increased β-oxidation, reduced gluconeogenesis, and enhanced the use of glutamine for energy consumption. Furthermore, the omics datasets revealed that VPS34 depletion triggered an antiviral response that included a decrease in the abundance of apically localized virus receptors such as ACE2. VPS34 inhibition abrogated SARS-CoV-2 infection in human kidney organoids and cultured proximal tubule cells in a glutamine-dependent manner. Thus, our results demonstrate that VPS34 adjusts endocytosis, nutrient transport, autophagy, and antiviral responses in proximal tubule cells in the kidney.},

We combined genetic engineering of a human organotypic three-dimensional (3D) skin model with global quantitative proteomics and phosphoproteomics to dissect the importance of essential components of the TGF-β signaling pathway, including the ligands TGF-β1, TGF-β2, and TGF-β3, the receptor TGF-βRII, and the intracellular effector SMAD4. Consistent with the antiproliferative effects of TGF-β signaling, the loss of TGF-β1 or SMAD4 promoted cell cycling and delayed epidermal differentiation. The loss of TGF-βRII, which abrogates both SMAD4-dependent and SMAD4-independent downstream signaling, more strongly affected cell proliferation and differentiation than did loss of SMAD4, and it induced invasive growth. TGF-βRII knockout reduced cell-matrix interactions, and the production of matrix proteins increased the production of cancer-associated cell-cell adhesion proteins and proinflammatory mediators and increased mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling. Inhibiting the activation of the ERK and p38 MAPK pathways blocked the development of the invasive phenotype upon the loss of TGF-βRII. This study provides a framework for exploring TGF-β signaling pathways in human epithelial tissue homeostasis and transformation using genetic engineering, 3D tissue models, and high-throughput quantitative proteomics and phosphoproteomics.},

  abstract     = {To reach inflamed tissues from the circulation, neutrophils must overcome physical constraints imposed by the tissue architecture, such as the endothelial barrier or the three-dimensional (3D) interstitial space. In these microenvironments, neutrophils are forced to migrate through spaces smaller than their own diameter. One of the main challenges for cell passage through narrow gaps is the deformation of the nucleus, the largest and stiffest organelle in cells. Here, we showed that chemokines, the extracellular signals that guide cell migration in vivo, modulated nuclear plasticity to support neutrophil migration in restricted microenvironments. Exploiting microfabricated devices, we found that the CXC chemokine CXCL12 enhanced the nuclear pliability of mouse bone marrow–derived neutrophils to sustain their migration in 3D landscapes. This previously uncharacterized function of CXCL12 was mediated by the atypical chemokine receptor ACKR3 (also known as CXCR7), required protein kinase A (PKA) activity, and induced chromatin compaction, which resulted in enhanced cell migration in 3D. Thus, we propose that chemical cues regulate the nuclear plasticity of migrating leukocytes to optimize their motility in restricted microenvironments.},

  abstract     = {Transforming growth factor–β (TGF-β) signaling has important roles during embryonic development and in tissue homeostasis. TGF-β ligands exert cellular effects by binding to type I (TβRI) and type II (TβRII) receptors and inducing both SMAD-dependent and SMAD-independent intracellular signaling pathways, the latter of which includes the activation of the tyrosine kinase Src. We investigated the mechanism by which TGF-β stimulation activates Src in human and mouse cells. Before TGF-β stimulation, inactive Src was complexed with TβRII. Upon TGF-β1 stimulation, TβRII associated with and phosphorylated TβRI at Tyr 182 . Binding of Src to TβRI involved the interaction of the Src SH2 domain with phosphorylated Tyr 182 and the interaction of the Src SH3 domain with a proline-rich region in TβRI and led to the activation of Src kinase activity and Src autophosphorylation. TGF-β1–induced Src activation required the kinase activities of TβRII and Src but not that of TβRI. Activated Src also phosphorylated TβRI on several tyrosine residues, which may stabilize the binding of Src to the receptor. Src activation was required for the ability of TGF-β to induce fibronectin production and migration in human breast carcinoma cells and to induce α–smooth muscle actin and actin reorganization in mouse fibroblasts. Thus, TGF-β induces Src activation by stimulating a direct interaction with TβRI that depends on tyrosine phosphorylation of TβRI by TβRII.},

  abstract     = {Many dementias are propagated through the spread of “prion-like” misfolded proteins. This includes prion diseases themselves (such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD), for which no treatments are available to slow or stop progression. The M 1 acetylcholine muscarinic receptor (M 1 receptor) is abundant in the brain, and its activity promotes cognitive function in preclinical models and in patients with AD. Here, we investigated whether activation of the M 1 receptor might slow the progression of neurodegeneration associated with prion-like misfolded protein in a mouse model of prion disease. Proteomic and transcriptomic analysis of the hippocampus revealed that this model had a molecular profile that was similar to that of human neurodegenerative diseases, including AD. Chronic enhancement of the activity of the M 1 receptor with the positive allosteric modulator (PAM) VU0486846 reduced the abundance of prion-induced molecular markers of neuroinflammation and mitochondrial dysregulation in the hippocampus and normalized the abundance of those associated with neurotransmission, including synaptic and postsynaptic signaling components. PAM treatment of prion-infected mice prolonged survival and maintained cognitive function. Thus, allosteric activation of M 1 receptors may reduce the severity of neurodegenerative diseases caused by the prion-like propagation of misfolded protein.},

  abstract     = {Maintenance of cell population size is fundamental to the proper functioning of multicellular organisms. Here, we describe a cell-intrinsic cell density–sensing pathway that enabled T cells to reach and maintain an appropriate population size. This pathway operated “kin-to-kin” or between identical or similar T cell populations occupying a niche within a tissue or organ, such as the lymph nodes, spleen, and blood. We showed that this pathway depended on the cell density–dependent abundance of the evolutionarily conserved protein coronin 1, which coordinated prosurvival signaling with the inhibition of cell death until the cell population reached threshold densities. At or above threshold densities, coronin 1 expression peaked and remained stable, thereby resulting in the initiation of apoptosis through kin-to-kin intercellular signaling to return the cell population to the appropriate cell density. This cell population size-controlling pathway was conserved from amoeba to humans, thus providing evidence for the existence of a coronin-regulated, evolutionarily conserved mechanism by which cells are informed of and coordinate their relative population size.},

Combined with our growing understanding of the essential role of stromal cells, this shift has led to increased interest in how the collective and interconnected metabolome of the tumor microenvironment can drive malignant transformation, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, drug resistance, immune evasion, and metastasis. In this review, we discuss how metabolite exchange between tumors and various cell types in the tumor microenvironment—such as fibroblasts, adipocytes, and immune cells—can activate signaling pathways that drive cancer progression.},

However, unlike the approved biologics currently used to treat this and other conditions, commercially available small-molecule inhibitors of TNF trimerization are cytotoxic or exhibit low potency. Here, we report a TNF-inhibitory molecule (TIM) that reduced TNF signaling in vitro and was an effective treatment in a mouse model of RA. The initial lead compound, TIM1, attenuated TNF-induced apoptosis of human and mouse cells by delaying the induction of proinflammatory NF-κB and MAPK signaling and caspase 3– and caspase 8–dependent apoptosis. TIM1 inhibited the secretion of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8 by disrupting TNF homotrimerization, thereby preventing its association with the TNF receptor. In a mouse model of collagen-induced polyarthritis, the more potent TIM1 analog TIM1c was orally bioavailable and reduced paw swelling, histological indicators of knee joint pathology, inflammatory infiltration of the joint, and the overall arthritis index. Orally delivered TIM1c showed immunological effects similar to those elicited by intraperitoneal injection of the FDA-approved TNF receptor decoy etanercept. Thus, TIM1c is a promising lead compound for the development of small-molecule therapies for the treatment of RA and other TNF-dependent systemic inflammation disorders.},

Mitochondria-dependent ferroptosis, which is triggered by iron overload and excessive lipid peroxidation, plays a pivotal role in the progression of DIC. Here, we showed that DOX accumulated in mitochondria by intercalating into mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), inducing ferroptosis in an mtDNA content-dependent manner. In addition, DOX disrupted heme synthesis by decreasing the abundance of 5&#39;-aminolevulinate synthase 1 (Alas1), the rate-limiting enzyme in this process, thereby impairing iron utilization, resulting in iron overload and ferroptosis in mitochondria in cultured cardiomyocytes. Alas1 overexpression prevented this outcome. Administration of 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA), the product of Alas1, to cultured cardiomyocytes and mice suppressed iron overload and lipid peroxidation, thereby preventing DOX-induced ferroptosis and DIC. Our findings reveal that the accumulation of DOX and iron in mitochondria cooperatively induces ferroptosis in cardiomyocytes and suggest that 5-ALA can be used as a potential therapeutic agent for DIC.},

Using a mass spectrometry–based cloning approach, we identified Semaphorin 4D (Sema4D) as an inflammatory cytokine that directly promoted cartilage destruction. Sema4d -deficient mice showed less cartilage destruction than wild-type mice in a model of rheumatoid arthritis. Sema4D induced a proinflammatory response in mouse articular chondrocytes characterized by the induction of proteolytic enzymes that degrade cartilage, such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and aggrecanases. The activation of Mmp13 and Mmp3 expression in articular chondrocytes by Sema4D did not depend on RhoA, a GTPase that mediates Sema4D-induced cytoskeletal rearrangements. Instead, it required NF-κB signaling and Ras-MEK-Erk1/2 signaling downstream of the receptors Plexin-B2 and c-Met and depended on the transcription factors IκBζ and C/EBPδ. Genetic and pharmacological blockade of these Sema4D signaling pathways inhibited MMP induction in chondrocytes and cartilage destruction in femoral head organ culture. Our results reveal a mechanism by which Sema4D signaling promotes cartilage destruction.},

Here, we show through in vitro and in vivo studies that the transcriptional regulators Yap and Taz have redundant functions as key determinants of the specification and differentiation of NCCs into osteoblasts or chondrocytes. Primary and cultured NCCs deficient in Yap and Taz switched from osteogenesis to chondrogenesis, and NCC-specific deficiency for Yap and Taz resulted in bone loss and ectopic cartilage in mice. Yap bound to the regulatory elements of key genes that govern osteogenesis and chondrogenesis in NCCs and directly regulated the expression of these genes, some of which also contained binding sites for the TCF/LEF transcription factors that interact with the Wnt effector β-catenin. During differentiation of NCCs in vitro and NCC-derived osteogenesis in vivo, Yap and Taz promoted the expression of osteogenic genes such as Runx2 and Sp7 but repressed the expression of chondrogenic genes such as Sox9 and Col2a1 . Furthermore, Yap and Taz interacted with β-catenin in NCCs to coordinately promote osteoblast differentiation and repress chondrogenesis. Together, our data indicate that Yap and Taz promote osteogenesis in NCCs and prevent chondrogenesis, partly through interactions with the Wnt–β-catenin pathway.},

Although vaccine development targeting these viruses has been accelerated substantially, there remain patients requiring treatment who cannot be vaccinated or who experience breakthrough infections. Understanding the common host factors necessary for the life cycles of coronaviruses may reveal conserved therapeutic targets. Here, we used the known substrate specificities of mammalian protein kinases to deconvolute the sequence of phosphorylation events mediated by three host protein kinase families (SRPK, GSK-3, and CK1) that coordinately phosphorylate a cluster of serine and threonine residues in the viral N protein, which is required for viral replication. We also showed that loss or inhibition of SRPK1/2, which we propose initiates the N protein phosphorylation cascade, compromised the viral replication cycle.

  abstract     = {The tumor microbiome is increasingly implicated in cancer progression and resistance to chemotherapy. In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), high intratumoral loads of Fusobacterium nucleatum correlate with shorter survival in patients. Here, we investigated the potential mechanisms underlying this association. We found that F. nucleatum infection induced both normal pancreatic epithelial cells and PDAC cells to secrete increased amounts of the cytokines GM-CSF, CXCL1, IL-8, and MIP-3α. These cytokines increased proliferation, migration, and invasive cell motility in both infected and noninfected PDAC cells but not in noncancerous pancreatic epithelial cells, suggesting autocrine and paracrine signaling to PDAC cells. This phenomenon occurred in response to Fusobacterium infection regardless of the strain and in the absence of immune and other stromal cells. Blocking GM-CSF signaling markedly limited proliferative gains after infection. Thus, F. nucleatum infection in the pancreas elicits cytokine secretion from both normal and cancerous cells that promotes phenotypes in PDAC cells associated with tumor progression. The findings support the importance of exploring host-microbe interactions in pancreatic cancer to guide future therapeutic interventions.},

  abstract     = {The canonical members of the Jagged/Serrate and Delta families of transmembrane ligands have an extracellular, amino-terminal C2 domain that binds to phospholipids and is required for optimal activation of the Notch receptor. Somatic mutations that cause amino substitutions in the C2 domain in human JAGGED1 (JAG1) have been identified in tumors. We found in reporter cell assays that mutations affecting an N-glycosylation site reduced the ligand’s ability to activate Notch. This N-glycosylation site located in the C2 domain is conserved in the Jagged/Serrate family but is lacking in the Delta family. Site-specific glycan analysis of the JAG1 amino terminus demonstrated that occupancy of this site by either a complex-type or high-mannose N-glycan was required for full Notch activation in reporter cell assays. Similarly to JAG1 variants with defects in Notch binding, N-glycan removal, either by mutagenesis of the glycosylation site or by endoglycosidase treatment, reduced receptor activation. The N-glycan variants also reduced receptor activation in a Notch signaling–dependent vascular smooth muscle cell differentiation assay. Loss of the C2 N-glycan reduced JAG1 binding to liposomes to a similar extent as the loss of the entire C2 domain. Molecular dynamics simulations suggested that the presence of the N-glycan limits the orientation of JAG1 relative to the membrane, thus facilitating Notch binding. These data are consistent with a critical role for the N-glycan in promoting a lipid-binding conformation that is required to orient Jagged at the cell membrane for full Notch activation.},

  abstract     = {Drosophila phototransduction is a model for signaling cascades that culminate in the activation of transient receptor potential (TRP) cation channels. TRP and TRPL are the canonical TRP (TRPC) channels that are regulated by light stimulation of rhodopsin and engagement of Gα q and phospholipase Cβ (PLC). Lipid metabolite(s) generated downstream of PLC are essential for the activation of the TRPC channels in photoreceptor cells. We sought to identify the key lipids produced subsequent to PLC stimulation that contribute to channel activation. Here, using genetics, lipid analysis, and Ca 2+ imaging, we found that light increased the amount of an abundant endocannabinoid, 2-linoleoyl glycerol (2-LG), in vivo. The increase in 2-LG amounts depended on the PLC and diacylglycerol lipase encoded by norpA and inaE , respectively. This endocannabinoid facilitated TRPC-dependent Ca 2+ influx in a heterologous expression system and in dissociated ommatidia from compound eyes. Moreover, 2-LG and mechanical stimulation cooperatively activated TRPC channels in ommatidia. We propose that 2-LG is a physiologically relevant endocannabinoid that activates TRPC channels in photoreceptor cells.},

  abstract     = {Increased abundance of polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) is observed in various tumor types, particularly in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Here, we found that PLK1 accelerated the progression of LUAD through a mechanism that was independent of its role in mediating mitotic cell division. Analysis of human tumor databases revealed that increased PLK1 abundance in LUAD correlated with mutations in KRAS and p53, with tumor stage, and with reduced survival in patients. In a mouse model of KRAS G12D -driven, p53-deficient LUAD, PLK1 overexpression increased tumor burden, decreased tumor cell differentiation, and reduced animal survival. PLK1 overexpression in cultured cells and mice indirectly increased the expression of the gene encoding the receptor tyrosine kinase RET by phosphorylating the transcription factor TTF-1. Signaling by RET and mutant KRAS in these tumors converged to activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Pharmacological inhibition of the MAPK pathway kinase MEK combined with inhibition of either RET or PLK1 markedly suppressed tumor growth. Our findings show that PLK1 can amplify MAPK signaling and reveal a potential target for stemming progression in lung cancers with high PLK1 abundance.},

Here, we demonstrated that Viperin was increased in abundance in patients with lymphatic and pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). Viperin-deficient mice had decreased Mtb bacterial loads and enhanced macrophage responses compared with their wild-type counterparts. Viperin suppressed the formation of a complex containing interleukin-1 receptor–associated kinase 1, TNF receptor–associated factor 6, and transforming growth factor β–activated kinase 1 (TAK1) and inhibited the TAK1-dependent activation of IκB kinase α/β, thereby impairing the production of nitric oxide and proinflammatory cytokines.

Their effectiveness is due both to the rapid, directly antiviral effects of IFN-stimulated gene products and to the effects of type I IFN on responding immune cells. Type I IFN signaling through its receptor, IFNAR, is tightly regulated at multiple steps in the signaling cascade, including at the level of IFNAR downstream effectors, which include the kinase JAK1 and the transcriptional regulator STAT1. Here, we found that tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)–associated factor 3 (TRAF3) enhanced the activation of JAK1 and STAT1 specifically in CD4 + T cells by preventing recruitment of the negative regulatory phosphatase PTPN22 to the IFNAR complex. The balance between signals through IFNAR and other cytokine receptors influences CD4 + T cell differentiation and function during infections.

  abstract     = {Spinocerebellar ataxia type 14 (SCA14) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by germline variants in the diacylglycerol (DAG)/Ca 2+ -regulated protein kinase Cγ (PKCγ), leading to Purkinje cell degeneration and progressive cerebellar dysfunction. Most of the identified mutations cluster in the DAG-sensing C1 domains. Here, we found with a FRET-based activity reporter that SCA14-associated PKCγ mutations, including a previously undescribed variant, D115Y, enhanced the basal activity of the kinase by compromising its autoinhibition. Unlike other mutations in PKC that impair its autoinhibition but lead to its degradation, the C1 domain mutations protected PKCγ from such down-regulation. This enhanced basal signaling rewired the brain phosphoproteome, as revealed by phosphoproteomic analysis of cerebella from mice expressing a human SCA14-associated H101Y mutant PKCγ transgene. Mutations that induced a high basal activity in vitro were associated with earlier average age of onset in patients. Furthermore, the extent of disrupted autoinhibition, but not agonist-stimulated activity, correlated with disease severity. Molecular modeling indicated that almost all SCA14 variants not within the C1 domain were located at interfaces with the C1B domain, suggesting that mutations in and proximal to the C1B domain are a susceptibility for SCA14 because they uniquely enhance PKCγ basal activity while protecting the enzyme from down-regulation. These results provide insight into how PKCγ activation is modulated and how deregulation of the cerebellar phosphoproteome by SCA14-associated mutations affects disease progression.},

In addition, the structural and functional abnormalities of the tumor vasculature foster the development of an aggressive tumor microenvironment and impair the efficacy of existing cancer therapies. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as major players of tumor progression, and a growing body of evidence has demonstrated that EVs derived from cancer cells trigger multiple responses in endothelial cells that alter blood vessel function in tumors. EV-mediated signaling in endothelial cells can occur through the transfer of functional cargos such as miRNAs, lncRNAs, cirRNAs, and proteins. Moreover, membrane-bound proteins in EVs can elicit receptor-mediated signaling in endothelial cells. Together, these mechanisms reprogram endothelial cells and contribute to the sustained exacerbated angiogenic signaling typical of tumors, which, in turn, influences cancer progression. Targeting these angiogenesis-promoting EV-dependent mechanisms may offer additional strategies to normalize tumor vasculature. Here, we discuss the current knowledge pertaining to the contribution of cancer cell–derived EVs in mechanisms regulating blood vessel functions in tumors. Moreover, we discuss the translational opportunities in targeting the dysfunctional tumor vasculature using EVs and highlight the open questions in the field of EV biology that can be addressed using mass spectrometry–based proteomics analysis.},

  abstract     = {The Nef protein produced by the viruses HIV-1 and SIV drives efficient viral replication partially by inducing constitutive activation of host cell tyrosine kinases, including members of the Src and Tec families. Here, we uncovered the mechanism by which both HIV-1 and SIV Nef enhanced the activity of the Tec family kinase Btk in vitro and in cells. A Nef mutant that could not bind to the SH3 domain of Src family kinases activated Btk to the same extent as did wild-type Nef, demonstrating that Nef activated Src and Tec family kinases by distinct mechanisms. The Btk SH3-SH2 region formed a homodimer requiring the CD loop in the SH2 domain, which was stabilized by the binding of Nef homodimers. Alanine substitution of Pro 327 in the CD loop of the Btk SH2 domain destabilized SH3-SH2 dimers, abolished the interaction with Nef, and prevented activation by Nef in vitro. In cells, Nef stabilized and activated wild-type but not P327A Btk homodimers at the plasma membrane. These data reveal that the interaction with Nef stabilizes Btk dimers through the SH3-SH2 interface to promote kinase activity and show that the HIV-1 Nef protein evolved distinct mechanisms to activate Src and Tec family tyrosine kinases to enhance viral replication.},

  abstract     = {Goblet cells in the small intestinal crypts contain large numbers of mucin granules that are rapidly discharged to clean bacteria from the crypt. Because acetylcholine released by neuronal and nonneuronal cells controls many aspects of intestinal epithelial function, we used tissue explants and organoids to investigate the response of the small intestinal crypt to cholinergic stimulation. The activation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors initiated a coordinated and rapid emptying of crypt goblet cells that flushed the crypt contents into the intestinal lumen. Cholinergic stimulation induced an expansion of the granule contents followed by intracellular rupture of the mucin granules. The mucus expanded intracellularly before the rupture of the goblet cell apical membrane and continued to expand after its release into the crypt lumen. The goblet cells recovered from membrane rupture and replenished their stores of mucin granules. Mucus secretion from the goblet cells depended on Ca 2+ signaling and the expansion of the mucus in the crypt depended on gap junctions and on ion and water transport by enterocytes adjacent to the goblet cells. This distinctive mode of mucus secretion, which we refer to as “expanding secretion, ” efficiently cleans the small intestine crypt through coordinated mucus, ion, and fluid secretion by goblet cells and enterocytes.},

A protocadherin-based intermicrovillar adhesion complex localized at microvilli tips mediates microvilli packing and organization. Here, we identified a second adhesion complex localized at the proximal base region of microvilli. This complex contained the immunoglobulin superfamily member TMIGD1, which directly interacted with the microvillar scaffolding proteins EBP50 and E3KARP. Complex formation with EBP50 required the activation of EBP50 by the actin-binding protein ezrin and was enhanced by the dephosphorylation of Ser 162 in the PDZ2 domain of EBP50 by the phosphatase PP1α. Binding of the EBP50-ezrin complex to TMIGD1 enhanced the dynamic turnover of EBP50 at microvilli. Enterocyte-specific inactivation of Tmigd1 in mice resulted in microvillar blebbing, loss of intermicrovillar adhesion, and perturbed brush border formation. Thus, we identified a second adhesion complex in microvilli and propose a mechanism that promotes microvillar formation and dynamics.},

In some cases, these ruptured membranes heal spontaneously. Here, we investigated repair mechanisms of the amnion, a layer of epithelial cells in the amniotic sac closest to the embryo. Macrophages migrated to and resided at rupture sites in both human and mouse amnion. A process called epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), in which epithelial cells acquire a mesenchymal phenotype and which is implicated in tissue repair, was observed at rupture sites. In dams bearing macrophage-depleted fetuses, the repair of amnion ruptures was compromised, and EMT was rarely detected at rupture sites. The migration of cultured amnion epithelial cells in wound healing assays was mediated by EMT through transforming growth factor–β (TGF-β)–Smad signaling. These findings suggest that fetal macrophages are crucial in amnion repair because of their ability to induce EMT in amnion epithelial cells.},

  abstract     = {To colonize the host and cause disease, the human enteropathogen Clostridioides difficile must sense, respond, and adapt to the harsh environment of the gastrointestinal tract. We showed that the production and degradation of cyclic diadenosine monophosphate (c-di-AMP) were necessary during different phases of C. difficile growth, environmental adaptation, and infection. The production of this nucleotide second messenger was essential for growth because it controlled the uptake of potassium and also contributed to biofilm formation and cell wall homeostasis, whereas its degradation was required for osmotolerance and resistance to detergents and bile salts. The c-di-AMP binding transcription factor BusR repressed the expression of genes encoding the compatible solute transporter BusAA-AB. Compared with the parental strain, a mutant lacking BusR was more resistant to hyperosmotic and bile salt stresses, whereas a mutant lacking BusAA was more susceptible. A short exposure of C. difficile cells to bile salts decreased intracellular c-di-AMP concentrations, suggesting that changes in membrane properties induce alterations in the intracellular c-di-AMP concentration. A C. difficile strain that could not degrade c-di-AMP failed to persist in a mouse gut colonization model as long as the wild-type strain did. Thus, the production and degradation of c-di-AMP in C. difficile have pleiotropic effects, including the control of osmolyte uptake to confer osmotolerance and bile salt resistance, and its degradation is important for host colonization.},

PROTACs that target oncogene products are avidly being explored for cancer therapies, and several are currently in clinical trials. Drug resistance is a substantial challenge in clinical oncology, and resistance to PROTACs has been reported in several cancer cell models. Here, using proteomic analysis, we found intrinsic and acquired resistance mechanisms to PROTACs in cancer cell lines mediated by greater abundance or production of the drug efflux pump MDR1. PROTAC-resistant cells were resensitized to PROTACs by genetic ablation of ABCB1 (which encodes MDR1) or by coadministration of MDR1 inhibitors. In MDR1-overexpressing colorectal cancer cells, degraders targeting either the kinases MEK1/2 or the oncogenic mutant GTPase KRAS G12C synergized with the dual epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR/ErbB)/MDR1 inhibitor lapatinib. Moreover, compared with single-agent therapies, combining MEK1/2 degraders with lapatinib improved growth inhibition of MDR1-overexpressing KRAS-mutant colorectal cancer xenografts in mice. Together, our findings suggest that concurrent blockade of MDR1 will likely be required with PROTACs to achieve durable protein degradation and therapeutic response in cancer.},

Polymerization of Dvl at the plasma membrane recruits the β-catenin destruction complex, enabling the phosphorylation of LRP5/6, a key step in inhibiting β-catenin degradation. Using purified Fzd proteins reconstituted in lipid nanodiscs, we investigated the factors that promote the recruitment of Dvl to the plasma membrane. We found that the affinity of Fzd for Dvl was not affected by Wnt ligands, in contrast to other members of the GPCR superfamily for which the binding of extracellular ligands affects the affinity for downstream transducers. Instead, Fzd-Dvl binding was enhanced by increased concentration of the lipid PI(4, 5)P 2 , which is generated by Dvl-associated lipid kinases in response to Wnt and which is required for LRP5/6 phosphorylation. Moreover, binding to Fzd did not promote Dvl DEP domain dimerization, which has been proposed to be required for signaling downstream of Fzd. Our findings suggest a positive feedback loop in which Wnt-stimulated local PI(4, 5)P 2 production enhances Dvl recruitment and further PI(4, 5)P 2 production to support Dvl polymerization, LRP5/6 phosphorylation, and β-catenin stabilization.},

  abstract     = {Gain-of-function mutations in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 ( LRRK2 ) gene are common in familial forms of Parkinson’s disease (PD), which is characterized by progressive neurodegeneration that impairs motor and cognitive function. We previously demonstrated that LRRK2-mediated phosphorylation of β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) triggers the production and nuclear translocation of the APP intracellular domain (AICD). Here, we connected LRRK2 to AICD in a feed-forward cycle that enhanced LRRK2-mediated neurotoxicity. In cooperation with the transcription factor FOXO3a, AICD promoted LRRK2 expression, thus increasing the abundance of LRRK2 that promotes AICD activation. APP deficiency in LRRK2 G2019S mice suppressed LRRK2 expression, LRRK2-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction, α-synuclein accumulation, and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) loss in the brain, phenotypes associated with toxicity and loss of dopaminergic neurons in PD. Conversely, AICD overexpression increased LRRK2 expression and LRRK2-mediated neurotoxicity in LRRK2 G2019S mice. In LRRK2 G2019S mice or cultured dopaminergic neurons from LRRK2 G2019S patients, treatment with itanapraced reduced LRRK2 expression and was neuroprotective. Itanapraced showed similar effects in a neurotoxin-induced PD mouse model, suggesting that inhibiting the AICD may also have therapeutic benefits in idiopathic PD. Our findings reveal a therapeutically targetable, feed-forward mechanism through which AICD promotes LRRK2-mediated neurotoxicity in PD.},

  abstract     = {The intrinsic fluorescence of samples confounds the use of fluorescence-based sensors. This is of particular concern in high-throughput screening (HTS) applications using large chemical libraries containing intrinsically fluorescent compounds. To overcome this problem, we developed a bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) Ca 2+ sensor, CalfluxCTN. We demonstrated that it reliably reported changes in intracellular Ca 2+ concentrations evoked by an agonist and an antagonist of the human muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M 1 (hM 1 R) even in the presence of the fluorescent compound fluorescein, which interfered with a standard fluorescent HTS sensor (Fluo-8). In an HTS using a chemical library containing fluorescent compounds, CalfluxCTN accurately identified agonists and antagonists that were missed or miscategorized using Fluo-8. Moreover, we showed that a luciferase substrate that becomes activated only when inside cells generated long-lasting BRET signals in HTS, enabling results to be reliably compared among replicate samples for hours. Thus, the use of a self-luminescent sensor instead of a fluorescent sensor could facilitate the complete screening of chemical libraries in a high-throughput context and enable analysis of autofluorescent samples in many different applications.},

  abstract     = {Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in the tumor microenvironment are often linked to drug resistance. Here, we found that coculture with CAFs or culture in CAF-conditioned medium unexpectedly induced drug sensitivity in certain lung cancer cell lines. Gene expression and secretome analyses of CAFs and normal lung–associated fibroblasts (NAFs) revealed differential abundance of insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) and IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs), which promoted or inhibited, respectively, signaling by the receptor IGF1R and the kinase FAK. Similar drug sensitization was seen in gefitinib-resistant, EGFR -mutant PC9GR lung cancer cells treated with recombinant IGFBPs. Conversely, drug sensitivity was decreased by recombinant IGFs or conditioned medium from CAFs in which IGFBP5 or IGFBP6 was silenced. Phosphoproteomics and receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) array analyses indicated that exposure of PC9GR cells to CAF-conditioned medium also inhibited compensatory IGF1R and FAK signaling induced by the EGFR inhibitor osimertinib. Combined small-molecule inhibition of IGF1R and FAK phenocopied the CAF-mediated effects in culture and increased the antitumor effect of osimertinib in mice. Cells that were osimertinib resistant and had MET amplification or showed epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition also displayed residual sensitivity to IGFBPs. Thus, CAFs promote or reduce drug resistance in a context-dependent manner, and deciphering the relationship between the differential content of CAF secretomes and the signaling dependencies of the tumor may reveal effective combination treatment strategies.},

  abstract     = {Missense mutations at the three hotspots in the guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) RAS—Gly 12 , Gly 13 , and Gln 61 (commonly known as G12, G13, and Q61, respectively)—occur differentially among the three RAS isoforms. Q61 mutations in KRAS are infrequent and differ markedly in occurrence. Q61H is the predominant mutant (at 57\%), followed by Q61R/L/K (collectively 40\%), and Q61P and Q61E are the rarest (2 and 1\%, respectively). Probability analysis suggested that mutational susceptibility to different DNA base changes cannot account for this distribution. Therefore, we investigated whether these frequencies might be explained by differences in the biochemical, structural, and biological properties of KRAS Q61 mutants. Expression of KRAS Q61 mutants in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts and RIE-1 epithelial cells caused various alterations in morphology, growth transformation, effector signaling, and metabolism. The relatively rare KRAS Q61E mutant stimulated actin stress fiber formation, a phenotype distinct from that of KRAS Q61H/R/L/P , which disrupted actin cytoskeletal organization. The crystal structure of KRAS Q61E was unexpectedly similar to that of wild-type KRAS, a potential basis for its weak oncogenicity. KRAS Q61H/L/R -mutant pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cell lines exhibited KRAS-dependent growth and, as observed with KRAS G12 -mutant PDAC, were susceptible to concurrent inhibition of ERK-MAPK signaling and of autophagy. Our results uncover phenotypic heterogeneity among KRAS Q61 mutants and support the potential utility of therapeutic strategies that target KRAS Q61 mutant–specific signaling and cellular output.},

Efforts toward OR expression and functional profiling have been met with limited success because of the poor efficiency of their cell surface expression in vitro. Structures protruding from the surface of olfactory sensory neurons called cilia contain all of the components of the olfactory signal transduction machinery and can be placed in an ex vivo plate assay to rapidly measure odor-specific responses. Here, we describe an approach using cilia isolated from the olfactory sensory neurons of mice expressing two human ORs, OR1A1 and OR5AN1, that showed 10- to 100-fold more sensitivity to ligands as compared to previous assays. A single mouse can produce enough olfactory cilia for up to 4000 384-well assay wells, and isolated cilia can be stored frozen and thus preserved. This pipeline offers a sensitive and highly scalable ex vivo odor-screening platform that has the potential to decode human olfaction.},

  abstract     = {In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), signaling from stromal cells is implicated in metastatic progression. Tumor-stroma cross-talk is often mediated through extracellular vesicles (EVs). We previously reported that EVs derived from cancer-associated stromal fibroblasts (CAFs) that are abundant in annexin A6 (ANXA6 + EVs) support tumor cell aggressiveness in PDAC. Here, we found that the cell surface glycoprotein and tetraspanin CD9 is a key component of CAF-derived ANXA6 + EVs for mediating this cross-talk. CD9 was abundant on the surface of ANXA6 + CAFs isolated from patient PDAC samples and from various mouse models of PDAC. CD9 colocalized with CAF markers in the tumor stroma, and CD9 abundance correlated with tumor stage. Blocking CD9 impaired the uptake of ANXA6 + EVs into cultured PDAC cells. Signaling pathway arrays and further analyses revealed that the uptake of CD9 + ANXA6 + EVs induced mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway activity, cell migration, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Blocking either CD9 or p38 MAPK signaling impaired CD9 + ANXA6 + EV–induced cell migration and EMT in PDAC cells. Analysis of bioinformatic datasets indicated that CD9 abundance was an independent marker of poor prognosis in patients with PDAC. Our findings suggest that CD9-mediated stromal cell signaling promotes PDAC progression.},

  abstract     = {Osteoarthritis (OA) and posttraumatic OA (PTOA) are caused by an imbalance in catabolic and anabolic processes in articular cartilage and proinflammatory changes throughout the joint, leading to joint degeneration and pain. We examined whether interleukin-6 (IL-6) signaling contributed to cartilage degradation and pain in PTOA. Genetic ablation of Il6 in male mice decreased PTOA-associated cartilage catabolism, innervation of the knee joint, and nociceptive signaling without improving PTOA-associated subchondral bone sclerosis or chondrocyte apoptosis. These effects were not observed in female Il6 −/− mice. Compared with wild-type mice, the activation of the IL-6 downstream mediators STAT3 and ERK was reduced in the knees and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) of male Il6 −/− mice after knee injury. Janus kinases (JAKs) were critical for STAT and ERK signaling in cartilage catabolism and DRG pain signaling in tissue explants. Whereas STAT3 signaling was important for cartilage catabolism, ERK signaling mediated neurite outgrowth and the activation of nociceptive neurons. These data demonstrate that IL-6 mediates both cartilage degradation and pain associated with PTOA in a sex-specific manner and identify tissue-specific contributions of downstream effectors of IL-6 signaling, which are potential therapeutic targets for disease-modifying OA drugs.},

Consequently, additional parameters are required to dissect the complex spatiotemporal activation of leukocytes during inflammation. Here, we showed that intravital microscopy of myeloid leukocyte Ca 2+ signals with Ca 2+ reporter mouse strains combined with bioinformatic signal analysis provided a tool to assess their activation in vivo. We demonstrated by two-photon microscopy that tissue-resident macrophages reacted to sterile inflammation in the cremaster muscle with Ca 2+ transients in a distinct spatiotemporal pattern. Moreover, through high-resolution, intravital spinning disk confocal microscopy, we identified the intracellular Ca 2+ signaling patterns of neutrophils during the migration cascade in vivo. These patterns were modulated by the Ca 2+ channel Orai1 and Gα i -coupled GPCRs, whose effects were evident through analysis of the range of frequencies of the Ca 2+ signal (frequency spectra), which provided insights into the complex patterns of leukocyte Ca 2+ oscillations. Together, these findings establish Ca 2+ frequency spectra as an additional dimension to assess leukocyte activation and migration during inflammation in vivo.},

  abstract     = {The integrin lymphocyte function–associated antigen 1 (LFA-1) helps to coordinate the migration, adhesion, and activation of T cells through interactions with intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and ICAM-2. LFA-1 is activated during the engagement of chemokine receptors and the T cell receptor (TCR) through inside-out signaling, a process that is partially mediated by phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and its product phosphatidylinositol 3, 4, 5-trisphosphate (PIP 3 ). To evaluate potential roles of PI3K in LFA-1 activation, we designed a library of CRISPR/single guide RNAs targeting known and potential PIP 3 -binding proteins and screened for effects on the ability of primary mouse T cells to bind to ICAM-1. We identified multiple proteins that regulated the binding of LFA-1 to ICAM-1, including the Rap1 and Ras GTPase-activating protein RASA3. We found that RASA3 suppressed LFA-1 activation in T cells, that its expression was rapidly reduced upon T cell activation, and that its activity was inhibited by PI3K. Loss of RASA3 in T cells led to increased Rap1 activation, defective lymph node entry and egress, and impaired responses to T-dependent immunization in mice. Our results reveal a critical role for RASA3 in T cell migration, homeostasis, and function.},

  abstract     = {The E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF12 plays essential roles during development, and the gene encoding it, RLIM , is mutated in the X-linked human developmental disorder Tonne-Kalscheuer syndrome (TOKAS). Substrates of RNF12 include transcriptional regulators such as the pluripotency-associated transcriptional repressor REX1. Using global quantitative proteomics in male mouse embryonic stem cells, we identified the deubiquitylase USP26 as a putative downstream target of RNF12 activity. RNF12 relieved REX1-mediated repression of Usp26 , leading to an increase in USP26 abundance and the formation of RNF12-USP26 complexes. Interaction with USP26 prevented RNF12 autoubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation, thereby establishing a transcriptional feed-forward loop that amplified RNF12-dependent derepression of REX1 targets. We showed that the RNF12-USP26 axis operated specifically in mouse testes and was required for the expression of gametogenesis genes and for germ cell differentiation in vitro. Furthermore, this RNF12-USP26 axis was disrupted by RLIM and USP26 variants found in TOKAS and infertility patients, respectively. This work reveals synergy within the ubiquitylation cycle that controls a key developmental process in gametogenesis and that is disrupted in human genetic disorders.},

  abstract     = {Signals that determine the differentiation of naïve CD4 + T helper (T H ) cells into specific effector cell subsets are primarily stimulated by cytokines, but additional signals are required to adjust the magnitude of T H cell responses and set the balance between effective immunity and immunological tolerance. By inducing the post-thymic deletion of the T cell lineage signaling protein THEMIS, we showed that THEMIS promoted the development of optimal type 1 immune responses to foreign antigens but stimulated signals that favored encephalitogenic responses to self-neuroantigens. THEMIS was required to stimulate the expression of the gene encoding the transcriptional regulator T-BET and the production of the cytokine interferon-γ (IFN-γ), and it enhanced the ability of encephalitogenic CD4 + T cells to migrate into the central nervous system. Consistently, analysis of THEMIS expression in polarized CD4 + T cells showed that THEMIS was selectively increased in abundance in T H 1 cells. The stimulation of predifferentiated effector CD4 + T cells with antigen-presenting cells revealed a stimulatory function for THEMIS on type 1 cytokine responses, similar to those observed ex vivo after immunization. In contrast, THEMIS exerted opposing effects on naïve CD4 + T cells in vitro by inhibiting the T cell receptor (TCR)–mediated signals that lead to T H 1 cell responses. These data suggest that THEMIS exerts TCR-independent functions in effector T cells, which increase the magnitude of normal and pathogenic T H 1 cell–mediated responses.},

The identification of high-affinity ligands for brain PPARα may reveal the mechanisms underlying the synaptic effects of this receptor and facilitate drug development. Here, using an affinity purification–untargeted mass spectrometry (AP-UMS) approach, we identified an endogenous, selective PPARα ligand, 7( S )-hydroxy-docosahexaenoic acid [7( S )-HDHA]. Results from mass spectrometric detection of 7( S )-HDHA in mouse and rat brain tissues, time-resolved FRET analyses, and thermal shift assays collectively revealed that 7( S )-HDHA potently activated PPARα with an affinity greater than that of other ligands identified to date. We also found that 7( S )-HDHA activation of PPARα in cultured mouse cortical neurons stimulated neuronal growth and arborization, as well as the expression of genes associated with synaptic plasticity. The findings suggest that this DHA derivative supports and enhances neuronal synaptic capacity in the brain.},

  abstract     = {Ligands of the transforming growth factor–β (TGF-β) superfamily, including TGF-βs, activins, and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), have been implicated in hepatic development, homeostasis, and pathophysiology. We explored the mechanisms by which hepatocytes decode and integrate injury-induced signaling from TGF-βs and activins (TGF-β/Activin) and BMPs. We mapped the spatiotemporal patterns of pathway activation during liver injury induced by acetaminophen (APAP) in dual reporter mice carrying a fluorescent reporter of TGF-β/Activin signaling and a fluorescent reporter of BMP signaling. APAP intoxication induced the expression of both reporters in a zone of cells near areas of tissue damage, which showed an increase in autophagy and demarcated the borders between healthy and injured tissues. Inhibition of TGF-β superfamily signaling by overexpressing the inhibitor Smad7 exacerbated acute liver histopathology but eventually accelerated tissue recovery. Transcriptomic analysis identified autophagy as a process stimulated by TGF-β1 and BMP4 in hepatocytes, with Trp53inp2 , which encodes a rate-limiting factor for autophagy initiation, as the most highly induced autophagy-related gene. Collectively, these findings illustrate the functional interconnectivity of the TGF-β superfamily signaling system, implicate the coordinated activation of TGF-β/Activin and BMP pathways in balancing tissue reparatory and regenerative processes upon APAP-induced hepatotoxicity, and highlight opportunities and potential risks associated with targeting this signaling system for treating hepatic diseases.},

NL2 recruits the postsynaptic scaffold protein gephyrin, which, in turn, stabilizes γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptors (GABA A Rs) in the postsynaptic domain. Thus, the amount of NL2 at the synapse can control synaptic GABA A R concentration to tune inhibitory neurotransmission efficacy. Here, using biochemistry, imaging, single-particle tracking, and electrophysiology, we uncovered a key role for cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) in the synaptic stabilization of NL2. We found that PKA-mediated phosphorylation of NL2 at Ser 714 caused its dispersal from the synapse and reduced NL2 surface amounts, leading to a loss of synaptic GABA A Rs. Conversely, enhancing the stability of NL2 at synapses by abolishing PKA-mediated phosphorylation led to increased inhibitory signaling. Thus, PKA plays a key role in regulating NL2 function and GABA-mediated synaptic inhibition.},

  abstract     = {Resistance to thyroid hormone due to mutations in THRA , which encodes the thyroid hormone receptor α (TRα1), shows variable clinical presentation. Mutations affecting TRβ1 and TRβ2 cause deafness in mice and have been associated with deafness in humans. To test whether TRα1 also affects hearing function, we used mice heterozygous for a frameshift mutation in Thra that is similar to human THRA mutations ( Thra S1/ + mice) and reduces tissue sensitivity to thyroid hormone. Compared to wild-type littermates, Thra S1/+ mice showed moderate high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss as juveniles and increased age-related hearing loss. Ultrastructural examination revealed aberrant orientation of ~20\% of sensory outer hair cells (OHCs), as well as increased numbers of mitochondria with fragmented morphology and autophagic vacuoles in both OHCs and auditory nerve fibers. Molecular dissection of the OHC lateral wall components revealed that the potassium ion channel Kcnq4 was aberrantly targeted to the cytoplasm of mutant OHCs. In addition, mutant cochleae showed increased oxidative stress, autophagy, and mitophagy associated with greater age-related cochlear cell damage, demonstrating that TRα1 is required for proper development of OHCs and for maintenance of OHC function. These findings suggest that patients with THRA mutations may present underdiagnosed, mild hearing loss and may be more susceptible to age-related hearing loss.},

  abstract     = {In cell membranes, G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) interact with cholesterol, which modulates their assembly, stability, and conformation. Previous studies have shown how cholesterol modulates the structural properties of GPCRs at ambient temperature. Here, we characterized the mechanical, kinetic, and energetic properties of the human β 2 -adrenergic receptor (β 2 AR) in the presence and absence of the cholesterol analog cholesteryl hemisuccinate (CHS) at room temperature (25°C), at physiological temperature (37°C), and at high temperature (42°C). We found that CHS stabilized various structural regions of β 2 AR differentially, which changed nonlinearly with temperature. Thereby, the strongest effects were observed for structural regions that are important for receptor signaling. Moreover, at 37°C, but not at 25° or 42°C, CHS caused β 2 AR to increase and stabilize conformational substates to adopt to basal activity. These findings indicate that the nonlinear, temperature-dependent action of CHS in modulating the structural and functional properties of this GPCR is optimized for 37°C.},

The development and function of T cells are controlled through the T cell antigen receptor, which recognizes peptides displayed on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. Here, we review how T cells generate the ability to recognize self-peptide–bound MHC molecules and use signals derived from these interactions to instruct cellular development, activation thresholds, and functional specialization in the steady state and during immune responses. We argue that the basic tenants of T cell development and function follow Weber-Fetcher’s law of just noticeable differences and Wilder’s law of initial value. Together, these laws argue that the ability of a system to respond and the quality of that response are scalable to the basal state of that system. Manifestation of these laws in T cells generates clone-specific activation thresholds that are based on perceivable differences between homeostasis and pathogen encounter (self versus nonself discrimination), as well as poised states for subsequent differentiation into specific effector cell lineages.},

  abstract     = {The Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor ibrutinib irreversibly binds BTK at Cys 481 , inhibiting its kinase activity and thus blocking transduction of B cell receptor (BCR) signaling. Although ibrutinib is durably effective in patients with B cell malignancies, many patients still develop ibrutinib-resistant disease. Resistance can arise because of mutations at the ibrutinib-binding site in BTK. Here, we characterized the mechanism by which two BTK mutations, C481F and C481Y, may lead to ibrutinib resistance. Both mutants lacked detectable kinase activity in in vitro kinase assays. Structural modeling suggested that bulky Phe and Tyr side chains at position 481 sterically hinder access to the ATP-binding pocket in BTK, contributing to loss of kinase activity. Nonetheless, BCR signaling still propagated through BTK C481F and C481Y mutants to downstream effectors, the phospholipase PLCγ2 and the transcription factor NF-κB. This maintenance of BCR signaling was partially achieved through the physical recruitment and kinase-independent activation of hematopoietic cell kinase (HCK). Upon BCR activation, BTK C481F or C481Y was phosphorylated by Src family kinases at Tyr 551 , which then bound to the SH2 domain of HCK. Modeling suggested that this binding disrupted an intramolecular autoinhibitory interaction in HCK. Activated HCK subsequently phosphorylated PLCγ2, which propagated BCR signaling and promoted clonogenic cell proliferation. This kinase-independent mechanism could inform therapeutic approaches to CLL bearing either the C481F or C481Y BTK mutants.},

  abstract     = {Inflammatory cytokine–induced activation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis (OA). We identified PILA as a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) that enhances NF-κB signaling and OA. The abundance of PILA was increased in damaged cartilage from patients with OA and in human articular chondrocytes stimulated with the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Knockdown of PILA inhibited TNF-induced NF-κB signaling, extracellular matrix catabolism, and apoptosis in chondrocytes, whereas ectopic expression of PILA promoted NF-κB signaling and matrix degradation. PILA promoted PRMT1-mediated arginine methylation of DExH-box helicase 9 (DHX9), leading to an increase in the transcription of the gene encoding transforming growth factor β–activated kinase 1 (TAK1), an upstream activator of NF-κB signaling. Furthermore, intra-articular injection of an adenovirus vector encoding PILA triggered spontaneous cartilage loss and exacerbated posttraumatic OA in mice. This study provides insight into the regulation of NF-κB signaling in OA and identifies a potential therapeutic target for this disease.},

We report here that necroptosis is also activated by extracellular osmotic stresses. Unlike the previously identified inducers of necroptosis, osmotic stress stimulated necroptosis through the direct activation of the kinase activity of RIPK3 by an increase in cytosolic pH mediated by the Na + /H + exchanger SLC9A1. Knockout, knockdown, or chemical inhibition of SLC9A1 blocked necroptosis induced by osmotic stresses. Moreover, setting intracellular pH at above-physiological values directly activated RIPK3 and necroptosis. The activation of RIPK3 by osmotic stresses did not require its RHIM domain, the protein-interacting domain required for the activation of RIPK3 when cells respond to other previously identified necroptotic stimuli. These results thus delineate a pathway that activates necroptosis in response to osmotic stresses.},

  abstract     = {The development of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) requires dynamic trans-synaptic coordination orchestrated by secreted factors, including Wnt family morphogens. To investigate how these synaptic cues in NMJ development are transduced, particularly in the regulation of acetylcholine receptor (AChR) accumulation in the postsynaptic membrane, we explored the function of Van Gogh–like protein 2 (Vangl2), a core component of Wnt planar cell polarity signaling. We found that conditional, muscle-specific ablation of Vangl2 in mice reproduced the NMJ differentiation defects seen in mice with global Vangl2 deletion. These alterations persisted into adulthood and led to NMJ disassembly, impaired neurotransmission, and deficits in motor function. Vangl2 and the muscle-specific receptor tyrosine kinase MuSK were functionally associated in Wnt signaling in the muscle. Vangl2 bound to and promoted the signaling activity of MuSK in response to Wnt11. The loss of Vangl2 impaired RhoA activation in cultured mouse myotubes and caused dispersed, rather than clustered, organization of AChRs at the postsynaptic or muscle cell side of NMJs in vivo. Our results identify Vangl2 as a key player of the core complex of molecules shaping neuromuscular synapses and thus shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying NMJ assembly.},

  abstract     = {Variants in the gene encoding ankyrin repeat and SOCS box–containing 4 ( ASB4 ) are linked to human obesity. Here, we characterized the pathways underlying the metabolic functions of ASB4. Hypothalamic Asb4 expression was suppressed by fasting in wild-type mice but not in mice deficient in AgRP , which encodes Agouti-related protein (AgRP), an appetite-stimulating hormone, suggesting that ASB4 is a negative target of AgRP. Many ASB4 neurons in the brain were adjacent to AgRP terminals, and feeding induced by AgRP neuronal activation was disrupted in Asb4 -deficient mice. Acute knockdown of Asb4 in the brain caused marked hyperphagia due to increased meal size, and Asb4 deficiency led to increased meal size and food intake at the onset of refeeding, when very large meals were consumed. Asb4 -deficient mice were resistant to the meal-terminating effects of exogenously administered calcitonin and showed decreased neuronal expression of Calcr , which encodes the calcitonin receptor. Pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons in the arcuate nucleus in mice are involved in glucose homeostasis, and Asb4 deficiency specifically in POMC neurons resulted in glucose intolerance that was independent of obesity. Furthermore, individuals with type 2 diabetes showed reduced ASB4 abundance in the infundibular nuclei, the human equivalent of the arcuate nucleus. Together, our results indicate that ASB4 acts in the brain to improve glucose homeostasis and to induce satiety after substantial meals, particularly those after food deprivation.},

  abstract     = {Synapses connect discrete neurons into vast networks that send, receive, and encode diverse forms of information. Synaptic function and plasticity, the neuronal process of adapting to diverse and variable inputs, depend on the dynamic nature of synaptic molecular components, which is mediated in part by cell adhesion signaling pathways. Here, we found that the enzyme biliverdin reductase (BVR) physically links together key focal adhesion signaling molecules at the synapse. BVR -null ( BVR −/− ) mice exhibited substantial deficits in learning and memory on neurocognitive tests, and hippocampal slices in which BVR was postsynaptically depleted showed deficits in electrophysiological responses to stimuli. RNA sequencing, biochemistry, and pathway analyses suggested that these deficits were mediated through the loss of focal adhesion signaling at both the transcriptional and biochemical level in the hippocampus. Independently of its catalytic function, BVR acted as a bridge between the primary focal adhesion signaling kinases FAK and Pyk2 and the effector kinase Src. Without BVR, FAK and Pyk2 did not bind to and stimulate Src, which then did not phosphorylate the N -methyl- d -aspartate (NMDA) receptor, a critical posttranslational modification for synaptic plasticity. Src itself is a molecular hub on which many signaling pathways converge to stimulate NMDAR-mediated neurotransmission, thus positioning BVR at a prominent intersection of synaptic signaling.},

  abstract     = {Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) binds to microbial and self-DNA in the cytosol and synthesizes cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP), which activates stimulator of interferon genes (STING) and downstream mediators to elicit an innate immune response. Regulation of cGAS activity is essential for immune homeostasis. Here, we identified the E3 ubiquitin ligase MARCH8 (also known as MARCHF8, c-MIR, and RNF178) as a negative regulator of cGAS-mediated signaling. The immune response to double-stranded DNA was attenuated by overexpression of MARCH8 and enhanced by knockdown or knockout of MARCH8. MARCH8 interacted with the enzymatically active core of cGAS through its conserved RING-CH domain and catalyzed the lysine-63 (K63)–linked polyubiquitylation of cGAS at Lys 411 . This polyubiquitylation event inhibited the DNA binding ability of cGAS, impaired cGAMP production, and attenuated the downstream innate immune response. Furthermore, March8 -deficient mice were less susceptible than their wild-type counterparts to herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) infection. Together, our findings reveal a mechanism underlying the functional regulation of cGAS and the fine-tuning of the innate immune response.},

  abstract     = {Chronic pain is a major health issue, and the search for new analgesics has become increasingly important because of the addictive properties and unwanted side effects of opioids. To explore potentially new drug targets, we investigated mutations in the NTRK1 gene found in individuals with congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis (CIPA). NTRK1 encodes tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA), the receptor for nerve growth factor (NGF) and that contributes to nociception. Molecular modeling and biochemical analysis identified mutations that decreased the interaction between TrkA and one of its substrates and signaling effectors, phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ). We developed a cell-permeable phosphopeptide derived from TrkA (TAT-pQYP) that bound the Src homology domain 2 (SH2) of PLCγ. In HEK-293T cells, TAT-pQYP inhibited the binding of heterologously expressed TrkA to PLCγ and decreased NGF-induced, TrkA-mediated PLCγ activation and signaling. In mice, intraplantar administration of TAT-pQYP decreased mechanical sensitivity in an inflammatory pain model, suggesting that targeting this interaction may be analgesic. The findings demonstrate a strategy to identify new targets for pain relief by analyzing the signaling pathways that are perturbed in CIPA.},

  abstract     = {Increased production of reactive oxygen species plays an essential role in the pathogenesis of several diseases, including cardiac hypertrophy. In our search to identify redox-sensitive targets that contribute to redox signaling, we found that protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) was reversibly oxidized and inactivated in hearts undergoing hypertrophy. Cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of PTP1B in mice (PTP1B cKO mice) caused a hypertrophic phenotype that was exacerbated by pressure overload. Furthermore, we showed that argonaute 2 (AGO2), a key component of the RNA-induced silencing complex, was a substrate of PTP1B in cardiomyocytes and in the heart. Our results revealed that phosphorylation at Tyr 393 and inactivation of AGO2 in PTP1B cKO mice prevented miR-208b–mediated repression of thyroid hormone receptor–associated protein 1 (THRAP1; also known as MED13) and contributed to thyroid hormone–mediated cardiac hypertrophy. In support of this conclusion, inhibiting the synthesis of triiodothyronine (T3) with propylthiouracil rescued pressure overload–induced hypertrophy and improved myocardial contractility and systolic function in PTP1B cKO mice. Together, our data illustrate that PTP1B activity is cardioprotective and that redox signaling is linked to thyroid hormone responsiveness and microRNA-mediated gene silencing in pathological hypertrophy.},

  abstract     = {Most tumor types either fail to respond or become resistant to kinase inhibitors, often because of compensatory prosurvival pathways in the cancer cell’s broader signaling circuitry. Here, we found that intrinsic resistance to kinase inhibitors in cultured primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells may be overcome by reshaping kinase networks into topologies that confer drug sensitivity. We identified several antagonists of chromatin-modifying enzymes that sensitized AML cell lines to kinase inhibitors. Of these, we confirmed that inhibitors of the lysine-specific demethylase (LSD1; also known as KDM1A) rewired kinase signaling in AML cells in a way that increased the activity of the kinase MEK and that broadly suppressed the activity of other kinases and feedback loops. As a result, AML cell lines and about half of primary human AML samples were primed for sensitivity to the MEK inhibitor trametinib. Primary human cells with KRAS mutations and those with high MEK pathway activity were the best responders to sequential treatment with LSD1 inhibitors then trametinib, whereas those with NRAS mutations and high mTOR activity were poor responders. Overall, our study reveals the MEK pathway as a mechanism of resistance to LSD1 inhibitors in AML and shows a way to modulate kinase network circuitry to potentially overcome therapeutic resistance to kinase inhibitors.},

DAG exerts a myriad of biological functions through protein kinase C (PKC) and other effectors, such as protein kinase D (PKD) isozymes and small GTPase-regulating proteins (such as RasGRPs). Imbalances in the fine-tuned homeostasis between DAG generation by phospholipase C (PLC) enzymes and termination by DAG kinases (DGKs), as well as dysregulation in the activity or abundance of DAG effectors, have been widely associated with tumor initiation, progression, and metastasis. DAG is also a key orchestrator of T cell function and thus plays a major role in tumor immunosurveillance. In addition, DAG pathways shape the tumor ecosystem by arbitrating the complex, dynamic interaction between cancer cells and the immune landscape, hence representing powerful modifiers of immune checkpoint and adoptive T cell–directed immunotherapy. Exploiting the wide spectrum of DAG signals from an integrated perspective could underscore meaningful advances in targeted cancer therapy.},

Cyclin J interacted with cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), which increased the phosphorylation of a subset of CDK substrates, including the transcription factor FoxK1 and the GTPase Drp1. Cyclin J–dependent phosphorylation of FoxK1 decreased the transcription of glycolytic genes and Hif-1α activation, whereas hyperactivation of Drp1 by cyclin J–dependent phosphorylation promoted mitochondrial fragmentation and impaired the production of mitochondrial ROS. In mice, cyclin J in macrophages limited the growth of tumor xenografts and protected against LPS-induced shock but increased the susceptibility to bacterial infection. Collectively, our findings indicate that cyclin J–CDK signaling promotes antitumor immunity and the resolution of inflammation by opposing the metabolic changes that drive inflammatory responses in macrophages.},

Critical cases of COVID-19 are characterized by the production of excessive amounts of cytokines and extensive lung damage, which is partially caused by the fusion of SARS-CoV-2–infected pneumocytes. Here, we found that cell fusion caused by the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein induced a type I interferon (IFN) response. This function of the S protein required its cleavage by proteases at the S1/S2 and the S2′ sites. We further showed that cell fusion damaged nuclei and resulted in the formation of micronuclei that were sensed by the cytosolic DNA sensor cGAS and led to the activation of its downstream effector STING. Phosphorylation of the transcriptional regulator IRF3 and the expression of IFNB , which encodes a type I IFN, were abrogated in cGAS-deficient fused cells. Moreover, infection with VSV-SARS-CoV-2 also induced cell fusion, DNA damage, and cGAS-STING–dependent expression of IFNB . Together, these results uncover a pathway underlying the IFN response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our data suggest a mechanism by which fused pneumocytes in the lungs of patients with COVID-19 may enhance the production of IFNs and other cytokines, thus exacerbating disease severity.},

  abstract     = {PAX8 is a master transcription factor that is essential during embryogenesis and promotes neoplastic growth. It is expressed by the secretory cells lining the female reproductive tract, and its deletion during development results in atresia of reproductive tract organs. Nearly all ovarian carcinomas express PAX8, and its knockdown results in apoptosis of ovarian cancer cells. To explore the role of PAX8 in these tissues, we purified the PAX8 protein complex from nonmalignant fallopian tube cells and high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma cell lines. We found that PAX8 was a member of a large chromatin remodeling complex and preferentially interacted with SOX17, another developmental transcription factor. Depleting either PAX8 or SOX17 from cancer cells altered the expression of factors involved in angiogenesis and functionally disrupted tubule and capillary formation in cell culture and mouse models. PAX8 and SOX17 in ovarian cancer cells promoted the secretion of angiogenic factors by suppressing the expression of SERPINE1 , which encodes a proteinase inhibitor with anti a ngiogenic effects. The findings reveal a non–cell-autonomous function of these transcription factors in regulating angiogenesis in ovarian cancer.},

  abstract     = {The fungal pathogen Candida albicans secretes the peptide toxin candidalysin, which damages epithelial cells and drives an innate inflammatory response mediated by the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways and the transcription factor c-Fos. In cultured oral epithelial cells, candidalysin activated the MAPK p38, which resulted in heat shock protein 27 (Hsp27) activation, IL-6 release, and EGFR phosphorylation without affecting the induction of c-Fos. p38 activation was not triggered by EGFR but by two nonredundant pathways involving MAPK kinases (MKKs) and the kinase Src, which differentially controlled p38 signaling outputs. Whereas MKKs mainly promoted p38-dependent release of IL-6, Src promoted p38-mediated phosphorylation of EGFR in a ligand-independent fashion. In parallel, candidalysin also activated the EGFR-ERK pathway in a ligand-dependent manner, resulting in c-Fos activation and release of the neutrophil-activating chemokines G-CSF and GM-CSF. In mice, early clearance events of oral C. albicans infection required p38 but not c-Fos. These findings delineate how candidalysin activates the pathways downstream of the MAPKs p38 and ERK that differentially contribute to immune activation during C. albicans infection.},

The membrane potential ( V M ) of vascular cells serves as the physiological bridge that translates brain activity into vascular function. In other beds, the ATP-sensitive K + (K ATP ) channel regulates V M in vascular smooth muscle, which is absent in the capillary network. Here, with transgenic mice that expressed a dominant-negative mutant of the pore-forming Kir6.1 subunit specifically in brain cECs or pericytes, we demonstrated that K ATP channels were present in both cell types and robustly controlled V M . We further showed that the signaling nucleotide adenosine acted through A 2A receptors and the Gα s /cAMP/PKA pathway to activate capillary K ATP channels. Moreover, K ATP channel stimulation in vivo increased cerebral blood flow (CBF), an effect that was blunted by expression of the dominant-negative Kir6.1 mutant in either capillary cell type. These findings establish an important role for K ATP channels in cECs and pericytes in the regulation of CBF.},

Here, we identified two ways through which DLK is coupled to the neural-specific isoform JNK3 to control prodegenerative signaling. JNK3 catalyzed positive feedback phosphorylation of DLK that further activated DLK and locked the DLK-JNK3 module in a highly active state. Neither homologous MAP3Ks nor a homologous MAPK could support this positive feedback loop. Unlike the related JNK1 isoform JNK2 and JNK3 promote prodegenerative axon-to-soma signaling and were endogenously palmitoylated. Moreover, palmitoylation targeted both DLK and JNK3 to the same axonal vesicles, and JNK3 palmitoylation was essential for axonal retrograde signaling in response to optic nerve crush injury in vivo. These findings provide previously unappreciated insights into DLK-JNK signaling relevant to neuropathological conditions and answer long-standing questions regarding the selective prodegenerative roles of JNK2 and JNK3.},

The glucocorticoid receptor (GR), a member of the nuclear receptor family, has been proposed to interact with and inhibit the activation of components of the PI3K-AKT and MAPK pathways downstream of RAS. In the absence of activating ligands, we found that GR was present in cytoplasmic KRAS-containing complexes and inhibited the activation of wild-type and oncogenic KRAS in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and human lung cancer A549 cells. The DNA binding domain of GR was involved in the interaction with KRAS, but GR-dependent inhibition of RAS activation did not depend on the nuclear translocation of GR. The addition of ligand released GR-dependent inhibition of RAS, AKT, the MAPK p38, and the MAPKK MEK. CRISPR-Cas9–mediated deletion of GR in A549 cells enhanced tumor growth in xenografts in mice. Patient samples of non–small cell lung carcinomas showed lower expression of NR3C1 , the gene encoding GR, compared to adjacent normal tissues and lower NR3C1 expression correlated with a worse disease outcome. These results suggest that glucocorticoids prevent the ability of GR to limit tumor growth by inhibiting RAS activation, which has potential implications for the use of glucocorticoids in patients with cancer.},

  abstract     = {G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest family of cell surface receptors and signal through the proximal effectors, G proteins and β-arrestins, to influence nearly every biological process. The G protein and β-arrestin signaling pathways have largely been considered separable; however, direct interactions between Gα proteins and β-arrestins have been described that appear to be part of a distinct GPCR signaling pathway. Within these complexes, Gα i/o , but not other Gα protein subtypes, directly interacts with β-arrestin, regardless of the canonical Gα protein that is coupled to the GPCR. Here, we report that the endogenous biased chemokine agonists of CXCR3 (CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11), together with two small-molecule biased agonists, differentially formed Gα i :β-arrestin complexes. Formation of the Gα i :β-arrestin complexes did not correlate well with either G protein activation or β-arrestin recruitment. β-arrestin biosensors demonstrated that ligands that promoted Gα i :β-arrestin complex formation generated similar β-arrestin conformations. We also found that Gα i :β-arrestin complexes did not couple to the mitogen-activated protein kinase ERK, as is observed with other receptors such as the V2 vasopressin receptor, but did couple with the clathrin adaptor protein AP-2, which suggests context-dependent signaling by these complexes. These findings reinforce the notion that Gα i :β-arrestin complex formation is a distinct GPCR signaling pathway and enhance our understanding of the spectrum of biased agonism.},

We found that high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) abundance was reduced by 45\% in septic patients compared to that in nonseptic patients. Furthermore, HDL-C abundance in nonsurviving septic patients was substantially lower than in those patients who survived. We therefore hypothesized that replenishing HDL might be a therapeutic approach for treating sepsis and found that supplementing HDL with synthetic HDL (sHDL) provided protection against sepsis in mice. In mice subjected to cecal ligation and puncture (CLP), infusing the sHDL ETC-642 increased plasma HDL-C amounts and improved the 7-day survival rate. Septic mice treated with sHDL showed improved kidney function and reduced inflammation, as indicated by marked decreases in the plasma concentrations of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and the cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-10, respectively. We found that sHDL inhibited the ability of the endotoxins LPS and LPA to activate inflammatory pathways in RAW264.7 cells and HEK-Blue cells expressing the receptors TLR4 or TLR2 and NF-κB reporters. In addition, sHDL inhibited the activation of HUVECs by LPS, LTA, and TNF-α. Together, these data indicate that sHDL treatment protects mice from sepsis in multiple ways and that it might be an effective therapy for patients with sepsis.},

We sought to determine whether DNA-PKcs played a role in the tubular damage that occurs during acute kidney injury (AKI) induced by LPS injection (to mimic sepsis), cisplatin administration, or renal ischemia/reperfusion injury. Although DNA-PKcs normally localizes to the nucleus, we detected cytoplasmic DNA-PKcs in mouse kidney tissues and urinary sediments of human patients with septic AKI. Increased cytoplasmic amounts of DNA-PKcs correlated with renal dysfunction. Tubule cell–specific DNA-PKcs deletion attenuated AKI-mediated tubular cell death and changes in the abundance of various proteins with mitochondrial functions or roles in apoptotic pathways. DNA-PKcs interacted with Fis1 and phosphorylated it at Thr 34 in its TQ motif, which increased the affinity of Fis1 for Drp1 and induced mitochondrial fragmentation. Knockin mice expressing a nonphosphorylatable T34A mutant exhibited improved renal function and histological features and reduced mitochondrial fragmentation upon induction of AKI. Phosphorylation of Thr 34 in Fis1 was detectable in urinary sediments of human patients with septic AKI and correlated with renal dysfunction.

However, this feature poses a major challenge to selectively modulate the system pharmacologically. Here, we identified a conserved cluster of three aromatic receptor residues that anchors the second extracellular loop (ECL2) to the top of receptor transmembrane helices (TM) 4 and 5 and enables recognition of both shared and specific characteristics of interacting chemokines. This cluster was essential for the activation of several chemokine receptors. Furthermore, characteristic motifs of the ß 1 strand and 30s loop make the two main CC-chemokine subgroups—the macrophage inflammatory proteins (MIPs) and monocyte chemoattractant proteins (MCPs)—differentially dependent on this cluster in the promiscuous receptors CCR1, CCR2, and CCR5. The cluster additionally enabled CCR1 and CCR5 to discriminate between closely related MIPs based on the N terminus of the chemokine. G protein signaling and β-arrestin2 recruitment assays confirmed the importance of the conserved cluster in receptor discrimination of chemokine ligands. This extracellular site may facilitate the development of chemokine-related therapeutics.},

It may also contribute to poor outcomes in patients treated with certain chemotherapeutics that can promote fibrosis, such as bleomycin and methotrexate. Although the mechanistic details of this phenomenon are still being unraveled, we provide an overview of the experimental evidence linking fibrogenic stroma and tumor initiation. In this Review, we will summarize the causes and consequences of fibrous stroma and how this stromal cue is transmitted to the nuclei of parenchymal cells through a physical continuum from the ECM to chromatin, as well as ECM-dependent biochemical signaling that contributes to cellular transformation.},

  abstract     = {The pathogenesis of sepsis-induced acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has not yet been fully elucidated. Growth arrest–specific 6 (Gas6) has marked effects on hemostasis and reduces inflammation through its interaction with receptor tyrosine kinases of the TAM family: Tyro3, Axl, and Mer. Here, we found that plasma concentrations of Gas6 and soluble Mer were greater in patients with severe sepsis or septic ALI/ARDS compared with those in normal healthy donors. To determine whether the Gas6-Mer axis was critical in the pathogenesis of ALI/ARDS, we investigated the effects of intravenous administration of the selective Mer inhibitor UNC2250 on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)–induced ALI in mouse models subjected to inhalation of LPS. UNC2250 markedly inhibited the infiltration into the lungs of neutrophils and monocytes with increased amounts of Gas6 and Mer proteins, severe lung damage, and increased amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in LPS-induced ALI in mice. In human pulmonary aortic endothelial cells, LPS induced decreases in the amounts of endothelial nitric oxide synthase, thrombomodulin, and vascular endothelial–cadherin, which was blocked by treatment with UNC2250. UNC2250 also inhibited the LPS-dependent increases in cell proliferation and enhanced apoptosis in HL-60 cells, a human neutrophil–like cell line, and RAW264.7 cells, a mouse monocyte/macrophage cell line. These data provide insights into the potential multiple beneficial effects of the Mer inhibitor UNC2250 as a therapeutic reagent to treat inflammatory responses in ALI/ARDS.},

PKCθ/β-catalyzed phosphorylation of CARD11 promotes the assembly of the CARD11-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) complex and lymphocyte activation. Here, we demonstrated that PKCθ/β-dependent CARD11 phosphorylation also suppressed CARD11 functions in T or B cells. Through mass spectrometry–based proteomics analysis, we identified multiple constitutive and inducible CARD11 phosphorylation sites in T cells. We demonstrated that a single TCR- or BCR-inducible phosphorylation on Ser 893 in the carboxyl terminus of CARD11 prevented the activation of the transcription factor NF-κB, the kinase JNK, and the protease MALT1. Moreover, CARD11 Ser 893 phosphorylation sensitized BCR-addicted lymphoma cells to toxicity induced by Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors. Phosphorylation of Ser 893 in CARD11 by PKCθ controlled the strength of CARD11 scaffolding by impairing the formation of the CBM complex. Thus, PKCθ simultaneously catalyzes both stimulatory and inhibitory CARD11 phosphorylation events, which shape the strength of CARD11 signaling in lymphocytes.},

  abstract     = {The protein tyrosine phosphatase CD45 plays a crucial role in B cell antigen receptor (BCR) signaling by activating Src family kinases. Cd45 −/− mice show altered B cell development and a phenotype likely due to reduced steady-state signaling; however, Cd45 −/− B cells show relatively normal BCR ligation–induced signaling. In our investigation of how BCR signaling was restored in Cd45 −/− cells, we found that the coreceptor CD22 switched from an inhibitory to a stimulatory function in these cells. We disrupted the ability of CD22 to interact with its ligands in Cd45 −/− B cells by generating Cd45 −/− St6galI −/− mice, which cannot synthesize the glycan ligand of CD22, or by treating Cd45 −/− B cells in vitro with the sialoside GSC718, which inhibits ligand binding to CD22. BCR ligation–induced signaling was reduced by ST6GalI deficiency, but not by GSC718 treatment, suggesting that CD22 restored BCR ligation–induced signaling in Cd45 −/− mature B cells by altering cellular phenotypes during development. CD22 was required for the increase in the surface amount of IgM-BCR on Cd45 −/− B cells, which augmented signaling. Because B cell survival depends on steady-state BCR signaling, IgM-BCR abundance was likely increased by the selective survival of IgM-BCR hi Cd45 −/− B cells because of CD22-mediated signaling under conditions of substantially reduced steady-state signaling. Because the amount of surface IgM-BCR is increased on B cells from patients with other BCR signaling deficiencies, including X-linked agammaglobulinemia, our findings suggest that CD22 may contribute to the partial restoration of B cell function in these patients.},

  abstract     = {The pseudokinase scaffolds PEAK1 and PEAK2 are implicated in cancer cell migration and metastasis. We characterized the regulation and role of the third family member PEAK3 in cell signaling. Similar to PEAK1 and PEAK2, PEAK3 formed both homotypic and heterotypic complexes. In addition, like PEAK1, it bound to the adaptors Grb2 and CrkII. However, unlike PEAK1 and PEAK2, homodimerized PEAK3 also interacted with the ARF GTPase-activating protein ASAP1, the E3 ubiquitin ligase Cbl, and the kinase PYK2. Dimerization and subsequent phosphorylation on Tyr 24 , likely by a Src family kinase, were required for the binding of PEAK3 to Grb2 and ASAP1. Interactions with Grb2, CrkII, ASAP1, Cbl, and PYK2 exhibited contrasting dynamics upon cell stimulation with epidermal growth factor (EGF), in part due to PEAK3 dephosphorylation mediated by the phosphatase PTPN12. Overexpressing PEAK3 in mesenchymal-like MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells enhanced cell elongation in a manner dependent on PEAK3 dimerization, and manipulation of PEAK3 expression demonstrated a positive role for this scaffold in regulating cell migration. Overexpressing PEAK3 in PEAK1/2 double-knockout MCF-10A breast epithelial cells enhanced acinar growth, impaired basement membrane integrity, and promoted invasion in three-dimensional cultures, with the latter two effects dependent on the binding of PEAK3 to Grb2 and ASAP1. PEAK1 and PEAK2 quantitatively and temporally influenced PEAK3 function. These findings characterize PEAK3 as an integral, signal-diversifying member of the PEAK family with scaffolding roles that promote cell proliferation, migration, and invasion.},

  abstract     = {Bleeding correlates with disease severity in viral hemorrhagic fevers. We found that the increase in type I interferon (IFN-I) in mice caused by infection with the Armstrong strain of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV; an arenavirus) reduced the megakaryocytic expression of genes encoding enzymes involved in lipid biosynthesis ( cyclooxygenase 1 and thromboxane A synthase 1 ) and a thrombopoietic transcription factor ( Nf-e2 ). The decreased expression of these genes was associated with reduced numbers of circulating platelets and defects in the arachidonic acid synthetic pathway, thereby suppressing serotonin release from δ-granules in platelets. Bleeding resulted when severe thrombocytopenia and altered platelet function reduced the amount of platelet-derived serotonin below a critical threshold. Bleeding was facilitated by the absence of the activity of the kinase Lyn or the administration of aspirin, an inhibitor of arachidonic acid synthesis. Mouse platelets were not directly affected by IFN-I because they lack the receptor for the cytokine (IFNAR1), suggesting that transfusion of normal platelets into LCMV-infected mice could increase the amount of platelet-released serotonin and help to control hemorrhage.},

In mature CD8 + T cells, Themis has been implicated in integrating TCR and cytokine signals. We investigated whether Themis plays a direct role in cytokine signaling in mature T cells. Themis was required for IL-2– and IL-15–driven CD8 + T cell proliferation both in mice and in vitro. Mechanistically, we found that Themis promoted the activation of the transcription factor Stat and mechanistic target of rapamycin signaling downstream of cytokine receptors. Metabolomics and stable isotope tracing analyses revealed that Themis deficiency reduced glycolysis and serine and nucleotide biosynthesis, demonstrating a receptor-proximal requirement for Themis in triggering the metabolic changes that enable T cell proliferation. The cellular, metabolic, and biochemical defects caused by Themis deficiency were corrected in mice lacking both Themis and the phosphatase Shp1, suggesting that Themis mediates IL-2 and IL-15 receptor-proximal signaling by restraining the activity of Shp1. Together, these results not only shed light on the mechanisms of cytokine signaling but also provide new clues on manipulating T cells for clinical applications.},

Alternatively, heterogeneity could arise from differences in molecular content between cells, termed molecular phenotypic variability, which does not necessarily imply imprecise signaling. The contribution of these two processes to signaling heterogeneity is unclear. Here, we fused fibroblasts to produce binuclear syncytia to distinguish noise from phenotypic variability in the analysis of cytokine signaling. We reasoned that the responses of the two nuclei within one syncytium could approximate the signaling outcomes of two cells with the same molecular content, thereby disclosing noise contribution, whereas comparison of different syncytia should reveal contribution of phenotypic variability. We found that ~90\% of the variance in the primary response (which was the abundance of phosphorylated, nuclear STAT) to stimulation with the cytokines interferon-γ and oncostatin M resulted from differences in the molecular content of individual cells. Thus, our data reveal that cytokine signaling in the system used here operates in a reproducible, high-fidelity manner.},

The wild-type channel has an amino-terminal funnel in the pore, but in the presence of the inhibitor probenecid, a cytoplasmically oriented amino terminus and phospholipids obstruct the pore. Functional analysis using whole-cell patch-clamp and oocyte voltage clamp showed that PANX1 lacking the amino terminus did not open and had a dominant negative effect on channel activity, thus confirming that the amino-terminal domain played an essential role in channel opening. These observations suggest that dynamic conformational changes in the amino terminus of human PANX1 are associated with lipid movement in and out of the pore. Moreover, the data provide insight into the gating mechanism of PANX1 and, more broadly, other large-pore channels.},

Although effective in cultured cells, fluorescent protein tags and reporters are suboptimal in vivo because of poor tissue penetration and high background signal. Luciferase reporters offer improved signal-to-noise ratios but require injections of luciferin that can lead to variable responses and that limit the number and timing of data points that can be gathered. Such issues in studying the critical transcription factor p53 have limited insight on its activity in vivo during development and tissue injury responses. Here, by linking the expression of the near-infrared fluorescent protein iRFP713 to a synthetic p53-responsive promoter, we generated a knock-in reporter mouse that enabled noninvasive, longitudinal analysis of p53 activity in vivo in response to various stimuli. In the developing embryo, this model revealed the timing and localization of p53 activation. In adult mice, the model monitored p53 activation in response to irradiation and paracetamol- or CCl 4 -induced liver regeneration. After irradiation, we observed potent and sustained activation of p53 in the liver, which limited the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and promoted DNA damage resolution. We propose that this new reporter may be used to further advance our understanding of various physiological and pathophysiological p53 responses.},

  abstract     = {Superresolution techniques have advanced our understanding of complex cellular structures and processes but require the attachment of fluorophores to targets through tags or antibodies, which can be bulky and result in underlabeling. To overcome these limitations, we developed a technique to visualize the nanoscale binding locations of signaling proteins by taking advantage of their native interaction domains. Here, we demonstrated that pPAINT (protein point accumulation in nanoscale topography) is a new, single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) technique and used it to investigate T cell signaling by visualizing the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain, which is common in signaling molecules. When SH2 domain–containing proteins relocate to the plasma membrane, the domains selectively, transiently, and reversibly bind to preferred phosphorylated tyrosine residues on receptors. This transient binding yields the stochastic blinking events necessary for SMLM when observed with total internal reflection microscopy and enables quantification of binding coefficients in intact cells. We used pPAINT to reveal the binding sites of several T cell receptor–proximal signaling molecules, including Zap70, PI3K, Grb2, Syk, Eat2, and SHP2, and showed that the probes could be multiplexed. We showed that the binding half-life of the tandem SH2 domain of PI3K correlated with binding site cluster size at the immunological synapses of T cells, but that longer binding lifetimes were associated with smaller clusters for the monovalent SH2 domain of Eat2. These results demonstrate the potential of pPAINT for investigating phosphotyrosine-mediated signaling processes at the plasma membrane.},

  abstract     = {Social memory enables one to recognize and distinguish specific individuals. It is fundamental to social behaviors that can be mediated by the oxytocin receptor (OXTR), such as forming relationships. We investigated the molecular regulation and function of OXTR in animal behavior involving social memory. We found that Ser 261 in OXTR was phosphorylated by protein kinase D1 (PKD1). Neuronal Ca 2+ signaling and behavior analyses revealed that rats expressing a mutated form of OXTR that cannot be phosphorylated at this residue (OXTR S261A) in the medial amygdala (MeA) exhibited impaired long-term social memory (LTSM). Blocking the phosphorylation of wild-type OXTR in the MeA using an interfering peptide in rats or through conditional knockout of Pkd1 in mice reduced social memory retention, whereas expression of a phosphomimetic mutant of OXTR rescued it. In HEK293A cells, the PKD1-mediated phosphorylation of OXTR promoted its binding to G q protein and, in turn, OXTR-mediated phosphorylation of PKD1, indicating a positive feedback loop. In addition, OXTR with a single-nucleotide polymorphism found in humans (rs200362197), which has a mutation in the conserved recognition region in the PKD1 phosphorylation site, showed impaired activation and signaling in vitro and in HEK293A cells similar to that of the S216A mutant. Our findings describe a phosphoregulatory loop for OXTR and its critical role in social behavior that might be further explored in associated disorders.},

  abstract     = {The Escherichia coli chemoreceptor array is a supramolecular assembly that enables cells to respond to extracellular cues dynamically and with great precision and sensitivity. In the array, transmembrane receptors organized as trimers of dimers are connected at their cytoplasmic tips by hexameric rings of alternating subunits of the kinase CheA and the scaffolding protein CheW (CheA-CheW rings). Interactions of CheW molecules with the members of receptor trimers not directly bound to CheA-CheW rings may lead to the formation of hexameric CheW rings in the chemoreceptor array. Here, we detected such CheW rings with a cellular cysteine-directed cross-linking assay and explored the requirements for their formation and their participation in array assembly. We found that CheW ring formation varied with cellular CheW abundance, depended on the presence of receptors capable of a trimer-of-dimers arrangement, and did not require CheA. Cross-linking studies of a CheA~CheW fusion protein incapable of forming homomeric CheW oligomers demonstrated that CheW rings were not essential for the assembly of CheA-containing arrays. Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET)–based kinase assays of arrays containing variable amounts of CheW rings revealed that CheW rings enhanced the cooperativity and the sensitivity of the responses to attractants. We propose that six-membered CheW rings provide the additional interconnectivity required for optimal signaling and gradient tracking performance by chemosensory arrays.},

In the peripheral nervous system, the myelin sheath is produced by Schwann cells. The guanine-nucleotide exchange factor cytohesin-2 activates the protein Arf6 to promote Schwann cell myelination. Here, we investigated the regulation of cytohesin-2 and found that the phosphorylation status of Tyr 381 in cytohesin-2 is central to Schwann cell myelination. Knockin mice with a nonphosphorylatable Y381F mutation in cytohesin-2 exhibited reduced myelin thickness and decreased Arf6 activity in sciatic nerve tissue. In HEK293T cells, cytohesin-2 was dephosphorylated at Tyr 381 by the protein tyrosine phosphatase PTP4A1, whereas phosphorylation at this site was maintained by interaction with the adaptor protein SH2B1. Schwann cell–specific knockdown of PTP4A1 in mice increased cytohesin-2 phosphorylation and myelin thickness. Conversely, Schwann cell–specific loss of SH2B1 resulted in reduced myelin thickness and decreased cytohesin-2 phosphorylation. Thus, a signaling unit centered on cytohesin-2—with SH2B1 as a positive regulator and PTP4A1 as a negative regulator—controls Schwann cell myelination in the peripheral nervous system.},

This is due to the lack of clearly defined underlying mechanisms or a dominant oncogene that can be targeted pharmacologically, unlike in other cancer types. Here, we report the identification of a previously uncharacterized oncogenic signaling pathway in HCC that is mediated by the tyrosine kinase Yes. Using genetic and pharmacological interventions in cellular and mouse models of HCC, we showed that Yes activity was necessary for HCC cell proliferation. Transgenic expression of activated Yes in mouse hepatocytes was sufficient to induce liver tumorigenesis. Yes phosphorylated the transcriptional coactivators YAP and TAZ (YAP/TAZ), promoting their nuclear accumulation and transcriptional activity in HCC cells and liver tumors. We also showed that YAP/TAZ were effectors of the Yes-dependent oncogenic transformation of hepatocytes. Src family kinase activation correlated with the tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear localization of YAP in human HCC and was associated with increased tumor burden in mice. Specifically, high Yes activity predicted shorter overall survival in patients with HCC. Thus, our findings identify Yes as a potential therapeutic target in HCC.},

Here, we used an intact cell proximity–based labeling coupled to tandem mass tag (TMT)–based quantitative proteomics analysis to identify proteins that selectively interacted with the GTP-bound form of Gα i1 . Multiple targets were identified and validated with a BioID2-tagged, constitutively active Gα i1 mutant, suggesting a network of interactions for activated Gα I proteins in intact cells. We showed that active Gα i1 , but not Gα i2 , stimulated one candidate protein, PDZ-RhoGEF (PRG), despite more than 85\% sequence identity between the G proteins. We also demonstrated in primary human neutrophils that active Gα i likely regulated the polarization of phosphorylated myosin light chain, a process critical for migration, through the activation of PRG. The identification and characterization of new targets directly or indirectly regulated by Gα i will aid in the investigation of the functional roles of Gα i -coupled GPCRs in multiple biological processes.},

  abstract     = {After ligand stimulation, many G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) undergo β-arrestin–dependent desensitization, during which they are internalized and either degraded or recycled to the plasma membrane. Some GPCRs are not subject to this type of desensitization because they lack the residues required to interact with β-arrestins. We identified a mechanism of redox-dependent alternative internalization (REDAI) that promotes the internalization and degradation of the purinergic P2Y 6 receptor (P2Y 6 R). Synthetic and natural compounds containing electrophilic isothiocyanate groups covalently modified P2Y 6 R at Cys 220 , which promoted the ubiquitylation of Lys 137 and receptor internalization and degradation in various mouse and human cultured cell lines. Endogenous electrophiles also promoted ligand-dependent P2Y 6 R internalization and degradation. P2Y 6 R is highly abundant in inflammatory cells and promotes the pathogenesis of colitis. Deficiency in P2Y 6 R protected mice against experimentally induced colitis, and mice expressing a form of P2Y 6 R in which Cys 220 was mutated to nonmodifiable serine were more sensitive to the induction of colitis. Several other GPCRs, including A 2B AR, contain cysteine and lysine residues at the appropriate positions to mediate REDAI, and isothiocyanate stimulated the internalization of A 2B AR and of a form of P2Y 2 R with insertions of the appropriate residues. Thus, endogenous and exogenous electrophiles may limit colitis progression through cysteine modification of P2Y 6 R and may also mediate internalization of other GPCRs.},

  abstract     = {The essential micronutrient zinc regulates immune responses by affecting signaling pathways. In activated monocytes and macrophages, signaling networks mediate the metabolic reprogramming that meets the demands of participation in immune responses. Here, we demonstrated that cytoplasmic, bioavailable zinc was essential for promoting IL-1β production in activated human monocytes and macrophages downstream of glycolysis induced by the kinase-containing multiprotein complex mTORC1. The concentration of cytoplasmic zinc was determined by that of extracellular zinc, which was brought into cells through the zinc-specific importer Zip8. The abundance of Zip8 was increased in monocytes from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), as well as in LPS-stimulated monocytes and macrophages from healthy individuals. The mTORC1-mediated phosphorylation of S6 kinase (S6K) was enhanced by zinc-mediated inhibition of PP2A, a phosphatase that targets S6K. As a result, IL-1β production was increased due to the activation of mTORC1-induced glycolysis. In monocytes of patients with RA, the expression of Zip8 and the zinc-inducible metallothionein isoform MT2A and the phosphorylation of S6K were enhanced compared with those of healthy controls. Furthermore, Zip8 expression correlated with more severe RA clinical parameters, suggesting that Zip8-mediated zinc influx is related to inflammatory conditions. These results provide insight into the role of cytoplasmic, bioavailable zinc in the metabolic reprogramming of human monocytes and macrophages in inflammatory responses.},

  abstract     = {The kinase AKT (also known as protein kinase B) is a key regulator of cell proliferation, survival, and metabolism. In addition to being activated by growth factors, AKT is activated in response to DNA damage. Here, we found that the DNA damage response kinase DNA-PK sustains cell survival through a phosphorylation event that leads to increased AKT activity. In various cancer and noncancer cells in culture, DNA damage caused by ionizing radiation or topoisomerase inhibitors triggered DNA-PK–dependent phosphorylation of the mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) subunit Sin1, which enabled its interaction with the guanine nucleotide exchange factor ECT2. Depleting Sin1 or ECT2 or disrupting the protein interaction or catalytic function of ECT2 attenuated DNA damage–induced AKT activation, thereby enhancing cellular sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents. Our findings elucidate a mechanism mediating DNA damage–induced AKT activation and cell survival.},

(2022). ID2 inhibits innate antiviral immunity by blocking TBK1- and

  abstract     = {The transcription regulator ID2 plays an essential role in the development and differentiation of immune cells. Here, we report that ID2 also negatively regulates antiviral innate immune responses. During viral infection of human epithelial cells, ID2 bound to TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and to inhibitor of nuclear factor κB kinase ε (IKKε). These interactions inhibited the recruitment and activation of interferon (IFN) regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) by TBK1 or IKKε, leading to a reduction in the expression of IFN-β1 ( IFNB1 ). IFN-β induced the nuclear export of ID2 to form a negative feedback loop. Knocking out ID2 in human cells enhanced innate immune responses and suppressed infection by different viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. Mice with a myeloid-specific deficiency of ID2 produced more IFN-α in response to viral infection and were more resistant to viral infection than wild-type mice. Our findings not only establish ID2 as a modulator of IRF3 activation induced by TBK1 and/or IKKε but also introduce a mechanism for cross-talk between innate immunity and cell development and differentiation.},
