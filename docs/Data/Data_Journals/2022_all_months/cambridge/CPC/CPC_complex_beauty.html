We give sufficient conditions under which the locations can be recovered (up to an isomorphism of the space) in the sparse regime. Moreover, we define a geometric counterpart of the model of flow of information on trees, due to Mossel and Peres, in which one considers a branching random walk on a sphere and the goal is to recover the location of the root based on the locations of leaves.

As a natural variant, Luczak and Thomassé introduced the notion of a locally bipartite graph in which each neighbourhood is 2-colourable. Here we study the chromatic profile of the family of graphs in which every neighbourhood is ; -colourable (locally ; -partite graphs) as well as the family where the common neighbourhood of every ; -clique is ; -colourable.

In this paper, we study a natural non-local Markov chain known as the ; for the mean-field case of the random-cluster model, where the underlying graph is the complete graph on ; vertices. The random-cluster model is parametrised by an ; and a ; . Our focus is on the critical regime: ; and ; , where ; is the threshold corresponding to the order–disorder phase transition of the model. We show that the mixing time of the CM dynamics is ; in this parameter regime, which reveals that the dynamics does not undergo an exponential slowdown at criticality, a surprising fact that had been predicted (but not proved) by statistical physicists. This also provides a nearly optimal bound (up to the ; factor) for the mixing time of the mean-field CM dynamics in the only regime of parameters where no non-trivial bound was previously known. Our proof consists of a multi-phased coupling argument that combines several key ingredients, including a new local limit theorem, a precise bound on the maximum of symmetric random walks with varying step sizes and tailored estimates for critical random graphs. In addition, we derive an improved comparison inequality between the mixing time of the CM dynamics and that of the local Glauber dynamics on general graphs; this results in better mixing time bounds for the local dynamics in the mean-field setting.},

Burr and Rosta, extending a famous conjecture of Erdős, conjectured that every graph is common. The conjectures of Erdős and of Burr and Rosta were disproved by Thomason and by Sidorenko, respectively, in the late 1980s. Collecting new examples of common graphs had not seen much progress since then, although very recently a few more graphs were verified to be common by the flag algebra method or the recent progress on Sidorenko’s conjecture. Our contribution here is to provide several new classes of tripartite common graphs. The first example is the class of so-called triangle trees, which generalises two theorems by Sidorenko and answers a question of Jagger, Šťovíček, and Thomason from 1996. We also prove that, somewhat surprisingly, given any tree ; , there exists a triangle tree such that the graph obtained by adding ; as a pendant tree is still common. Furthermore, we show that adding arbitrarily many apex vertices to any connected bipartite graph on at most ; vertices yields a common graph.},

There are three classes of such models, the most studied being the critical one. In a recent series of works by Martinelli, Morris, Toninelli and the authors, it was shown that the KCM counterparts of critical bootstrap percolation models with the same properties split into two classes with different behaviour. Together with the companion paper by the first author, our work determines the logarithm of the infection time up to a constant factor for all critical KCM, which were previously known only up to logarithmic corrections. This improves all previous results except for the Duarte-KCM, for which we give a new proof of the best result known. We establish that on this level of precision critical KCM have to be classified into seven categories instead of the two in bootstrap percolation. In the present work, we establish lower bounds for critical KCM in a unified way, also recovering the universality result of Toninelli and the authors and the Duarte model result of Martinelli, Toninelli and the second author.},

  abstract     = {Combinatorial samplers are algorithmic schemes devised for the approximate- and exact-size generation of large random combinatorial structures, such as context-free words, various tree-like data structures, maps, tilings, RNA molecules. They can be adapted to combinatorial specifications with additional parameters, allowing for a more flexible control over the output profile of parametrised combinatorial patterns. One can control, for instance, the number of leaves, profile of node degrees in trees or the number of certain sub-patterns in generated strings. However, such a flexible control requires an additional and nontrivial tuning procedure. Using techniques of convex optimisation, we present an efficient tuning algorithm for multi-parametric combinatorial specifications. Our algorithm works in polynomial time in the system description length, the number of tuning parameters, the number of combinatorial classes in the specification, and the logarithm of the total target size. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a series of practical examples, including rational, algebraic, and so-called Pólya specifications. We show how our method can be adapted to a broad range of less typical combinatorial constructions, including symmetric polynomials, labelled sets and cycles with cardinality lower bounds, simple increasing trees or substitutions. Finally, we discuss some practical aspects of our prototype tuner implementation and provide its benchmark results.},

  abstract     = {We define a new ribbon group action on ribbon graphs that uses a semidirect product of a permutation group and the original ribbon group of Ellis-Monaghan and Moffatt to take (partial) twists and duals, or twuals, of ribbon graphs. A ribbon graph is a fixed point of this new ribbon group action if and only if it is isomorphic to one of its (partial) twuals. This extends the original ribbon group action, which only used the canonical identification of edges, to the more natural setting of self-twuality up to isomorphism. We then show that every ribbon graph has in its orbit an orientable embedded bouquet and prove that the (partial) twuality properties of these bouquets propagate through their orbits. Thus, we can determine (partial) twualities via these one vertex graphs, for which checking isomorphism reduces simply to checking dihedral group symmetries. Finally, we apply the new ribbon group action to generate ; self-trial ribbon graphs on up to seven edges, in contrast with the few, large, very high-genus, self-trial regular maps found by Wilson, and by Jones and Poultin. We also show how the automorphism group of a ribbon graph yields self-dual, -petrial or –trial graphs in its orbit, and produce an infinite family of self-trial graphs that do not arise as covers or parallel connections of regular maps, thus answering a question of Jones and Poulton.},

In this paper, we investigate analogues of these results in the directed setting. There are several ways to define a minor in a digraph. One natural way is as follows. A ; is a digraph whose vertex set is partitioned into ; parts such that each part induces a strongly connected subdigraph, and there is at least one edge in each direction between any two distinct parts. We investigate bounds on the dichromatic number and minimum out-degree of a digraph that force the existence of strong ; minors as subdigraphs. In particular, we show that any tournament with dichromatic number at least 2; contains a strong ; minor, and any tournament with minimum out-degree ; also contains a strong ; minor. The latter result is tight up to the implied constant and may be viewed as a strong-minor analogue to the classical result of Kostochka and Thomason. Lastly, we show that there is no function ; such that any digraph with minimum out-degree at least ; (; ) contains a strong ; minor, but such a function exists when considering dichromatic number.},

  abstract     = {Many problems in combinatorial linear algebra require upper bounds on the number of solutions to an underdetermined system of linear equations ; , where the coordinates of the vector ; are restricted to take values in some small subset (e.g. ; ) of the underlying field. The classical ways of bounding this quantity are to use either a rank bound observation due to Odlyzko or a vector anti-concentration inequality due to Halász. The former gives a stronger conclusion except when the number of equations is significantly smaller than the number of variables; even in such situations, the hypotheses of Halász’s inequality are quite hard to verify in practice. In this paper, using a novel approach to the anti-concentration problem for vector sums, we obtain new Halász-type inequalities that beat the Odlyzko bound even in settings where the number of equations is comparable to the number of variables. In addition to being stronger, our inequalities have hypotheses that are considerably easier to verify. We present two applications of our inequalities to combinatorial (random) matrix theory: (i) we obtain the first non-trivial upper bound on the number of ; Hadamard matrices and (ii) we improve a recent bound of Deneanu and Vu on the probability of normality of a random ; matrix.},

  abstract     = {It is well known that the height profile of a critical conditioned Galton–Watson tree with finite offspring variance converges, after a suitable normalisation, to the local time of a standard Brownian excursion. In this work, we study the distance profile, defined as the profile of all distances between pairs of vertices. We show that after a proper rescaling the distance profile converges to a continuous random function that can be described as the density of distances between random points in the Brownian continuum random tree. We show that this limiting function a.s. is Hölder continuous of any order ; , and that it is a.e. differentiable. We note that it cannot be differentiable at 0, but leave as open questions whether it is Lipschitz, and whether it is continuously differentiable on the half-line ; . The distance profile is naturally defined also for unrooted trees contrary to the height profile that is designed for rooted trees. This is used in our proof, and we prove the corresponding convergence result for the distance profile of random unrooted simply generated trees. As a minor purpose of the present work, we also formalize the notion of unrooted simply generated trees and include some simple results relating them to rooted simply generated trees, which might be of independent interest.},

These events satisfy similar recursive properties: ; holds if and only if ; holds for at least one of the trees initiated by children of the root, and ; holds if and only if ; holds for at least two of these trees. The probability of ; has a continuous phase transition, increasing from 0 when the mean of the child distribution increases above 1. On the other hand, the probability of ; has a first-order phase transition, jumping discontinuously to a non-zero value at criticality. Given the recursive property satisfied by the event, we describe the critical child distributions where a continuous phase transition takes place.

In particular, we show that the cover time becomes linear in the number ; of vertices on discrete tori and bounded degree trees, of order ; on bounded degree expanders, and of order ; on the Erdős–Rényi random graph in a certain sparsely connected regime. We also consider the algorithmic question of computing an optimal strategy and prove a dichotomy in efficiency between computing strategies for hitting and cover times.},

We establish a threshold result for the existence of a spanning tree in ; , restricting to ; satisfying the necessary divisibility conditions. Specifically, we show that when ;  ≥ 5, there is a positive constant ; (; ) such that for any ;  ≥ 2, the probability that ; contains a spanning tree tends to 1 if ; &gt; ; (; ), and otherwise this probability tends to zero. The threshold value ; (; ) grows exponentially with ; . As ; is connected with probability that tends to 1, this implies that when ; ≤ ; (; ), most ; -regular ; -uniform hypergraphs are connected but have no spanning tree. When ;  = 3, 4 we prove that ; contains a spanning tree with probability that tends to 1, for any ;  ≥ 2. Our proof also provides the asymptotic distribution of the number of spanning trees in ; for all fixed integers ; , ;  ≥ 2. Previously, this asymptotic distribution was only known in the trivial case of 2-regular graphs, or for cubic graphs.},

  abstract     = {Consider the following experiment: a deck with ; copies of ; different card types is randomly shuffled, and a guesser attempts to guess the cards sequentially as they are drawn. Each time a guess is made, some amount of ‘feedback’ is given. For example, one could tell the guesser the true identity of the card they just guessed (the complete feedback model) or they could be told nothing at all (the no feedback model). In this paper we explore a partial feedback model, where upon guessing a card, the guesser is only told whether or not their guess was correct. We show in this setting that, uniformly in ; , at most ; cards can be guessed correctly in expectation. This resolves a question of Diaconis and Graham from 1981, where even the ; case was open.},
