  abstract     = {We consider residue expansions for survival and density/mass functions of first-passage distributions in finite-state semi-Markov processes (SMPs) in continuous and integer time. Conditions are given which guarantee that the residue expansions for these functions have a dominant exponential/geometric term. The key condition assumes that the relevant states for first passage contain an irreducible class, thus ensuring the same sort of dominant exponential/geometric terms as one gets for phase-type distributions in Markov processes. Essentially, the presence of an irreducible class along with some other conditions ensures that the boundary singularity ; for the moment generating function (MGF) of the first-passage-time distribution is a simple pole. In the continuous-time setting we prove that ; is a dominant pole, in that the MGF has no other pole on the vertical line ; In integer time we prove that ; is dominant if all holding-time mass functions for the SMP are aperiodic and non-degenerate. The expansions and pole characterisations address first passage to a single new state or a subset of new states, and first return to the starting state. Numerical examples demonstrate that the residue expansions are considerably more accurate than saddlepoint approximations and can provide a substitute for exact computation above the 75th percentile.},

  abstract     = {Restless bandits are a class of sequential resource allocation problems concerned with allocating one or more resources among several alternative processes where the evolution of the processes depends on the resources allocated to them. Such models capture the fundamental trade-offs between exploration and exploitation. In 1988, Whittle developed an index heuristic for restless bandit problems which has emerged as a popular solution approach because of its simplicity and strong empirical performance. The Whittle index heuristic is applicable if the model satisfies a technical condition known as indexability. In this paper, we present two general sufficient conditions for indexability and identify simpler-to-verify refinements of these conditions. We then revisit a previously proposed algorithm called the adaptive greedy algorithm which is known to compute the Whittle index for a sub-class of restless bandits. We show that a generalization of the adaptive greedy algorithm computes the Whittle index for all indexable restless bandits. We present an efficient implementation of this algorithm which can compute the Whittle index of a restless bandit with ; states in ; computations. Finally, we present a detailed numerical study which affirms the strong performance of the Whittle index heuristic.},

Our focus is on the non-standard regime when the mean of the free process is negative but the reflection vectors point away from the origin, so that the reflected process escapes to infinity along one of the axes. Under rather general conditions, it is shown that such behaviour is certain and each component can dominate the other with positive probability for any given starting position. Additionally, we establish the corresponding invariance principle providing justification for the use of the reflected Brownian motion as an approximate model. Focusing on the probability that the first component dominates, we derive a kernel equation for the respective Laplace transform in the starting position. This is done for the compound Poisson model with negative exponential jumps and, by means of approximation, for the Brownian model. Both equations are solved via boundary value problem analysis, which also yields the domination probability when starting at the origin. Finally, certain asymptotic analysis and numerical results are presented.},

Among many equivalent models for the hyperbolic space, we study the ; -dimensional Poincaré ball (; ), with a general connectivity radius. While many phase transitions are known for the expectation asymptotics of certain subgraph counts, very little is known about the second-order results. Two of the distinguishing characteristics of geometric graphs on the hyperbolic space are the presence of tree-like hierarchical structures and the power-law behaviour of the degree distribution. We aim to reveal such characteristics in detail by investigating the behaviour of sub-tree counts. We show multiple phase transitions for expectation and variance in the resulting hyperbolic geometric graph. In particular, the expectation and variance of the sub-tree counts exhibit an intricate dependence on the degree sequence of the tree under consideration. Additionally, unlike the thermodynamic regime of the Euclidean random geometric graph, the expectation and variance may exhibit different growth rates, which is indicative of power-law behaviour. Finally, we also prove a normal approximation for sub-tree counts using the Malliavin–Stein method of Last ; (; , 2016), along with the Palm calculus for Poisson point processes.},

In the extended class studied in this paper, on the contrary, it decreases the stochastic intensity of the process, which induces a kind of negative dependence in the increments in the disjoint time intervals. First, we define the extended class of generalized Pólya processes and derive some preliminary results which will be used in the remaining part of the paper. It is seen that the extended class of generalized Pólya processes can be viewed as generalized pure death processes, where the death rate depends on both the state and the time. Based on the preliminary results, the main properties of the multivariate extended generalized Pólya process and meaningful characterizations are obtained. Finally, possible applications to reliability modeling are briefly discussed.},

  abstract     = {We study a stochastic compartmental susceptible–infected (SI) epidemic process on a configuration model random graph with a given degree distribution over a finite time interval. We split the population of graph vertices into two compartments, namely, S and I, denoting susceptible and infected vertices, respectively. In addition to the sizes of these two compartments, we keep track of the counts of SI-edges (those connecting a susceptible and an infected vertex) and SS-edges (those connecting two susceptible vertices). We describe the dynamical process in terms of these counts and present a functional central limit theorem (FCLT) for them as the number of vertices in the random graph grows to infinity. The FCLT asserts that the counts, when appropriately scaled, converge weakly to a continuous Gaussian vector semimartingale process in the space of vector-valued càdlàg functions endowed with the Skorokhod topology. We discuss applications of the FCLT in percolation theory and in modelling the spread of computer viruses. We also provide simulation results illustrating the FCLT for some common degree distributions.},

  abstract     = {Motivated by recent studies of big samples, this work aims to construct a parametric model which is characterized by the following features: (i) a ‘local’ reinforcement, i.e. a reinforcement mechanism mainly based on the last observations, (ii) a random persistent fluctuation of the predictive mean, and (iii) a long-term almost sure convergence of the empirical mean to a deterministic limit, together with a chi-squared goodness-of-fit result for the limit probabilities. This triple purpose is achieved by the introduction of a new variant of the Eggenberger–Pólya urn, which we call the rescaled Pólya urn. We provide a complete asymptotic characterization of this model, pointing out that, for a certain choice of the parameters, it has properties different from the ones typically exhibited by the other urn models in the literature. Therefore, beyond the possible statistical application, this work could be interesting for those who are concerned with stochastic processes with reinforcement.},

A classical directed preferential attachment (PA) model generates in- and out-degree distributions with power-law tails, but the theoretical properties of the reciprocity feature in this model have not yet been studied. We derive asymptotic results on the number of reciprocal edges between two fixed nodes, as well as the proportion of reciprocal edges in the entire PA network. We see that with certain choices of parameters, the proportion of reciprocal edges in a directed PA network is close to 0, which differs from the empirical observation. This points out one potential problem of fitting a classical PA model to a given network dataset with high reciprocity, and indicates that alternative models need to be considered.},

  abstract     = {The study of multivariate extremes is dominated by multivariate regular variation, although it is well known that this approach does not provide adequate distinction between random vectors whose components are not always simultaneously large. Various alternative dependence measures and representations have been proposed, with the most well-known being hidden regular variation and the conditional extreme value model. These varying depictions of extremal dependence arise through consideration of different parts of the multivariate domain, and particularly through exploring what happens when extremes of one variable may grow at different rates from other variables. Thus far, these alternative representations have come from distinct sources, and links between them are limited. In this work we elucidate many of the relevant connections through a geometrical approach. In particular, the shape of the limit set of scaled sample clouds in light-tailed margins is shown to provide a description of several different extremal dependence representations.},

A numerical comparison of our new approach with the MLPF, on a single processor, shows that similar errors are possible for a mild increase in computational cost.

We characterize when such a game admits Nash equilibria and prove that when a Nash equilibrium exists, it is unique and consists of pure strategies that are proportional in the same proportions as the total intensities.

OfLm can be divided into two types, namely, moving average (maofLm) and real harmonizable (rhofLm), both of which share the covariance structure of ofBm under assumptions. We show that maofLm and rhofLm admit stochastic integral representations in the time and Fourier domains, and establish their distinct small- and large-scale limiting behavior. We also characterize time-reversibility for ofLm through parametric conditions related to its Lévy measure. In particular, we show that, under non-Gaussianity, the parametric conditions for time-reversibility are generally more restrictive than those for the Gaussian case (ofBm).},

  abstract     = {This paper studies a composite problem involving decision-making about the optimal entry time and dynamic consumption afterwards. In Stage 1, the investor has access to full market information subject to some information costs and needs to choose an optimal stopping time to initiate Stage 2; in Stage 2, the investor terminates the costly full information acquisition and starts dynamic investment and consumption under partial observation of free public stock prices. Habit formation preferences are employed, in which past consumption affects the investor’s current decisions. Using the stochastic Perron method, the value function of the composite problem is proved to be the unique viscosity solution of some variational inequalities.},

This leads to a new type of time-inconsistent stochastic impulse control problem. First, the optimal solution in the precommitment sense is derived. Second, the problem is formulated as an intrapersonal sequential dynamic game in line with Strotz’s consistent planning. In particular, the notions of pure dividend strategies and a (strong) subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium are adapted. An equilibrium is derived using a smooth fit condition. The equilibrium is shown to be strong. The uncontrolled state process is a fairly general diffusion.},

For example, a person spreads a contagious disease only as long as they are contagious. In this paper, we define a novel generalization of the Hawkes process that we call the ; . In this new stochastic process, the excitement from one arrival lasts for a randomly drawn activity duration, hence the ephemerality. Our study includes exploration of the process itself as well as connections to well-known stochastic models such as branching processes, random walks, epidemics, preferential attachment, and Bayesian mixture models. Furthermore, we prove a batch scaling construction of general, marked Hawkes processes from a general ephemerally self-exciting model, and this novel limit theorem both provides insight into the Hawkes process and motivates the model contained herein as an attractive self-exciting process in its own right.},

The weak convergence of fitness distributions to the globally stable equilibrium is proved. Condensation occurs when almost surely a positive proportion of the population travels to and condenses at the largest fitness value. Condensation may occur when selection is favoured over mutation. A criterion for the occurrence of condensation is given.},

In particular, we show that there is a nontrivial critical value of the data rate below which the chain is ergodic and converges to a stationary distribution and above which it is non-ergodic, i.e., the queues at the nodes grow in an unbounded manner.

Unlike in earlier works, in the present paper the transmitted signal powers of the devices of the network are assumed random, independent and identically distributed, and possibly unbounded. Additionally, we assume that the devices form a stationary Cox point process, i.e., a Poisson point process with stationary random intensity measure, in two or more dimensions. We present the following main results. First, under suitable moment conditions on the signal powers and the intensity measure, there is percolation in the SINR graph given that the device density is high and interferences are sufficiently reduced, but not vanishing. Second, if the interference cancellation factor ; and the SINR threshold ; satisfy ; , then there is no percolation for any intensity parameter. Third, in the case of a Poisson point process with constant powers, for any intensity parameter that is supercritical for the underlying Gilbert graph, the SINR graph also percolates with some small but positive interference cancellation factor.},

Refinements of the true partition always decrease the code part corresponding to the edge placement, and thus a respective increase of the code part specifying the model should overweight that gain in order to yield a minimum at the true partition. The balance between these effects turns out to be delicate. We show that the MDL principle identifies the true partition among models whose relative block sizes are bounded away from zero.

  abstract     = {We consider a collection of Markov chains that model the evolution of multitype biological populations. The state space of the chains is the positive orthant, and the boundary of the orthant is the absorbing state for the Markov chain and represents the extinction states of different population types. We are interested in the long-term behavior of the Markov chain away from extinction, under a small noise scaling. Under this scaling, the trajectory of the Markov process over any compact interval converges in distribution to the solution of an ordinary differential equation (ODE) evolving in the positive orthant. We study the asymptotic behavior of the quasi-stationary distributions (QSD) in this scaling regime. Our main result shows that, under conditions, the limit points of the QSD are supported on the union of interior attractors of the flow determined by the ODE. We also give lower bounds on expected extinction times which scale exponentially with the system size. Results of this type when the deterministic dynamical system obtained under the scaling limit is given by a discrete-time evolution equation and the dynamics are essentially in a compact space (namely, the one-step map is a bounded function) have been studied by Faure and Schreiber (2014). Our results extend these to a setting of an unbounded state space and continuous-time dynamics. The proofs rely on uniform large deviation results for small noise stochastic dynamical systems and methods from the theory of continuous-time dynamical systems.; In general, QSD for Markov chains with absorbing states and unbounded state spaces may not exist. We study one basic family of binomial-Poisson models in the positive orthant where one can use Lyapunov function methods to establish existence of QSD and also to argue the tightness of the QSD of the scaled sequence of Markov chains. The results from the first part are then used to characterize the support of limit points of this sequence of QSD.},
