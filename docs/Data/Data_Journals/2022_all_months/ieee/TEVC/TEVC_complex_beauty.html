  abstract     = {Recently, large-scale multiobjective optimization has received increasing attention from the evolutionary multiobjective optimization (EMO) community. This has led to the emergence of a specialized research area called evolutionary large-scale multiobjective optimization (ELMO). In general, it is believed that multiobjective optimization problems become more difficult as the number of decision variables increases. However, the following two counterintuitive observations are obtained from careful examinations of recent ELMO studies. One is that experimental results on some large-scale multiobjective test problems were improved by increasing the number of decision variables. The other is that better results were obtained for some other large-scale multiobjective test problems by conventional EMO algorithms (EMOAs) than state-of-the-art ELMO algorithms (ELMOAs). These observations suggest that ELMOAs have not always been evaluated on appropriate test problems. Moreover, their performance is not always better than the performance of conventional EMOAs. In this letter, we first re-examine the performance of ELMOAs and conventional EMOAs on a wide variety of scalable multiobjective test problems. Then, counterintuitive experimental results are analyzed using the anytime performance evaluation scheme and distributions of randomly generated initial solutions. Based on the analysis, suggestions on how to handle large-scale multiobjective test problems with counterintuitive results are proposed.},

  abstract     = {Genetic programming (GP) is a common method for performing symbolic regression that relies on the use of ephemeral random constants in order to adequately scale predictions. Suitable values for these constants must be drawn from appropriate, but typically unknown, distributions for the problem being modeled. While rarely used with GP, $Z$ -score standardization of feature and response spaces often significantly improves the predictive performance of GP by removing scale issues and reducing error due to bias. However, in some cases it is also associated with erratic error due to variance. This article demonstrates that this variance component increases in the presence of gaps at the boundaries of the training data explanatory variable intervals. An initial solution to this problem is proposed that augments training data with pseudo instances located at the boundaries of the intervals. When applied to benchmark problems, particularly with small training samples, this solution reduces error due to variance and, therefore, total error. Augmentation is shown to also stabilize error in larger problems; however, results suggest that standardized GP works well on such problems with little need for training data augmentation.},

This manuscript presents a multiple classifiers-assisted evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition, which is adapted for high-dimensional expensive problems in terms of the following two insights. Compared to approximation-based surrogates, the accuracy of classification-based surrogates is robust for few high-dimensional training samples. Furthermore, multiple local classifiers can hedge the risk of overfitting issues. Accordingly, the proposed algorithm builds multiple classifiers with support vector machines (SVMs) on a decomposition-based multiobjective algorithm, wherein each local classifier is trained for a corresponding scalarization function. Experimental results confirm that the proposed algorithm is competitive to the state-of-the-art algorithms and computationally efficient as well.},

However, most of existing evolutionary algorithms focus on searching a globally optimal band subset under a fixed size, and their obtained band subsets may still contain a large number of redundant bands. In order to simultaneously obtain multiple optimal band subsets with different sizes, this article proposes an unsupervised multitask artificial bee colony (ABC) BS algorithm based on variable-size clustering (MBBS-VC). First, a variable-size band clustering method based on worst class decomposition is developed, based on which the BS problem can be modeled as a multitask optimization problem. Next, a multitask multimicrogroup bee colony algorithm with variable coding length is proposed to simultaneously search multiple optimal band subsets with different sizes. Moreover, several new strategies, including the intergroup collaboration strategy based on bidirectional neighborhood learning and the multimeasure integration judgment (MIJ) mechanism, are designed to improve the performance of MBBS-VC. In this article, the hyperspectral BS problem is transformed into a multitask optimization problem for the first time. Finally, compared with 15 classical BS algorithms on several commonly used datasets, experimental results verify the superiority of the proposed BS algorithm.},

In this article, a cooperative coevolution (CC) with knowledge-based variable decomposition, called bilevel multiobjective CC (BLMOCC), is proposed for BLMOPs. In BLMOCC, the variable interactions are represented by an interaction matrix. The perturbation-based variable decomposition combined with the matrix completion approach has been designed for dynamically discovering the correlation among the bilevel variables, based on which the variables are divided into different groups. To further handle possible weak correlations among various groups of variables, a CC has been adopted for optimizing them in a collaborative way. In experimental studies, BLMOCC is compared with a nested method (NS) and a state-of-the-art algorithm (H-BLEMO) on a set of benchmark problems. The effects of each component in BLMOCC have also been verified by comparing it with its three variants. The experimental results demonstrate that BLMOCC has the best performance among all the compared algorithms. In addition, BLMOCC has also been applied to a real-world management decision-making problem, which further validates its efficiency and effectiveness.},

In robotics, such algorithms can be used for generating a collection of controllers covering most of the possible behaviors of a robot. To do so, these algorithms associate a behavioral descriptor (BD) to each of these behaviors. Each BD is used for estimating the novelty of one behavior compared to the others. In most existing algorithms, the BD needs to be hand-coded, thus requiring prior knowledge about the task to solve. In this article, we introduce: autonomous robots realizing their abilities, an algorithm that uses a dimensionality reduction technique to automatically learn BDs based on raw sensory data. The performance of this algorithm is assessed on three robotic tasks in simulation. The experimental results show that it performs similar to traditional hand-coded approaches without the requirement to provide any hand-coded BD. In the collection of diverse and high-performing solutions, it also manages to find behaviors that are novel with respect to more features than its hand-coded baselines. Finally, we introduce a variant of the algorithm which is robust to the dimensionality of the BD space.},

More precisely, we compare previously obtained results from a grid search with those obtained from three automated configuration techniques: 1) iterated racing; 2) mixed-integer parallel-efficient global optimization (MIP-EGO); and 3) mixed-integer evolutionary strategies. Using two different cost metrics: 1) expected running time (ERT) and 2) the area under the empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) curve, we find that in several cases the best configurations with respect to ERT are obtained when using the area under the ECDF curve as the cost metric during the configuration process. Our results suggest that even when interested in ERT performance, it might be preferable to use anytime performance measures for the configuration task. We also observe that tuning for ERT is much more sensitive with respect to the budget that is allocated to the target algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) is one of the most popular techniques for cancer treatment. However, existing IMRT planning methods can only generate one solution at a time and, consequently, medical physicists should perform the planning process many times to obtain diverse solutions to meet the requirement of a clinical case. Meanwhile, multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) have not been fully exploited in IMRT planning since they are ineffective in optimizing the large number of discrete variables of IMRT. To bridge the gap, this article formulates IMRT planning into a large-scale combinatorial many-objective optimization problem and proposes a coevolutionary algorithm to solve it. In contrast to the existing MOEAs handling high-dimensional search spaces via variable grouping or dimensionality reduction, the proposed algorithm evolves one population with fine encoding for local exploitation and evolves another population with rough encoding for global exploration. Moreover, the convergence speed is further accelerated by two customized local search strategies. The experimental results verify that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art MOEAs and IMRT planning methods on a variety of clinical cases.},

Using multi- and many-objective problems from the DTLZ and WFG benchmark test suites, we analyze how Landmark MDS visualizations can offer far greater insight into algorithm performance than using traditional algorithm performance metrics such as hypervolume alone, and can be used to complement explicit performance metrics. Ultimately, this visualization allows the visual identification of problem features and assists the decision maker in making intuitive recommendations for algorithm parameters/operators for creating and testing better EAs to solve multi- and many-objective problems.},

However, few studies considered dynamic changes during the vehicles’ service, which can cause the original schedule infeasible or obsolete. The few existing studies are limited by the dynamic scenarios considered, and by overly complicated algorithms that are unable to benefit from the wealth of contributions provided by the existing CARP literature. In this article, we first provide a mathematical formulation of dynamic CARP (DCARP) and design a simulation system that is able to consider dynamic events while a routing solution is already partially executed. We then propose a novel framework which can benefit from the existing static CARP optimization algorithms so that they could be used to handle DCARP instances. The framework is very flexible. In response to a dynamic event, it can use either a simple restart strategy or a sequence transfer strategy that benefits from the past optimization experience. Empirical studies have been conducted on a wide range of DCARP instances to evaluate our proposed framework. The results show that the proposed framework significantly improves over state-of-the-art dynamic optimization algorithms.},

Among different classes of NAS methods, evolutionary computation-based NAS (ENAS) methods have recently gained much attention. Unfortunately, the development of ENAS is hindered by unfair comparison between different ENAS algorithms due to different training conditions and high computational cost caused by expensive performance evaluation. This article develops a platform named BenchENAS, in short for benchmarking evolutionary NAS, to address these issues. BenchENAS makes it easy to achieve fair comparisons between different algorithms by keeping them under the same settings. To accelerate the performance evaluation in a common lab environment, BenchENAS designs a novel and generic efficient evaluation method for the population characteristics of evolutionary computation. This method has greatly improved the efficiency of the evaluation. Furthermore, BenchENAS is easy to install and highly configurable and modular, which brings benefits in good usability and easy extensibility. This article conducts efficient comparison experiments on eight ENAS algorithms with high GPU utilization on this platform. The experiments validate that the fair comparison issue does exist in the current ENAS algorithms, and BenchENAS can alleviate this issue.

However, a strong hypothesis underlying their performance is that MOEAs are able to find a representative solution set to cover the entire Pareto-optimal front (PF) and decision makers are able to conveniently and precisely articulate their preference, which is not always easy to fulfill in practice. Accordingly, it is suggested that representative solutions in the naturally interesting regions of the PF rather than the whole PF should be targeted. A large body of research has been proposed to search or identify the knees or knee regions over the past decades. Therefore, this article aims to provide a comprehensive survey of the research on knee-oriented optimization. We start with a discussion of the importance and basic concepts of the knees, followed by a summary of knee-oriented benchmarks and indicators. After that, knee-oriented frameworks and techniques, and real-world applications are presented. Finally, potential challenges are pointed out and a few promising future lines of research are suggested.

  abstract     = {The divide-and-conquer strategy has been widely used in cooperative co-evolutionary algorithms to deal with large-scale global optimization problems, where a target problem is decomposed into a set of lower-dimensional and tractable subproblems to reduce the problem complexity. However, such a strategy usually demands a large number of function evaluations to obtain an accurate variable grouping. To address this issue, a merged differential grouping (MDG) method is proposed in this article based on the subset–subset interaction and binary search. In the proposed method, each variable is first identified as either a separable variable or a nonseparable variable. Afterward, all separable variables are put into the same subset, and the nonseparable variables are divided into multiple subsets using a binary-tree-based iterative merging method. With the proposed algorithm, the computational complexity of interaction detection is reduced to $O(\max {n,n_{ns}\times \log _{2} k})$ , where $n$ , $n_{ns}(\leq n)$ , and $k( &amp;lt; n)$ indicate the numbers of decision variables, nonseparable variables, and subsets of nonseparable variables, respectively. The experimental results on benchmark problems show that MDG is very competitive with the other state-of-the-art methods in terms of efficiency and accuracy of problem decomposition.},

  abstract     = {Evolutionary sequential transfer optimization is a paradigm that leverages search experience from solved source optimization tasks to accelerate the evolutionary search of a target task. Even though many algorithms have been developed, they mainly focus on objective-homogeneous problems, where the source and target tasks possess a similar number of objectives. In this work, we explore objective-heterogeneous problems, in which knowledge transfers across single-objective optimization problems (SOPs), multiobjective optimization problems (MOPs), and many-objective optimization problems (MaOPs). Objective-heterogeneous problems challenge the existing methods due to the diverse search and objective spaces between the source and the target task. To address this issue, we present a decision variable analysis-based transfer method that can conduct knowledge transfer across problems with the different numbers of objectives. We first separate decision variables of MOPs and MaOPs into convergence-related variables (CVs) and diversity-related variables (DVs), according to their roles while treating variables of SOPs as CVs. Then, we propose a convergence transfer module to transfer knowledge of CVs to speed up the convergence. It aligns both solutions and fitness ranks for preserving fitness rank consistency between the source and target tasks, whereby accelerating search speed. Besides, a diversity transfer module is presented to refine the distribution of DVs to maintain the population diversity. The experimental results on objective-heterogeneous test problems and a real-world case study have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Knee points, characterized as a small improvement on one objective can lead to a significant degradation on at least one of the other objectives, are attractive to decision makers (DMs) in multicriterion decision making. This article presents a simple and effective knee point identification (KPI) method to help DMs identify solution(s) of interest from a given set of tradeoff solutions thus facilitating posterior decision making. Our basic idea is to sequentially validate whether a solution is a knee point or not by comparing its localized tradeoff utility with others within its neighborhood characterized from a decomposition perspective. In particular, a solution is a knee point if and only if it has the best-localized tradeoff utility among its neighbors. We implement a GPU version that carries out the KPI in a parallel manner. This GPU version reduces the worst-case complexity from quadratic to linear. The performance of our proposed method is compared with five state-of-the-art KPI methods on 134 test problem instances and two real-world engineering design problems. Empirical results demonstrate its outstanding performance especially on problems with many local knee points. We further validate the usefulness of our proposed method for guiding evolutionary multiobjective optimization algorithms to search for knee points on the fly during the evolutionary process.},

  abstract     = {The blossoming of electric vehicles gives rise to a new vehicle routing problem (VRP) called capacitated electric VRP. Since charging is not as convenient as refueling, both the service of customers and the recharging of vehicles should be considered. In this article, we propose a confidence-based bilevel ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm to solve the problem. It divides the whole problem into the upper level subproblem capacitated VRP and the lower level subproblem fixed routing vehicle charging problem. For the upper level subproblem, an ACO algorithm is used to generate customer service sequence. Both the direct encoding scheme and the order-first split-second encoding scheme are implemented to make a guideline of their applicable scenes. For the lower level subproblem, a new heuristic called simple enumeration is proposed to generate recharging schedules for vehicles. Between the two subproblems, a confidence-based selection method is proposed to select promising customer service sequence to conduct local search and lower level optimization. By setting adaptive confidence thresholds, the inferior service sequences that have little chance to become the iteration best are eliminated during the execution. The experiments show that the proposed algorithm has reached the state-of-the-art level and updated eight best known solutions of the benchmark.},

Most benchmarks are performance based, to test algorithm performance under a wide set of conditions. There is also resource- and behavior-based benchmarks to test the resource consumption and the behavior of algorithms. In this article, we propose a novel behavior-based benchmark toolbox: BIAS (Bias in algorithms, structural). This toolbox can detect structural bias (SB) per dimension and across dimension-based on 39 statistical tests. Moreover, it predicts the type of SB using a random forest model. BIAS can be used to better understand and improve existing algorithms (removing bias) as well as to test novel algorithms for SB in an early phase of development. Experiments with a large set of generated SB scenarios show that BIAS was successful in identifying bias. In addition, we also provide the results of BIAS on 432 existing state-of-the-art optimization algorithms showing that different kinds of SB are present in these algorithms, mostly toward the center of the objective space or showing discretization behavior. The proposed toolbox is made available open-source and recommendations are provided for the sample size and hyper-parameters to be used when applying the toolbox on other algorithms.},

The framework establishes a relationship between estimated costs of parallel function evaluations (on real-world problems) to known sets of test functions. Such real-world problems are not always readily available (e.g., confidentiality and proprietary software). Therefore, new test problems are created by Gaussian process simulation. The proposed framework is applied in an extensive benchmark study to compare multiple state-of-the-art parallel optimizers with a novel model-based algorithm, which combines ideas of an explorative search for global model quality with parallel local searches to increase function exploitation. The benchmarking framework is used to configure good batch size setups for parallel algorithms systematically based on landscape properties. Furthermore, we introduce a proof of concept for a novel automatic batch size configuration. The predictive quality of the batch size configuration is evaluated on a large set of test functions and the functions generated by Gaussian process simulation. The introduced algorithm outperforms multiple state-of-the-art optimizers, especially on multimodal problems. Additionally, it proves to be particularly robust over various problem landscapes, and performs well with all tested batch sizes. Consequently, this makes it well suited for black-box kinds of problems.},

Simultaneously, meta-algorithmic techniques, such as automated algorithm selection and configuration, enable performance improvements by utilizing the complementary strengths of different algorithms or configurable algorithm components. In fact, meta-algorithms have become major drivers in advancing the state of the art in solving many prominent computational problems. However, meta-algorithmic techniques are complex and difficult to use correctly, while their incorrect use may reduce their efficiency, or in extreme cases, even lead to performance losses. Here, we introduce the Sparkle platform, which aims to make meta-algorithmic techniques more accessible to nonexpert users, and to make these techniques more broadly available in the context of competitions, to further enable the assessment and advancement of the true state of the art in solving challenging computational problems. To achieve this, Sparkle implements standard protocols for algorithm selection and configuration that support easy and correct use of these techniques. Following an experiment, Sparkle generates a report containing results, problem instances, algorithms, and other relevant information, for convenient use in scientific publications.},

  abstract     = {Automated hyperparameter optimization (HPO) has gained great popularity and is an important component of most automated machine learning frameworks. However, the process of designing HPO algorithms is still an unsystematic and manual process: new algorithms are often built on top of prior work, where limitations are identified and improvements are proposed. Even though this approach is guided by expert knowledge, it is still somewhat arbitrary. The process rarely allows for gaining a holistic understanding of which algorithmic components drive performance and carries the risk of overlooking good algorithmic design choices. We present a principled approach to automated benchmark-driven algorithm design applied to multifidelity HPO (MF-HPO). First, we formalize a rich space of MF-HPO candidates that includes, but is not limited to, common existing HPO algorithms and then present a configurable framework covering this space. To find the best candidate automatically and systematically, we follow a programming-by-optimization approach and search over the space of algorithm candidates via Bayesian optimization. We challenge whether the found design choices are necessary or could be replaced by more naive and simpler ones by performing an ablation analysis. We observe that using a relatively simple configuration (in some ways, simpler than established methods) performs very well as long as some critical configuration parameters are set to the right value.},

Feature-based algorithm selection has recently received attention in the research field of black-box numerical optimization. However, there is still room for the analysis of algorithm selection for black-box optimization. Most previous studies have focused only on whether an algorithm selection system can outperform the single-best solver (SBS) in a portfolio. In addition, a benchmarking methodology for algorithm selection systems has not been well investigated in the literature. In this context, this article analyzes algorithm selection systems on the 24 noiseless black-box optimization benchmarking functions. First, we demonstrate that the first successful performance measure is more reliable than the expected runtime measure for benchmarking algorithm selection systems. Then, we examine the influence of randomness on the performance of algorithm selection systems. We also show that the performance of algorithm selection systems can be significantly improved by using sequential least squares programming as a presolver. We point out that the difficulty of outperforming the SBS depends on algorithm portfolios, cross-validation methods, and dimensions. Finally, we demonstrate that the effectiveness of algorithm portfolios depends on various factors. These findings provide fundamental insights for algorithm selection for black-box optimization.},

Starting from the graph that depicts the solution quality versus runtime, we argue that runtime is the only performance measure with a generic, meaningful, and quantitative interpretation. Hence, our assessment is solely based on runtime measurements. We discuss proper choices for solution quality indicators in single- and multi-objective optimization, as well as in the presence of noise and constraints. We also discuss the choice of the target values, budget-based targets, and the aggregation of runtimes by using simulated restarts, averages, and empirical cumulative distributions which generalize convergence graphs of single runs.

In this work, we delve deep into the Bayesian statistical assessment of experimental results by proposing a framework for the analysis of several algorithms on several problems/instances. To this end, experimental results are transformed to their corresponding rankings of algorithms, assuming that these rankings have been generated by a probability distribution (defined on permutation spaces). From the set of rankings, we estimate the posterior distribution of the parameters of the studied probability models, and several inferences concerning the analysis of the results are examined. Particularly, we study questions related to the probability of having one algorithm in the first position of the ranking or the probability that two algorithms are in the same relative position in the ranking. Not limited to that, the assumptions, strengths, and weaknesses of the models in each case are studied.

  abstract     = {The role of carefully constructed benchmark suites in algorithm design and testing is critical. Within the continuous multiobjective optimization domain, existing suites include the general purpose ZDT, DTLZ, and WFG suites, and more recent ones specifically designed to explore the impacts of a particular problem characteristic. However, the relationship between existing suites is not clear, and the field would benefit from a “stock-take” assessment. This article investigates the coverage of current continuous multiobjective suites using the instance space analysis (ISA) methodology. Exploratory landscape analysis is used to measure critical features of each problem suite. Thereafter, we generate a 2-D visualization of the existing problem instances by locating them in the instance space, assessing their diversity, and identifying whether there are sparse areas of value to fill with new problem instances. Our findings show that the current suites are restricted in diversity when representing the entire problem instance space. We propose and evaluate three problem construction methods: 1) problem tuning; 2) toolkit hybridization; and 3) new function injection. Problem tuning is shown to generate problems surrounding existing instances, while hybridization creates problems falling between existing suites. Furthermore, utilizing the insights afforded by ISA, we show how problem features can be identified to inform the creation of new functions which fill gaps toward the boundaries of the instance space.},

In this article, we propose an experimental protocol for the comparison of fully automatic design methods. This protocol is characterized by two notable elements: 1) a way to define benchmarks for the evaluation and comparison of design methods and 2) a sampling strategy that minimizes the variance when estimating their expected performance. To define generally applicable benchmarks, we introduce the notion of mission generator: a tool to generate missions that mimic those a design method will eventually have to solve. To minimize the variance of the performance estimation, we show that, under some common assumptions, one should adopt the sampling strategy that maximizes the number of missions considered—a formal proof is provided as the supplementary material. We illustrate the experimental protocol by comparing the performance of two offline fully automatic design methods that were presented in previous publications.},

We, therefore, introduce the OSU-Honda Automobile Hood Dataset (CarHoods10k), an industry-grade 3-D vehicle hood data set of over 10 000 shapes along with mechanical performance data that were validated against real-world hood designs by industry experts. CarHoods10k offers researchers and practitioners the unique opportunity to develop novel methods on realistic data with relevance to real-world vehicle design. To illustrate central use cases, we first apply methods from geometric deep learning to learn a compact latent representation for design space exploration. Second, we use machine learning models to predict mechanical hood performance from the learned latent representation. We thus demonstrate the effectiveness of machine learning for building metamodels, which are used in design optimization whenever possible to replace costly engineering simulations. Third, we integrate CarHoods10k in a topology optimization approach based on evolutionary algorithms to demonstrate its capability to search for high-performing structures, while maintaining manufacturability constraints.},

Consequently, there is no consensus regarding the best practice for rigorous benchmarking, and whether this is possible at all outside the context of a given application. Here, we argue that synthetic datasets must continue to play an important role in the evaluation of clustering algorithms, but that this necessitates constructing benchmarks that appropriately cover the diverse set of properties that impact clustering algorithm performance. Through our framework, HAWKS, we demonstrate the important role evolutionary algorithms play to support flexible generation of such benchmarks, allowing simple modification and extension. We illustrate two possible uses of our framework: 1) the evolution of benchmark data consistent with a set of hand-derived properties and 2) the generation of datasets that tease out performance differences between a given pair of algorithms. Our work has implications for the design of clustering benchmarks that sufficiently challenge a broad range of algorithms, and for furthering insight into the strengths and weaknesses of specific approaches.},

We propose a new method for this estimation based on a recently developed efficiency-improved genetic algorithm. We demonstrate that it delivers an excellent balance between improved data quality and computational efficiency. We also introduce a “spatial consistency” feature to further speed up the algorithm by using available nonlinear-beamforming operators as initial trial solutions for the neighboring data ensembles.

In this article, we propose probabilistic selection approaches that utilize the uncertainty information of the Kriging models (as surrogates) to improve the solution process in offline data-driven multiobjective optimization. These approaches are designed for decomposition-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithms and can, thus, handle a large number of objectives.

To illuminate the elite solutions for a space of behaviors, QD algorithms require the definition of a suitable behavior space. If the behavior space is high-dimensional, a suitable dimensionality reduction technique is required to maintain a limited number of behavioral niches. While current methodologies for automated behavior spaces focus on changing the geometry of the behavior space or on unsupervised learning of its key features, there remains a need for customizing behavioral diversity to a particular meta-objective specified by the end user. In the newly emerging framework of QD Meta-Evolution, or QD-Meta for short, one evolves a population of QD algorithms, each with different algorithmic and representational characteristics, to optimize the algorithms and their resulting archives to a user-defined meta-objective. Despite promising results compared to traditional QD algorithms, QD-Meta has yet to be compared to state-of-the-art behavior space automation methods, such as centroidal voronoi tessellations multidimensional archive of phenotypic elites (CVT-MAP-Elites) and autonomous robots realizing their abilities (AURORAs). This article performs an empirical study of QD-Meta on function optimization and multilegged robot locomotion benchmarks. Results demonstrate that QD-Meta archives provide improved average performance and faster adaptation to a priori unknown changes to the environment when compared to CVT-MAP-Elites and AURORA. A qualitative analysis shows how the resulting archives are tailored to the meta-objectives provided by the end user.},

  abstract     = {Expensive multiobjective optimization problems pose great challenges to evolutionary algorithms due to their costly evaluation. Building cheap surrogate models to replace the expensive real models has been proved to be a practical way to reduce the number of costly evaluations. Supervised learning techniques from the community of machine learning have been widely applied to build either regressors, which approximate the fitness values of candidate solutions, or classifiers, which estimate the categories of candidate solutions. Considering the characteristics of the data produced in optimization, this article proposes a new surrogate model, called a relation model, for evolutionary multiobjective optimization. Instead of estimating the qualities of candidate solutions directly, the relation model tries to estimate the relationship between a pair of solutions $\langle \mathbf {x}, \mathbf {y}\rangle $ , i.e., $\mathbf {x}$ dominates $\mathbf {y}$ , $\mathbf {x}$ is dominated by $\mathbf {y}$ , or $\mathbf {x}$ is nondominated with $\mathbf {y}$ in the case of multiobjective optimization. To implement this idea, first a balanced training set is prepared, then a classifier is built based on the training data set to learn the relationship, and finally, the classifier with a voting-scoring strategy is applied to estimate the relationship between the candidate solutions and parent solutions. By this way, the promising candidate solutions are recognized and evaluated by the real models. The new approach is applied to three well-known benchmark suites and two real-world applications, and the experimental results suggest that the proposed method outperforms some state-of-the-art methods based on regression and classification models on the given instances.},

These mechanisms are associated with different stages of the EDA, including seeding, learning, and mapping. It is shown that, besides increasing the quality of the solutions in terms of objective values, the feasibility of the final solutions is guaranteed if an initial population of feasible solutions is seeded to the algorithm. The EDA with the proposed mechanisms is applied to two suites of benchmark problems for constrained continuous optimization and its performance is compared with some state-of-the-art algorithms and constraint-handling methods.

To address the issue, this article proposes a novel method, called DD-CMOEA, which features dual stages (i.e., exploration and exploitation) and dual populations. Specifically, the two populations, called mainPop and auxPop, first individually evolve with and without considering the constraints, responsible for exploring feasible and infeasible solutions, respectively. Then, in the exploitation stage, mainPop provides information about the location of feasible regions, which facilitates auxPop to find and exploit surrounding infeasible solutions. The promising infeasible solutions obtained by auxPop in turn help mainPop converge better toward the Pareto-optimal front. Extensive experiments on three well-known test suites and a real-world case study fully demonstrate that DD-CMOEA is more competitive than five state-of-the-art CMOEAs.},

This similarity may facilitate the transfer of functional knowledge between model species and human. Multiple network alignment is the process of uncovering the connection similarity between three or more networks simultaneously. Existing algorithms for multiple network alignment rely on sequence similarities to help drive the alignments, and no comprehensive study has been done to determine the most effective ways to utilize network connectivity—network topology—to drive multiple network alignment. Here, we devise and empirically test the efficacy of several measures of topological similarity between three or more networks. To evolve the alignments toward optimal, we use simulated annealing as the search algorithm since it is agnostic to the objective being optimized. We test the measures both on the partially synthetic and highly similar PPI networks from the integrated interaction database, as well as on real PPI networks from a recent BioGRID release.},

To fill this research gap, this article proposes a clustering-based transfer (CBT) learning method to solve DMOPs. When the environment changes, two novel operations (clustering-based selection (CBS) and CBT) are used to guide knowledge transfer. Specifically, CBS aims to find a population with nondominated solutions and dominated solutions as the training data for the new environment. Then, CBT further collects the previous Pareto-optimal solutions and some noise solutions as the training data for the previous environment. Two training data sets from different environments are, respectively, divided into multiple clusters and transfer learning is conducted on two similar clusters with high probability to reduce the negative effect, which can train an accurate prediction model to identify the promising solutions for the new environment. Empirical studies have been conducted on 14 benchmark DMOPs and one real-life path planning problem of unmanned air/ground vehicles, which validate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Especially, our method can significantly reduce negative transfer on 12 out of 14 cases when compared with direct transfer learning.},

  abstract     = {Various evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have been proposed to address feature selection (FS) problems, in which a large number of fitness evaluations are needed. With the rapid growth of data scales, the fitness evaluation becomes time consuming, which makes FS problems expensive optimization problems. Surrogate-assisted EAs (SAEAs) have been widely used to solve expensive optimization problems. However, the SAEAs still face difficulties in solving expensive FS problems due to their high-dimensional discrete decision variables. To address this issue, we propose an SAEA with parallel random grouping for expensive FS problems, in which three main components consist. First, a constraint-based sampling strategy is proposed, which considers the influence of the constraint boundary and the number of selected features. Second, a high-dimensional FS problem is randomly divided into several low-dimensional subproblems. Surrogate models are then constructed in these low-dimensional decision spaces. After that, all the subproblems are optimized in parallel. The process of random grouping and parallel optimization continues until the termination condition is met. Finally, a final solution is chosen from the best solution in the historical search and the best solution in the last population using a random, distance-, or voting-based method. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm generally outperforms traditional, ensemble, and evolutionary FS methods on 14 datasets with up to 10 000 features, especially when the required number of real fitness evaluations is limited.},

  abstract     = {Neural architecture search (NAS) provides an automatic solution in designing network architectures. Unfortunately, the direct search for complete task-dependent network architectures is laborious since training and evaluating complete neural architectures over a large search space are computationally prohibitive. Recently, one-shot NAS (OSNAS) has attracted great attention in the NAS community because it significantly speeds up the candidate architecture evaluation procedure through weight sharing. However, the full weight sharing training paradigm in OSNAS may result in strong interference across candidate architectures and mislead the architecture search. To alleviate the problem, we propose a partial weight sharing OSNAS framework that directly evolves complete neural network architectures. In particular, we suggest a novel node representation scheme that randomly activates a subset of nodes of the one-shot model in each generation to reduce the weight coupling in the one-shot model. During the evolutionary search, a tailored crossover operator randomly samples the nodes from two parent individuals or a single parent to construct new candidate architectures, thus effectively constraining the degree of weight sharing. Furthermore, we introduce a new mutation operator that replaces the chosen nodes of the one-shot model with randomly generated nodes to enhance the exploratory capability. Finally, we encode a set of pyramidal convolution operations in the search space, enabling the evolved neural networks to capture different levels of details in the images. The proposed method is examined and compared with 26 state-of-the-art algorithms on ten image classification tasks, including CIFAR series, CINIC10, ImageNet, and MedMNIST series. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can computationally much more efficiently find neural architectures that achieve comparable classification accuracy to the state-of-the-art designs.},

  abstract     = {Multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (EAs) based on decomposition are becoming successful and popular. Particularly, a conical area EA (CAEA) was developed to heighten the convergence and population diversity of decomposition-based algorithms for bi-objective optimization by employing a cone decomposition approach. The global Pareto optimality of cone decomposition was proved. It means that the optimum of every conical subproblem of the cone decomposition approach is Pareto optimal in the entire bi-objective space in the presence of a continuous frontier segment within its associated subregion. In this article, based on the global Pareto optimality, we further reveal that the cone decomposition approach also has a desired ability of $\mu $ -distribution convergence for bi-objective optimization. We first prove by the monotonicity and additivity of the Lebesgue measure and the squeeze theorem for limits that the hypervolume of the optimal solutions of all $\mu $ subproblems of the cone decomposition approach is infinitely close to that of the optimal $\mu $ -distribution for large enough $\mu $ in the presence of a continuous frontier. Meanwhile, the original CAEA is further improved to better approximate the optimal solutions of conical subproblems. The experimental results on bi-objective benchmark problems show that the improved CAEA achieves higher qualities of frontiers and better $\mu $ -distribution convergence in the terms of hypervolume error compared with six other popular multiobjective algorithms.},

Considering the characteristics of multistage and diversified processing technologies of the problem, building new powerful evolutionary algorithm (EA) for DHDFSP is expected. To achieve this, we propose a general EA framework called distributed co-evolutionary memetic algorithm (DCMA). It includes four basic modules: 1) dual population (POP)-based global exploration; 2) elite archive (EAR)-oriented local exploitation; 3) elite knowledge transfer (EKT) among POPs and EAR; and 4) adaptive POP restart. EKT is a general model for information fusion among search agents due to its problem independence. In execution, four modules cooperate with each other and search agents co-evolve in a distributed way. This DCMA evolutionary framework provides some guidance in algorithm construction of different optimization problems. Furthermore, we design each module based on problem knowledge and follow the DCMA framework to propose a specific DCMA metaheuristic for coping with DHDFSP. Computational experiments validate the effectiveness of the DCMA evolutionary framework and its special designs, and show that the proposed DCMA metaheuristic outperforms the compared algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Due to the high variability and uncertainty of the wind speed, an interval forecast can provide more information for decision makers to achieve a better energy management compared to the traditional point forecast. In this article, a knee-based lower upper bound estimation method (K-LUBE) is proposed to construct wind speed prediction intervals (PIs). First, we analyze the underlying limitations of traditional direct interval forecast methods, i.e., their obtained PIs often fail to achieve a good balance between the interval width and the coverage probability. K-LUBE resolves the difficulty based on a multiobjective optimization framework in conjunction with a knee selection criterion. Specifically, a PI-NSGA-II multiobjective optimization algorithm is designed to obtain a set of Pareto-optimal solutions. A parameter transfer and a sample training strategies are developed to significantly improve the convergence speed of the optimization procedure. Then, the knee selection criterion is introduced to select the best tradeoff solution among the obtained solutions. In comparison with traditional methods, this method can always provide a reliable PI for decision makers. The procedure is automatic and requires no parameter to be specified in advance, making it more practical for use. The effectiveness of the proposed K-LUBE method is demonstrated through extensive comparisons with four traditional direct interval forecast methods and four classical benchmark models.},

  abstract     = {Classification data are usually represented by many features, but not all of them are useful. Without domain knowledge, it is challenging to determine which features are useful. Feature selection is an effective preprocessing technique for enhancing the discriminating ability of data, but it is a difficult combinatorial optimization problem because of the challenges of the huge search space and complex interactions between features. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) has been successfully applied to feature selection due to its efficiency and easy implementation. However, most existing PSO-based feature selection methods still face the problem of falling into local optima. To solve this problem, this article proposes a novel PSO-based feature selection approach, which can continuously improve the quality of the population at each iteration. Specifically, a correlation-guided updating strategy based on the characteristic of data is developed, which can effectively use the information of the current population to generate more promising solutions. In addition, a particle selection strategy based on a surrogate technique is presented, which can efficiently select particles with better performance in both convergence and diversity to form a new population. Experimental comparing the proposed approach with a few state-of-the-art feature selection methods on 25 classification problems demonstrate that the proposed approach is able to select a smaller feature subset with higher classification accuracy in most cases.},

  abstract     = {We introduce an evolutionary algorithm called recombinator- $k$ -means for optimizing the highly nonconvex kmeans problem. Its defining feature is that its crossover step involves all the members of the current generation, stochastically recombining them with a repurposed variant of the $k$ -means++ seeding algorithm. The recombination also uses a reweighting mechanism that realizes a progressively sharper stochastic selection policy and ensures that the population eventually coalesces into a single solution. We compare this scheme with a state-of-the-art alternative, a more standard genetic algorithm with deterministic pairwise-nearest-neighbor crossover and an elitist selection policy, of which we also provide an augmented and efficient implementation. Extensive tests on large and challenging datasets (both synthetic and real word) show that for fixed population sizes recombinator- $k$ -means is generally superior in terms of the optimization objective, at the cost of a more expensive crossover step. When adjusting the population sizes of the two algorithms to match their running times, we find that for short times the (augmented) pairwise-nearest-neighbor method is always superior, while at longer times recombinator- $k$ -means will match it and, on the most difficult examples, take over. We conclude that the reweighted whole-population recombination is more costly but generally better at escaping local minima. Moreover, it is algorithmically simpler and more general (it could be applied even to $k$ -medians or $k$ -medoids, for example).

  abstract     = {Recent studies show that deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks in the form of subtle perturbations to the input image, which leads the model to output wrong prediction. Such an attack can easily succeed by the existing white-box attack methods, where the perturbation is calculated based on the gradient of the target network. Unfortunately, the gradient is often unavailable in the real-world scenarios, which makes the black-box adversarial attack problems practical and challenging. In fact, they can be formulated as high-dimensional black-box optimization problems at the pixel level. Although evolutionary algorithms are well known for solving black-box optimization problems, they cannot efficiently deal with the high-dimensional decision space. Therefore, we propose an approximated gradient sign method using differential evolution (DE) for solving black-box adversarial attack problems. Unlike most existing methods, it is novel that the proposed method searches the gradient sign rather than the perturbation by a DE algorithm. Also, we transform the pixel-based decision space into a dimension-reduced decision space by combining the pixel differences from the input image to neighbor images, and two different techniques for selecting neighbor images are introduced to build the transferred decision space. In addition, six variants of the proposed method are designed according to the different neighborhood selection and optimization search strategies. Finally, the performance of the proposed method is compared with a number of the state-of-the-art adversarial attack algorithms on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets. The experimental results suggest that the proposed method shows superior performance for solving black-box adversarial attack problems, especially nontargeted attack problems.},

This article enhances each constitutive module of the above approach, including novel interventions on management of the convergence-diversity tradeoff while mapping the solutions from the previous and current generation; use of a computationally more efficient ML method, namely, Random Forest (RF); and changing the manner and extent to which the learnt ML model is utilized toward advancement of the offspring.

To investigate the search efficacy provided by the IP2 operator, it is integrated with multi-and many-objective optimization algorithms, such as NSGA-II, NSGA-III, MOEA/D, and MaOEA-IGD, and tested on a range of two- to ten-objective test problems, and five real-world problems.

We propose an EDA probability model based on the asymmetric generalized Gaussian mixture model, which describes the area in the solution space as comprehensively as possible and constructs a probability model of complex distribution points, especially for missing and outliers. We propose a transformation and a Gaussian evolution strategy in the selection mechanism of EDA to process the deformation, rotation, and denoising of selected dominant individuals. Considering the complexity of the model, we choose to optimize from the perspective of variational Bayesian, and introduce a prior probability distribution through local variation to reinforce the convergence of the algorithm in dealing with complex point sets.

  abstract     = {Dynamic multiobjective optimization problem (DMOP) denotes the multiobjective optimization problem which varies over time. As changes in DMOP may exist some patterns that are predictable, to solve DMOP, a number of research efforts have been made to develop evolutionary search with prediction approaches to estimate the changes of the problem. A common practice of existing prediction approaches is to predict the change of Pareto-optimal solutions (POS) based on the historical solutions obtained in the decision space. However, the change of a DMOP may occur in both decision and objective spaces. Prediction only in the decision space thus may not be able to give the proper estimation of the problem change. Taking this cue, in this article, we propose an evolutionary search with multiview prediction for solving DMOP. In contrast to existing prediction methods, the proposed approach conducts prediction from the views of both decision and objective spaces. To estimate dynamic changes in DMOP, a kernelized autoencoding model is derived to perform the multiview prediction in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), which holds a closed-form solution. To examine the performance of the proposed method, comprehensive empirical studies on the commonly used DMOP benchmarks, as well as a real-world case study on the movie recommendation problem, are presented. The obtained experimental results verified the efficacy of the proposed method for solving both benchmark and real-world DMOPs.},

This article proposes a matrix-friendly genetic algorithm (MGA), in which the population is represented by a matrix and the evolution of population is realized by matrix operations. Compared with the performance of a baseline genetic algorithm (GA) on solving the maximum value of the binary function, MGA can converge better and faster. In addition, MGA is more efficient because of its parallelism on matrix operations, and MGA runs 2.5 times faster than the baseline GA when using the NumPy library. Considering the advantages of the memristor in matrix operations, memristor circuits are designed for the deployment of MGA. This deployment method realizes the parallelization and in-memory computing (memristor is both memory and computing unit) of MGA. In order to verify the effectiveness of this deployment, a feature selection experiment of logistic regression (LR) on Sonar datasets is completed. LR with MGA-based feature selection uses 46 fewer features and achieves 11.9\% higher accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Multimodality is commonly seen in real-world multiobjective optimization problems (MOPs). In such optimization problems, namely, multimodal MOPs (MMOPs), multiple decision vectors can be projected to the same solution in the objective space (i.e., there are multiple implementations corresponding to that solution). Therefore, the diversity in the decision space is very important for the decision maker when tackling MMOPs. Subset selection methods have been widely used in the field of evolutionary multiobjective optimization for selecting well-distributed solutions (in the objective space) to be presented to the decision maker. However, since most subset selection methods do not consider the diversity of solutions in the decision space, they are not suitable for MMOPs. In this article, we aim to clearly demonstrate the usefulness of subset selection for multimodal multiobjective optimization. We propose a novel subset selection framework that can be easily integrated into existing multimodal multiobjective optimization algorithms. By selecting a prespecified number of solutions with good diversity in both the objective and decision spaces from all the examined solutions, the proposed framework significantly improves the performance of state-of-the-art multimodal multiobjective optimization algorithms on various test problems.},

Such expensive problems can be addressed by Gaussian process-assisted evolutionary algorithms. In many problems, the (single) objective and constraints are correlated to some extent. Unfortunately, existing works based on the Gaussian process for expensive constrained optimization treat the objective and multiple constraints as being statistically independent, typically for the ease of computation. To fill this gap, this article investigates the correlation among the objective and constraints. To be specific, we model the correlation amongst the objective and constraint functions using a multitask Gaussian process prior, and then mathematically derive a constrained expected improvement acquisition function that allows the correlation among the objective and constraints. The correlation between the objective and constraints can be captured and leveraged during the optimization process. The performance of the proposed method is examined on a set of benchmark problems and a real-world antenna design problem. On problems with high correlation amongst the objective and constraints, the experimental results show that leveraging the correlation yields improvements in both the optimization speed and the constraint-handling ability compared with the method that assumes the objective and constraints are statistically independent.},

In addition, the SCSparse is embedded in the position updating of the particles to generate sparse solutions.

For a given problem, a suitable genome representation must be defined along with a mutation operator to generate subsequent generations. Unlike natural systems, which display a variety of complex rearrangements (e.g., mobile genetic elements), mutation for genetic algorithms commonly utilizes only random pointwise changes. Furthermore, generalizing beyond pointwise mutations poses a key difficulty as useful genome rearrangements depend on the representation and problem domain. To move beyond the limitations of manually defined pointwise changes, here we propose the use of techniques from masked language models to automatically generate mutations. As a first step, common subsequences within a given population are used to generate a vocabulary. The vocabulary is then used to tokenize each genome. A masked language model is trained on the tokenized data in order to generate possible rearrangements (i.e., mutations). In order to illustrate the proposed strategy, we use string representations of molecules and use a genetic algorithm to optimize for drug-likeness and synthesizability. Our results show that moving beyond random pointwise mutations accelerates genetic algorithm optimization.},

  abstract     = {A considerable number of surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) have been developed to solve expensive optimization problems (EOPs) with continuous objective functions. However, in the real-world applications, we may face EOPs with discontinuous objective functions, which are also called EOPs with discontinuous responses (EOPDRs). Indeed, EOPDRs pose a great challenge to current SAEAs. In this article, a surrogate-assisted differential evolution (DE) algorithm with region division is proposed, named ReDSADE. ReDSADE includes three main strategies: 1) the region division strategy; 2) the Kriging-based search; and 3) the radial basis function (RBF)-based local search. In the region division strategy, we define a new distance measure, called the objective-decision distance. Based on this distance, the evaluated solutions are partitioned into several clusters, and several support vector machine (SVM) classifiers are trained to classify them. These SVM classifiers divide the decision space into several subregions, with the aim of making the objective function continuous in them. In the Kriging-based search, a Kriging model is established in each subregion and combined with DE to search for the optimal solution. In the RBF-based local search, DE is coupled with RBF to search around the best solution found so far, thus accelerating the convergence. By combining these three strategies, ReDSADE is able to solve EOPDRs with limited function evaluations. Three sets of test problems and a real-world application are utilized to verify the effectiveness of ReDSADE. The results demonstrate that ReDSADE exhibits good convergence accuracy and convergence speed.},

  abstract     = {The uncertain capacitated arc routing problem has many real-world applications in logistics domains. Genetic programming (GP) is a promising approach to training routing policies to make real-time decisions and handle uncertain events effectively. In the real world, there are various problem domains and no single routing policy can work effectively in all of them. Instead of training in isolation, we can leverage the relatedness between the problems and transfer knowledge from previously solved source problems to solve the target problem. The existing transfer methods are not effective enough due to the loss of diversity during the knowledge transfer. To increase the diversity of the transferred knowledge, in this article, we propose a novel GP method that removes phenotypic duplicates from the source individuals to initialize the target individuals. Furthermore, assuming that the transferred knowledge used in initialization already includes all the important knowledge explored for the source problem, it is more effective to explore new regions that have not been explored for the source problem. Therefore, we propose novel genetic operators that prohibit the search from revisiting the source individuals when solving the target problem. To speed up the revisit check, we propose to adapt a powerful hashing method for routing policies that greatly improves the efficiency of the genetic operators. Our experimental results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms the existing GP approaches with knowledge transfer in terms of both initial and final solution quality.},

In this article, we discuss the efficiency of greedy subset selection for the hypervolume, inverted generational distance (IGD), and IGD plus (IGD+) indicators. Greedy algorithms usually efficiently handle the subset selection. However, when a large number of solutions are given (e.g., subset selection from tens of thousands of solutions in a UEA), they often become time consuming. Our idea is to use the submodular property, which is known for the hypervolume indicator, to improve their efficiency. First, we prove that the IGD and IGD+ indicators are also submodular. Next, based on the submodular property, we propose an efficient greedy inclusion algorithm for each indicator. We demonstrate through computational experiments that the proposed algorithms are much faster than the standard greedy subset selection algorithms. The proposed algorithms also help the research on performance indicators.},

This article proposes an evolutionary approach to generate an oblique RF for regression problems. More specifically, our method induces an oblique RF by transforming the original feature space to a new feature space through the evolutionary feature construction method. To speed up the searching process, the proposed method evaluates each set of features based on a decision tree (DT) rather than an RF. In order to obtain an RF, we archive top-performing features and corresponding trees during the search. In this way, both the features and the forest can be constructed simultaneously in a single run. The proposed evolutionary forest is applied to 117 benchmark problems with different characteristics and compared with some state-of-the-art regression methods, including several variants of the RF and gradient boosted DTs (GBDTs). The experimental results suggest that the proposed method outperforms the existing RF and GBDT methods.},

  abstract     = {Knowledge transfer plays a vastly important role in solving multitask optimization problems (MTOPs). Many existing methods transfer task-specific knowledge, such as the high-quality solution from one task to other tasks to enhance the optimization ability, which, however, may not work well or even have a negative effect if the tasks have very different task-specific knowledge. Hence, this article proposes a meta-knowledge transfer (MKT)-based differential evolution (MKTDE) algorithm by using a more general MKT method to solve MTOPs more efficiently. The meta-knowledge defined in this article refers to the knowledge that can evolve task-specific knowledge during the evolutionary search. That is, the meta-knowledge is a kind of “ knowledge of knowledge ,” which denotes the knowledge of “ how to solve problem via evolution ” and “ the feature/way/method of evolving high-quality solution .” The evolutionary search for solving different tasks can share common meta-knowledge even though these tasks involve heterogeneous data and have very different task-specific knowledge. Therefore, the MKT can associate the heterogeneous multisource data of different tasks via transferring the meta-knowledge to help solve MTOPs more efficiently in a more general way. Moreover, to further enhance the MKTDE, two novel and efficient methods are proposed. One is multiple populations for the multiple tasks framework using a unified search space for making knowledge transfer flexibly. The other is an elite solution transfer method for achieving positive high-quality solution transfer. The superior performance of the proposed MKTDE is verified via extensive numerical experiments on both widely used MTOP benchmark problems and real-world robot navigation problems, with comparisons with some state-of-the-art and the latest well-performing algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Memetic algorithm (MA) is widely applied to optimize routing problems as it provides one way to combine local search with global search. However, the local search in MA needs to be carefully designed according to the problem’s characteristics. In this article, we consider a real-world large-scale waste collection problem with multiple depots, multiple disposal facilities, multiple trips, and working time constraints. Vehicles with a limited capacity and working time can start from different depots, collect waste at different sites, and make multiple trips to different disposal facilities to empty the waste and return to its origin. While the existing work considered problems with multiple trips and time constraints, none have tackled problems with multiple depots, multiple disposal facilities, multiple trips, as well as working time constraints. The change from “single-depot” to “multidepot” not only reflects better the situation in real life but also leads to a qualitative different and more complex problem. In this article, we first model this complex problem mathematically. Then, a novel region-focused MA is proposed to tackle this new challenge. Compared to classic MA, this region-focused one is enhanced by two major components: 1) a new heuristic-assisted solution initialization algorithm and 2) a region-focused local search with novel heuristics. Comprehensive computational studies show that our proposed approaches significantly outperform several state-of-the-arts on our real problem of thousands of tasks. The new local search procedure and solution initialization method significantly improve the search ability in combination with global search ability of MA.},

  abstract     = {Real-world multiobjective optimization problems usually involve conflicting objectives that change over time, which requires the optimization algorithms to quickly track the Pareto-optimal front (POF) when the environment changes. In recent years, evolutionary algorithms based on prediction models have been considered promising. However, most existing approaches only make predictions based on the linear correlation between a finite number of optimal solutions in two or three previous environments. These incomplete information extraction strategies may lead to low prediction accuracy in some instances. In this article, an incremental support vector machine (ISVM)-based dynamic multiobjective evolutionary algorithm, in short called ISVM-DMOEA, is proposed. We treat the solving of dynamic multiobjective optimization problems (DMOPs) as an online learning process, using the continuously obtained optimal solution to update an ISVM without discarding the solution information at earlier time. ISVM is then used to filter random solutions and generate an initial population for the next moment. To overcome the obstacle of insufficient training samples, a synthetic minority oversampling strategy is implemented before the training of ISVM. The advantage of this approach is that the nonlinear correlation between solutions can be explored online by ISVM, and the information contained in all historical optimal solutions can be exploited to a greater extent. The experimental results and comparison with the chosen state-of-the-art algorithms demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can effectively tackle DMOPs.},

However, traditional EAs are not suitable to deal with high-dimensional expensive problems (HEPs) with high-dimensional search space even if their fitness evaluations are assisted by surrogate models. The recently proposed autoencoder-embedded evolutionary optimization (AEO) framework is highly appropriate to deal with high-dimensional problems. This work aims to incorporate surrogate models into it to further boost its performance, thus resulting in surrogate-assisted AEO (SAEO). It proposes a novel model management strategy that can guarantee reasonable amounts of re-evaluations; hence, the accuracy of surrogate models can be enhanced via being updated with new evaluated samples. Moreover, to ensure enough data samples before constructing surrogates, a problem-dimensionality-dependent activation condition is developed for incorporating surrogates into the SAEO framework. SAEO is tested on seven commonly used benchmark functions and compared with state-of-the-art algorithms for HEPs. The experimental results show that SAEO can further enhance the performance of AEO on most cases and SAEO performs significantly better than other algorithms.

  abstract     = {Manifold learning (MaL) methods are an invaluable tool in today’s world of increasingly huge datasets. MaL algorithms can discover a much lower-dimensional representation (embedding) of a high-dimensional dataset through nonlinear transformations that preserve the most important structure of the original data. State-of-the-art MaL methods directly optimize an embedding without mapping between the original space and the discovered embedded space. This makes interpretability—a key requirement in exploratory data analysis—nearly impossible. Recently, genetic programming has emerged as a very promising approach to MaL by evolving functional mappings from the original space to an embedding. However, genetic programming-based MaL has struggled to match the performance of other approaches. In this work, we propose a new approach to using genetic programming for MaL, which preserves local topology. This is expected to significantly improve performance on tasks where local neighborhood structure (topology) is paramount. We compare our proposed approach with various baseline MaL methods and find that it often outperforms other methods, including a clear improvement over previous genetic programming approaches. These results are particularly promising, given the potential interpretability and reusability of the evolved mappings.},

  abstract     = {Effective constraint handling techniques (CHTs) are of great significance for evolutionary algorithms (EAs) dealing with constrained optimization problems (COPs). To date, many CHTs, such as penalty function, superiority of feasible solutions, and $\epsilon $ -constraint (EC), have been designed. However, different CHTs are usually suited to different problems, even the most appropriate technique changes along with the stages of the optimization process. Motivated by this phenomenon, we propose a voting-mechanism-based ensemble framework, named voting mechanism for constraint handling (VMCH), to integrate multiple CHTs for solving various COPs. In this framework, each CHT acts as a voter, all voters vote for each pair of solutions, and the solution in each pair with the highest weighted votes is considered better. In addition, an adaptive strategy is developed to adjust the voter weights according to their historical voting performance. To investigate the performance of VMCH in improving existing algorithms, the proposed VMCH is embedded into the three best algorithms in the competition on constrained single objective real-parameter optimization at CEC 2018, namely, MAgES, iLSHADE $\epsilon $ , and IUDE, to form three new algorithm versions, i.e., MAgES-VMCH, iLSHADE $\epsilon $ -VMCH, and IUDE-VMCH. They are compared with seven state-of-the-art peer algorithms. Extensive experiments are conducted on 57 real-world COPs. The ranking results show that the new algorithm version MAgES-VMCH takes first place among the ten comparison algorithms. Moreover, all the new VMCH-enhanced versions of the three best algorithms are superior to their original versions. Therefore, the proposed VMCH framework can achieve competitive performance in solving COPs.},

  abstract     = {Surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) have become very popular for tackling computationally expensive multiobjective optimization problems (EMOPs), as the surrogate models in SAEAs can approximate EMOPs well, thereby reducing the time cost of the optimization process. However, with the increased number of decision variables in EMOPs, the prediction accuracy of surrogate models will deteriorate, which inevitably worsens the performance of SAEAs. To deal with this issue, this article suggests an ensemble surrogate-based framework for tackling EMOPs. In this framework, a global surrogate model is trained under the entire search space to explore the global area, while a number of surrogate submodels are trained under different search subspaces to exploit the subarea, so as to enhance the prediction accuracy and reliability. Moreover, a new infill sampling criterion is designed based on a set of reference vectors to select promising samples for training the models. To validate the generality and effectiveness of our framework, three state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms [nondominated sorting genetic algorithm III (NSGA-III), multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition with differential evolution (MOEA/D-DE) and reference vector-guided evolutionary algorithm (RVEA)] are embedded, which significantly improve their performance for solving most of the test EMOPs adopted in this article. When compared to some competitive SAEAs for solving EMOPs with up to 30 decision variables, the experimental results also validate the advantages of our approach in most cases.},

However, for data with both the two characteristics above, there is still a lack of the corresponding FS algorithm. Due to the complex coupling relationship between missing data and class imbalance, the need for better FS method becomes essential. To tackle high-dimensional imbalanced data with missing values, this article studies a new evolutionary FS method. First, an improved $F$ -measure based on filling risk (RF-measure) is defined to evaluate the influence of missing data on the performance of FS in the case of class imbalance. Following that taking the RF-measure as an objective function, a particle swarm optimization-based FS method with fuzzy clustering (PSOFS-FC) is proposed. Two new problem-specific operators or strategies, i.e., the swarm initialization strategy guided by fuzzy clustering and the local pruning operator based on feature importance, are developed to improve the performance of PSOFS-FC. Compared with state-of-the-art FS algorithms on several public datasets, experimental results show that PSOFS-FC can achieve excellent classification performance with relatively less running time, indicating its superiority on tackling high-dimensional imbalanced data with missing values.},

  abstract     = {How to evaluate Pareto front approximations generated by multi/many-objective optimizers is a critical issue in the field of multiobjective optimization. Currently, there exist two types of comprehensive quality indicators (i.e., volume-based and distance-based indicators). Distance-based indicators, such as inverted generational distance (IGD), are usually computed by summing up the distance of each reference point to its nearest solution. Their high computational efficiency leads to their prevalence in many-objective optimization. However, in the existing distance-based indicators, the distributions of the solution sets are usually neglected, leading to their lack of ability to well distinguish between different solution sets. This phenomenon may become even more severe in high-dimensional space. To address such an issue, a kernel-based indicator (KBI) is proposed as a comprehensive indicator. Different from other distance-based indicators, a kernel-based maximum mean discrepancy is adopted in KBI for directly measuring the difference that can characterize the convergence, spread, and uniformity of two sets, i.e., the solution set and reference set, by embedding them in reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). As a result, KBI not only reflects the distance between the solution set and the reference set but also can reflect the distribution of the solution set itself. In addition, to maintain the desirable weak Pareto compliance property of KBI, a nondominated set reconstruction approach is also proposed to shift the original solution set. The detailed theoretical and experimental analysis of KBI is provided in this article. The properties of KBI have also been analyzed by the optimal $\mu $ -distribution.},

However, most of the existing EMT algorithms only consider handling two tasks simultaneously. As the computational cost incurred in the evolutionary search and knowledge transfer increased rapidly with the number of optimization tasks, these EMT algorithms cannot meet today’s requirements of optimization service on the cloud for many real-world applications, where hundreds or thousands of optimization requests (labeled as large-scale EMT) are often received simultaneously and require to be optimized in a short time. Recently, graphics processing unit (GPU) computing has attracted extensive attention to accelerate the applications possessing large-scale data volume that are traditionally handled by the central processing unit (CPU). Taking this cue, toward large-scale EMT, in this article, we propose a new EMT paradigm based on the island model with the compute unified device architecture (CUDA), which is able to handle a large number of continuous optimization tasks efficiently and effectively. Moreover, under the proposed paradigm, we develop the GPU-based implicit and explicit knowledge transfer mechanisms for EMT. To evaluate the performance of the proposed paradigm, comprehensive empirical studies have been conducted against its CPU-based counterpart in large-scale EMT.},

To improve the effectiveness and efficiency of these techniques, in this article, we proposed a novel memetic estimation of the distribution algorithm-based approach, namely, MEEDA, to tackle this problem. In particular, MEEDA explores four different domain-dependent local search methods that search for effective composite services by utilizing several neighborhood structures. Apart from that, to significantly reduce the computational time of MEEDA, an efficient local search strategy is introduced by combining a uniform fitness distribution scheme for selecting suitable solutions and stochastic local search operators for effectively and efficiently exploiting neighbors. To better demonstrate MEEDA’s effectiveness and scalability, we create a more challenging, augmented version of the service composition benchmark dataset. Experimental results on this benchmark show that MEEDA with newly developed domain-dependent local search operator, i.e., layer-based constrained one-point swaps, significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms in finding high-quality composite services.},

  abstract     = {Few-shot image classification (FSIC) is an important but challenging task due to high variations across images and a small number of training instances. A learning system often has poor generalization performance due to the lack of sufficient training data. Genetic programming (GP) has been successfully applied to image classification and achieved promising performance. This article proposes a GP-based approach with a dual-tree representation and a new fitness function to automatically learn image features for FSIC. The dual-tree representation allows the proposed approach to have better searchability and learn richer features than a single-tree representation when the number of training instances is very small. The fitness function based on the classification accuracy and the distances of the training instances to the class centroids aims to improve the generalization performance. The proposed approach can deal with different types of FSIC tasks with various numbers of classes and different image sizes. The results show that the proposed approach achieves significantly better performance than a large number of state-of-the-art methods on nine 3-shot and 5-shot image classification datasets. Further analysis shows the effectiveness of the new components of the proposed approach, its good searchability, and the high interpretability of the evolved solutions.},

  abstract     = {The decomposition-based evolutionary algorithm (MOEA/D) has attained excellent performance in solving optimization problems involving multiple conflicting objectives. However, the Pareto-optimal front (POF) of many multiobjective optimization problems (MOPs) has irregular properties, which weakens the performance of MOEA/D. To address this issue, we devise a dynamic transfer reference point-oriented MOEA/D with local objective-space knowledge (DTR-MOEA/D). The design principle is based on three original and rigorous mechanisms. First, the individuals are projected onto a line segment (two-objective case) or a 3-D plane (three-objective case) after being normalized in the objective space. The line segment or the plane is divided into three different regions: 1) the central region; 2) the middle region; and 3) the edge region. Second, a dynamic transfer criterion of the reference point is developed based on the population density relationships in different regions. Third, a strategy of population diversity enhancement guided by local objective-space knowledge is adopted to improve the diversity of the population. Finally, the experimental results conducted on 16 benchmark MOPs and eight modified MOPs with irregular POF shapes verify that the proposed DTR-MOEA/D has attained a strong competitiveness compared with other representative algorithms.},

However, some of its components may become inefficient in certain situations. This study introduces the second variant of this method, called RS-CMSA-ESII. It improves the adaptation schemes for the normalized taboo distances of the archived solutions and the covariance matrix of the subpopulation, the termination criteria for the subpopulations, and the way in which the infeasible solutions are treated. It also improves the time complexity of RS-CMSA-ES by updating the initialization procedure of a subpopulation and developing a more accurate metric for determining critical taboo regions. The effects of these modifications are illustrated by designing controlled numerical simulations. RS-CMSA-ESII is then compared with the most successful and recent niching methods for MMO on a widely adopted test suite. The results obtained reveal the superiority of RS-CMSA-ESII over these methods, including the winners of the competition on niching methods for MMO in previous years. Besides, this study extends RS-CMSA-ESII to dynamic MMO and compares it with a few recently proposed methods on the modified moving peak benchmark functions.},

  abstract     = {Supply chain management (SCM) is a significant and complex system in a smart city that requires advanced artificial intelligence (AI) and optimization techniques. The multiobjective supply chain configuration (MOSCC) in SCM is to set the optimal configurations for supply chain members to minimize both the cost of goods sold ( $CoGS$ ) and the lead time ( $LT$ ). Although some algorithms have been proposed for the MOSCC, they do not make the best use of the problem-related knowledge and cannot perform well on the large-scale instances with many members and configuration options. Therefore, this article proposes a multipopulation ant colony system with knowledge-based local searches (MPACS-KLSs). First, the multiobjective algorithm is based on the multiple populations for multiple objectives framework. Two ant colonies are used to separately minimize $CoGS$ and $LT$ , which helps to search in the biobjective space sufficiently. Second, with the considerations of the problem-related knowledge, a priority-based solution construction method, a rank-based heuristic strategy, and an objective-oriented global pheromone updating strategy are proposed. Third, to speed up the convergence, especially for large-scale MOSCC instances, two knowledge-based local searches are designed to minimize $CoGS$ and $LT$ of solutions, respectively. Exhaustive experiments are conducted on both the instances from the real life and the randomly generated instances with different problem scales. The results show that MPACS-KLS is superior to the contestant algorithms, especially on the large-scale MOSCC instances, which significantly extends the AI and optimization techniques in practical applications of the smart city.},

For that landscape, one-step success probability and expected progress were estimated analytically, and further proved to converge, as space dimension increases, to the corresponding asymptotics of the algorithm with normal mutation. This article takes the analysis further by considering the RIDGE, an asymmetric landscape almost uncovered in the literature. For the elitist algorithm, estimates of expected progress along the radial and longitudinal axes are derived, then tested numerically against the real behavior of the algorithm on several functions from this class. The global behavior of the algorithm is predicted correctly by iterating the one-step analytical formulas. Moreover, experiments show identical mean value dynamics for the algorithms with uniform and normal mutation, which implies that the derived formulas apply also to the normal case. Essential to the whole analysis is $\theta $ , the inclination angle of the RIDGE. The behavior of the algorithm on the SPHERE and HYPERPLANE is also obtained, at the limits of the $\theta $ interval (0°, 90°].},

Our wizard achieves competitive performance on all benchmark suites. It significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art algorithms on some of the suites, including YABBOB and LSGO. Its excellent performance is obtained without any task-specific parametrization. The algorithm selection wizard, all of its base solvers, as well as the benchmark suites are available for reproducible research in the open-source Nevergrad platform.},

  abstract     = {Dominance move (DoM) is a binary quality indicator that can be used in multiobjective and many-objective optimization to compare two solution sets obtained from different simulations. The DoM indicator can differentiate the sets for certain important features, such as convergence , spread , uniformity , and cardinality . DoM does not require any reference point or any representative Pareto solution set, and it has an intuitive and physical meaning, similar to the $\epsilon $ -indicator. It calculates the minimum total move of members of one set so that all elements in another set are to be dominated or identical to at least one member of the first set. Despite the aforementioned desired properties, DoM is hard to calculate, particularly for higher dimensions. There is an efficient and exact method to calculate it in biobjective problems. This work proposes a novel approach to calculate DoM using a mixed-integer programming (MIP) approach, which can handle two sets with two or more objectives and is shown to overcome the issue of information loss associated with the $\epsilon $ -indicator. Experiments in the biobjective space are done to verify the model’s correctness. Furthermore, other experiments, using 3-, 5-, 10-, 15-, 20-, 25-, and 30-objective problems, are performed to show how the model behaves in higher dimensional cases. Algorithms, such as IBEA, MOEA/D, NSGA-III, NSGA-II, and SPEA2, are used to generate the solution sets; however, any other algorithm can also be used with the proposed MIP-DoM indicator. Further extensions are discussed to handle certain idiosyncrasies with some solution sets and improve the quality indicator and its use for other scenarios.},

This article addresses the energy-aware distributed hybrid flow-shop scheduling (EADHFSP) with minimization of makespan and energy consumption simultaneously. We present a mixed-integer linear programming model and propose a cooperative memetic algorithm (CMA) with a reinforcement learning (RL)-based policy agent. First, an encoding scheme and a reasonable decoding method are designed, considering the tradeoff between two conflicting objectives. Second, two problem-specific heuristics are presented for hybrid initialization to generate diverse solutions. Third, solutions are refined with appropriate improvement operator selected by the RL-based policy agent. Meanwhile, an effective solution selection method based on the decomposition strategy is utilized to balance the convergence and diversity. Fourth, an intensification search with multiple problem-specific operators is incorporated to further enhance the exploitation capability. Moreover, two energy-saving strategies are designed for improving the nondominated solutions. The effect of parameter setting is investigated and extensive numerical tests are carried out. The comparative results demonstrate that the special designs are effective and the CMA is superior to the existing algorithms in solving the EADHFSP.},

Particle swarm optimization (PSO) has been widely used for FS due to being efficient and easy to implement. However, when dealing with high-dimensional data, most of the existing PSO-based FS approaches face the problems of falling into local optima and high-computational cost. Evolutionary multitasking is an effective paradigm to enhance global search capability and accelerate convergence by knowledge transfer among related tasks. Inspired by evolutionary multitasking, this article proposes a multitasking PSO approach for high-dimensional FS. The approach converts a high-dimensional FS task into several related low-dimensional FS tasks, then finds an optimal feature subset by knowledge transfer between these low-dimensional FS tasks. Specifically, a novel task generation strategy based on the importance of features is developed, which can generate highly related tasks from a dataset adaptively. In addition, a new knowledge transfer mechanism is presented, which can effectively implement positive knowledge transfer among related tasks. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can evolve a feature subset with higher classification accuracy in a shorter time than other state-of-the-art FS methods on high-dimensional classification.},

  abstract     = {Dynamic optimization, for which the objective functions change over time, has attracted intensive investigations due to the inherent uncertainty associated with many real-world problems. For its robustness with respect to noise, evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have been expected to have great potential for dynamic optimization. Many dynamic optimization methods, such as diversity-driven methods, memory methods, and prediction methods have been proposed based on EAs to deal with environmental changes. However, they face difficulties in adapting to fast changes in dynamic optimization as EAs normally need quite a few fitness evaluations to find a near-optimum solution. To address this issue, this article proposes a new framework of applying EAs in the context of dynamic optimization to deal with fast changing environments. We suggest that instead of online evolving (searching) solutions for the ever-changing objective function, EAs are more suitable for acquiring an archive of solutions in an offline way, which could be adopted to construct a system to provide high-quality solutions efficiently in a dynamic environment. To be specific, we formulate the offline search as a static set-oriented optimization problem. Then, a set of solutions is obtained by an EA for this set-oriented optimization problem. After this, the obtained solution set is adopted to do fast adaptation to the corresponding dynamic optimization problem. The general framework is instantiated for continuous dynamic-constrained optimization problems, and the empirical results show the potential of the proposed framework. The superiority of the framework is also verified on a dynamic vehicle routing problem with changing demands.},

  abstract     = {Protein structure prediction (PSP) problems are a major biocomputing challenge, owing to its scientific intrinsic that assists researchers to understand the relationship between amino acid sequences and protein structures, and to study the function of proteins. Although computational resources increased substantially over the last decade, a complete solution to PSP problems by computational methods has not yet been obtained. Using only one energy function is insufficient to characterize proteins because of their complexity. Diverse protein energy functions and evolutionary computation algorithms have been extensively studied to assist in the prediction of protein structures in different ways. Such algorithms are able to provide a better protein with less computational resources requirement than deep learning methods. For the first time, this study proposes a many-objective PSP (MaOPSP) problem with four types of objectives to alleviate the impact of imprecise energy functions for predicting protein structures. A many-objective evolutionary algorithm (MaOEA) is utilized to solve MaOPSP. The proposed method is compared with existing methods by examining 34 proteins. An analysis of the objectives demonstrates that our generated conformations are more reasonable than those generated by single/multiobjective optimization methods. Experimental results indicate that solving a PSP problem as an MaOPSP problem with four objectives yields better PSPs, in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.

Ranging from small refinements to the incorporation of sophisticated novel ideas, the majority of modifications proposed to this algorithm have been the result of a manual process in which developers try new designs based on their own knowledge and expertise. However, manually introducing changes is very time consuming and makes the systematic exploration of all the possible algorithm configurations a difficult process. In this article, we propose to use automatic design to overcome the limitations of having to manually find performing PSO algorithms. We develop a flexible software framework for PSO, called PSO-X, which is specifically designed to integrate the use of automatic configuration tools into the process of generating PSO algorithms. Our framework embodies a large number of algorithm components developed over more than 25 years of research that have allowed PSO to deal with a large variety of problems, and uses irace , a state-of-the-art configuration tool, to automatize the task of selecting and configuring PSO algorithms starting from these components. We show that irace is capable of finding high-performing instances of PSO algorithms never proposed before.},

  abstract     = {Bilevel optimization refers to a specialized class of problems where the optimum of an upper level (UL) problem is sought subject to the optimality of a nested lower level (LL) problem as a constraint. This nested structure necessitates a large number of function evaluations for the solution methods, especially population-based metaheuristics such as evolutionary algorithms (EAs). Reducing this effort remains critical for practical uptake of bilevel EAs, particularly for computationally expensive problems where each solution evaluation may involve a significant cost. This letter aims to contribute toward this field by a novel and previously unexplored proposition that bilevel optimization problems can be posed as multifidelity optimization problems. The underpinning idea is that an informed judgment of how accurate the LL optimum estimate should be to confidently determine its ranking can significantly cut down redundant evaluations during the search. Toward this end, we propose an algorithm which learns the appropriate fidelity to evaluate a solution during the search based on the seen data, instead of resorting to an exhaustive LL optimization. Numerical experiments are conducted on a range of standard as well as more complex variants of the SMD test problems to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach when compared to state-of-the-art surrogate-assisted algorithms.},

  abstract     = {To prevent the population from getting stuck in local areas and then missing the constrained Pareto front fragments in dealing with constrained multiobjective optimization problems (CMOPs), it is important to guide the population to evenly explore the promising areas that are not dominated by all examined feasible solutions. To this end, we first introduce a cost value-based distance into the objective space, and then use this distance and the constraints to define an indicator to evaluate the contribution of each individual to exploring the promising areas. Theoretical studies show that the proposed indicator can effectively guide population to focus on exploring the promising areas without crowding in local areas. Accordingly, we propose a new constraint handling technique (CHT) based on this indicator. To further improve the diversity of population in the promising areas, the proposed indicator-based CHT divides the promising areas into multiple subregions, and then gives priority to removing the individuals with the worst fitness values in the densest subregions. We embed the indicator-based CHT in evolutionary algorithm and propose an indicator-based constrained multiobjective algorithm for solving CMOPs. Numerical experiments on several benchmark suites show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Compared with six state-of-the-art constrained evolutionary multiobjective optimization algorithms, the proposed algorithm performs better in dealing with different types of CMOPs, especially in those problems that the individuals are easy to appear in the local infeasible areas that dominate the constrained Pareto front fragments.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning is a distributed machine learning approach to privacy preservation and two major technical challenges prevent a wider application of federated learning. One is that federated learning raises high demands on communication resources, since a large number of model parameters must be transmitted between the server and clients. The other challenge is that training large machine learning models such as deep neural networks in federated learning requires a large amount of computational resources, which may be unrealistic for edge devices such as mobile phones. The problem becomes worse when deep neural architecture search (NAS) is to be carried out in federated learning. To address the above challenges, we propose an evolutionary approach to real-time federated NAS that not only optimizes the model performance but also reduces the local payload. During the search, a double-sampling technique is introduced, in which for each individual, only a randomly sampled submodel is transmitted to a number of randomly sampled clients for training. This way, we effectively reduce computational and communication costs required for evolutionary optimization, making the proposed framework well suitable for real-time federated NAS.},

  abstract     = {Hypervolume is widely used in the evolutionary multiobjective optimization (EMO) field to evaluate the quality of a solution set. For a solution set with $\mu $ solutions on a Pareto front, a larger hypervolume means a better solution set. Investigating the distribution of the solution set with the largest hypervolume is an important topic in EMO, which is the so-called hypervolume-optimal $\mu $ -distribution. Theoretical results have shown that the $\mu $ solutions are uniformly distributed on a linear Pareto front in two dimensions. However, the $\mu $ solutions are not always uniformly distributed on a single-line Pareto front in three dimensions. They are only uniform when the single-line Pareto front has one constant objective. In this article, we further investigate the hypervolume-optimal $\mu $ -distribution in three dimensions. We consider the line-based and plane-based Pareto fronts. For the line-based Pareto fronts, we extend the single-line Pareto front to two-line and three-line Pareto fronts, where each line has one constant objective. For the plane-based Pareto fronts, the linear triangular and inverted triangular Pareto fronts are considered. First, we show that the $\mu $ solutions are not always uniformly distributed on the line-based Pareto fronts. The uniformity depends on how the lines are combined. Then, we show that a uniform solution set on the plane-based Pareto front is not always optimal for hypervolume maximization. It is locally optimal with respect to a $(\mu +1)$ selection scheme. Our results can help researchers in the community to better understand and utilize the hypervolume indicator.},

  abstract     = {In multiobjective optimization, it is generally known that the boom in computational complexity and search spaces came with a rise in the number of objectives, and this leads to a decrease in selection pressure and the deterioration of the evolutionary process. It follows then that the many-objective optimization problem (MaOP) has become one of the most challenging topics in the field of intelligent optimization. Recently, the multifactorial evolutionary algorithm (MFEA) and its variations, which have shown excellent performance in knowledge transfer across related problems, may provide a new and effective way for solving MaOPs. In this article, a novel MFEA based on improved dynamical decomposition (MFEA/IDD), which integrates the advantages of multitasking optimization and decomposition-based evolutionary algorithms, is proposed. Specifically, in the improved dynamical decomposition strategy (IDD) method, the bi-pivot strategy is designed to provide a good mechanism for balancing between convergence and diversity instead of the single-pivot strategy. Furthermore, a novel MFEA-based approach embedding the IDD strategy is developed to reduce the total running time for solving multiple MaOPs simultaneously. Compared with seven state-of-the-art algorithms, the efficacy of our proposed method is validated experimentally on the benchmarks WFG, DTLZ, and MAF with three to ten objectives, along with a series of real-world cases. The results reveal that the MFEA/IDD is well placed in balancing convergence and diversity while reducing the total number of function evaluations for solving MaOPs.},

However, as the number of tasks increases to the extent of many-task optimization, the knowledge transfer between tasks encounters more uncertainty and challenges, thereby resulting in degradation of optimization performance. To give full play to the many-task optimization framework and minimize the potential negative transfer, this article proposes an evolutionary many-task optimization algorithm based on a multisource knowledge transfer mechanism, namely, EMaTO-MKT. Particularly, in each iteration, EMaTO-MKT determines the probability of using knowledge transfer adaptively according to the evolution experience, and balances the self-evolution within each task and the knowledge transfer among tasks. To perform knowledge transfer, EMaTO-MKT selects multiple highly similar tasks in terms of maximum mean discrepancy as the learning sources for each task. Afterward, a knowledge transfer strategy based on local distribution estimation is applied to enable the learning from multiple sources. Compared with the other state-of-the-art evolutionary many-task algorithms on benchmark test suites, EMaTO-MKT shows competitiveness in solving many-task optimization problems.},

  abstract     = {Evolutionary multitask optimization (EMTO) has recently attracted widespread attention in the evolutionary computation community, which solves two or more tasks simultaneously to improve the convergence characteristics of tasks when individually optimized. Effective knowledge between tasks is transferred by taking advantage of the parallelism of population-based search. Without any prior knowledge about tasks, it is a challenging problem of how to adaptively transfer effective knowledge between tasks and reduce the impact of negative transfer in EMTO. However, these two issues are rarely studied simultaneously in the existing literature. Besides, in complex many-task environments, the potential relationships among individuals from highly diverse populations associated with tasks directly determine the effectiveness of cross-task knowledge transfer. Keeping those in mind, we propose a multitask evolutionary algorithm based on anomaly detection (MTEA-AD). Specifically, each task is assigned a population and an anomaly detection model. Each anomaly detection model is used to learn the relationship among individuals between the current task and the other tasks online. Individuals that may carry negative knowledge are identified as outliers, and candidate transferred individuals identified by the anomaly detection model are selected to assist the current task, which may carry common knowledge across the current task and other tasks. Furthermore, to realize the adaptive control of the degree of knowledge transfer, the successfully transferred individuals that survive to the next generation through the elitism are used to update the anomaly detection parameter. The fair competition between offspring and candidate transferred individuals can effectively reduce the risk of negative transfer. Finally, the empirical studies on a series of synthetic benchmarks and a practical study are conducted to verify the effectiveness of MTEA-AD. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposal can adaptively adjust the degree of knowledge transfer through the anomaly detection model to achieve highly competitive performance compared to several state-of-the-art EMTO methods.},

Recent years have seen a large body of EMTO works based on different kinds of EAs and studying one or more aspects in how to represent, extract, transfer, and reuse knowledge. A key challenge to EMTO is the occurrence of negative knowledge transfer between tasks, which becomes severer when the total number of tasks increases. To address this issue, we propose an adaptive EMTO (AEMTO) framework. This framework can adapt knowledge transfer frequency, knowledge source selection, and knowledge transfer intensity in a synergistic way to make the best use of knowledge transfer, especially when facing many tasks. We implement the proposed AEMTO framework and evaluate our implementation on three suites of MTO problems with 2, 10, and 50 tasks and one real-world MTO problem with 2000 tasks in comparison to several state-of-the-art EMTO methods with certain adaptation strategies regarding knowledge transfer and the single-task optimization counterpart of the proposed method. Experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the adaptive knowledge transfer strategies used in AEMTO and the overall performance superiority of AEMTO.},

In this article, an evolutionary multitasking (EMT)-based constrained multiobjective optimization (EMCMO) framework is developed to solve CMOPs. In EMCMO, the optimization of a CMOP is transformed into two related tasks: one task is for the original CMOP, and the other task is only for the objectives by ignoring all constraints. The main purpose of the second task is to continuously provide useful knowledge of objectives to the first task, thus facilitating solving the CMOP. Specially, the genes carried by parent individuals or offspring individuals are dynamically regarded as useful knowledge due to the different complementarities of the two tasks. Moreover, the useful knowledge is found by the designed tentative method and transferred to improve the performance of the two tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to use EMT to solve CMOPs. To verify the performance of EMCMO, an instance of EMCMO is obtained by employing a genetic algorithm as the optimizer. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on four benchmark test suites to verify the effectiveness of knowledge transfer. Furthermore, compared with other state-of-the-art constrained multiobjective optimization algorithms, EMCMO can produce better or at least comparable performance.},

  abstract     = {For solving large-scale multiobjective problems (LSMOPs), the transformation-based methods have shown promising search efficiency, which varies the original problem as a new simplified problem and performs the optimization in simplified spaces instead of the original problem space. Owing to the useful information provided by the simplified searching space, the performance of LSMOPs has been improved to some extent. However, it is worth noting that the original problem has changed after the variation, and there is thus no guarantee of the preservation of the original global or near-global optimum in the newly generated space. In this article, we propose to solve LSMOPs via a multivariation multifactorial evolutionary algorithm. In contrast to existing transformation-based methods, the proposed approach intends to conduct an evolutionary search on both the original space of the LSMOP and multiple simplified spaces constructed in a multivariation manner concurrently. In this way, useful traits found along the search can be seamlessly transferred from the simplified problem spaces to the original problem space toward efficient problem solving. Besides, since the evolutionary search is also performed in the original problem space, preserving the original global optimal solution can be guaranteed. To evaluate the performance of the proposed framework, comprehensive empirical studies are carried out on a set of LSMOPs with two to three objectives and 500–5000 variables. The experimental results highlight the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method compared to the state-of-the-art methods for large-scale multiobjective optimization.},

In this manuscript we present A-MFEA-RL, an adaptive version of the well-known MFEA algorithm whose search and inheritance operators are tailored for multitask reinforcement learning environments. Specifically, our approach includes crossover and inheritance mechanisms for refining the exchange of genetic material, which rely on the multilayered structure of modern deep-learning-based reinforcement learning models. In order to assess the performance of the proposed approach, we design an extensive experimental setup comprising multiple reinforcement learning environments of varying levels of complexity, over which the performance of A-MFEA-RL is compared to that furnished by alternative nonevolutionary multitask reinforcement learning approaches. As concluded from the discussion of the obtained results, A-MFEA-RL not only achieves competitive success rates over the simultaneously addressed tasks, but also fosters the exchange of knowledge among tasks that could be intuitively expected to keep a degree of synergistic relationship.},

  abstract     = {Using evolutionary computation algorithms to solve multiple tasks with knowledge sharing is a promising approach. Image feature learning can be considered as a multitask learning problem because different tasks may have a similar feature space. Genetic programming (GP) has been successfully applied to image feature learning for classification. However, most of the existing GP methods solve one task, independently, using sufficient training data. No multitask GP method has been developed for image feature learning. Therefore, this article develops a multitask GP approach to image feature learning for classification with limited training data. Owing to the flexible representation of GP, a new knowledge sharing mechanism based on a new individual representation is developed to allow GP to automatically learn what to share across two tasks and to improve its learning performance. The shared knowledge is encoded as a common tree, which can represent the common/general features of two tasks. With the new individual representation, each task is solved using the features extracted from a common tree and a task-specific tree representing task-specific features. To find the best common and task-specific trees, a new evolutionary search process and fitness functions are developed. The performance of the new approach is examined on six multitask learning problems of 12 image classification datasets with limited training data and compared with 17 competitive methods.

  abstract     = {The choice of design representations, as of search operators, is central to the performance of evolutionary optimization algorithms, in particular, for multitask problems. The multitask approach pushes further the parallelization aspect of these algorithms by solving simultaneously multiple optimization tasks using a single population. During the search, the operators implicitly transfer knowledge between solutions to the offspring, taking advantage of potential synergies between problems to drive the solutions to optimality. Nevertheless, in order to operate on the individuals, the design space of each task has to be mapped to a common search space, which is challenging in engineering cases without clear semantic overlap between parameters. Here, we apply a 3-D point cloud autoencoder to map the representations from the Cartesian to a unified design representation: the latent space of the autoencoder. The transfer of latent space features between design representations allows the reconstruction of shapes with interpolated characteristics and maintenance of common parts, which potentially improves the performance of the designs in one or more tasks during the optimization. Compared to traditional representations for shape optimization, such as free-form deformation, the latent representation enables more representative design modifications, while keeping the baseline characteristics of the learned classes of objects. We demonstrate the efficiency of our approach in an optimization scenario where we minimize the aerodynamic drag of two different car shapes with common underbodies for cost-efficient vehicle platform design.},

EAs are population-based methods inspired by principles of natural evolution that have provided a gradient-free path to solving complex learning and optimization problems. However, unlike the natural world where evolution has engendered diverse species and produced differently skilled subpopulations, in silico EAs are typically designed to evolve a set of solutions specialized for just a single target task. This convention of problem solving in isolation tends to curtail the power of implicit parallelism of a population. Skills evolved for a given problem instance do not naturally transfer to populations tasked to solve another. Hence, convergence rates remain restrained, even in settings where related tasks with overlapping search spaces, similar optimal solutions, or with other forms of reusable information, are routinely recurring.},

In this article, we propose a scalable many-objective benchmark problem covering most of the important features for routing applications based on real-world data. We define five objective functions representing distance, traveling time, delays caused by accidents, and two route-specific features, such as curvature and elevation. We analyze several different instances for this test problem and provide their true Pareto front to analyze the problem difficulties. Additionally, we apply four well-known evolutionary multiobjective algorithms. Since this test benchmark can be easily transferred to real-world routing problems, we construct a routing problem from OpenStreetMap data. We evaluate the three optimization algorithms and observe that we are able to provide promising results for such a real-world application. The proposed benchmark represents a scalable many-objective route planning optimization problem enabling researchers and engineers to evaluate their many-objective approaches.},

  abstract     = {Perceptual aliasing challenges reinforcement learning agents. They struggle to learn stable policies by failing to identify and disambiguate perceptually identical states in the environment that require different actions to reach a goal. As the agent often has only a local frame of reference, it cannot represent the global environment. Frame-of-reference-based learning is a feature of vertebrate intelligence that allows multiple simultaneous representations of an environment at different levels of abstraction. This enables the resolution of patterns that are made up of patterns that are made up of features. The evolutionary computation technique of learning classifier systems has shown promise in learning nested patterns in single-step domains. This work uses the frame-of-reference concept within a learning classifier system to learn stable policies in non-Markov multistep domains. Considering aliased states at a constituent level enables the system to place them appropriately in holistic-level policies. Instead of enumerating a huge search space, evolution computation empowers the novel system to evolve fitter rules and policies. The experimental results show that the novel system effectively solves complex aliasing patterns in non-Markov environments that have been challenging to artificial agents. For example, the novel system utilizes only 6.5, 3.71, and 3.22 steps to resolve Maze10, Littman57, and Woods102, respectively.},

To make such surrogates as accurate as possible, we formulate dominance prediction as an imbalanced classification problem and address this problem using deep learning techniques. Furthermore, to integrate the surrogates based on dominance prediction with multiobjective evolutionary optimization, we develop a two-stage preselection strategy. This strategy aims to select a promising solution to be evaluated among those produced by genetic operations, taking proper account of the balance between convergence and diversity. We conduct an empirical study on a number of well-known multiobjective and many-objective benchmark problems, over a relatively small number of function evaluations.

However, in the process of knowledge transfer, negative transfer is common because it is difficult to evaluate whether knowledge is effective for population evolution. Therefore, how to obtain and transfer the effective knowledge to curb the negative transfer is a challenging problem in MTO. To deal with this problem, a self-adjusting multitask particle swarm optimization (SA-MTPSO) algorithm is designed to improve the convergence performance in this article. First, a knowledge estimation metric, combining the decision space knowledge and the target space knowledge for each task, is designed to describe the effectiveness of knowledge. Then, the effective knowledge is obtained to promote the knowledge transfer process. Second, a self-adjusting knowledge transfer mechanism, based on the effective knowledge and the self-adjusting transfer method, is developed to achieve effective knowledge transfer. Then, the ineffective knowledge is removed to solve the negative transfer problem. Third, the convergence analysis is given to guarantee the effectiveness of the SA-MTPSO algorithm theoretically. Finally, the proposed algorithm is compared with some existing MTO algorithms. The results show that the performance of the proposed algorithm is superior to most algorithms on negative transfer suppression and convergence.},

  abstract     = {Many decisions in a machine learning (ML) pipeline involve nondifferentiable and discontinuous objectives and search spaces. Examples include feature selection, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning, where candidate solutions in an outer optimization loop must be evaluated via a learning subsystem. Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are prominent gradient-free methods to handle such tasks. However, EAs are known to pose steep computational challenges, especially when dealing with large-instance datasets. As opposed to prior works that often fall back on parallel computing hardware to resolve this big data problem of EAs, in this article, we propose a novel algorithm-centric solution based on evolutionary multitasking . Our approach involves the creation of a band of minions , i.e., small data proxies to the main target task, that are constructed by subsampling a fraction of the large dataset. We then combine the minions with the main task in a single multitask optimization framework, boosting evolutionary search by using small data to quickly optimize for the large dataset. Our key algorithmic contribution in this setting is to allocate computational resources to each of the tasks in a principled manner. The article considers wrapper-based feature selection as an illustrative case study of the broader idea of using multitasking to speedup outer loop evolutionary configurations of any ML subsystem. The experiments reveal that multitasking can indeed speedup baseline EAs, by more than 40\% on some datasets.},

In this framework, the task of optimizing a set of lower level problems parameterized by upper level variables is conducted in a parallel manner. In the meanwhile, a transfer learning strategy is developed to improve the effectiveness of each lower level search (LLS) process. In practice, we implement two versions of the TLEA: the first version uses the covariance matrix adaptation evolutionary strategy and the second version uses the differential evolution as the evolutionary operator in lower level optimization. The experimental studies on two sets of widely used bilevel optimization benchmark problems are conducted, and the performance of the two TLEA implementations is compared to that of four well-established evolutionary bilevel optimization algorithms to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm framework.},

In this scheduling problem, each job consists of multiple parts and the jobs are divided into different types. The manufacturing of a job is comprised of three consecutive stages: 1) parts fabrication on first-stage parallel machines; 2) parts assembly on second-stage single machine; and 3) job differentiation on one of third-stage dedicated machines. We provide a mixed-integer programming model, derive three lower bounds, and further present the EAMA metaheuristic for HDFSP. The EAMA is initialized heuristically, and its global exploration is performed by a differential evolution, which includes three newly designed operators: 1) elite-driven discretized differential mutation; 2) probability crossover; and 3) biased selection. To enhance the local search, an external elite archive is set and evolved in parallel with global exploration by a meta-Lamarckian learning-based adaptive multistage local search and a variable length-based adaptive block-insertion local search. After the global exploration and local exploitation, an elite sharing strategy is used to exchange the excellent information between population and elite archive, and an adaptive restart strategy is used to diversify the population. The influence of parameter setting on EAMA is surveyed by using an improved design-of-experiment. The statistical results from extensive computational experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the special designs and show that EAMA performs more efficient than the existing algorithms in solving the problem under consideration.},

We investigate the system’s capabilities by evolving and 3-D printing objects at different levels of structural consistency, and assess the quality of the fitness measures presented to explore the design space of our generative system.

Genetic programming is considered a promising hyper-heuristic technique to automatically evolve routing policies that can make effective real-time decisions in an uncertain environment. Most existing research on genetic programming hyper-heuristic for the uncertain capacitated arc routing problem only focused on the test performance aspect. As a result, the routing policies evolved by genetic programming are usually too large and complex, and hard to comprehend. To evolve effective, smaller, and simpler routing policies, this article proposes a novel genetic programming approach, which simplifies the routing policies during the evolutionary process using a niching technique. The simplified routing policies are stored in an external archive. We also developed new elitism, parent selection, and breeding schemes for generating offspring from the original population and the archive. The experimental results show that the newly proposed approach can achieve significantly better test performance than the current state-of-the-art genetic programming algorithms for the uncertain capacitated arc routing problem. The evolved routing policies are smaller, and thus potentially more interpretable.},

This article investigates how to find the robustness intervals of the goal solution in evolutionary robust optimization and formulates this as a bilevel optimization problem. Then, a novel algorithm framework is proposed to solve the bilevel problem: an efficient heuristic-based approach is developed to optimize the upper level task, while a global optimizer is utilized to tackle the lower level task. The proposed heuristic-based approach contains four key components: 1) peak detection; 2) peak allocation; 3) calculation of the next perturbation value; and 4) robustness interval fine-tuning, aiming to enhance the efficiency of searching for the target intervals. Finally, three types of artificial test problems and a practical problem are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm framework. The results show that all the robustness intervals can be successfully found when the goal solution is given by means of the proposed algorithm framework.},

  abstract     = {Differential evolution is a powerful nature-inspired real-parameter optimization algorithm that has been successfully used to solve a number of hard optimization problems. It has been used to tackle both continuous and discrete optimization problems. The application of a continuous method to discrete problems involves several challenges, including solution representation and search space–solution space mapping. In this work, we study random key encoding, a popular encoding scheme that is used to represent permutations in high-dimensional continuous spaces. We analyze the search space it constitutes, study its structure and properties, and introduce two novel modifications of the encoding. We investigate the proposed encoding strategies in the context of four variants of the differential evolution algorithm and demonstrate their usefulness for two widespread permutation problems: 1) the linear ordering problem and 2) the traveling salesman problem.},

  abstract     = {In recent decades, recommender systems have been well studied and widely applied. However, most recommenders unilaterally optimize the results from the buying customers’ views without considering expectations of other participants, e.g., merchants. Unfortunately, the expectations of customers and merchants in recommendation are different or even conflicted. Especially for popular group-trading markets, customers and merchants are competing in trading, i.e., customers want to meet their preferences or obtain gains with personal favorite items, while merchants want to recommend wholesale items with setting group-trading terms or conditions. In addition, some practical constraints are not fully considered by prior systems. In this article, we propose a cooperative–competitive evolutionary algorithm (i.e., CoEA) for the bidirectional recommendations in group-trading markets. Specifically, we, respectively, formalize two subproblems with designed objectives for two-sided participants in markets, and integrate the cooperative–competitive optimizations into one framework. Second, CoEA designs a binary encoding matrix for individual representation to integrate the two subproblems. Furthermore, by assembling game evolution process, CoEA designs cooperative–competitive evolution operators, i.e., the cooperative crossover and competitive mutation , which guide the solutions to equilibrium by, respectively, bridging communication between two populations of subproblems and optimizing distinctive objective in each population. Finally, we construct two real applications involving bidirectional recommendations, i.e., the group buying and P2P lending, and conduct extensive experiments with the real-world datasets. By comparing CoEA with several representative recommendation algorithms and evolutionary algorithms, the experimental results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of CoEA.},

  abstract     = {Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown outstanding results in different application tasks. However, the best performance is obtained when customized CNNs architectures are designed, which is labor intensive and requires highly specialized knowledge. Over three decades, neuroevolution (NE) has studied the application of evolutionary computation to optimize artificial neural networks (ANNs) at different levels. It is well known that the encoding of ANNs highly impacts the complexity of the search space and the optimization algorithms’ performance as well. As NE has rapidly advanced toward the optimization of CNNs topologies, researchers face the challenging duty of representing these complex networks. Furthermore, a compilation of the most widely used encoding methods is nonexistent. In response, we present a comprehensive review on the state-of-the-art of encodings for CNNs.},

  abstract     = {Visualizing the search behavior of a series of points or populations in their native domain is critical in understanding biases and attractors in an optimization process. Distance-based many-objective optimization test problems have been developed to facilitate visualization of search behavior in a 2-D design space with arbitrarily many objective functions. Previous works have proposed a few commonly seen problem characteristics into this problem framework, such as the definition of disconnected Pareto sets and dominance resistant regions of the design space. The authors’ previous work has advanced this research further by providing a problem generator to automatically create user-defined problem instances featuring any combination of these problem features as well as newly introduced ones, such as landscape discontinuities, varying objective ranges, and neutrality. This work makes a number of additional contributions including the proposal of an enhanced, open-source feature-rich problem generator that can create user-defined problem instances exhibiting a range of problem features—some of which are newly introduced here or form extensions of existing features. A comprehensive validation of the problem generator is also provided using popular multiobjective optimization algorithms, and some problem generator settings to create instances exhibiting different challenges for an optimizer are identified.},
