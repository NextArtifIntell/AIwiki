  abstract     = {This work mainly addresses continuous-time multiagent consensus networks where an adverse attacker affects the convergence performances of said protocol. In particular, we develop a novel secure-by-design approach in which the presence of a network manager monitors the system and broadcasts encrypted tasks (i.e., hidden edge weight assignments) to the agents involved. Each agent is then expected to decode the received codeword containing data on the task through appropriate decoding functions by leveraging advanced security principles, such as objective coding and information localization. Within this framework, a stability analysis is conducted for showing the robustness to channel tampering in the scenario where part of the codeword corresponding to a single link in the system is corrupted. A tradeoff between objective coding capability and network robustness is also pointed out. To support these novelties, an application example on decentralized estimation is provided. Moreover, an investigation of the robust agreement is as well extended in the discrete-time domain. Further numerical simulations are given to validate the theoretical results in both the time domains.},

The agents’ models are presented by strict-feedback nonlinear large-scale systems, but unlike the existing studies, unknown dynamics with feedback outputs are considered, and assumptions of polynomial-type nonlinearities for physical interconnection functions are relaxed. Initially, the observer of unmeasurable states via the outputs is designed. Then, ET augmented controllers are established to transform the physically interconnected system into isolated subsystems connected by a communication network. By utilizing the local information of each agent and adaptive dynamic programming (ADP), ET-distributed ${\boldsymbol {\mathcal {H}}_{\boldsymbol \infty }}$ optimal control laws and disturbance rejection laws are derived. The parameters of the ET observers and controllers are synchronously updated online by event-triggering mechanisms; thus, it reduces computational complexity and communication. It is guaranteed that the states in the closed dynamics are $L_{2}$ -gain bounded and the Zeno behavior is avoided. Additionally, the convergence of cost functions to the near-optimal values is accelerated by a concurrent learning technique, avoiding dependence on the online examination of the persistence of excitation conditions. Finally, the control performance of a nonholonomic multirobot system in a comparative simulation study shows that the proposed observers and controllers are effective.},

Moreover, we introduce a multivariate Gaussian prior for the sparse codes to achieve group sparsity, thereby substantially improving the classification performance. Furthermore, the sparse codes are estimated by a group-sparse Bayesian learning (GSBL) method, and the dictionary atoms are updated sequentially by maximizing a posterior. Moreover, to avoid manual parameter adjustment, the hyperparameters are optimized by an evidence maximization method. Accordingly, we develop a classification scheme via GSBL. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted on six benchmark datasets of face classification, object recognition, handwritten recognition, and scene categorization to substantiate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Feature selection has been considered as an effective method to solve imbalanced classification problems. It can be formulated as a multiobjective optimization problem (MOP) aiming to find a small feature subset while achieving a high classification accuracy. With traditional MOP, the focus is on deriving an optimal solution (i.e., a feature subset), while ignoring the diversity in solution space (e.g., there could exist multiple feature subsets achieving the same accuracy). Providing more options for feature selection would be beneficial since some features can be more difficult to obtain than others. In this work, we treat feature selection as a multimodal MOP (MMOP) whose goals are to find an excellent Pareto front in objective space and as many equivalent Pareto optimal solutions (feature subsets) as possible in feature space. Note that though several multimodal multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MMEAs) have been proposed, their use of a convergence-first selection criterion could cause the loss of solution diversity in an objective and feature space. To address the issue, a novel competition-driven mechanism is designed to assist the existing multimodal MMEAs in locating more equivalent feature subsets and a desired Pareto front. The effectiveness of the proposed mechanism is first verified on all 22 MMOPs from CEC2019. Then, the proposed method is applied to feature selection in imbalanced classification problems and a real-world application, i.e., credit card fraud detection. Experimental results show that the proposed mechanism can not only provide more equivalent feature subsets but also improve classification accuracy.},

Compared with traditional control strategies, the proposed control mechanism can not only save network bandwidth but also improve the cybersecurity of communications. Inspired by Halanay’s inequality, a new inequality is proposed, which can be effectively applied to the quasisynchronization problem for dynamical systems. Then, by using this inequality and the Lyapunov functional approach, quasisynchronization criteria are set for RDNNs. The desired control gain is gained from solving a group of linear matrix inequalities. Moreover, in the absence of deception attacks, the exponential synchronization problem is studied for RDNNs.

The main contributions lie in: 1) the article for the first time embeds the backstepping technique in designing a kind of discontinuous controller with proportional integral (PI) compensation and 2) with the help of Filippov’s theory, a new defined system described by differential inclusions can be first obtained by taking some transformations, and then a novel nonsmooth Lyapunov function approach along with its upper right Dini derivative technique is applied to complete the construction of the discontinuous controller.

In this study, an integrated data-driven framework applicable at the control level is proposed to deal with secure transmission and attack detection simultaneously. In the framework, a secure correlation-based encryption/decryption approach and a trustworthiness judgement approach are proposed. Comprehensive discussions are made regarding the analysis of the sensitivity to attacks, the introduced time delay, and the design degree-of-free. Executable algorithms are presented, corresponding to which hardware is modularized and can work standalone independent from the configuration of the monitoring and control systems or any third-party authentication agencies.

However, the conflicting nature between many objectives may lead to an imbalance between exploration and exploitation, resulting in a low efficiency in search for a set of optimal solutions that can well balance convergence and diversity. To meet this challenge, we propose an adaptive model management strategy assisted by two sets of reference vectors, one set of adaptive reference vectors accounting for convergence while the other set of fixed reference vectors for diversity. Specifically, we first propose a new acquisition function that calculates an amplified upper confidence bound (AUCB). Two optimization processes are performed in parallel to optimize the acquisition function, each based on one of the two sets of reference vectors. Then, we select one promising candidate solution according to diversity or convergence from the nondominated solutions obtained by the two optimization processes. The experimental results on four suites of test functions as well as six real-world application problems demonstrate the competitive performance of the proposed reference vector-assisted adaptive model management strategy, in comparison with seven state-of-the-art surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs).},

  abstract     = {Robot-assisted rehabilitation has been a promising solution to improve motor learning of neurologically impaired patients. State-of-the-art control strategies are typically limited to the ignorance of heterogeneous motor capabilities of poststroke patients and therefore intervene suboptimally. In this article, we propose a control framework for robot-assisted motor learning, emphasizing the detection of human intention, generation of reference trajectories, and modification of robotic assistance. A real-time trajectory generation algorithm is presented to extract the high-level features in active arm movements using an adaptive frequency oscillator (AFO) and then integrate the movement rhythm with the minimum-jerk principle to generate an optimal reference trajectory, which synchronizes with the motion intention in the patient as well as the motion pattern in healthy humans. In addition, a subject-adaptive assistance modification algorithm is presented to model the patient’s residual motor capabilities employing spatially dependent radial basis function (RBF) networks and then combining the RBF-based feedforward controller with the impedance feedback controller to provide only necessary assistance while simultaneously regulating the maximum-tolerated error during trajectory tracking tasks. We conduct simulation and experimental studies based on an upper limb rehabilitation robot to evaluate the overall performance of the motor-learning framework. A series of results showed that the difficulty level of reference trajectories was modulated to meet the requirements of subjects’ intended motion, furthermore, the robotic assistance was compliantly optimized in response to the changing performance of subjects’ motor abilities, highlighting the potential of adopting our framework into clinical application to promote patient-led motor learning.},

A general distributed consensus error model is first developed to formulate the formation behavior of the networked quadrotor aircraft. Then, by using adaptive techniques, virtual position control strategies are proposed to eliminate the impacts of perturbations, so that the following quadrotor aircraft can boundedly track the desired position trajectory with a satisfying pattern. Furthermore, based on the designed virtual position control strategies, the attitude reference angles are constructed and adaptive attitude control strategies are further designed to guarantee that the attitude angles track the reference angles asymptotically. In terms of the asymptotic tracking results of attitude control systems, the bounded consensus formation results are obtained based on the Lyapunov stability theorem. Numerical simulations are carried out to verify the efficiency of the designed position formation as well as attitude tracking control strategies of the networked quadrotor aircraft.},

Second, we take full advantage of the reduced-order filter to address the fault detection problem for FSMJSs, in which the stochastic failure phenomenon is injected into the reduced-order filter. Besides, the logarithmic quantizer is employed to tackle the limited bandwidth problem in a communication channel. Consequently, the new sufficient conditions are developed based on the Lyapunov theory to obtain the desired reduced-order filter.

Here, we show that critical links can not only contribute to structural controllability but can also have a significant impact on the structural predictability of networks, suggesting the universal pattern of structural reciprocity in directed networks. In addition, it is shown that the fraction and location of critical links have a strong influence on the performance of prediction algorithms. Moreover, these empirical results are interpreted by introducing the link centrality based on corresponding line graphs.

This article contributes to that foundation in two ways. First, it identifies the core elements of CES development processes (CESDPs) through a literature review. Then, it proposes the ComplEX System Integrated Utilities Model (CESIUM), a novel framework for exploring how numerous system and development process characteristics may affect the performance of CES. CESIUM creates abstract representations of a system architecture, the corresponding engineering organization, and the new product development process through which the organization designs the system. It does so by representing the system as a network of interdependent artifacts designed by agents. Simulated agents iteratively design their artifacts through optimization and share information with other agents, thereby advancing the CES toward a solution. Hence, this article makes it possible for researchers to compare how development process characteristics shape system outcomes.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, high-throughput screening (HTS) systems are widely used in pharmaceutical industries and laboratories for the discovery of new drugs and biomedical substances. It is important to efficiently schedule them so as to reduce the cost. In the operation of an HTS system, a microplate may visit some resources more than once and complex time window constraints are imposed on some activities and activity sequences. Moreover, with the consistency requirement, a one-microplate cyclic schedule is necessary. Thus, its scheduling problem is very challenging. This article studies the scheduling problem of an HTS system for an enzymatic assay, a typical application of HTSs, from the perspective of control theory. The system is modeled by resource-oriented Petri nets (ROPNs). With the model, necessary and sufficient conditions under which a feasible cyclic schedule exists are established. Then, we determine how many microplates should be in the system for concurrent processing and the transition firing sequence to obtain the activity sequence for an optimal and feasible schedule. In this way, a feasible and optimal cyclic schedule can be found by very simple computations, which shows that polynomial algorithms for an optimal schedule exist, while the existing studies apply mathematical programming with exponential computation complexity. Also, its efficient implementation is given.},

To narrow this gap, in this article, we propose a novel perspective-corrected spatial REG (PcSREG) approach for human–robot interaction (HRI) by considering the selection of reference frames. The task of REG is simplified into the process of generating diverse spatial relation units. First, we pick out all landmarks in these spatial relation units according to the entropy of preference and allow its updating through a stack model. Then, all possible referring expressions are generated according to different reference frame strategies. Finally, we evaluate every expression using a probabilistic referring expression resolution model and find the best expression that satisfies both of the appropriateness and effectiveness. We implement the proposed approach on a robot system and empirical experimental results show that our approach can generate more effective spatial referring expressions for practical applications.},

There exist some methods to solve this problem, such as hybrid-sampling, over-sampling, and under-sampling. Each method has its own advantage, and different methods generally provide some complementary knowledge. We want to combine these three methods at the decision level in an appropriate way for achieving as good as possible classification performance. Evidence theory is expert at representing and combining uncertain information. So a new method called an evidential combination of classifiers (ECC) is proposed for dealing with imbalanced data. The classification result generated by different strategies (i.e., hybrid-sampling, over-sampling, or under-sampling) may have different reliabilities for query patterns. A cautious reliability evaluation rule is developed for each classification result based on the close neighborhoods. After that, the classification result is revised with a new belief redistribution way according to the reliability evaluation, and the probability/belief of one class can be partially transferred to other classes as well as the total ignorance, which is defined by the whole frame of classes. By doing this, we can reduce the error risk of each classification method. Then, the revised classification results from different methods are combined by evidence theory to make the final class decision. The effectiveness of the ECC method has been demonstrated using several experiments, and it shows that ECC can effectively improve the classification performance comparing with other related methods.},

This article addresses the verification of current-state opacity of a discrete event system modeled with Petri nets, where the secret is defined as a set of states. The existing methods cannot deal with large-sized systems due to the curse of dimensionality. Multi-valued decision diagrams (MDDs) are widely accepted as an efficient and compact data structure for representing the extremely large reachability sets of Petri nets. We show that MDDs can be used in Petri nets with partial observable transitions and propose an approach for the verification of current-state opacity for bounded Petri nets.

In the present article, we develop a novel dual Kalman-type filter, referred to as DEKF under minimum error entropy (MEE) with fiducial points (MEEFs-DEKF) to deal with the non-Gaussian noises. First, the equivalent state-space model and parameter-space model are presented based on the MVAR model. Then, an optimality criterion based on MEE with fiducial points (MEEFs) is applied in the batch-mode regression equation to improve the robustness. Finally, a fixed-point iteration algorithm gives the posterior estimates of state and parameter. Simulation results confirm that the proposed MEEF-DEKF can achieve excellent performance in various noises with different distributions, especially in heavy-tailed and multimodal noises.},

The state of the concerned system is affected by possibly (fast) time-varying uncertainty. The fuzzy set theory is adopted to describe such uncertainty. The task is to drive the system to obey a set of prescribed constraints optimally. Since the control objective may be changing along with the system uncertainty, a time-varying $\beta $ -measure is defined to gauge the constraint-following error; based on which, an adaptive robust control scheme with two tunable parameters is then proposed to render it to be uniform boundedness and uniform ultimate boundedness. For the seeking of the optimal design parameters, two cost functions, each of which is dominated by one tunable parameter, are developed with the fuzzy information, and thereout a two-player cooperative game is formulated. Finally, the optimal design problem is successfully solved: with the existence, uniqueness, and analytical expression of the Pareto optimality.},

  abstract     = {We propose a novel semi-supervised learning (SSL) assumption—the high separation probability (HSP) assumption—that is complementary to the common low density separation (LDS) assumption, and a highly accurate and efficient SSL algorithm, the transductive minimax probability machine (TMPM). Under the HSP assumption, a preferred classifier should ensure that with high probability the samples are far away from the decision boundary. Similarly, the LDS assumption states that the decision boundary should lie in a low-density region. A remarkable property of HSP is that it provides an elegant theoretical framework for analyzing the generalization performance of SSL, while it remains difficult for the LDS assumption to have a quantitative criterion on how it fits the data. Moreover, it has the same paradigm as the minimax probability machine (MPM) and yields an intractable mixed-integer optimization for solving the transductive label assignment problem. Consequently, we propose TMPM with a label-switching strategy and iterative manner to formalize our approximate solution. Theoretically, we analyze the computational complexity, convergence property, and generalization error bound of TMPM. Empirically, we show that TMPM achieves competitive performance on a wide range of datasets, while being almost one order of magnitude faster than existing SSL approaches.},

Due to the physical characteristics of space tether by nature, there exists no control inputs on the in-plane/out-of-plane channels of the tether; therefore, the postcapture tethered system is a typical multiinput and multioutput underactuated system. In this article, we propose an energy-based controller for the underactuated system subject to input saturation and the nonnegativity constraint of the tether tension. First, we give the dynamic model of the postcapture tethered system, with consideration of the three attitude angles of the postcapture combination, the in-plane/out-of-plane angles, and the tether length. Second, we list the analysis process of the system’s equilibrium points. Third, we give the detailed controller design process, and verify the stability of the system by invoking the Lyapunov techniques and the extended Barbalat’s lemma. Finally, numerical simulations and comparison results with the hierarchical sliding mode controller are conducted to validate the performance improvement of the developed control strategy.},

  abstract     = {Randomized neural networks (NNs), such as random vector functional link (RVFL) and extreme learning machine (ELM), have been widely applied in various classification problems owing to their computational efficiency and universal approximation capability. However, such approaches are designed for regular Euclidean data and lack the ability to generalize to complex structured data. Moreover, their randomly generated parameters often lead to a suboptimal decision boundary with a growing requirement of hidden neurons. In this article, we first propose a plain framework, termed randomized graph convolutional networks (RGCNs), to generalize the classic randomized NNs to the non-Euclidean domain. Then, a hybrid framework called evolution-driven RGCN (EvoRGCN) is presented by using adaptive differential evolution with novelty search strategy to seek the globally optimal graph embedding for the plain RGCN. Finally, we recast the classic ELM and RVFL under the proposed frameworks, resulting in four novel semi-supervised models, including the plain models [i.e., graph convolutional extreme learning machines (GCELMs) and graph convolutional RVFL (GCRVFL)] and the optimized models (i.e., O-GCELM and O-GCRVFL). We show that our approaches are the natural generalization of the traditional randomized NNs in the non-Euclidean domain. Furthermore, our approaches not only retain the advantages of the classic approaches but also enable them to handle graph data. We compare our approaches against many existing methods across regular datasets and graph benchmarks, demonstrating that the proposed approaches dramatically outperform the compared methods with better generalization ability and robustness. Particularly, we quantitatively show the performance ranking of different randomized NNs, i.e., O-GCRVFL $&amp;gt; $ O-GCELM $\approx $ GCRVFL $&amp;gt; $ GCELM $\approx $ RVFL $&amp;gt; $ ELM.},

This article considers reduced-order high-gain observer (ROHGO)-based neural tracking control on random nonlinear systems having output delay. In order to foster the design and analysis, the estimated states and the estimation errors are scaled by the high gain of the observer. Based on neural network (NN) approximation and state observation, an adaptive controller is designed for the overall system using the backstepping method. It is proved that all the closed-loop signals are bounded almost surely, letting alone the tracking error. By tuning the related design parameters, the asymptotic tracking error could be regulated arbitrarily small. Within the best of our knowledge, this article serves as the first attempt for NN-based control on RDE systems. Finally, the validity of main results is confirmed by a simulation example.},

  abstract     = {This article presents a novel secure-control framework against sensor deception attacks. The vulnerability of cyber-physical systems with respect to sensor deceptive attacks makes that all sensor measurements are not reliable until the system security is assured by an attack detection module. Most of the active attack detection strategies require some time to assess the system security, while injecting a watermark signal to ease the detection. However, the injection of watermark signals deteriorates the performance and stability of the plant. The proposed control framework consists of a dual-rate control (DRC) that is able to stabilize the plant using: 1) a model predictive controller that operates at a slower sampling time; 2) a state-feedback predictor-based controller that operates in the nominal sampling time disregarding the use of the untrustworthy measurements until the attack detector is able to certify the security; and 3) a reconfiguration block (RB) for palliating the effect of the watermarking. Simulation results indicate the efficacy of the proposed DRC framework to defend the system from cyber-attacks and the ability of the RB to improve the closed-loop performance during the watermark injection.},

For the purpose of finding different roots within a limited computational budget in a single run simultaneously, in this article, a hybrid niching-based differential evolution with two archives, referred to as HNDE/2A, is proposed. It can be featured as: 1) two niching techniques, i.e., crowding and speciation, are combined to balance the diversity and convergence; 2) a root archive is used to save the found roots during the run. Additionally, if a root is saved into the root archive, it will be reinitialized immediately to further promote the population diversity; and 3) an inferior offspring archive is presented to utilize the useful information of the inferior offspring. To evaluate the performance of our proposal, 30 problems are chosen as the test suite. Moreover, HNDE/2A is also used to solve two real-world problems. Compared with other algorithms, HNDE/2A yields better results in terms of the root ratio and the success rate with a less computational budget.},

  abstract     = {Deep convolution neural network and its ensemble variant-based classification methods of P300 in the Devanagari script (DS)-based P300 speller (DS-P3S) have generated numerous training parameters. This is likely to increase the problems like computational complexity and overfitting. The recent attempts of researchers to overcome these problems are further deteriorating the accuracy due to the dense connectivity and channel-mix group convolution. Moreover, compressing the deep models in these attempts also found losing vital information. Therefore, to mitigate these problems, an efficient compact classification model called “DS-P3SNet” along with a knowledge distillation (KD) and transfer learning (TL) is proposed in this article. It includes: 1) extraction of rich morphological information across temporal region; 2) combination of channelwise and channel-mix-depthwise convolution (C2-DwCN) for efficient channel selection and extraction of spatial information with less number of trainable parameters; 3) channelwise convolution (Cw-CN) for classification to provide sparse connectivity; 4) knowledge distillation to reduce the tradeoff between accuracy and the number of trainable parameters; and 5) subject-to-subject transfer of learning to reduce subject variability. The trial-to-trial transfer of learning to reduce the tradeoff between the number of trials and accuracy. The experimentations were performed on a self-generated dataset of 20 words comprising of 79 DS characters collected from ten volunteer healthy subjects. An average accuracy of $95.32~{\pm }~0.85$\% and $94.64~{\pm }~0.68$\% were obtained for subject-dependent and subject-independent experiments, respectively. The trainable parameters were also reduced approximately by 2–34 times compared to existing models with improved or equivalent performance.},

By taking the quantities of goods transmitted between different nodes as control inputs, a new kind of learning control scheme is subsequently proposed to discuss the stability of the nodes’ states within the SCN. It is further shown that the convergence speed of nodes’ states with this scheme is faster than that yielded by using some traditional schemes.

  abstract     = {In this article, the control approach based on structured input–output finite-time stability (IO-FTS) is extended to tackle the reference tracking problem. IO-FTS was originally introduced to deal with the disturbance rejection problem. By applying the finite-time stability control to a properly augmented system, we show that it is possible to enforce a set of specific requirements on the response of the closed-loop system during the transients, taking also into account saturation constraints on the actuators. Adding IO-FTS constraints to classic-state-feedback control law leads to a feasibility problem with bilinear matrix inequality (BMI) constraints. Herein, we show how the original BMI problem can be relaxed to a linear matrix inequality (LMI) one, which comes at a price of more conservatism, but turns out to be computationally more efficient. To prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we consider the case of the longitudinal control of a missile.},

It is shown that a new class of bipartite containment fluctuation behaviors emerges in the presence of the ELF framework, regardless of any structure conditions for CANs. In particular, the leaders are clustered into separate groups, each of which can realize the modulus consensus, whereas the followers may not be enabled to converge but fluctuate within the bounded region spanned by all leaders’ states and their symmetric states.

However, the main drawback of these methods lies in their proneness to infeasible local minima, especially in complex environments. To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel motion planning method that represents trajectories as samples from a mixture of continuous-time Gaussian processes (MGP) and employs stochastic optimization in order to update the MGP parameters in a cost-minimizing manner. The contributions of the proposed trajectory optimization method arise from the introduced mixture representation and stochastic gradient estimation, dominantly enabling better exploration of the trajectory space and including nondifferentiable optimizing costs. We evaluated the proposed method in multiple simulation benchmarks featuring 7 degree-of-freedom (DOF) robot arms and a 10DOF mobile manipulator. We also conducted a real-world experiment with a 14DOF dual-arm robot. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method achieves higher success rate than several state-of-the-art methods, while the advantages stemming from MGPs and stochastic optimization, like trajectory smoothness, support of nondifferentiable cost functions, multiple trajectory solutions, and the ability to tackle high-dimensional planning problems, are inherently kept.},

  abstract     = {This article proposes a novel data reconstruction method, called projective cross-reconstruction (PCR) for cross-domain recognition. The intrinsic philosophy behind PCR is that the data from different domains but with the same label have a strong correlation and thus they can be reconstructed with each other. To this end, we first rearrange the data of source and target domains to form two new cross-data matrices, and the data with the same label but from different domains can be arranged together. Then, we use two different projection matrices to project the new cross-data into two approximate subspaces and perform the cross-reconstruction without introducing any extra matrix as the reconstruction coefficient matrix. This guarantees that the data from different domains can be interlaced well and the data from different domains but sharing the same label can be aligned together. In doing so, the problem of cross-domain distribution mismatch is solved and a discriminative and transferrable feature representation can be obtained. Moreover, PCR integrates the classifier learning and feature representation learning into a unified framework so that these two tasks can be iteratively improved until the termination condition is met. Extensive experiments on six datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed PCR, compared with the state-of-the-art methods.},

Confidentiality constraints are also an issue. This article presents a decentralized fault diagnosis method that only requires the knowledge of local models and limited knowledge of their neighboring subsystems. The method, implemented in the decentralized diagnoser design ( $D^{3}$ ) algorithm, is based on structural analysis and can advantageously be applied to high-dimensional systems, linear or nonlinear. Using the concept of isolation on request, a hierarchy is built according to diagnostic objectives. The resulting diagnoser is based on analytical redundancy relations (ARRs) generated along the hierarchy. Their number is optimized via binary integer linear programming (BILP) while still guaranteeing maximal diagnosability at each level. $D^{3}$ proves of lower time complexity than its centralized equivalent.

First, the consensus problem of first-order MAS is mostly solved by linear matrix inequality (LMI) without consideration of energy loss. To overcome these difficulties, an adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) technique is fit to solve the consensus problem and similar formation control problem for second-order MAS by the establishment of a performance index function. Besides, we introduce the generalized policy iteration (GPI) algorithm as a kind of ADP technique without the problem of low convergence speed and high computational complexity. Combined with previous works, it can be found that our proposed structure can be extended to high-order cases based on the structure of local neighborhood formation error and algorithm. Afterward, the convergence analysis, optimality analysis, and stability analysis are given. Neural networks (NNs) are also implemented to approximate the iterative control policies and value functions, respectively. Moreover, we realize that many collisions may occur in the formation control problem. Inspired by the idea of the artificial potential field (APF) technique, the concept of the repulsive force field is introduced based on our proposed learning-based structure to avoid collisions simply and efficiently.

  abstract     = {The existing fault diagnosis methods of rotating machinery constructed with both shallow learning and deep learning models are mostly based on vibration analysis under steady rotating speed. However, the rotating speed frequently changes to meet practical engineering needs. The shallow learning models largely depend on domain experience of feature extraction, and training a deep learning model requires large samples and a long time. In addition, vibration monitoring has the shortcomings of contact measurement, small coverage, and noise interference. To address these problems, this article proposes a new fault diagnosis method with the least square interactive support matrix machine (LSISMM) and infrared thermal images. In this method, a novel matrix-form classifier called LSISMM is constructed under the concept of nonparallel interactive hyperplanes to fully leverage the structure information of infrared thermal images. To improve the computation efficiency, a new least square loss constraint is designed for LSISMM. Besides, we derive an effective solution framework based on the alternating direction method of the multiplier (ADMM) framework. The constructed LSISMM is directly used to analyze the collected thermal images of rotating machinery under time-varying speeds. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed method is superior to state-of-the-art methods in terms of diagnosis accuracy and efficiency, especially under small thermal image samples.},

In classic robust tube-based MPC approaches, an open-loop control sequence is computed via periodically solving an online nominal MPC problem, which requires prior model information and frequent access to onboard computational resources. In this article, we propose an efficient robust MPC solution based on receding horizon reinforcement learning, called r-LPC, for unknown nonlinear systems with state constraints and disturbances. The proposed r-LPC utilizes a Koopman operator-based prediction model obtained offline from precollected input–output datasets. Unlike classic tube-based MPC, in each prediction time interval of r-LPC, we use an actor–critic structure to learn a near-optimal feedback control policy rather than a control sequence. The resulting closed-loop control policy can be learned offline and deployed online or learned online in an asynchronous way. In the latter case, online learning can be activated whenever necessary; for instance, the safety constraint is violated with the deployed policy. The closed-loop recursive feasibility, robustness, and asymptotic stability are proven under function approximation errors of the actor–critic networks. Simulation and experimental results on two nonlinear systems with unknown dynamics and disturbances have demonstrated that our approach has better or comparable performance when compared with tube-based MPC and linear quadratic regulator, and outperforms a recently developed actor–critic learning approach.},

However, such a field is still relatively unexplored, particularly for microscopic control objects, such as intersections and coordinated intersection groups. This article proposes a human-in-the-loop recommendation system for strategic urban traffic management, which follows an agent-based structure. A regional agent dispatcher is defined to assign agents for operation whenever “operation on-demand” is required. Such a requirement is identified by a daily-dependent operational mode on strategic traffic operations at a control object level. The strategic management scheme for each control object is guided by a strategic agent (customized), which is essentially a deep recommender model with a specific architecture. By featuring the multiagent design, a customized operational scheme can be generated at the intersection level, which instructs the corresponding controller to take specific operations. The utility of the recommendation system is demonstrated via a case study using real-world traffic data. In both offline and online evaluations, the system performs consistently at traffic operational recommendations in different scenarios and has the potential to provide more reasonable traffic operational strategies than a human-operated system.},

  abstract     = {The separable nonlinear least-squares (SNLLS) problems considered in this article frequently appear in a wide range of research fields, such as machine learning, computer vision, system identification, and signal processing. The variable projection algorithm proposed by Golub and Pereyra, which reduces the dimension of the parameters by projecting the linear parameters out of the problem, is quite valuable in solving SNLLS problems. Previous implementations of the variable projection algorithm are based on matrix factorization. In this article, we propose an iterative implementation of the variable projection algorithm. Compared with previous implementations based on matrix decomposition, the proposed method can effectively avoid suffering from large condition number of the matrix or even matrix decomposition failure when dealing with ill-posed SNLLS problems. Numerical experiments on real-world data and synthetic data show the efficiency and robustness of the proposed iterative variable projection algorithm.},

Because the control signal is discontinuous in the quantized control and event-triggered control, many existing methods to deal with the input delay are no longer applicable. Through constructing an auxiliary tracking error and an auxiliary system, the input-quantized control is implemented for nonlinear systems with unknown control gain and unknown input delay. With the well-designed Lyapunov–Krasovskii functionals and the linear growth condition of input delay, the stability analysis is achieved. The studied method is also applicable to the event-triggered control for systems possessing unknown input delay. The stability analysis shows that all the signals are semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB). The use of dynamic surface control (DSC) effectively simplifies the controller structure. The quantized and event-triggered control simulations illustrate that the proposed schemes are effective.},

  abstract     = {Many inverse problems in machine learning, system identification, and image processing include nuisance parameters, which are important for the recovering of other parameters. Separable nonlinear optimization problems fall into this category. The special separable structure in these problems has inspired several efficient optimization strategies. A well-known method is the variable projection (VP) that projects out a subset of the estimated parameters, resulting in a reduced problem that includes fewer parameters. The expectation maximization (EM) is another separated method that provides a powerful framework for the estimation of nuisance parameters. The relationships between EM and VP were ignored in previous studies, though they deal with a part of parameters in a similar way. In this article, we explore the internal relationships and differences between VP and EM. Unlike the algorithms that separate the parameters directly, the hierarchical identification algorithm decomposes a complex model into several linked submodels and identifies the corresponding parameters. Therefore, this article also studies the difference and connection between the hierarchical algorithm and the parameter-separated algorithms like VP and EM. In the numerical simulation part, Monte Carlo experiments are performed to further compare the performance of different algorithms. The results show that the VP algorithm usually converges faster than the other two algorithms and is more robust to the initial point of the parameters.},

  abstract     = {Verification is a critical process in the development of engineered systems. Through verification, engineers gain confidence in the correct functionality of the system before it is deployed into operation. Traditionally, verification strategies are fixed at the beginning of the system’s development and verification activities (VAs) are executed as the development progresses. Such an approach appears to give inferior results as the selection of the VAs does not leverage information gained through the system’s development process. In contrast, a set-based design (SBD) approach to verification, where VAs are dynamically selected as the system’s development progresses, has been shown to provide superior results. However, its application under realistic engineering scenarios remains unproven due to the large size of the verification tradespace. In this work, we propose a parallel tempering approach (PTA) to efficiently explore the verification tradespace. First, we formulate an exploration of the verification tradespace as a tree search problem. Second, we design a parallel tempering (PT) algorithm by simulating several replicas of the verification process at different temperatures to obtain a near-optimal result. Third, We apply the PT algorithm to all possible verification states to dynamically identify near-optimal results. The effectiveness of the proposed PTA is evaluated on a partial model of a notional satellite optical instrument.},

With no gradient computations, the DSS technique is able to achieve comparable accuracy but with a significant reduction in computational times by a factor of more than 370 compared with the existing Bayesian A-optimality (BAO) technique. The BAO technique, in general, attains higher estimation accuracy for oscillatory systems whereas the DSS approach is superior for systems with smoother impulse responses. The DSS method possesses further advantages of simplicity of implementation and low crest factor due to the signal being binary.

Different from the existing works, a novel adaptive tracking control algorithm is proposed with asymmetric time-varying constraints and dynamic event-triggering mechanism. First, to constrain the state variable within given time-varying boundaries, a novel predefined-time performance function is constructed. Second, a novel barrier function related to state variable is constructed, by means of which the state variable is directly constrained within the asymmetric time-varying boundaries without the virtual controller. In addition, by establishing a novel dynamic function, we propose a dynamic event-triggering mechanism, and then design controller accordingly, which can reduce computation burdens and save the network resources. By the aid of the Lyapunov stability theory, it is proved that the system tracking error converges to an adjustable bounded set in probability in a finite time and all state variables are successfully constrained into the asymmetric time-varying boundaries. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm is verified by a simulation example.},

With the aid of a co-positive Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional (CLKF), sufficient conditions ensuring the exponential stability almost surely (ES a.s.) of the SDPSs without control is studied, where the mode is not necessary to be stable. After that, a mode-dependent controller with switching delay is designed to stabilize the SDPSs in the case that there are unstable subsystems. An algorithm is provided to design the control gains. It is discovered that the mode in the closed-loop SDPSs is not required to be stable on synchronous and asynchronous switching intervals. Numerical simulations verify the merits of the new results.},

In this article, we study an approximate optimal magnetic control strategy for a one-dimensional (1-D) magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) system with uncertainty quantification within the learning framework of the underlying MHD model. First, the MHD flow system is modeled by coupled partial differential equations (PDEs) wherein the Reynolds number is not deterministic but random. Then, the optimal magnetic control problem is formulated and reduced to a parameter selection problem with stochastic PDE constraints by means of the control parameterization method. Significantly different from the conventional sensitivity analysis and adjoint methods, a polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) based on a multifidelity model is developed to construct the underlying PDEs model by polynomial functions. Thus, the relationship between the objective function and the control sequence is derived explicitly, which, in turn, transforms the optimal parameter selection problem with stochastic PDE constraints into a typical algebraic optimization problem that can be easily solved by the existing nonlinear programming algorithm. Numerical simulations are illustrated to demonstrate the high performance of our proposed method.},

Discrete events of system-state transfer are expressed by event tracking and clustering in the form of contiguous quanta of data. This approach is capable of describing typical processes in industrial systems in a chain of codes that contain system input/output parameters. The constituent nodes of the Markovian Processes chain form a series akin to genes in the deoxyribonucleic acid, repeatable and predictable. The process genes are the quanta of information that aligns to represent a chain of activities (process). They describe the causal links between occurring events forming a pattern (pathway) that leads to a well-specified output (e.g., a product with a defect or otherwise). The creation of process genomics requires the knowledge of system observed or latent parameters (state) as well as the state change at specified time intervals (discretization). The process genomics theory is tested in an industrial case study for quality assessment and control of glue dispensing in micro-semiconductor manufacturing. The resulting definitions of the system state and interrelationship of control parameters contribute to the development of the process genes. The outcome of the gene alignment is the geometric interpretation of the glue droplet formation. A predicted or observed droplet within the production tolerance leads to a nondefective product. The principle of creating production genomics is to find and rectify the defect-causing genes or to disrupt the sequences that lead to producing defective products, leading to a zero-defect manufacturing process.},

Due to the decentralized nature of dynamical networks, and inaccessibility or high control cost, in some applications, it is desired to employ pinning control techniques. A natural question that comes to mind is how one can select the proper pinned nodes and their feedback gains, (i.e., the performance metrics) to optimize the convergence rate to the homogeneous stationary state (i.e., the performance index) while the total pinning cost is kept below a given limit. This optimization problem has been converted into a semidefinite programming problem, and the optimal feedback gains have been derived analytically. Based on these results, for a given set of pinned nodes, an algorithm for determining the optimal feedback gains has been developed. Furthermore, it is shown that the edges between the pinned nodes do not impact the optimal results, and adding an edge between free nodes or between free and pinned nodes modifies the optimal convergence rate in nondecreasing order. Based on the derived analytical results, several interesting properties have been discovered. For symmetric networks, the nodes within a vertex orbit have the same optimal feedback gains, which are independent of the edges within each vertex orbit. For a number of topologies, closed-form formulas are provided for the optimal results. For a network of Chua systems, the impact of cut number is illustrated by comparing the optimal results for different topologies.},

For this goal, the nonlinear engagement model is first transformed to a set of new differential equations in terms of the line-of-sight (LOS) angles. Then, the approach angle constraints are handled by constructing two reference range profiles as cubic polynomials of LOS angles. By solving the unknown coefficients involved in the polynomials, a semianalytical 3-D guidance solution is derived from the second-order range dynamics. To meet the FOV limit and avoid the initial guidance saturation, the achievable approach angle set is determined for capturability analysis by introducing the look angle dynamics with respect to the range profiles. The technique does not involve the model linearization, guidance switching logic, constant velocity assumption, and LOS rate information. Notably, only the LOS angle measurement is required during the guidance process once the initial conditions are provided, which makes it preferable for vehicles equipped with passive angles-only sensors. Extensive numerical simulations and Monte Carlo test are conducted to validate effectiveness and robustness of the proposed technique.},

  abstract     = {Prompt online detection of anomalies induced by malicious attacks enhances the efficacy of real-time operation and mitigation of attack, an indispensable part of any cyber-physical system (CPS) management. This article proposes a novel online rapid detection scheme that continuously monitors the data packet stream and infers the sequence of probability distributions, estimated as histograms, and alerts when a change in the histogram is detected, reporting both the attack as well as an estimate of its instant of commencement. A statistical data-driven attack model is proposed and employed that is general enough to represent two ubiquitous types of attacks on CPS: 1) replay and 2) bias-injection. The proposed detection framework relies on the fact that CPSs possess well-defined dynamics that are affected by quasistationary noise, which allows the histogram sequences of the system data packets to converge (to different distributions under the presence of the attack versus the absence of attack). The proposed online scheme detects an attack, and estimates the attack commencement time by relying on the computed distance between real-time estimated histogram versus apriori learned nominal histogram. Our formulation further sheds light on two different attack initiation-time-based subcases, “early” (attack starts before sufficient data of nominal behavior was collected to allow its histogram sequence to be closer to its nominal value) versus “late.” The designed algorithm of our scheme has linear time complexities in the dimension of data packets and algorithm parameters, which makes it suited for rapid detection.

  abstract     = {Distributed population dynamics offer a game-theoretical framework for distributed decision making. As such, the application of these methods to the control of networked systems has been widely studied in the literature. The theoretical analyses available in the literature have only considered continuous-time formulations of distributed population dynamics. However, given that modern computers can only process information in a discrete-time fashion, the practical implementation of distributed population dynamics-based methods is inevitably discrete. In consequence, it is paramount to extend the available theory to a more implementable discrete-time approach. For that reason, in this article, we provide a discrete-time analysis of a general class of distributed population dynamics, and we derive sufficient conditions on the discretization time to ensure the asymptotic stability of the discretized dynamics. To illustrate the relevance and performance of the proposed methods, we apply the developed theory to distributed optimization and control problems, including a real multirobot platform, which consider noncomplete communication networks and coupled constraints.},

The main contributions are summarized as follows: 1) globally Lipschitz condition, as required in many existing literatures, is not needed in this article; 2) for each agent, only one filtered output signal is required to be broadcast to its neighbors, which can effectively relieve network transmission burden; 3) the distributed adaptive controllers and event-triggered conditions are co-designed based on a single Lyapunov function such that continuous monitoring of neighbors’ states is not needed; and 4) by introducing an exponential convergence term to the designed triggering condition, Zeno behavior is avoided while all the agents’ outputs can reach asymptotically leaderless consensus. Moreover, to easily implement the designed triggering condition and further reduce the triggering frequency when the consensus errors converge to the neighborhood of origin, a switching type of triggering condition is presented and bounded consensus can be guaranteed. Simulation results are given to validate the presented distributed consensus control scheme.},

However, the noises in gas sensors hinder the acquisition of such features. In order to solve this problem, this article proposes a stable feature extraction algorithm which takes the impulse response of the e-nose system as the feature. The impulse response is estimated from a nonparametric model constrained by a multiscale wavelet kernel regularization matrix. The kernel regularization matrix equips the proposed feature extraction method with an ability in resistance to random noise. A numerical experiment proves that compared with single-scale kernel regularization, the use of multiscale wavelet kernel helps to achieve more stable and accurate impulse response estimation. Then, a field experiment is conducted to demonstrate the performance of the proposed features. This experiment aims to identify four different whiskies measured by a self-designed e-nose with four commercial gas sensors. Under the framework of transfer learning, the classification result based on the proposed features outperforms those using other considered features. The accuracy of whisky identification reaches 92.00\%, showing a good potential of applying the proposed feature representations in the area of e-noses.},

  abstract     = {Learning from imbalanced data is an important and challenging topic in machine learning. Many works have devised methods to cope with imbalanced data, but most methods only consider minority or majority classes without considering the relationship between the two classes. In addition, many synthetic minority oversampling technique-based methods generate synthetic samples from the original feature space and use the Euclidean distance to search for the nearest neighbors. However, the Euclidean distance is not a precise distance metric in a high-dimensional space. This article proposes a novel method, called deep density hybrid sampling (DDHS), to address imbalanced data problems. The proposed method learns an embedding network to project the data samples into a low-dimensional separable latent space. The goal is to preserve class proximity during data projection, and we use within-class and between-class concepts to devise loss functions. We propose to use density as a criterion to select minority and majority samples. Subsequently, we apply a feature-level approach to the selected minority samples and generate diverse and valid synthetic samples for the minority class. This work conducts extensive experiments to assess our proposed method and compare it with several methods. The experimental results show that the proposed method can yield promising and stable results. The proposed method is a data-level algorithm, and we combine the proposed method with the boosting technique to develop a method called DDHS-boosting. We compare DDHS-boosting with several ensemble methods, and DDHS-boosting shows promising results.},

Then, a novel attack and compensation model is proposed to display the randomly occurring behaviors of the DoS attacks and the deception attacks within a unified framework. Furthermore, a distributed multisensor fusion estimation (DMSFE) algorithm is presented. An explicit form of dimensionality reduction is designed against attacks. Stability conditions are derived such that the mean square errors (MSEs) of the proposed DMSFE are bounded.

Under the control of the designed method, the output is limited to a given region, and the system is proved to be closed-loop stable with the assistance of Lyapunov’s theorem of stability.

  abstract     = {Underactuated systems are widely applied in industry, construction, manufacturing, etc., and the complex working environment puts forward higher demands for safety and transient performance. Hence, it is necessary to consider how to simultaneously ensure actuated and unactuated motion constraints by fewer control inputs, especially when systems suffer from model uncertainties, unavailable velocities, etc. Unfortunately, it is still a significant challenge to overcome in real applications and theoretical analysis. Additionally, most existing studies merely consider the specific control objects and few general methods are applicable to a class of underactuated systems. To this end, we design a new adaptive output-feedback controller for a class of uncertain underactuated systems. Compared with existing methods only handling actuated constraints, an important merit of this article is that by introducing the elaborately designed coupling term composed of actuated and unactuated constraints together, all state variables are kept within the preset time-variant ranges and converge to their desired values. Furthermore, a new Lyapunov function candidate is utilized to provide a theoretical guarantee. As far as we know, without the need of exact model knowledge and velocity feedback, this article provides the first solution to achieve accurate motion control and state constraints for both actuated and unactuated variables, which is meaningful both theoretically and practically. Meanwhile, the asymptotic stability of the equilibrium point for the closed-loop system is proven by utilizing Lyapunov techniques and Barbalat’s lemma. For verification, the presented controller is applied to underactuated overhead and rotary cranes, respectively, together with detailed theoretical analysis and experimental validations.},

  abstract     = {Recently, hashing-based multimodal learning systems have received increasing attention due to their query efficiency and parsimonious storage costs. However, impeded by the quantization loss caused by numerical optimization, the existing cross-media hashing approaches are unable to capture all the discriminative information present in the original multimodal data. Besides, most cross-modal methods belong to the one-step paradigm, which learn the binary codes and hash function simultaneously, increasing the complexity of optimization. To address these issues, we propose a novel two-stage approach, named the two-stage supervised discrete hashing (TSDH) method. In particular, in the first phase, TSDH generates a latent representation for each modality. These representations are then mapped to a common Hamming space to generate the binary codes. In addition, TSDH directly endows the hash codes with the semantic labels, enhancing the discriminatory power of the learned binary codes. A discrete hash optimization approach is developed to learn the binary codes without relaxation, avoiding the large quantization loss. The proposed hash function learning scheme reuses the semantic information contained by the embeddings, endowing the hash functions with enhanced discriminability. Extensive experiments on several databases demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed TSDH, outperforming several recent competitive cross-media algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Collaborative filtering (CF) is a classical model for recommender systems. Though neural network-based CF models have been shown to perform well in some cases, they still suffer from the sparsity and cold-start issues. To address these issues, we propose a novel neural network-based CF model, termed the cross-domain explicit–implicit-mixed CF neural network (CEICFNet). The proposed model utilizes deep neural networks to learn latent factors not only from the explicit ratings and the implicit interactions but also in a cross-domain manner. In particular, domain-shared multilayer perception (MLP) networks are designed to learn the user rating latent factors and the user interaction latent factors from the explicit ratings and the implicit interactions, respectively, which act as bridges for transferring knowledge across domains. On the other hand, domain-specific MLP networks are designed to learn the item rating latent factors and the item interaction latent factors from the explicit ratings and the implicit interactions, respectively. Then, in each domain, based on the user rating latent factors and the item rating latent factors, the rating predictive representation for each user–item pair can be learned by an MLP. Similarly, the interaction predictive representation for each user–item pair can be learned. For integrating the explicit ratings and the implicit interactions, in each domain, a fully connected layer is used to automatically assign different weights to the rating predictive representations and the interaction predictive representations, based on which the final interaction probability can be generated. Extensive experiments are conducted on five datasets and the results have confirmed the effectiveness of our model.},

Considering the urgency of disaster relief, a practical, accurate, and robust modeling method for multiple SUAVs deployments is vital. For this concern, this article first formalizes the deployment problem of multiple solar-powered UAVs in communication recovery by extending Group MultiRole Assignment (GMRA) (UGRA). In the second step, the success in this assignment process depends on the choice of the agent evaluation method. The evaluation benchmark in UGRA is SUAV path planning in a complex environment with uncertain subpaths and accumulative attitude errors. In response to this issue, we propose two innovative algorithms: 1) dynamic curve path-planning algorithm (DCPPA) and 2) greedy curved straight path-planning algorithm (GCSPPA). Moreover, with the time requirement in mind, one sufficient condition and one necessary condition are established to help the DCPPA achieve fast convergence. With these two novel agent evaluation algorithms, UGRA can rapidly deploy multiple SUAVs to establish a collaborative relay network within an acceptable time. Finally, simulation experiments at different scales are carried out to demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed solution.},

More specifically, we develop a reinforcement learning (RL)-based asynchronous localization algorithm to localize the position of AUV, where the time clock of AUV is not required to be well synchronized with the real time. Based on the estimated position, a scalable sampling strategy called multivariate probabilistic collocation method with orthogonal fractional factorial design (M-PCM-OFFD) is employed to evaluate the time-varying uncertain model parameters of AUV. After that, an RL-based tracking controller is designed to drive AUV to the desired target point. Besides that, the performance analyses for the integration solution are also presented. Of note, the advantages of our solution are highlighted as: 1) the RL-based localization algorithm can avoid local optimal in traditional least-square methods; 2) the M-PCM-OFFD-based sampling strategy can address the model uncertainty and reduce the computational cost; and 3) the integration design of localization and tracking can reduce the communication energy consumption. Finally, simulation and experiment demonstrate that the proposed localization algorithm can effectively eliminate the impact of asynchronous clock, and more importantly, the integration of M-PCM-OFFD in the RL-based tracking controller can find accurate optimization solutions with limited computational costs.},

  abstract     = {Screening cluttered and occluded contraband items from baggage X-ray scans is a cumbersome task even for the expert security staff. This article presents a novel strategy that extends a conventional encoder-decoder architecture to perform instance-aware segmentation and extract merged instances of contraband items without using any additional subnetwork or an object detector. The encoder-decoder network first performs conventional semantic segmentation and retrieves cluttered baggage items. The model then incrementally evolves during training to recognize individual instances using significantly reduced training batches. To avoid catastrophic forgetting, a novel objective function minimizes the network loss in each iteration by retaining the previously acquired knowledge while learning new class representations and resolving their complex structural interdependencies through Bayesian inference. A thorough evaluation of our framework on two publicly available X-ray datasets shows that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially within the challenging cluttered scenarios, while achieving an optimal tradeoff between detection accuracy and efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Four-wheeled steerable mobile robots have been widely used in industrial fields. However, robust tracking control is hard to achieve with a fixed maneuver mode. Based on a novel internal coupled sliding mode control (ICSMC) method, this study handles the above challenge by constructing a mode-dependent switched mobile robot (MSMR), and then designing an asynchronous $H_{\infty}$ continuous stabilization control scheme. This method governs the system behaviors to perform adaptive-mode allocations asynchronously and smoothly. First, a unified expression of MSMR is formulated, which regards the maneuver modes as optional subsystems. Then, with the coupled sliding surfaces and modified reaching law, an enhanced chattering-free ICSMC technique is established to optimize continuous control inputs for each subsystem. Moreover, using a surveillant criterion that depicts the energy decaying rate, an evaluation rule is built to distinguish the mismatched subsystems and then realize autonomous mode switching for the concerned MSMR. Utilizing piecewise Lyapunov functional technique and mode-dependent average dwell time, new sufficient conditions are derived for global exponential stability and $H_{\infty}$ performance. Comparative experiments implemented on the developed MSMR are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.},

Following recursive modeling philosophy, kinematics, and dynamics are first formulated for multiple-manipulator actuated coupled position and attitude system of spacecraft in the presence of external disturbances, where two vector factorizations are proposed to ensure a compact and explicit dynamic formulation, holding the inherent skew-symmetric property of the coefficient matrices. In view of the unconspicuous cascaded-like system structure, a nonlinear control scheme is designed following backstepping philosophy to drive the joints of manipulators causing reactions to robustly stabilize the spacecraft position and attitude. Toward this end, a reference trajectory prescribing the spacecraft motion is predesigned by means of polynomial functions ensuring well-behaviored performance. Then, as a key component, a second-order dynamic filter is constructed making use of the dynamics structure to generate the command joint motion capable of manipulator actuation. The rigorous closed-loop stability and robust performance analyses are undertaken within the Lyapunov framework. Moreover, three types of self-collisions possibly happening in the motion of multiple manipulators are considered and handled by three collision detection methods, which facilitates a collision-free trajectory shaping during the aforementioned reference trajectory design phase.

  abstract     = {The goal of zero-shot learning (ZSL) is to transfer knowledge learned from seen classes during training to unseen classes for testing, with the help of auxiliary information, such as attributes and descriptions. Most of the existing methods view ZSL as a label-embedding problem, in which class and image representations are embedded to a common space. However, many methods either show a bias toward seen classes caused by the projection domain-shift problem, or sacrifice the performance of seen classes to generalize to unseen ones. In this article, we present an embedding approach for ZSL, which is motivated by human recognition memory, namely, recollection and familiarity (R&amp;F). We propose a decoder to regularize the nonlinear mapping between the semantic space and the visual space, which represents the reasonable recollection process, and use a residual block to refine the recognition ability for seen classes, which indicates the familiarity process. R&amp;F can generalize well to unseen classes, while retaining the discriminative ability for the seen classes. Extensive experiments are conducted on Animals with Attribute (AwA1), Animals with Attributes 2 (AwA2), Attribute Pascal&amp;Yahoo (aPY), SUN Attribute (SUN), Caltech-UCSD-Birds 200-2011 (CUB), and ImageNet databases. As qualitative and quantitative results show, the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art embedding-based methods by a large margin and significantly alleviates the projection domain-shift problem.},

  abstract     = {This article aims at proposing an adaptive neural control strategy for a class of nonlinear time-delay systems with input delays and unknown control directions. Different from previous researches that investigated delays and constraints separately, the novelty of this article lies in that it simultaneously considers delays (state and input delays) and input constraints (magnitude and rate constraints) for a class of uncertain nonlinear systems. In this article, the uncertain states and input delays are handled by integrating a constructed auxiliary system that functions as an observer with neural networks (NNs), with which the adverse effects caused by the uncertain states and input delays can be approximated and compensated. By involving smooth hyperbolic tangent functions in the designed auxiliary system, the problem of magnitude and rate constraints of the control input is fully addressed. Then, the backstepping technique runs through the entire control designing process, which allows the designed adaptive neural control strategy to handle the input constraints and delays at the same time. Furthermore, Nussbaum functions are employed to resolve the problem of unknown control directions. Due to the introduction of an input-driven filter, only the output of the system is required to be measured as the control feedback, which promotes the applicability of the designed controller. Under the proposed control scheme, semiglobal, uniform, and ultimate boundedness of all signals of the closed-loop system is realized with uncertain control directions, input and state delays, and guaranteed magnitude and rate constraints of control inputs. Finally, simulation results are illustrated to verify the effectiveness of the presented control method.},

In this scheduling problem, jobs are divided into different types and each job consists of multiple parts. The manufacturing of a job involves three stages: 1) parts fabrication on first-stage parallel machines; 2) parts assembly on second-stage single machine; and 3) job differentiation on one of third-stage dedicated machines. Due to the assembly operation and limited buffers between adjacent stages, deadlock and blocking will occur. We formulate the problem and present a deadlock handling policy to guarantee all schedules feasible. Then, we propose the DCMA metaheuristic to approximate the optimal solutions in acceptable time. Global exploration of DCMA is performed by a hybrid of three parts: 1) a continuous optimizer to be executed in continuous search space; 2) a discrete optimizer to be executed in combinatorial solution space; and 3) a meta-Lamarckian learning-based selection mechanism for adaptively determining that which optimizer is more suitable for current global exploration campaign. To balance exploration and exploitation, three problem-special local search strategies are presented, which collaborates with each other and are adaptively started to avoid high computational costs. The effect of parameter setting on DCMA is checked by the Taguchi method of design of experiment. The computational experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of DCMA special designs, and show that DCMA performs better than the existing algorithms for the considered problem.},

Unlike the widely applied three-time scale tuning, a time scale-independent tuning is achieved by restricting the plant to have a Hammerstein structure and elevating the adaptation of the control input which makes it as fast as the dither signal. Albeit the existed fast ES schemes utilize a high-frequency sinusoidal dither in order to achieve fast minimization of the plant’s static nonlinearity, the phase shift of the plant could not be neglected as the frequency is high and the ES may fail to reach the extreme values if the shift is large enough. Thus, an effective adaptive frequency varying phase compensation method is introduced to deal with the phase shift under the assumptions in this article. Moreover, a high-gain optimizer is presented to remove the restriction that the adaptation gain has to be small and could still guarantee the stability properties, which makes the proposed scheme more practical. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is illustrated by numerical simulations.},

However, the unique characteristics of the underwater environment make it challenging to perform the tracking task. This article is concerned with a finite-time tracking control issue for AUV, subjected to unavailable velocity signals in the measurement side and uncertain model parameters in physical side. A HOTL system, including operator, buoys, AUV and sensors, is first provided to construct a cooperative tracking network. For such system, operator in surface control center decides the tracking mission based on all available data. Then, a buoy-assisted localization estimator is utilized by AUV to acquire its position, through which a fast terminal sliding mode observer is developed to estimate the velocity of AUV in finite time. With the estimated velocity information, an adaptive-nonsingular fast terminal sliding mode tracking controller is designed to drive AUV to the target point in finite time. For the proposed velocity observer and tracking controller, the signum and differential functions are employed together to improve the convergence speed and reduce the chattering. Besides that, the proposed solution can not only guarantee finite-time velocity observation, but also achieve finite-time tracking control. Finally, simulation and experimental results are both presented to verify the effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {Online streaming feature selection (OSFS) has attracted extensive attention during the past decades. Current approaches commonly assume that the feature space of fixed data instances dynamically increases without any missing data. However, this assumption does not always hold in many real applications. Motivated by this observation, this study aims to implement online feature selection from sparse streaming features, i.e., features flow in one by one with missing data as instance count remains fixed. To do so, this study proposes a latent-factor-analysis-based online sparse-streaming-feature selection algorithm (LOSSA). Its main idea is to apply latent factor analysis to pre-estimate missing data in sparse streaming features before conducting feature selection, thereby addressing the missing data issue effectively and efficiently. Theoretical and empirical studies indicate that LOSSA can significantly improve the quality of OSFS when missing data are encountered in target instances.},

  abstract     = {The reliability of data is important for complex systems modeling. However, it remains to be a great challenge mainly due to the lack of effective measurement of data reliability. On the condition that there exist the actual result and gold standard in a piece of data simultaneously, a data-driven method is proposed using the belief rule base (BRB) with data reliability and expert knowledge. In the proposed method, gold standards are used to indicate the degree to which the actual results are correct and, thus, the reliability of each piece of data is defined as the similarity between its actual result and the corresponding gold standard. According to the reliability of each piece of data, the training dataset is divided into multiple clusters. Each cluster of data is separately used to construct and optimize a BRB model. The weight and reliability of each model are then calculated using the data in the respective cluster with the consideration of the reliabilities of the data. Finally, the estimated results of the models are integrated using the evidential reasoning rule to generate the integrated results. The proposed method is applied to help radiologists diagnose thyroid nodules, in which historical examination reports are collected from a tertiary hospital located in Hefei, Anhui, China. Its superior performance is verified by experiments.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of the insurance industry, more diverse insurance products are produced for consumers. Insurance portfolio problems have received increasing attention. While most studies focus on insurance portfolio problem for a single insured, insurance portfolio problems for a specific group of insured are even more intricate but little attention has been paid to. In this article, we propose a group insurance portfolio model for investment allocation of several insurance policies so that the total payout of the whole group can be maximized. The statistical average value of each parameter is considered in the model to approximate the expectation payout of the group insurance portfolio problem. To solve this problem, a coevolutionary estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) utilizing the divide-and-conquer strategy is proposed. First, as the payout of each insured under a certain portfolio plan can be calculated separately, the proposed approach decomposes the group insurance portfolio problem into several single-insured insurance portfolio problems. In this way, the dimension of the optimization problem becomes lower compared to the original problem. An adaptive EDA is proposed to optimize the portfolio plan of each insured independently. Second, the group insurance portfolio problem remains a nonseparable problem since the investment amount of each insured is limited by the total investable amount of the whole group. A particle swarm optimization algorithm is adopted to cooperate with the EDA to optimize the proportion of allocation to each insured. The proposed algorithm is verified on various scenarios. The experimental results validate that the proposed approach is effective for the group insurance portfolio problem.},

Among these various applications, herein, we focus on the use of UAVs for search and rescue missions in emergency and postdisaster scenarios. In this context, self-charging technologies for drones create new challenges in the routing of UAVs with charging stations. We present a variant of the vehicle routing problem (VRP) to address the integrated use of UAVs and mobile charging stations and define the VRP with synchronized networks (VRPSN), a new class of VRPs involving the routing of UAVs whose recharge platforms can travel to different locations during an operation. This leads to two networks within the VRP that must be integrated and synchronized. This research develops a mixed-integer linear program model for the VRPSN that considers the use of UAVs and mobile charging stations in a synchronized manner. To overcome the computational limits of the MILP model, this research presents a construct-and-adjust heuristic method integrated with a genetic algorithm. As a numerical example, we test the proposed model on the Córrego do Feijão Mine located in Minas Gerais, Brazil, where a dam recently collapsed, killing many workers. Numerical tests show that the new methodology is an attractive planning method for providing efficient and rapid responses in search and rescue missions.},

Studying the mechanism of the growth and death of a network is of great significance to network modeling. Identical to many models focused on the growing process, in this article, we study the decreasing process thoroughly. A novel evolving network model considering the growing and decreasing process is established based on the queueing system. Focused on the degreasing process, we originally investigate two strategies of vertex deleting that are the brutal strategy and the heritable strategy which characterizes the heritable behavior of “dying” vertices in real networks. On the basis of our model, stochastic properties of the proposed network are analyzed, e.g., the distribution and the expectation of the stationary scale of the network are theoretically obtained. In addition to that, degree distributions with different strategies are demonstrated in simulations, which manifests the power-low distribution. The reliability of the network is also studied by different attacks, sharing the same characteristic with the scale-free network.},

Furthermore, equivalent sufficient conditions directly represented by the system parameters are derived. As applications, it is shown that these sufficient conditions are exactly global exponential stability criteria of the zero equilibrium when the disturbances vanish, and the Cartesian product of two polytopes can be viewed as a reachable set estimation of the states when the initial functions are limited into a certain range. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is illustrated by two numerical examples.

  abstract     = {Change in users’ preferences over time is a challenging issue in collaborative filtering models. Recent temporal recommender systems (RSs) use latent temporal features or probabilistic latent transition models. The models designed using latent temporal features remain confined to point estimation only, i.e., considering single predicted values (e.g., rating) and completely ignore the likelihood of other possible items being generated due to change in users’ preferences. The latent transitive models represent users’ preference over different states using distribution estimation but ignore user–item features. This article proposes an integrated approach for designing collaborative filtering models using both point and distribution estimation techniques together to address this issue. The matrix factorization-based point estimation strategy is applied to integrate user–item correlations and feature information, whereas the hidden Markov model is used for users’ preference distribution over time. Three benchmark datasets were used to evaluate and compare the proposed model’s performance with related state-of-the-art temporal RS models.

The selected nonlinear system satisfies a standard Lagrangian structure affected by nonparametric uncertainties. A barrier Lyapunov function is used to ensure the state constraints by designing a time-varying gain, which guarantees the fulfillment of the predefined state constraints even under external perturbations. The proposed design methodology for the barrier sliding-mode control (BSMC) ensures the convergence of the sliding surface in finite time to the origin. Consequently, the asymptotic convergence of the states to the corresponding equilibrium point is achieved. The finite-time stability of the origin in the closed-loop system with the proposed controller has been demonstrated using the second Lyapunov stability method. The suggested controller was evaluated on a two-link robotic manipulator. Then, the obtained results showed better stabilization and tracking performances (while the restrictions are satisfied) than the traditional first-order sliding-mode or linear state feedback controllers.},

  abstract     = {Mechanical systems with (possibly fast) time-varying but bounded uncertainty are considered. The exact value of the boundary is unknown. All the designer can get is that the boundary values are in a (known) fuzzy set. On the basis, a robust control method is proposed, which can ensure the uniformly bounded and uniformly ultimately bounded of the controlled mechanical system. The control contains two flexibly selectable design parameters. We seek to choose the optimal parameters. For a superior performance, two fuzzy-set-based performance indices are proposed to reflect the transient performance as well as the steady-state performance. Each performance index can be influenced by two design parameters. However, influences are nonconciliatory. This poses a design dilemma: the increase of a parameter may harness one performance while inflict the other. Therefore, the “optimal” choice of the design parameters is not intuitively clear. To resolve this dilemma, the two-player Nash-based noncooperative game theory is adopted, which is a notable feature of this article. Once the problem is formulated, we show that there is always a Nash-equilibrium solution to the two-player problem. We also show how to find it. The approach is very general, which also can be extended to $n$ -player Nash game for future research. The control is applied to a compressor powered by permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) as a demonstration. The resulting performance shows that this Nash-based robust control design is both practical and effective.},

  abstract     = {Achieving high-precision position control while maintaining positive cable tensions is the most challenging issue for the motion control of cable-driven parallel robots, which should be considered significantly. Different from the existing control schemes with online tension distribution that needs real-time computing in each control cycle, a novel dual-loop dynamic control scheme is proposed in this article, where a paralleled dual-loop tracking strategy is introduced to provide a more compatible scheme, which consists of two tracking loops: 1) the tension control loop and 2) the position control loop. In the former loop, the offline tension distribution is adopted to avoid cable hanging loosely and the real-time feasibility of the distribution method is no longer a necessary demand. In the latter loop, due to the complex dynamics characterized by the cable-driven form, the cooperative motion relation among multiple cables and inevitable external disturbances are investigated comprehensively, and the robust synchronization method is included to guarantee the high-precision position control. Afterward, the Lyapunov method is adopted to analyze the strict stability of the whole closed-loop system with both the position and tension control feedback. The experiments indicate that by synthesizing the two control loops, the proposed scheme can dramatically reduce the tracking errors in the trajectory tracking while avoiding the cable relaxation, and particularly, has a satisfactory control effect when the velocity and acceleration of the trajectory have significant oscillations. Additionally, the strong disturbance rejection ability is also validated via robustness experiments.},

The resulting FMSASs are comprised of Markov switching piecewise-affine systems over a set of operating regions. To characterize the multinetwork-induced constraints, the measurement output is quantized before being transmitted, and a compensation scheme is applied to tackle the quantized measurement output loss intermittently. Meanwhile, the randomly occurring DAs are involved, in which the attack behaviors are identified by the bounded stochastic signals. Differently, to deal with the multinetwork-induced constraints, a novel nonstationary region-dependent affine filter strategy is developed. By resorting to a mode-dependent and region-dependent Lyapunov functional and S-procedure theory, sufficient conditions are elicited such that the filtering error system is mean-square exponentially stable. Finally, the practicability of the derived results is verified by a practical tunnel diode circuit model.},

With the rapid development of information technology, DoS attacks against communication topologies are more and more common in MASs with cyber-physical features. To actively reduce the influences caused by DoS attacks, a secure mode strategy is proposed to make agents switch into the secure mode when attacks occur. In this strategy, each agent accesses or terminates the secure mode with bounded time delays after DoS attacks begin or end. Based on the switched system theory, the secure mode strategy against DoS attacks is modeled as the asynchronous switching between agent models and topologies. Finally, we obtain the sufficient conditions on the frequency and duration of DoS attacks, under which the designed controller can guarantee the consensus of MASs. By practical examples, the MASs with the secure mode strategy are illustrated to have better attack-resistant effectiveness than the ones without the secure mode strategy.},

Second, a fuzzy state-feedback control scheme is designed for the Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy second-fractional-order delayed linear networks to achieve global stabilization. Third, considering that only a few scholars have worked on adaptive control of fractional-order networks, an adaptive control method is also designed to realize the global stabilization of the Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy second-fractional-order linear networks, which does not contain the sign function and chattering problem can be averted. All results, given as algebraic criteria, are proved directly from the Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy second-fractional-order networks without utilizing the reduced-order approach.

One is that the upper bound of settling time for the closed-loop system can be estimated without dependence on system initial states, and hence, can be acquired arbitrarily small through tuning control design parameters. The other is that the output constraint can be handled by means of a barrier Lyapunov function (BLF). Via the BLF and the backstepping-like technique, a fixed-time controller, which can cope with a type of nonlinear systems concurrently with and without output constraints, is systematically built. The rigorous analysis on the strength of the Lyapunov theory is given to show that the investigated system under the proposed controller is fixed-time stable, and the violation of a preset output constraint is averted.

The method permits the construction of the optimal policy without any knowledge of the model, without requiring that the time derivatives of the state are available for the design, and without even assuming that an initial stabilizing feedback policy is available. Two alternative architectures are discussed: the first scheme revolves around the periodic computation of some matrix inversions involving the Q-function, whereas the second approach relies on a purely continuous-time implementation of some dynamic systems whose trajectories are uniformly attracted by the solutions to the above algebraic equations. Interestingly, the proposed strategy essentially constitutes a (direct) data-driven implementation of the celebrated Kleinman algorithm, hence subsuming the particularly appealing features of the latter, such as quadratic monotone convergence to the optimal solution.

  abstract     = {Recently, contactless bimodal palmprint recognition technology has attracted increased attention due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Many dual-camera-based sensors have been proposed to capture palm vein and palmprint images synchronously. However, translations between captured palmprint and palm vein images differ depending on the distance between the hand and the sensors. To address this issue, we designed a low-cost method to align the bimodal palm regions for current dual-camera systems. In this study, we first implemented a contactless palm image acquisition device with a dual-camera module and a single-point time of flight (TOF) ranging sensor. Using this device, we collected a dataset named DCPD under different distances and light source intensities from 271 different palms. Then, a bimodal palm image alignment method is proposed based on the imaging and ranging models. After the system model is calibrated, the translation between the visible light and infrared light palm regions can be estimated quickly based on the palm distance. Finally, we designed a convolutional neural network (CNN) to effectively extract the fine- and coarse-grained palm features. Compared to widely used existing methods, the proposed networks achieved the lowest equal error rate (EER) on the Tongji, IITD, and DCPD datasets, and the average time cost of the system to perform one-time identification is approximately 0.15 s. The experimental results indicate that the proposed methods achieved high efficiency and comparable accuracy. In addition, the system’s EER and rank-1 on the DCPD dataset were 0.304\% and 98.66\%, respectively.},

First, a novel static event-triggered discrete gain scheduled control, which can improve the control performance and simultaneously save the communication resources, is proposed by utilizing the properties of the parametric Lyapunov equation (PLE). Moreover, the static self-triggered mechanism, in which the next control law updates based on the previous triggered states, is also designed to avoid the monitoring of all states. In order to further increase the interevent times (IETs), the corresponding dynamic event-triggered and self-triggered discrete gain scheduled control are designed, respectively. All the proposed algorithms can not only avoid the Zeno phenomenon but also provide a designable parametric MIET. This allows to easily find a tradeoff between the IETs and the control performance by adjusting the only design parameter. In addition, by exploiting the properties of the PLE, the designed algorithms avoid the complicated relationship between the MIET and the system matrices. In some cases, the MIET can totally avoid the relationship with the system itself and be designed as an arbitrarily large bounded constant. Finally, applications to the spacecraft rendezvous system show the effectiveness of the established algorithms.},

To further reduce the use of resources for the control objective, an energy-saving control algorithm is introduced composed of double dynamic event-triggered mechanisms that work independently: one intends to control the communication of agents with their neighbors and the other to decide the update of controllers. It is shown that the control algorithm performs well compared to most existing control algorithms in terms of the communication cost between agents and the update cost of controllers. In addition, a new procedure to choose parameters is obtained by the developed Lyapunov stabilty method, with the potential of achieving less conservative parameters than related results. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is verified by numerical simulations.},

Such multiresolution heterogeneous observations create opportunities yet pose challenges to model the dynamics of the targeted crowds. Existing approaches that integrate multiresolution observations rely on intensive computation of a large volume of historical data, and thus, result in a lack of computational efficiency, accuracy, and robustness. To address these limitations, this article proposes a new crowd dynamics modeling approach to aggregating the multiresolution information under a Bayesian inference framework. Beta-binomial and Normal–Wishart conjugate distributions were adopted to model crowd dynamics from low-resolution UAV observations and high-resolution UGV observations, respectively. Based on the proposed approach, a real-time model updating mechanism is developed to implement information aggregation for onboard crowd dynamics inference, where high efficiency, accuracy, and robustness are critical. Numerical simulations and onboard experiments were conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed modeling approach.},

In this article, such cases can be modeled by a Mealy-based finite-state machine (FSM) with nondeterministic output functions, and we investigate the “initial-state” observability by use of matrix semitensor product (matrix-STP). First, to characterize the nondeterministic output functions, a virtual state set consisting of state–event pairs is introduced to obtain an augmented FSM. By resorting to the matrix-STP, the algebraic expression of augmented FSM is proposed. Subsequently, based on the newly constructed model, the initial-state observability can be verified by checking the distinguishability of state trajectories of the augmented FSM. Meanwhile, the necessary and sufficient condition for such initial-state observability is derived from a discriminant matrix consisting of polynomial elements. Finally, numerical examples show the validity of the proposed method. The current results are further conducive to explore the critical safety of cyber–physical systems in many real-world systems.},

  abstract     = {Rumors (i.e., untrue emergence saying of COVID-19 in an area) that rapidly disseminate on the ubiquitous social media easily cause public panics and irrational behaviors (e.g., taking unnecessary medicine) of many very sensitive individuals referred to as target recipients . Thus, rumor controlling or blocking for these target recipients is very critical, which differs from the traditional way of protecting all individuals and remains an open and challenging problem so far. In this work, on the basis that rumors are disseminated from the given sources to target recipients via multiple paths which may be significantly interrupted by deleting a few key links referred to as protectors , we first mathematically define a general target information disseminating (TID) model and do theoretical proofs. Second, based on the TID model, we introduce a random walk algorithm to sample the paths of rumor dissemination for recipients. Third, aiming at deleting a budget-limited set of protectors efficiently in a large number of selected paths to reduce or weaken the negative rumor influences on the target recipients, we propose a heuristical strategy-based rumor influence decay mechanism referred to as RumorDecay (i.e., RumorDecay $k$ hop nearest neighbor method and RumorDecay $k$ hop random walk method in this work) which can locate the optimal protectors quickly and efficiently. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on many real social networks and the results show that the RumorDecay strategy can significantly weaken the rumor dissemination ability with less time cost.},

One challenging problem is that it is still unclear how to construct the regulator equations of stochastic MASs with unknown dynamics for dynamic exosystem compensation. Toward this end, this article develops a novel distributed control scheme for the approximate output regulation of discrete-time stochastic MASs subject to heterogeneous and unknown nonlinear dynamics. A distributed observer is designed for the exosystem-state estimation of agents, based upon which nonlinear regulator equations are constructed for the feedforward control design, thereby achieving distributed exosystem compensation. A high-order neural network is deployed to approximately solve the nonlinear regulator equations with unknown nonlinearity, and an adaptive control law is developed for the approximate output regulation of discrete-time stochastic MASs. Stability analysis shows that the closed-loop system is semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed control law.},

Many countries have adopted different policies and studies are performed to understand the effect of each of the policies on the growth rate of the infected cases. In this article, the data about the policies taken by all countries at each date, and the effect of the policies on the growth rate of the pandemic are used to build a model of the pandemic’s behavior. The model takes as input a set of policies and predicts the growth rate of the pandemic. Then, a population-based multiobjective optimization algorithm is developed, which uses the model to search through the policy space and finds a set of policies that minimize the cost induced to the society due to the policies and the growth rate of the pandemic. Because of the complexity of the modeling problem and the uncertainty in measuring the growth rate of the pandemic via the models, an ensemble learning algorithm is proposed in this article to improve the performance of individual learning algorithms. The ensemble consists of ten learning algorithms and a metamodel algorithm that is built to predict the accuracy of each learning algorithm for a given data record. The metamodel is a set of support vector machine (SVM) algorithms that is used in the aggregation phase of the ensemble algorithm. Because there is uncertainty in measuring the growth rate via the models, a landscape smoothing operator is proposed in the optimization process, which aims at reducing uncertainty. The algorithm is tested on open access data online and experiments on the ensemble learning and the policy optimization algorithms are performed.},

  abstract     = {A novel methodology is introduced for optimally allocating a sampling budget. Sampling budget allocation problems arise frequently in various settings. For example, in the design of complex engineering systems, given both the complexity of these systems and the imperfect information on new technologies, designers often face deep uncertainty as to system performance. Consequently, designers need to sample multiple alternative designs under a limited budget. This article proposes a minimax regret approach to allocate the sampling budget in the presence of deep uncertainty pertaining to system performance. The objective is to maximize the probability of selecting the design with the minimum–maximum regret under a limited sampling budget and imperfect information. To effectively solve the minimax regret problem, an approximation methodology that provides good solutions with quantifiable uncertainty is developed. The essence of the methodology, which has the added benefit of being generally applicable to any multilevel optimization, is that all but the first level of multilevel optimization can be eliminated via a response surface. By sampling many values of a higher level decision’s variables, solving the next lower level optimization given those samples values, and calibrating a response surface to the objective function value eliminate one required optimization. Doing this repeatedly reduces the complexity of the multilevel optimization to a standard optimization. Regardless of the number of levels in the optimization, repeating this process ultimately leaves one with a single optimization whose objective function can be directly computed, given the highest level variables. Numerical experiments with two sampling allocation examples demonstrate both the benefit of the robust sampling budget allocation versus nonrobust formulations and the effectiveness of the proposed solution approach.},

The proposed method first employs a sliding window strategy to smooth on the raw time series. Subsequently, the smoothed time series is transformed into the corresponding granular time series that is depicted by evolving shape with the aid of the clustering algorithm based on the dynamic time warping (DTW) distance. Finally, a Takagi–Sugeno (TS) architecture-like granular model (GrM) is formed by deriving the relations implying in the granular time series and offers the granular output in the numeric vector format. The GrM adopts the pattern-to-pattern inference mechanism to realize the long-term prediction of time series at the vector level. Experiments on several datasets demonstrate that the proposed method not only has the ability to circumvent the cumulative error but also makes the resulting GrM equip better interpretability.},

Current measures usually suffer from deteriorated accuracy, which is known as the security–performance tradeoff. Motivated by these concerns, in this article, a novel cancelable fingerprint approach, i.e., Indexing-Min–Max (IMM) hashing, is proposed to securely transform a fixed-length fingerprint feature vector to a discrete index hashed code. IMM hashing is essentially established upon the min–max hash and further strengthened by the integration of the partial Hadamard transform, which alleviates performance deterioration while maintaining a high security level. Extensive experiments on FVC2002 and FVC2004 fingerprint datasets coupled with comprehensive theoretical analyses demonstrate the favorable accuracy and strong anti-attack resilience of the proposed method. Besides, compared to the unprotected counterpart, the matching precision of the protected templates yields little accuracy loss or even improved performance, which means the security–performance tradeoff is well handled. Furthermore, IMM hashing also meets the unlinkability and revocability requisites of cancelable biometrics.},

Dual-user/two-handed teleoperation of a WMM is desirable for tasks where it is important to simultaneously control the poses of both the MP and the EE. The existing teleoperation approaches for WMMs are mostly executed at the kinematic level, without considering the nonlinear rigid-body dynamics of the WMMs. In this article, a task-priority-based dual-user teleoperation framework for a WMM is implemented to perform tasks in a constrained environment. It can simultaneously manipulate the MP and the EE, the overground obstacles are avoided by telecontrolling the MP using the WMM’s null space. Any residual redundancy can be further employed for other tasks such as singularity avoidance. The stability of the entire teleoperation design is rigorously proved even with arbitrary time delays. Experiments with a dual-user teleoperation system, consisting of two local robots and an omnidirectional WMM, are conducted to verify the proposed approach’s feasibility and effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {In this article, the problem of constant yet deferred output constraint for uncertain strict-feedback nonlinear systems is studied. By “deferred output constraint,” we mean that the system output is free/released from any constraint in the initial interval and then preserves within a bounded region right after a finite time. Due to such a form of output constraint, the normally employed Barrier Lyapunov Function (BLF)-based results become invalid because the corresponding BLF is undefined in the initial period. The problem will be rather complicated yet challenging if computation and communication constraints are taken into account. By developing an error-based nonlinear function and constructing a prescribed-time scaling function, together with the approximate ability of neural networks, a varying threshold-based event-triggering adaptive neural control algorithm is presented such that not only the deferred output constraint can be ensured and the network resources can be saved but also the tracking error is able to converge to a pregiven region in a prescribed time. Simulations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we propose BNAS-v2 to further improve the efficiency of broad neural architecture search (BNAS), which employs a broad convolutional neural network (BCNN) as the search space. In BNAS, the single-path sampling-updating strategy of an overparameterized BCNN leads to terrible unfair training issue, which restricts the efficiency improvement. To mitigate the unfair training issue, we employ a continuous relaxation strategy to optimize all paths of the overparameterized BCNN simultaneously. However, continuous relaxation leads to a performance collapse issue that leads to the unsatisfactory performance of the learned BCNN. For that, we propose the confident learning rate (CLR) and introduce the combination of partial channel connections and edge normalization. Experimental results show that 1) BNAS-v2 delivers state-of-the-art search efficiency on both CIFAR-10 (0.05 GPU days, which is $4\times $ faster than BNAS) and ImageNet (0.19 GPU days) with better or competitive performance; 2) the above two solutions are effectively alleviating the performance collapse issue; and 3) BNAS-v2 achieves powerful generalization ability on multiple transfer tasks, e.g., MNIST, FashionMNIST, NORB, and SVHN.

First, the proposed dynamic event-triggered strategy combined with the decentralized output-based controller is presented in a unified framework to deal with deception attacks and DoS attacks in the multiarea power system. Then, we utilize the Lyapunov stability theory to analyze the exponential stability in the mean-square sense and the robustness of the power system. By solving a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), a procedure is given for the design of output-based load frequency controllers.

  abstract     = {Multiobjective optimization evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) have received significant achievements in recent years. However, they encounter many difficulties in dealing with many-objective optimization problems (MaOPs) due to the weak selection pressure. One possible way to improve the ability of MOEAs for these MaOPs is to balance the convergence and diversity in the high-dimensional objective space. Based on this consideration, this article proposes a novel generic two-stage (TS) framework for MaOPs. The entire evolutionary search process is divided into two stages: in the first stage, a new subregion dominance and a modified subregion density-based mating selection mainly purse the convergence and in the second stage, a novel level-based Pareto dominance cooperates with the traditional Pareto dominance that mainly promotes diversity. Integrated into NSGA-II, the TS NSGA-II, referred to as TS-NSGA-II, is proposed. To extensively evaluate the performance of our approach, 29 benchmark problems were used as the test suite. The experimental results demonstrate our approach obtained superior or competitive performance compared with eight state-of-the-art many-objective optimization evolutionary algorithms. To study its generality, the proposed TS strategy was also combined with four other advanced methods for MaOPs. The results show that it can also improve the performance of these four methods in terms of convergence and diversity.},

The goal is to solve the global optimization problem through decentralized computation and communication over a network of agents without a central coordinator. Through using triple proximal splitting operators to deal with the nonsmooth terms, we come up with a novel decentralized algorithm with uncoordinated stepsizes, where the stepsizes with independent upper bounds are also distributed for agents or edges over the communication network. Furthermore, we establish the sublinear convergence rate for the proposed algorithm in terms of the first-order optimality residual in a nonergodic sense.

  abstract     = {Earth observation resources are becoming increasingly indispensable in disaster relief, damage assessment, and other related domains. Many unpredictable factors, such as changes in observation task requirements, bad weather, and resource malfunctions, may cause the scheduled observation scheme to become infeasible. In these cases, it is crucial to promptly reformulate high-quality observation schemes while exerting minimal negative effects on the previously scheduled tasks. Accordingly, in this study, a bottom-up distributed coordination framework together with an improved contract net is proposed, aiming to facilitate dynamic task replanning for heterogeneous Earth observation resources. This hierarchical framework consists of three levels: 1) neighboring resource coordination; 2) single planning center coordination; and 3) multiple planning center coordination. The observation tasks affected by unpredicted factors are managed along with a bottom-up route from resources to planning centers. This bottom-up distributed coordination framework transfers part of the computing load to various nodes of the observation systems to plan tasks more efficiently and robustly. To support the prompt replanning of multiple tasks to proper Earth observation resources in dynamic environments, we propose a multiround combinatorial allocation (MCA) method. Moreover, a new float interval-based local search algorithm is proposed to quickly obtain a promising replanning scheme. The simulation results demonstrate that the MCA method can achieve a better task completion rate for large-scale tasks with satisfactory time efficiency. In addition, this method can efficiently obtain replanning schemes based on original schemes in dynamic environments.},

Under the proposed optimization algorithms, the agents approach the approximate optimal solution in finite time. Although there exist errors (they may be called approximation errors) between the approximate minimizers and the global accurate minimizer, the approximation errors can be regulated by penalty parameter and the relationship between the bound of the approximation errors and the penalty parameter is given explicitly. Furthermore, the proposed distributed approximate optimization algorithms are applied to the optimal rendezvous problem of wheeled multimobile robots, making the mobile robots achieve approximate optimization rendezvous in finite time.

We prove that a bounded deadlock-free Petri net is nonblocking if and only if its min-max-BRG is unobstructed , which can be verified by solving a set of integer constraints and then examining the min-max-BRG. For Petri nets that are not deadlock-free, one needs to determine the set of dead markings. This can be done with an approach based on the computation of maximal implicit firing sequences enabled by the markings in the min-max-BRG.

However, this balance comes mainly from statistical models, which are challenging to interpret. In contrast, we present $\mu C^{1}$ and $\mu C^{2}$ , two geometric model-based approaches to gesture recognition which support the visualization and geometrical interpretation of the recognition process. We compare $\mu C^{1}$ and $\mu C^{2}$ with respect to two classical ML algorithms, k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) and support vector machine (SVM), and two state-of-the-art (SotA) deep learning (DL) models, bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU), on an experimental dataset of ten gesture classes from the Italian Sign Language (LIS), each repeated 100 times by five inexperienced non-native signers, and gathered with wearable technology (a sensory glove and inertial measurement units). As a result, we achieve a compromise between high recognition rates ( $&amp;gt;90\%$ ) and low recognition times ( $ &amp;lt; 0.1 {\mathrm{ s}}$ ) that is adequate for human–computer interaction.

To resolve this contradiction, a noise-suppressing neural dynamics (NSND) model is proposed to solve the TDCNO problem subject to both equality and inequality constraints via the nonlinear complementary problem (NCP) function. The proposed method allows inequality constraints for unknown variables, removes the short-time invariance hypothesis, and further eliminates lagging errors during the solving process in the presence of noises. Besides, the rapid convergence, global stability, and noise processing of the NSND model are verified by the theoretical analyses. Simulation results of illustrative examples, including dimensionality reduction on principal component analyses (PCA) and a robot motion control, show that the NSND model outperforms the existing models for the TDCNO problem.},

To reduce the network communication bandwidth resource from the controller to the actuator and mitigate the adverse effect from DoS attacks, a novel event-triggered control strategy is proposed based on the reliable attack detection mechanism. The general attack detection mechanisms depend on the residuals between the values from the systems and observers. Different from the general attack detection mechanisms, a novel attack detection mechanism is proposed based on the logic relationship of voltage level signals which from the outputs of system components. Besides, the controller is designed based on the backstepping method and the controller can guarantee that the Zeno behavior is excluded. Furthermore, by using the Lyapunov stability theory, it proves that the controllers make the MASs achieve consensus. Eventually, a simulation example is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed theoretical results.},

The state information is quantized and transmitted to the controller. An event-triggered mechanism is presented in terms of the quantizer parameter. The updating law of the dynamic quantizer is suggested for the purpose of guaranteeing the state operating within the quantization range. Meanwhile, the contour line of the Lyapunov function is developed to provide an efficient way for system performance improvement. A co-design strategy is put forward to determine the event-triggered parameter and the quantization scheme simultaneously. The asynchronization issue between the controller and the subsystem is solved by designing a suitable switching signal. The Zeno behavior is eliminated by calculating a lower bound of the event-triggered interval. In the end, a strategy for finding the initial value of the quantization parameter is discussed.

The objective is to design a distributed algorithm for agents with single-integrator dynamics to cooperatively satisfy the coupled equality constraint and minimize the sum of all local cost functions. Here, both the coupled equality constraint and cost functions depend explicitly on time. The cost functions are in quadratic form and may have nonidentical time-varying Hessians. To solve the problem in a distributed manner, an estimator based on the distributed average tracking method is first developed for each agent to estimate certain global information. By leveraging the estimated global information and an adaptive gain scheme, a distributed continuous-time algorithm is proposed, which ensures the agents to find and track the time-varying optimal trajectories with vanishing errors. We illustrate the applicability of the proposed method in the optimal hose transportation problem using multiple quadrotors.},

Early in the design of the proposed controller, the friction, coriolis, centrifugal, and gravity parts of the robot model are considered as they are uncertain, and then they are compensated by the proposed structure. Unlike the existing approaches, the proposed self-organizing fuzzy emotional (SFE) approach achieves not only optimum parameters but also optimum constructions. In structure learning, a new index based on the measured error, the number of rules, and the max sensory input is considered to generate new rules. The parameter learning condition depends on the stability. Furthermore, we formulate a controller based on SFE for a two-link robot and 3-PSP spatial parallel manipulator. To deal with the increasing and decreasing weight of Amygdala, the robust outer feedback is augmented to the whole controller. Simulation results show the priority of the proposed approach in comparison to alternative approaches especially in improving the ability to deal with uncertainty.},

  abstract     = {This article is concerned with the leader-following output consensus problem in the framework of distributed nonlinear observers. Instead of certain hypotheses on the leader system, a group of geometric conditions is put forward to develop a novel distributed observers strategy, thereby definitely improving the applicability of the existing results. To be more specific, the improved distributed observers can precisely handle consensus problems for some nonlinear leader systems, which are invalid for the traditional strategies with a certain assumption, such as elastic shaft single linkage manipulator (ESSLM) systems and most of the first-order nonlinear systems. We prove the sufficient conditions for the exponential stability of our distributed observers’ error dynamic by proposing two pioneered lemmas to show the relationship between the maximum eigenvalues of two matrices appearing in Lyapunov type matrices. Then, a partial feedback linearization method with zero dynamic proposed in differential geometry is employed to design the purely decentralized control law for the affine nonlinear multiagent system. With this advancement, the existing results can be regarded as a specific case owing to that the followers can be chosen as an arbitrary minimum phase affine smooth nonlinear system. At last, the novel distributed observers and the improved purely decentralized control law are applied in the distributed control framework to construct a closed-loop system. We also prove the stability of the closed-loop system to achieve leader-following consensus. Our method is illustrated by the ESSLM system and Van der Pol system as leaders.},

In order to improve the performance of nonnegative latent factor (NLF) models based on the double factorization while reducing the computation burden of NLF models in terms of the triple factorization (TF) technique, a novel symmetric NLF (SNLF) model, i.e., TF-like SNLF model, is proposed in this article. A latent factor (LF) matrix that reflects the relationship of items is introduced into the objective function so as to offer more freedom for solutions. Then, a fixed weighting matrix designed by sensitivity experiments is used to replace the aforementioned LF matrix dependent on the update, which greatly helps save the time cost without sacrificing any accuracy. Furthermore, the alteration direction (ADI) method is adopted to design the algorithm, which effectively helps reduce the occurrence of the local minimum while guaranteeing convergence. Finally, experimental results on four real industrial data sets demonstrate that the proposed TF-like SNLF model makes a good compromise between the model performance and the time efficiency.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates the finite-time stability (FTS) of switched nonlinear systems (SNSs) with state jumps. Our main concerns are twofold. One is that the SNS only consists of FTS subsystems. The other is that the SNS has both FTS subsystems and exponentially stable (ES) subsystems. Due to the switches and state jumps, the main challenge of the study comes from the estimation of settling time and the synthesis of different Lyapunov functions for FTS/ES subsystems. Based on the analytical-inductive method and the initial-value-dependent dwell-time approach, several FTS criteria for the SNSs are established. Then, we provide the estimation of settling time which is explicitly dependent on the dwell time and initial value. Our results can be applied to the finite-time control problem of switched systems with/without state jumps, even when some subsystems can only be exponentially stabilized through linear feedback control and others are finite-time stabilized by discontinuous/nonlinear controls. Finally, three examples are given to illustrate the proposed results. The finite-time stabilization of a continuous stirred tank reactor and the finite-time consensus of a multiagent system are both adopted as potential applications.},

Inspired by the thought of granular computing, this article proposes a new hesitant fuzzy linguistic method to deal with issues when a lot of decision makers provide hesitant and uncertain preference information in the decision-making process. First, we design a multiplicative consistency index and calculate its thresholds corresponding to different dimensions of preference matrix by the Monte Carlo experiment. Then, we construct a hesitant fuzzy linguistic model with granularity level, so as to recharacterize original assessment information and improve the consistency of preference matrices as far as possible. Considering the features of some large-scale group decision-making situation, where the decision makers have little opportunity to take part in multiple consensus reaching processes, hesitant fuzzy linguistic fuzzy $C$ -means clustering algorithm is developed to integrate the assessment information given by decision makers. Finally, the final decision-making results are derived. An illustrative example of assessing psychological situation of some COVID-19 infected persons clarifies the reasonability of the proposed method. Finally, we complete some comparative studies and simulation experiments to demonstrate the method’s validity and advantages.},

In this article, building via standard consumer utility-based models, we uncover the value of the UPC program in a production system. In the basic model, we consider the case when the manufacturer is risk averse. For both the cases with and without UPC, the optimal product pricing and quality decisions are determined and the respective manufacturer’s utility and consumer surplus are derived. The values of UPC to the manufacturer and consumers are found. We find that: 1) both quality improvement and UPC can be beneficial to consumers under some situations and 2) the optimal quality level, the optimal utility, and the consumer surplus are independent of the return fee. In the extended models, we explore two cases, namely, the case when consumers are risk averse, and the case with a collection platform, which can enhance the collection rate. We find that no matter what the level of consumers’ risk averse is, it reduces consumers’ benefits. Moreover, a higher platform’s power is beneficial to the manufacturer and consumers but may reduce the platform’s profit.},

  abstract     = {Due to technical or economic limitations, timely measuring quality-relevant key performance indicators (KPIs) of complex industrial processes (CIPs), especially the chemical composition-related indexes, is intractable. Process monitoring image sequences (PMISs) usually involve significant information about the operation states and KPIs. Thus, soft sensor-based online KPI inference by incorporating process monitoring variables (TPMVs) and PMISs is more promising. However, the extremely inconsistent sampling rates with different expression forms and concerning aspects between PMISs and TPMVs lead to a great challenge in the soft sensor modeling by combining PMISs and TPMVs. In this article, a self-attention dual-channel deep network (SADCDN)-based soft sensor model for the end-to-end online KPI detection/prediction is proposed. Specifically, one channel adopts the gated recurrent unit (GRU) network to extract intrinsic time-series features in TPMVs, and simultaneously the other channel introduces a novel frame-dilated convolution fusion neural network (FDCFNN) to extract intrinsic spatiotemporal features from PMISs to address the sampling inconsistence between PMISs and TPMVs. Successively, dual-channel network features with different concerning aspects are weighted and fused based on an introduced self-attention mechanism to bridge the gap of sampling rates and concerning aspects between PMISs and TPMVs for the soft sensor modeling. Practical application results on two real industrial processes, the bauxite flotation process and the sintering process of a cement rotary kiln, have demonstrated the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed dual-channel model, laying a foundation for the process optimization of CIPs.},

  abstract     = {Fault diagnosability evaluation is important for monitoring and control system design. The evaluation results provide knowledge of the achievable performance of concerned systems from the fault diagnosis perspective. In this article, the diagnosability analysis of Markov jump systems with multiple time delays is addressed by using statistics. Specifically, cases with both completely and partially known transition probabilities are considered. First, the characteristics of the multiple time delays and the Markov process are extracted based on a constructed system dynamic. This step is followed by defining the fault detectability and isolability of the considered system. On this basis, Kullback–Leibler divergence-based fault diagnosability measures for different fault cases are given, and the relations between these measures are investigated. For cases with completely known transition probabilities, due to random variation in the structure, a quantitative fault diagnosability method is proposed by simultaneously considering the fault diagnosis performance and the importance of different system structures. For cases with partially known or even completely unknown transition probabilities, instead of a scalar measure, an interval measure and the corresponding evaluation method are developed to take advantage of as much available information as possible. Finally, the effectiveness of the developed measures is verified via simulation.},

Distinct from the existing ones, the proposed adaptive event-triggered strategy automatically tunes the threshold according to the local extremum of the system output signal, which can significantly reduce the number of unnecessary signal transmissions to ensure system performance. First, the proposed adaptive event-triggered transmission scheme is integrated with the decentralized DOFC and communication delays under the framework of a linear time-delay system. Then, the asymptotic stability of the closed-loop power system is analyzed through the Lyapunov stability theory and a procedure is given for the design of decentralized dynamic output load frequency controllers by solving some linear matrix inequalities (LMIs).

  abstract     = {Underwater camera calibration has attracted much attentions due to its significance in high-precision three-dimensional (3-D) pose estimation and scene reconstruction. However, most existing calibration methods focus on calibrating the underwater camera in a single scenario [e.g., air-glass-water], which can not well formulate the geometry constraint and further result in the complex calibration process. Moreover, the calibration precision of these methods is low, since multilayer transparent refractions with unknown layer orientation and distance make the task more difficult than that in air. To address these challenges, we develop a novel and efficient medium-driven method for underwater camera calibration (MedUCC), which can calibrate the underwater camera parameters, including the orientation and position of the transparent glass accurately. Our key idea of this article is to leverage the light-path changes formed by medium refractions between different media to acquire calibration data, which can better formulate the geometry constraint, and estimate the initial value of the underwater camera parameters. To improve the calibration accuracy of the underwater camera system, a quaternion-based solution is developed to refine the underwater camera parameters. To the end, we evaluate the calibration performance on an underwater camera system. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that our proposed method can obtain a better performance in comparison to the existing works. We also validate our proposed MedUCC method on our designed 3-D scanner prototype, which illustrates the superiority of our proposed calibration method.},

Cleaning can remove dust, and the effect of cleaning on PV performance resembles that of maintenance. In this article, we propose a hybrid cleaning scheduling policy with periodic planning and dynamic adjustment for refining the operations and maintenance of PV systems. Specifically, the periodic planning stage aims for medium-term scheduling while the dynamic adjustment stage is tailed for short-term fine-tuning. In the former stage, we show that when the number of cleaning actions is fixed, a periodic cleaning strategy is optimal. Moreover, we derive the optimality condition under which the optimal cleaning interval can be determined. In the latter stage, based on the determined cleaning interval, we dynamically adjust the cleaning schedule with the forecast of meteorological parameters, PV power generation, and dust deposition in order to further minimize economic losses. In addition, we take the forecasting uncertainty into account and propose a new custom parameter called risk-taking tendency (RTT), which is able to quantify the risk preference of decision makers and analyze its influence on the scheduling policy.

Meanwhile, a modified event-based consensus protocol combining a continuous function is presented, which overcomes the difficulty of control design caused by discontinuous information transmission. By introducing a compensating state estimator, it is shown that the bounded consensus of higher-order FOMASs can be still achieved under a directed graph even though the derivative of the leader signal is unknown to all agents. Stability analysis based on the fractional-order Lyapunov direct method and simulation examples verify the correctness of the presented method.},

AFPNet executes in real time on a commercial embedded GPU. The network includes two new modules. The local memory module (LMM) is the first; it improves the upsampling accuracy by propagating the high-level features to the adjacent grids. The cascaded pyramid pooling module (CPPM) is the second; it reduces computational time by changing the structure of the pyramid pooling module. Using these two modules, the proposed AFPNet achieved 76.4\% mean intersection-over-union on the Cityscapes test dataset, outperforming other real-time semantic segmentation networks. Furthermore, AFPNet was successfully deployed on an embedded board Jetson AGX Xavier and applied to the real-world navigation of a mobile robot, proving that AFPNet can be effectively used in a variety of real-time applications.},

Currently, several deep learning-based approaches are leveraged to learn preferences of groups for items and predict next items in which groups may be interested. Yet, their recommendation performance is still unsatisfactory due to sparse group–item interactions. To address this challenge, this study presents a novel model, called group recommendation model with two-stage deep learning (GRMTDL), which encompasses two sequential stages: 1) group representation learning (GRL) and 2) group preference learning (GPL). In GRL, we first construct an undirected tripartite graph over group–user–item interactions, and then employ it to accurately learn group semantic features through a spatial-based variational graph autoencoder network. While in GPL, we first introduce a dual PL-network that contains two structure-sharing subnetworks: 1) group PL-network employed for GPL and 2) user PL-network utilized for user preference learning. Then, we design a novel layered transfer learning (LTL) method to learn group preferences by alternately optimizing these two subnetworks. In particular, it can effectively absorb knowledge of user preferences into the process of GPL. Furthermore, extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed GRMTDL model outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines for group recommendation.},

To reduce the communication overhead, a distributed event-triggered control scheme is designed based on an estimate of unknown gain sign’s reciprocal. Leveraging the stochastic Lyapunov stability theory and backstepping design technique, it is proved that 1) the output responses of followers converge to a convex hull formed by those of the leaders and their symmetric ones; 2) all signals in the closed-loop system are semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded in probability (SGUUBP); and 3) there is no Zeno behavior.

To alleviate this issue, this article proposes a comprehensive competitive learning (CCL) strategy for CSOs using three competition mechanisms to guide the particle search. Specifically, environmental competition classifies winner and loser particles from the swarm, while cognitive competition and social competition select one winner particle as the cognitive component and the social component, respectively, to guide the search for loser particles. This competitive learning strategy aims to enhance the search capability of loser particles and provides diverse search directions for solving LMOPs.

In this article, we propose a novel online population size learning (OPL) technique of evolution strategies for handling noisy optimization problems. By re-evaluating a fraction of the candidates, we measure the strength of noise level of the re-evaluated candidate solutions and adapt the population size according to the noise level. The proposed OPL combines the advantages of both explicit averaging by re-evaluations and the implicit averaging by large population size and overcomes their limitations. We incorporate it with the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES) and obtain OPL-CMA-ES. Compared with the existing noise handling technique, the proposed OPL is much simpler in both concepts and computation. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the algorithm’s performance on standard problems with Gaussian noise. We further evaluate the performance of OPL-CMA-ES on the black-box optimization benchmarks (BBOBs) noisy testbed, which is a standard platform for comparing black-box optimization algorithms, compared with the state-of-the-art noise-handling algorithms. The experimental results show that OPL-CMA-ES achieves remarkable performance and outperforms the compared variants.},

Since the drift and input dynamics are both unknown, an NN is built within a self-triggered update paradigm to approximate the unknown tracking control. The error derivative used in the weight update algorithm is derived using a robust exact differentiator technique. To address input constraints, an auxiliary compensator is designed for the unimplemented control effort. Through rigorous Lyapunov analyses, we can guarantee that all the tracking and weight errors are uniformly ultimately bounded. Finally, to show the effectiveness of the proposed control performance, simulation results of a two-link robot are provided and analyzed.},

The DPUC is an important application problem in modern electronics manufacturing. A robust model is established for the DPUC with makespan criterion. A counter-intuitive paradox is found, that is, adding a new job to one of the production lines can reduce the completion time of the production line. Two acceleration methods are provided to save computational efforts. An iterated greedy algorithm called IG_FS is proposed to solve the DPUC. A heuristic based on the well-known NEH is proposed to generate the initial solution for the IG_FS. In the destruction phase of the IG_FS, dynamic sizes based on both adaptability and randomness are provided to improve the exploration capability. During the local search phase of the IG_FS, a hybrid local search method consisting of shift and swap operators is presented to exploit more diverse search areas. Extensive experiments show that the proposed IG_FS performs significantly better than the six competing algorithms adapted from the closely related scheduling literature.},

By contrast, ranking is not a static but an interactive process where the user continues interacting with the document retrieval system through information exchange such as search intent (e.g., rating or clicking for the retrieved items). We model the interactive ranking process (IRP), and propose an Attention-Based Interactive LTR model (AIRank) to constitute an intent-aware flexible ranking policy to gratify the user’s need. To enhance the ranking quality, the inherent relations among documents are procured by the self-attention method to contribute to an enriched user intent representation.

However, providing care services considering abstract physiological desires (e.g., hunger, thirst, hot, and cold) rather than specific commands (e.g., serve a cup of water) has not been fully investigated. The key to such services that satisfy abstract requests, e.g., thirst, is to evaluate the available options (e.g., milk, tea, biscuit, and Coke) with the consideration of the care recipient’s preferences. In this study, we argue that both general taste (long-term care preferences) and sequential influence [short-term care preferences (STCPs)] should be considered for a robot to provide satisfying services. In this article, a long STCP model (LSTCPM) is introduced. The model can be initialized and updated incorporating the feedback from the care recipients. Then, a virtual agent-based simulation system is presented, which provides a way to evaluate and fine-tune the LSTCPM prior to its deployment to actual care robots. Finally, experiments were conducted in a real household domain using our care robot KUT-PCR to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach.},

With the development of the connected and automated vehicle (CAV) technology, CAVs can conduct cooperative merging using communication, and can also handle complicated situations even with legacy vehicles. In this article, a game theory-based ramp merging strategy has been developed for the optimal merging coordination of CAVs in mixed traffic, which can determine the dynamic merging sequence and corresponding longitudinal/lateral control. This strategy improves the safety and efficiency of the merging process by ensuring a safe intervehicle distance and harmonizing the speeds of CAVs in the traffic stream. To verify the proposed strategy, mixed traffic simulation runs under different penetration rates and different congestion levels have been carried out on an innovative Unity-SUMO integrated platform, which connects a game engine-based driving simulator with a state-of-the-art microscopic traffic simulator. The results show that the average speed of traffic flow can be increased up to 210\%, while the fuel consumption can be reduced up to 53.9\%. In addition, the driving volatility can be stabilized to a level with 0\% extreme values.},

Combining self-triggered strategy with general event-triggered strategy, a novel fully distributed asynchronous mixed self- and event-triggered control strategy is proposed, which can make the MASs achieve the prescribed state formation structure. The control strategy proposed in this study does not depend on any global network information. Therefore, no matter how large scale of the network is, the control strategy is feasible. Meanwhile, the control strategy uses the sampled state information at triggering instants instead of the real-time state information, which efficiently eliminates continuous communication among agents. Different from the existing studies, the event-triggered detector starts to work if and only if the next self-triggering instant comes in the control strategy proposed in this article. Thus, the control strategy can save more communication resources between sensor and event-triggered detector within the same inter-event interval compared with the previous event-triggered strategies. In addition, the control strategy designs a exponential decay term in the triggering function to rule out the unexpected Zeno behavior and reduce the triggering number. Finally, the numerical simulation result of multi-robot formation is given, which demonstrates the feasibility and performance of the proposed control strategy.},

  abstract     = {Distributed renewable energy source is an advisable solution for dc microgrids to reduce fuel consumption and CO 2 emission. In such microgrids, the installation of two or more battery energy storage (BES) units is utilized to compensate the power imbalance between the sources and loads. Nevertheless, energy management with numerous BES units does not simultaneously consider the impacts of distributed generators (DGs) and constant power loads (CPLs). Since the inaccurate current sharing will shorten the lifetime of the batteries and cause instability problem, this article proposes a distributed secondary $H_{\infty }$ consensus approach based on the dynamic event-triggered communication method to realize accurate current sharing and efficient operation in the presence of numerous DGs and CPLs. First, the whole state-space function model of the dc microgrid consisting of DGs, batteries, resistive loads, and CPLs, is first built in detail. This model is further transformed into standard linear heterogeneous multiagent systems, which provides an indispensable preprocessing for advanced control strategy application. Then, the distributed secondary $H_{\infty }$ consensus approach based on the foresaid systems is designed to achieve accurate current sharing. For reducing the communication among batteries and the controller updating frequency, the dynamic event-triggered communication method is proposed. Compared with existing event-triggered methods, the communication and controller updating frequency of the proposed dynamic event-triggered method have been reduced a lot. Additionally, the proposed method can not only avoid the Zeno behavior, but also obtain the lowest bound of the sampled time interval. Finally, the numerical simulation results and experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.},

Different from the distributed control, we apply a simple boundary control strategy, which greatly reduces the cost of the control design. Note that three issues need to be addressed: 1) how to model the asynchronous behavior? 2) how to design the asynchronous boundary controller? and 3) how to process the incomplete matrix information? We deal with these problems one by one. Based on a general hidden Markov model (HMM), an asynchronous boundary feedback controller is considered. Via the Wirtinger-type inequality, Schur complement technique, and transition matrix properties, sufficient conditions ensuring exponentially mean square stability and strictly $(W, P, R)-\alpha $ dissipativity are established, which covers several special cases. Finally, a numerical example is presented to illustrate the proposed control strategies.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning has been widely applied in many fields. Efficient optimization algorithms contribute a lot to the enhancement of deep learning. However, reverse studies on how deep learning can solve optimization problems, especially mathematical programming, are relatively scarce. In this work, we aim to initiate a discussion on using deep learning to solve parametric mathematical programming, which can be converted to find a mapping from parameter space to solution space. Given that deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have been successfully applied in the field of computer vision, converting a mathematical programming problem into an image representation may provide the solution. This work takes the 0–1 knapsack problem (KP) as an example to build an original image representation method. After modifying the image details, the proposed method is extended to the general 0–1 linear programming (LP) problem, and a deep learning architecture is designed to solve the transferred computer vision problem. The efficiency of the proposed DCNNs method is validated on a large number of problems, and results show that this method can solve the 0–1 LP accurately and efficiently without iteration. The solution speed is 20 times faster than that of traditional optimization solvers.},

The prescribed performance means that the USV tracks a given trajectory with the arbitrarily predefined speed of response and accuracy. The existing prescribed performance control (PPC) solutions and the traditional robust control approaches for USVs may have the singularity issue or cause a discontinuous control signal. Thereby, a new-type adaptive PPC strategy is put forward in this article. The adaptive technique is devoted to tackling model imperfections as usual, whereas the constraint-handling technique is adopted in a novel way. Herein, we first construct an auxiliary variable instead of using the approach angle or azimuth angle. Then, we impose constraints on the position error, not the tracking error, and the auxiliary variable, simultaneously. In this way, the predefined performance is achieved by moreover a singularity-free continuous control action. These theoretical findings are illustrated via a comparative simulation study.},

Nevertheless, most of previous consensus reaching models focus on adjusting decision makers’ preference relations and ignore the individual consistency, which results in that individual consistency may be destroyed by using these consensus reaching models. Moreover, it has been accepted that words mean different things for different people and thus, it is also necessary to model decision makers’ personalized individual semantics (PISs) in linguistic GDM. This work focuses on developing some PIS-based consistency control and consensus reaching models for linguistic GDM. First, we analyze the problems existing in previous PIS models and then develop a minimum adjustment-based optimization model to test and improve the individual consistency for a linguistic preference relation (LPR). Followed by this, a PIS-based individual consensus-level maximization model and a PIS-based minimum adjustment model are established for consensus reaching in linguistic GDM, in which individual consistency control is considered. Furthermore, an algorithm for consensus reaching is proposed based on these models. To justify the proposed models and algorithm, some numerical results and simulation analysis are provided eventually.},

In order to overcome this issue, a novel conflicting evidence combination approach called autoencoder- K- Means (AE- ${K}$ -Means) is proposed in this article. In AE- ${K}$ -Means, for determining the weight of evidence, a new compound credibility has been defined, which is not only based on autoencoder, $K$ -Means algorithm, but also evidence similarity. The compound credibility effectively integrates the explicit and implicit information of the evidence, thereby helping to further obtain dominant information and eliminate the interference from other factors.

In particular, to solve the nonconvex filter design problem caused by introducing the $H_{-}$ index, the Gerschgorin theorem is first used to linearize the corresponding filter design conditions in the outer region of a ball.

Next, an event-triggered output-feedback control rule is developed in the controller-to-actuator channel to obtain a discrete control signal with less occupation on communication resources without inducing Zeno phenomena. Besides, to enforce system profiles evolve within the predefined performance boundaries with reduced chattering, a tracking differentiator (TD)-based prescribed performance control (TDPPC) is proposed, where the time differentiation of the preselected envelopes can be managed with smooth transient, and a balance between system performance and sampling cost can be ensured. Finally, a sigmoid function-based TD (STD), rather than dynamic surface control, is utilized to overcome the complexity explosion.

It has been studied in depth before. However, most of the existing literature was based on nonadaptive seeding strategies and simple information diffusion models. It considered the number of influenced users as a measurement unit to quantify the revenue. Until the emergence of the collaborate game model, it considered the activity as a basic object to compute the revenue. An activity initiated by a user can only influence those users whose distances are within ${k}$ -hop from the initiator. Based on that, we adopt an adaptive seed strategy and formulate an RM under the size budget (RMSB) problem. If taking into account the product’s promotion, we extend it to an RM under the community budget problem, where the influence can be distributed over the whole network uniformly. We can prove that our objective function is adaptive monotone and not adaptive submodular, but it is adaptive submodular in some special cases. We study these two problems under both the special submodular cases and general nonsubmodular cases, and propose RMSBSolver and RMCBSolver to solve them with strong theoretical guarantees, respectively. In particular, we give a data-dependent approximation ratio by adaptive primal curvature for the RMSB in general nonsubmodular cases. Finally, we evaluate our proposed algorithms by conducting experiments on real datasets, and show the effectiveness and accuracy of our solutions.},

Different with the first-order multiagent consensus, the second-order case needs to achieve the agreement not only on position but also on velocity, therefore this optimized control is more challenging and interesting. To derive the control, reinforcement learning (RL) can be a natural consideration because it can overcome the difficulty of solving the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equation. To implement RL, it needs to iterate both adaptive critic and actor networks each other. However, if this optimized control learns RL from most existing optimal methods that derives the critic and actor adaptive laws from the negative gradient of square of the approximating function of the HJB equation, this control algorithm will be very intricate, because the HJB equation correlated to a second-order nonlinear multiagent system will become very complex due to strong state coupling and nonlinearity. In this work, since the two RL adaptive laws are derived via implementing the gradient descent method to a simple positive function, which is obtained on the basis of a partial derivative of the HJB equation, this optimized control is significantly simple. Meanwhile, it not merely can avoid the requirement of known dynamic acknowledge, but also can release the condition of persistent excitation, which is demanded in most RL optimization methods for training the adaptive parameter more sufficiently. Finally, the proposed control is demonstrated by both theory and computer simulation.},

  abstract     = {The Dempster–Shafer (D-S) evidence theory has been widely used in many fields from probabilistic inference, information fusion to decision analysis due to its superiority to formulate uncertain and incomplete information under a weaker condition than the Bayesian probability theory. To support the elicitation of basic probability assignment (BPA), numerous uncertainty measures have been proposed in the recent decades, which take into account nonspecificity and structural conflict (SC) in either the entropy-alike or nonentropy form. This article is focused primarily on developing a generalized belief entropy to measure and quantify the uncertainty of BPA in a consistent and comprehensive way. The definition of the proposed belief entropy involves three components. Specifically, the first component is Shannon’s definition of entropy of probability functions which can be interpreted as the measure of discord of the mass function among various focal elements. The second component is the measure of total nonspecificity which is the generalization of Dubois–Prade’s definition of nonspecificity measure. Furthermore, the critical component introduced in this article is the utilization of the SC coefficient within an evidence, which fully considers the intersection between each pair of focal elements of the BPA. The characteristics and properties of the new generalized belief entropy are analyzed systematically with theoretical proofs. Finally, the proposed belief entropy is embedded to a three-tuple approach to deal with a practical multiple attribute decision-making (MADM) problem to demonstrate its validity and strengths of measuring nonspecificity and SC in uncertain decision making.},

  abstract     = {This article deals with the fully distributed dual-terminal dynamic event-triggered bipartite output containment control of heterogeneous linear multiagent systems (HLMASs) subject to actuator faults. First, a class of fully distributed dynamic event-triggered observers is proposed over the directed signed communication network for each follower to estimate the leaders’ system matrices and (symmetric) combination states, which are merely available to a small fraction of followers. Then, based on the estimations of leaders’ system matrices, adaptive algorithms are employed to solve the regulator equations. Furthermore, the fully distributed observer-based dynamic event-triggered controllers are proposed by integrating the adaptive gains to compensate for actuator faults. Dual-terminal dynamic event-triggered mechanisms (ETMs) are addressed to exclude not only continuous control updates but also continuous communication among agents. Correspondingly, some mild criteria and the rigorous proofs are established to ensure the implementation of bipartite output containment through the Lyapunov stability theory. Moreover, the strictly positive lower bounds of intervals between two adjacent event-triggered time instants are derived, which indicates that Zeno behavior is ruled out in the dual-terminal dynamic ETMs. Finally, numerical simulations are performed to demonstrate the theoretical analysis.},

The dramatic increase of user tasks, however, poses a significant challenge on DC providers to retain users’ expectations on both aspects. To tackle this challenge, this work first formulates the problem into a constrained biobjective optimization problem. A biobjective algorithm, named simulated-annealing-based adaptive differential evolution (SADE), is presented to simultaneously reduce both the response time of tasks and energy cost. Meanwhile, a method of minimal Manhattan distance is adopted to search for a final knee, for achieving a good balance between response time minimization and energy cost reduction. Experimental results on real-life datasets, i.e., the electricity prices and tasks collected from a Google cluster trace, have proved that SADE yields less task response time and lower energy cost compared with state-of-the-art algorithms.},

This article proposes a scheme to address the sweep coverage problem of MASs within uncertain environments. In the proposed formulation, the coverage region is divided into multiple stripes, of which each has the workload completed by MASs in sequence. When the workload on the current stripe is completed, all the agents switch to the next together. The temporal dependence between the switching time computation and the sweep coverage operation is taken into account, and an online learning strategy is designed to handle environmental uncertainties and balance the workload among agents on the same stripe. Thereby, the distributed sweep coverage algorithm is developed to guarantee the complete sweep coverage, which consists of three operations, i.e., communication, workload partition, and sweeping. Theoretical analysis is afterward conducted to estimate the upper bound for the error between the actual and optimal coverage time. Finally, numerical simulations are carried out to substantiate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed scheme.},

Multiple deep learning-based NRL models have been proposed recently to effectively handling primitive tasks of information network analysis and mining (INAM) domain, including link prediction (LP). LP is considered as an important one due to its multiple applications in many disciplines. In the recent few years, LP in dynamic networks has attracted a lot of attention from researchers to propose novel algorithms for better capturing both rich structural and evolutional information of complex information networks (INs). However, recent models are mainly concentrated on preserving the sequential representations of a given network over time. They have largely ignored other important structural features, such as: intracommunity which contributes to the creation of links between network nodes. In this article, we propose a novel community-driven dynamic NRL technique upon the RNN+GCN framework, called: ComGCN. Specifically, the ComGCN model is a combination of microscopic (node embedding-based) and mesoscopic (intracommunity-based) dynamic network embedding approach which enable effectively handling the LP problem in context of dynamism. Extensive experiments on real-world dynamic networks demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed model compared with recent state-of-the-art baselines.},

  abstract     = {This article aims to realize event-triggered constrained consensus tracking for high-order nonlinear multiagent networks subject to full-state constraints. The main challenge of achieving such goals lies in the fact that the standard designs [e.g., backstepping, event-triggered control, and barrier Lyapunov functions (BLFs)] successfully developed for low-order dynamics fail to work for high-order dynamics. To tackle these issues, a novel high-order event-triggered mechanism is devised to update the actual control input, lowering the communication and computation burden. More precisely, compared with the conventional event-triggered mechanism, not only the amplitudes of control signals and a fixed threshold are considered but a monotonically decreasing function is introduced to allow a relatively big threshold, while guaranteeing consensus tracking error to be small. Then, a high-order tan-type BLF working for both constrained and unconstrained scenarios is incorporated into the distributed adding-one-power-integrator design for the purpose of confining full states within some compact sets all the time. A finite-time convergent differentiator (FTCD) is introduced to circumvent the “explosion of complexity.” The consensus tracking error is shown to eventually converge to a residual set whose size can be adjusted as small as desired through choosing appropriate design parameters. Comparative simulations have been conducted to highlight the superiorities of the developed scheme.},

The popular feature mapping approaches convert each bag into an instance in the new feature space. However, most of them hardly maintain the distinguishability of bags, and the MIL model does not support self-reinforcement. In this article, we propose the multi-instance ensemble learning with discriminative bags (ELDB) algorithm with two new techniques. The bag selection technique obtains a discriminative bag set (dBagSet) according to two parts. First, considering the space and label distribution of the data, the bag selection process is optimized through discriminative analysis to obtain the basic dBagSet. Second, with the state and action transfer strategy, a dBagSet with better distinguishability is obtained through self-reinforcement. The ensemble technique trains a series of classifiers with these dBagSets and obtains the final weighted model. The experimental results show that ELDB is superior to the state-of-the-art MIL mapping solutions.},

It is beneficial to alleviate the long-tail and combinatorial explosion problems in human-object interaction (HOI). Nevertheless, the existing FS-HOI methods only focus on modeling the relationships between labeled samples and unlabeled samples in the Euclidean domain, which neglects the rich relational structures of the visual information among labeled samples and between human actions and objects. Accordingly, we tackle the few-shot HOI task in the non-Euclidean domain and present a graph-based model, namely, task-oriented high-order context graph network (THCG-Net). It contains a task attention module (TA-Module) and a high-order context graph module (HG-Module). In TA-Module, an attention mechanism is designed by utilizing task information to build a task-oriented space, in which the discriminative information for the current task (episode) is captured by embedding the visual features into the task-oriented space. The HG-Module is proposed to construct a task-level graph and takes the context information as high-order knowledge, which provides discriminative guidance for propagating visual information. It captures the discriminability among different categories while highlights the commonality of related categories adaptively, which effectively transfers knowledge to related categories. Extensive experimental results on two benchmark datasets, HICO-FS and TUHOI-FS, are provided. It demonstrates that our THCG-Net significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches, which proves its impressive effectiveness in recognizing various human actions and surrounding objects in few-shot scenarios.},

Due to the existence of switching topologies, the state of the virtual reference system may jump, which further affects the transient performance of the lower tracking system; moreover, the actuator faults may also cause a sudden change in actual system. In order to mitigate the influence of switching topologies and actuator faults on the lower tracking system, the generalized restricted potential function is introduced to ensure the norm of the lower tracking error within the predefined performance function.

To adopt a better cost-saving control, an impulsive pinning scheme is designed. That is, the key nodes in the multiplex networks are pinned and controlled at impulsive instants. At the same time, a virtual leader is introduced. Based on the theory of stochastic impulsive differential equations and the Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional method, the sufficient conditions are derived for the error systems to converge into a bounded region in the sense of the mean square.

  abstract     = {This article investigates the distributed optimal cooperation problems for multiple high-order systems, in which the dynamics of each agent is allowed to be subject to unknown nonlinearities. To eliminate the effect caused by unknown nonlinearities, a nonlinearity estimator is developed based on agents’ states, which successfully reconstructs the nonlinear dynamics if the unknown nonlinearities are bounded. And to minimize the sum of multiple local nonlinear cost functions with Lipschitz-type gradients, a couple of static and adaptive state-dependent algorithms are designed, respectively, where each agent may only have access to its own local cost function. It is challenging to solve such an optimal cooperation problem as the performance of the whole multiagent network is evaluated by the sum of all local performance functions. In order to fulfill the goal of cooperative optimization, a state-dependent distributed optimal cooperation algorithm is proposed first. By utilizing tools from the Lyapunov stability theory and convex optimization analysis, it is proven that the considered distributed optimal cooperation problem for high-order nonlinear systems can be solved by the proposed optimal cooperation algorithm if the state-dependent parameters are suitably selected. It is noted that the selections of the state-dependent parameters depend on some global information of the multiagent systems. Furthermore, by incorporating the proposed optimal cooperation algorithm with adaptive parameters strategy, the optimal cooperation problem is solved in a fully distributed manner. Finally, a numerical simulation is shown to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.},

Different from the case of Newton particles, a nonholonomic dynamics with unknown disturbances is considered. A novel method to decouple the spherical orbit tracking subsystem and the lateral formation flying subsystem is proposed. By overlooking the control of the vehicle’s surge velocity, a nonsmooth spherical orbit tracking algorithm is designed by backstepping. Without considering the spherical orbit tracking errors and using any global information of topologies, a distributed, nonsmooth formation protocol is designed. The input-to-state stability (ISS) theory is used to analyze the converge property of the interconnected system consisting of these two subsystems. Simulation results are given to verify the theoretical analysis.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates the input–output finite-time stability (IO-FTS) for nonlinear hidden semi-Markov switching systems (S-MSSs) via the asynchronous sliding mode control (SMC) approach. Under the assumption that a detector is set up to estimate the mode value, the mode of the original system is not directly accessible. The asynchrony between the system and controller is described as a hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM). Many practical factors, such as semi-Markov switching parameters, finite-time interval, asynchronous phenomenon, uncertain parameters, and nonlinearity, are taking into account during the SMC design process. We aim to design an efficient finite-time asynchronous SMC scheme under a hidden semi-Markov switching effect. A novel sliding switching surface (SSS) is constructed, in which the SMC law rises asynchronously with original S-MSSs. Then, by means of finite-time stability, an asynchronous SMC law is synthesized to guarantee that the associated hidden S-MSSs fulfill the reaching condition within a finite time. Furthermore, sufficient conditions are derived in view of the IO-FTS of sliding mode dynamics under the framework of a novel inequality lemma. Results are given for the application of this control design method to a single-link robot arm model (SLRAM).},

Accordingly, having access to reliable information about tire–road interactions through tire-embedded sensors is desirable for developing enhanced vehicle control systems. Thus, the main objectives of this research are: 1) to analyze data from an experimental accelerometer-based intelligent tire acquired over a wide range of maneuvers, with different vertical loads, velocities, and high slip angles and 2) to develop a lateral force predictor based on a machine learning tool, more specifically, the Gaussian process regression (GPR) technique. It is determined that the proposed intelligent tire system can provide reliable information about the tire–road interactions even in the case of high slip angles. In addition, lateral force models based on GPR can predict forces very well, outperforming other machine learning models and providing levels of uncertainty that can be useful for designing vehicle control strategies.},

For continuous-time FOMASs, by virtue of the variational method, the optimal solution under the constraint of the global performance index function is presented, and then the optimal state-feedback gain matrix (OSFGM) is derived through the Laplace transform and the inverse transform of fractional order. For discrete-time FOMASs, the OSFGM based on the algebraic Riccati equation (ARE) is computed, then it is shown that the OSFGM is a (asymmetric) Laplace matrix which has a zero eigenvalue and the corresponding network structure is a complete graph. Moreover, we rigorously prove that consensus can be achieved under the optimal state-feedback gain matrices. Finally, two simulation examples are shown to check the validity of the proposed theorems.},

  abstract     = {Toward better approximation for the minimum-weighted vertex cover (MWVC) problem in multiagent systems, we present a distributed algorithm from the perspective of learning in games. For self-organized coordination and optimization, we see each vertex as a potential game player who makes decisions using local information of its own and the immediate neighbors. The resulting Nash equilibrium is classified into two categories, i.e., the inferior Nash equilibrium (INE) and the dominant Nash equilibrium (DNE). We show that the optimal solution must be a DNE. To achieve better approximation ratios, local rules of perturbation and weighted memory are designed, with the former destroying the stability of an INE and the latter facilitating the refinement of a DNE. By showing the existence of an improvement path from any INE to a DNE, we prove that when the memory length is larger than 1, our algorithm converges in finite time to DNEs, which could not be improved by exchanging the action of a selected node with all its unselected neighbors. Moreover, additional freedom for solution efficiency refinement is provided by increasing the memory length. Finally, intensive comparison experiments demonstrate the superiority of the presented methodology to the state of the art, both in solution efficiency and computation speed.},

In this study, energy-efficient fuzzy FJSP (EFFJSP) is considered and a bi-population evolutionary algorithm with feedback (FBEA) is proposed to minimize fuzzy makespan and fuzzy total energy consumption and maximize minimum agreement index. The computation of fuzzy energy consumption is given and four heuristics are proposed to produce the initial population. An effective method is presented to evaluate the quality of two populations and a feedback mechanism based on population quality is adopted to dynamically adjust the size of each population. A novel process of reproduction, crossover and mutation is developed based on feedback. An enhanced local search is also used to produce high-quality solutions. Extensive experiments are conducted to test the performance of FBEA. FBEA can provide promising results for EFFJSP.},

  abstract     = {The tracking control of a wastewater treatment process (WWTP) is considered. The process is highly nonlinear, with strong coupling, difficult to model mathematically, and the operation is subject to unknown disturbances. We address this multivariable tracking control problem by applying the direct heuristic dynamic programming (dHDP)-based reinforcement learning control. The control goal is to track a desired reference of the dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration of the 5th aerobic zone ( $S_{O5}$ ) and nitrate concentration of the 2nd anoxic zone ( $S_{NO2}$ ) by manipulating the oxygen transfer coefficient of the 5th aerobic zone ( $K_{L}a_{5}$ ) and internal recycle flow rate ( $Q_{a}$ ). The dHDP aims at achieving a minimal accumulated WWTP tracking error while dealing with strong coupling between the $S_{O5}$ and $S_{NO2}$ and eliminating unknown disturbances in the process. The proposed dHDP approach devises an optimal control strategy entirely driven by WWTP process data as an online learning control method. We have conducted extensive and systematic simulations based on the well-known BSM1 platform of the WWTP controlled by dHDP to compare and contrast performances with other methods.},

  abstract     = {In large-scale group decision making (LSGDM), appropriate clustering analysis is important to consensus reaching since it can reduce the interactive complexity among individuals. According to the traditional clustering method, a conflict may arise between the consensus reaching levels and total adjustment costs within clusters when individuals have different unit adjustment cost, which reflects their willingness to make concessions. Since this conflict may aggravate the consensus complexity, we propose a new $K$ -means clustering method that considers both preferences and the preference adjustment cost. The preference adjustment cost is attached to preferences with a parameter that can be determined by balancing this conflict. Because of such conflict, the proposed clustering algorithm can improve the similarity of intracluster individuals on the preference adjustment cost by offsetting some acceptable consensus reaching levels within clusters. According to the proposed clustering algorithm, individuals who have both similar preferences and adjustment willingness are classified into the same clusters. In this way, the moderator can provide similar compensation strategies for intracluster individuals, which will decrease the adjustment complexity. A practical case study of team construction examines the application of the proposed algorithm, and the related comparative analysis shows that it is convenient for managers to persuade individuals to reach a consensus under the improved clustering results.},

Existing works dealing with this problem either assume the estimated time-varying depth is invertible or require the priori information of the system kinematics. This case potentially leads to the singularity of the control scheme and requirement for a high gain feedback. In this brief, a new image-space observer which does not involve the inversion of the estimated depth is proposed, upon which, we design an adaptive visual tracking controller without using the image-space velocity information. More importantly, the observer employs a passive image Jacobian matrix-based constant feedback instead of high gain feedback and the priori information is no longer demanded. Additionally, the proposed control scheme enjoys a desirable separation property for the robotic dynamics and kinematics which makes it applicable to most industrial/commercial robots having a closed torque control loop and only permitting the joint velocity command. By using the Lyapunov stability analysis, the asymptotical convergence of both image-space tracking errors and observation errors are obtained. Numerical simulations and implementation issues concerning the application to industrial/commercial robots are presented to verify the efficacy of the control scheme.},

Data lake (DL), as a flexible on-demand heterogeneous data management architecture, has become a feasible solution in data management. Metadata modeling for DLs is the key basis for smart analysis and processing. However, the varieties in structures and semantics of industrial WoT data hinder metadata modeling and maintenance. Moreover, the lack of textual descriptions and the semantics hidden in value streams make it hard to automatically construct semantic metadata. The dynamic nature of WoT requires on-time evolution on metadata. To overcome these challenges, we propose an automated bottom-up metadata generation approach for DL of WoT applications. Applying a data-driven framework, raw data are notated as linked data and self-organizing map-based online clustering is applied to real timely extract data characteristics. To recognize entities, concepts and relations, semantics-based entity discovery approach from short texts is proposed according to the feature of WoT data. The numerical analysis is performed to find the hidden relations from raw values. Full-dimensional metadata with rich semantic knowledge are finally built. Experiments on a real-world dataset are conducted to verify the effectiveness of methods and a case study on an energy WoT system is provided to demonstrate the feasibility of the approach.},

Recent advances in neural architectures search (NAS) promise opportunities in automated optimization for disparity estimation. However, the main challenge of the NAS methods is the significant amount of computing time to explore a vast search space [e.g., $1.6\times 10^{29}$ ] and costly training candidates. To reduce the NAS computational demand, many proxy-based NAS methods have been proposed. Despite their success, most of them are designed for comparatively small-scale learning tasks. In this article, we propose a fast NAS method, called FastStereoNet, to enable resource-aware NAS within an intractably large search space. FastStereoNet automatically searches for hardware-friendly CNN architectures based on late acceptance hill climbing (LAHC), followed by simulated annealing (SA). FastStereoNet also employs a fine-tuning with a transferred weights mechanism to improve the convergence of the search process. The collection of these ideas provides competitive results in terms of search time and strikes a balance between accuracy and efficiency. Compared to the state of the art, FastStereoNet provides $5.25\times $ reduction in search time and $44.4\times $ reduction in model size. These benefits are attained while yielding a comparable accuracy that enables seamless deployment of disparity estimation on resource-limited devices. Finally, FastStereoNet significantly improves the perception quality of disparity estimation deployed on field-programmable gate array and Intel Neural Compute Stick 2 accelerator in a significantly less onerous manner.},

First, we design an adaptive event-based consensus control protocol using the local sampled state information so that the consensus errors of all agents are uniformly ultimately bounded. The validity of the above event-triggered adaptive control protocol is confirmed by excluding the Zeno behavior within finite time. Then, based on the RL approach, we present a model-free algorithm to get the feedback gain matrix, and accomplish constructing the adaptive event-triggered control strategy without the knowledge of model information. Distinct with the existing related works, this RL-based event-triggered adaptive control algorithm only relies on the local sampled state information, irrelevant to any model information or global network information. Finally, we provide some examples to demonstrate the validity of the above adaptive event-based consensus algorithm.},

  abstract     = {In this article, classification problems for a class of tensor datasets with a noisy environment are investigated. To address such issues, a novel fuzzy support tensor machine (FSTM) dual model with robustness is established. First, for each input sample in the noisy tensor dataset, we define three kinds of fuzzy membership functions, such as linear, cosine, and exponential forms. In particular, the reconstruction process from one-dimensional (1-D) vector data to third-order tensor data is also derived in the Appendix. Second, the original optimization model of an FSTM on fuzzy membership is designed by constructing the vector pattern of the traditional support vector machine (SVM) models into a tensor pattern. Next, by introducing the Lagrangian multiplier method and tensor-Tucker decomposition method to the original FSTM model, an FSTM dual model without tensor inner product operation is obtained for the first time. Such a dual model with tensor-Tucker decomposition form can avoid conservativeness caused by the vectorization of tensor data in the traditional SVM model. Furthermore, an FSTM classifier is derived by the designed numerical algorithm, and the classification generalization error bound of the FSTM model with a general form is developed. It is worth noting that a linear least-squares FSTM (LLS-FSTM) equation with tensor-Tucker decomposition is also designed in the Appendix to further reduce the slightly time-consuming problem of the solving the dual optimization model FSTM. Finally, two numerical examples are presented to verify the feasibility and validity of the derived FSTM classifier.},

In this article, we propose a novel mixed attribute outlier detection method based on multigranulation relative entropy by employing the neighborhood rough set. First, the neighborhood system is constructed by optimizing the mixed distance metric and the radius of the statistical value. Second, the neighborhood entropy is introduced as an uncertainty measure of data. Furthermore, the three kinds of multigranulation relative entropy-based matrices are defined by three kinds of attribute sequences, and the multigranulation relative entropy-based outlier factor is integrated to indicate the outlier degree of every object. Based on the proposed outlier detection model, the corresponding algorithm is designed. Finally, the proposed algorithm is compared with other nine algorithms through experiments on public data.

Furthermore, the robust variable step-size (VSS) strategy, which is also predicted on the robust cost function, is also utilized to improve the convergence performance of the proposed CR-LMM algorithm, i.e., convergence speed and steady-state mean square deviation. The condition which guarantees the CR-LMM algorithm stability is obtained by analyzing the convergence in the mean and mean-square sense, and the theoretical steady-state result is also derived.

  abstract     = {Prediction of sensor readings in event-based Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications is considered. A new approach is proposed, which allows turning off sensors in periods when their readings can be predicted, thus preserving energy that would be consumed for sensing and communications. The proposed approach uses a long short-term memory (LSTM) model that learns spatiotemporal patterns in sequences of sensorial data for future predictions. The LSTM model and the sensors collaboratively monitor the environment. They are controlled by a reinforcement learning (RL) agent that dynamically decides about using the LSTM prediction versus physical sensing in a way that maximizes energy saving while maintaining prediction accuracy. Two approaches are used for the RL: 1) the Markov decision process (MDP) model-based for low scale applications and 2) deep ${Q}$ -Network-based for larger scales. Compared to the current literature, the proposed solution is unique in predicting all sensor readings for real-time event detection and providing a model capable of learning long-term spatiotemporal correlations, enabling power conservation and detection accuracy balance. We compare the proposed solutions to the most relevant state-of-the-art approaches using a large real dataset collected in a dynamic space by measuring the accuracy, consumed energy, network lifetime, latency, and missed events’ ratio. To investigate the scalability of the solutions, these parameters are calculated for different network sizes. The results show that the system achieves 50\% accuracy with 32\% of activation time and 75\% accuracy with 60\% activation time.},

First, the multiattention layer is introduced to automatically capture the dominant brain regions relevant to mental tasks without incorporating any prior knowledge about the physiology. Then, a multiattention convolutional neural network is employed to extract deep representation from raw EEG signals. Especially, a domain discriminator is applied to deep representation to reduce the differences between sessions for target subjects. The extensive experiments are conducted on three public EEG datasets (Dataset IIa and IIb of BCI Competition IV, and High Gamma dataset), achieving the competitive performance with average classification accuracy of 81.48\%, 82.54\%, and 93.97\%, respectively. All the results outperform the state-of-the-art algorithms demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method. Importantly, we confirm that it is easier and more appropriate to transfer the information from local brain regions than from the whole brain.

  abstract     = {Zeroing neural network (ZNN), an effective method for tracking solutions of dynamic equations, has been developed and improved by various strategies, typically the application of nonlinear activation functions (AFs) and varying parameters (VPs). Unlike VPs, AFs applied in ZNN models act directly on real-time error. The processing unit of v needs to obtain neural state in real time. In the implementation process, highly nonlinear AFs become an important cause of time delays, which eventually leads to instability and oscillation. However, most studies focus on exploring new theoretically valid AFs to improve performance of ZNNs, while ignoring the adverse effects of highly nonlinear AFs. The nonlinearity of AFs requires us fully consider time-delay tolerance of ZNNs using nonlinear AFs, so as to ensure that the model is not unstable even when disturbed by time delays. In this work, delay-perturbed generalized ZNN (DP-GZNN) is proposed to investigate time-delay tolerance of generalized ZNN (G-ZNN) in solving dynamic Lyapunov equation. Considering the nonlinearity of AFs, two delay terms are elegantly added to G-ZNN and DP-GZNN is then derived. After rigorous mathematical derivations, sufficient conditions in a linear matrix inequality (LMI) manner are presented for global convergence of DP-GZNN. Through rich numerical experiments, hyperparameters involved in the analysis process are discussed in detail. Comparative simulations are also conducted to compare the ability of different ZNN models to resist time delays. It is worth to mention that this is the first time to consider the ability of G-ZNN to resist discrete and distributed time delays.},

  abstract     = {Many complex nonlinear optimization or control issues can be transformed into the solving of time-varying nonlinear equations (TVNEs), playing a fundamental role in the control and management of complex systems. As a result, a robust and high-precision online solution method is significant for TVNE. However, there are three main challenges for handling TVNE via the existing methods: First, short-time invariance assumption frequently leveraged in the existing methods leads to lagging errors that are difficult to eliminate. Second, it is difficult in dealing with unknown noise disturbance during the solution process, which causes low solution accuracy or solution failure. Third, existing continuous-time methods are hard to be implemented on digital equipments. In this article, an anti-noise discrete-time neural dynamics (DTND) is designed and studied to overcome the above issues systematically. The theoretical analysis and numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed model effectively eliminates the lagging errors and achieves the accurate solution of the TVNE in a noisy environment. Moreover, to verify the superior numerical computational property of the DTND model, the intention recognition of lower limbs is explored from the artificial systems, computational experiments, and parallel execution (ACP) framework. Specifically, a nonlinear artificial dynamic system (NADS) concerning the human surface electromyogram (sEMG) signals and joint information is established, which performs in parallel with the actual human lower limb physical experiments. Simulation results illustrate that, within the acceptable range of the digital computer, the controller designed by the DTND model can well guide the NADS to accurately recognize the motion intention of the human lower limb.},

  abstract     = {Aiming to addressing the nonrepetitive uncertainties of multiagent systems, this work proposes a discrete-time-distributed adaptive iterative learning control (DDAILC) scheme for an output consensus problem, where two fundamental requirements in the traditional distributed iterative learning control (ILC) methods, i.e., the identical initial states and the repetitive desired trajectories, are removed. Furthermore, the algorithm design and analysis are directly aimed at discrete-time nonlinear multiagent systems, rather than continuous-time ones, to meet the needs of practical implementations. The iteration-varying trajectory of the virtual leader is included in the learning control protocol for a compensation. The adaptive parameter-updating law works along the iteration dimension by using a general consensus error that contains the output data of adjacent agents. To ensure the estimation of the control gain to be nonzero, a semisaturator is utilized in the parameter-updating law. The convergence of the output consensus is shown rigorously. Both numerical and practical examples are used to test the theoretical results. Moreover, the DDAILC efficiently improves performance of the building heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system by utilizing both the distributed topology and the repetitive dynamic characteristic.},

  abstract     = {This study has the aim of introducing a new type of trajectory tracking robust controllers for a class of rehabilitation robotic system considering the articulations restrictions. The robotic device consists of a suspended biped configuration. The suggested robust control considers the application of state depending gains which provide finite-time convergence for the tracking deviation. The state restrictions are fulfilled by the implementation of controller gains estimated by a class of the controlled tangent barrier Lyapunov function. Stability analysis for the tracking error yields the explicit design of the state dependent gains. The rate of convergence for the controller design is enhanced using a matrix inequality convex optimization method. Based on the forward complete characteristic of the suggested rehabilitation device, it is allowed using a finite-time convergent super-twisting-based differentiator to concrete an output feedback realization of the proposed controller. A computerized model of the tendered rehabilitation robot provides a reliable testing platform to the suggested roust controller. Numerical evaluations appear to serve as an indirect confirmation for the tracking error convergence, satisfying the articulation restrictions, and the effect of the gain optimization design. For comparison purposes, the regular state feedback control design is considered as benchmark. The faster convergence of the mean square estimation of the tracking error justifies the design of the proposed control design as well as the state feedback structure justifies the origin is a fixed-time stable equilibrium point for the space of tracking error at the same time that state space restrictions remain satisfied. The experimental evaluations of the proposed controller justifies the barrier controller which, in spite of the modeling uncertainties and the implementation issues, tracked the reference trajectories.},

  abstract     = {Single-cell RNA sequencing is a transformative technology that enables us to study the heterogeneity of the tissue at the cellular level. Clustering is used as the key computational approach to group cells under the transcriptome profiles from single-cell RNA-seq data. However, accurate identification of distinct cell types is facing the challenge of high dimensionality, and it could cause uninformative clusters when clustering is directly applied on the original transcriptome. To address such challenge, an evolutionary multiobjective deep clustering (EMDC) algorithm is proposed to identify single-cell RNA-seq data in this study. First, EMDC removes redundant and irrelevant genes by applying the differential gene expression analysis to identify differentially expressed genes across biological conditions. After that, a deep autoencoder is proposed to project the high-dimensional data into different low-dimensional nonlinear embedding subspaces under different bottleneck layers. Then, the basic clustering algorithm is applied in those nonlinear embedding subspaces to generate some basic clustering results to produce the cluster ensemble. To lessen the unnecessary cost produced by those clusterings in the ensemble, the multiobjective evolutionary optimization is designed to prune the basic clustering results in the ensemble, unleashing its cell type discovery performance under three objective functions. Multiple experiments have been conducted on 30 synthetic single-cell RNA-seq datasets and six real single-cell RNA-seq datasets, which reveal that EMDC outperforms eight other clustering methods and three multiobjective optimization algorithms in cell type identification. In addition, we have conducted extensive comparisons to effectively demonstrate the impact of each component in our proposed EMDC.},

  abstract     = {In this article, an optimized tracking control scheme is studied for the quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (QUAV) system by combining both reinforcement learning (RL) and the backstepping technique. The RL aims to overcome the difficulty coming from solving the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equation, and it is performed via iterating both critic and actor each other, where the critic is for improving the control performance and the actor is for executing the control behavior. In mathematics, a QUAV system is composed of two connected subsystems that are, respectively, modeled by the translational and rotational dynamic equations, which are coupled via a rotation matrix; hence, the optimized tracking scheme is composed of two interconnected individual controls corresponding to the position and attitude, respectively. To achieve the two optimized position and attitude controls, the RL is constructed on the basis of the neural network (NN) approximation of the HJB equation’s solution by utilizing NN’s outstanding function approximation ability. Particularly, the position control is accomplished by introducing an intermediate control because the translational dynamic is an underactuated system. Since the proposed RL algorithm is significantly simple in comparison with the published methods, the optimized QUAV control can be easily executed in practical applications. Finally, the results are demonstrated by a Lyapunov stability analysis and a numerical simulation.},

When cyber-attacks compromise some sensory nodes, the estimation results of the local finite-time estimators which use the measurements of the attacked sensors can be corrupted. An efficient detection algorithm is thus proposed to identify the valid local estimators that are completely devoid of the attacked sensory nodes. The information of the valid local estimators is then used to achieve secure state estimation and localization of the launched cyber-attack. The necessary and sufficient conditions for the feasibility and finite-time convergence of the proposed estimation mechanism are analytically derived and proven. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by testing it on a dc electric motor. Likewise, some online software-in-the-loop tests are conducted to demonstrate the real-time feasibility of the proposed algorithm.},

Performance optimization and design simplicity are hardly taken simultaneously into account by existing controllers. For this sake, the multidimensional Taylor network (MTN) controller, which involves both transient improvement and design simplicity, is proposed here. The MTN controller, as a novel one with a fixed structure, is capable of making the proposed system asymptotically track the reference with no need of system information except for the control direction. A performance index related to the transient improvement by dynamic regulation is established. Parameters of the MTN controller are adapted for the optimization problem in line with this performance index of the arbitrary approximation by the polynomial function. The existence and the realizability of the solution to the optimization problem are demonstrated. Specific steps of the controller design are given. The effectiveness of the proposed controller is confirmed by its theoretical analysis as well as its application to a two-link manipulator system.},

In addition, the interexecution time is lower bounded by a positive constant, and it is assured that the Zeno behavior will not happen. Finally, the effectiveness of the obtained results is illustrated by an example.},

  abstract     = {An optimal switching heating control strategy based on minimum margin (OS-MM) is proposed for high efficiency, low energy consumption, and high-uniformity fine control in a large-scale vertical quench furnace. This work was stimulated by the need for solving the contradiction between the heating rate and temperature overshoot to achieve a rapid rise in temperature with no overshoot. Based on a three-dimensional (3-D) transient temperature field model of the quenching furnace, the temperature field optimization control problem is transformed into a boundary optimization control problem of rapid heating, whereby it is rigorously proved that the fastest rise in temperature is attained by the full-power heating, which satisfies the bang-bang characteristics. The key parameter that determines the overshoot in the full-power heating mode is introduced and defined as the minimum margin in the temperature-rising process. The analytical expression for solving the minimum margin is calculated by the eigenfunction expansion method and using the strong metal thermal inertia of the internal temperature field, the OS-MM method is designed to stop the heating in advance at a calculated switching point to optimize full-power heating, thus conserving energy by reducing its consumption. The results of simulation and industrial experiments show that this strategy greatly shortens the temperature adjusting time, significantly reduces energy consumption, and effectively improves the control performance indices, such as overshoot and static error in the temperature holding period of the thermal treatment process, as compared to the existing heating methods.},

  abstract     = {In this article, an adaptive swarm control within saturated input based on the nonlinear coupling degree is proposed. Swarm control is a forward study in kinematics and dynamics of the swarm system. However, the coupling degree in the previous work can only manifest whether the agents in the swarm being connected or not, ignoring the connection strength. As a result, the nonlinear coupling degree is proposed, which is more suitable for practical engineering than the previous coupling degree. Based on the nonlinear coupling degree, we put forward novel swarm kinematics and dynamics. Besides, the effects of input saturation and nonlinear dynamics should be considered for this novel swarm control based on the nonlinear coupling degree. Therefore, we introduce the backstepping method to design an adaptive swarm controller. With this controller, the input saturation auxiliary system is designed to reduce the effects of input saturation, and a radial basis function neural network (RBF-NN) is introduced to approximate the nonlinear dynamics. To overcome the differential explosion in the backstepping method, a command filter is put forward to reduce the amount of calculation and reduces the difficulty of the controller design. It is proved that the proposed controller ensures stability based on the Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, the simulation results of a multiagent system composed of six omnidirectional mobile robots illustrate the validity of the proposed controller.},

  abstract     = {Multilabel image recognition, a critically practical task in computer vision, aims to predict multiple objects present in each image. The existing studies mainly focus on conceptual visual cues but fail to reconcile the visual information with their semantic guidance. Intuitively, humans can not only associate extra topological concepts but also imagine other approximate scenes based on a semantic description. Inspired by such semantic-interactive capability, two different types of semantic priors, i.e., the concept correlations of the same scene and semantic similarities among different scenes, should be further explored for the recognition decisions. To efficiently interact with these semantic relationships, in this article, we propose a novel semantic-interactive graph convolutional network (SI-GCN), which can leverage the topological information learned from knowledge graphs to boost the performance of multilabel recognition. Specifically, the proposed SI-GCN framework consists of two different GCN-based branches in parallel, i.e., concept correlations learning (CCL) branch and semantic similarity learning (SSL) branch. Inputting the semantic-embedding vectors of all the concepts, the CCL branch maps the label co-occurrence graph into a set of interdependent concept classifiers. Recalibrating the image feature embedding with the standardized supervision of the semantic similarity graph, the SSL branch learns the semantically consistent in-batch visual representations. Finally, a well-established interactive learning scheme is formulated to concurrently optimize the obtained concept classifiers and the visual representation learning in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments on the MS-COCO and Pascal VOC 2007 &amp; 2012 benchmarks demonstrate the superiorities of the proposed SI-GCN method compared to the state-of-the-art baselines.},

However, none of the existing works have considered systems with multiple work-sharing units. This article makes advancements in the state of the art by modeling condition-based MARs for nonrepairable work-sharing systems that must perform a specified amount of work during the primary mission (PM). The MAR considered presumes aborting the PM to prevent considerable damage when the number of available units reduces to a certain number ${k}$ while the amount of work accomplished in the PM is less than ${L}$ ( ${k}$ ). After the PM abortion, a rescue procedure (RP) is executed by the remaining units to survive the system. Dynamic operating conditions during PM and RP are considered. A probabilistic model-based numerical algorithm is proposed to evaluate several performance metrics, including mission success probability, RP success probability, damage avoidance probability, and expected cost of losses. The MAR optimization problem for minimizing the expected cost of losses is formulated and solved using the genetic algorithm. An example of a chemical reactor system is provided to demonstrate the proposed algorithm as well as the benefit of MARs optimized in comparison to the “no abort” policy and the most conservative abort policy (the PM aborts upon the failure of any unit). Effects of several model parameters on the system performance metrics and optimization solutions are also examined through examples.},

A regressor that predicts two or more outputs, i.e., multioutput regression, is commonly used in many applications. However, current multioutput regressors use a batch method to handle data, which presents compatibility issues for streaming data as they need to be analyzed online. To address this issue, we present a multioutput regression system, called MORStreaming, for streaming data. MORStreaming uses an instance-based model to make predictions because this model can quickly adapt to change by only storing new instances or by throwing away old instances. However, learning instances in our regression system are constrained by online demand and need to consider the relationship between outputs. Therefore, MORStreaming consists of two algorithms: 1) an online algorithm based on topology networks which is designed to learn the instances and 2) an online algorithm based on adaptive rules which is designed to learn the correlation between outputs automatically. Experiments involving both artificial and real-world datasets indicate MORStreaming can achieve superior performance compared with other multioutput methods.},

To precisely localize the missing target, fundamental target localization cases in distinct crowdsourced environments are formally classified and efficiently addressed to reduce the positioning errors with different numbers of smartphones detecting the missing target and different numbers of fixed iBeacon nodes nearby these target-detecting smartphones. According to our review of relevant research, this is the first solution that can provide the crowdsourced guiding path to a missing target with high localization accuracy for all densities of participating smartphones and iBeacon nodes. In particular, an Android-based prototype with static and mobile iBeacon nodes is implemented to verify the feasibility and superiority of our framework.

Although the followers cannot obtain the given tracking information directly, they can obtain the corresponding information from leaders and other followers through the communication network based on the graph theory. In terms of this case, a distributed formation-containment (FC) control method is proposed to handle the related flight problems. We aim to develop a formation control for the leader QUAVs and a containment control for the follower QUAVs with the graph theory. Furthermore, a neural network (NN) technique is utilized to cope with the uncertainty of each QUAV. In order to guarantee good flight performance when tracking, the finite-time stability theorem is introduced into the control design to make each QUAV achieve satisfactory tacking performance in finite time. Finally, numerical simulations are conducted in the platform of two-layer 16 QUAVs to validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed NN-based finite-time FC control.},

First, a new event-triggered parity relation is obtained and the parity space-based residual signal achieves complete decoupling with the event-triggered transmission error.

By means of the concept of bounded energy and the independent Bernoulli-distributed (BD) white sequences, a representative attack model is given. A definition of mean-square (MS) security in H 2 -sense is employed to reasonably explain the dynamics process of the controlled systems. We aim at designing a set of resilient RMPC controllers so as to make the closed-loop system state under consideration of deception attacks and the RR protocol enter and stay in a certain bounded region. Furthermore, with the aid of stochastic analysis methods and inequality analysis techniques, sufficient conditions are obtained to satisfy the desirable security requirements. To tackle the nonconvex obstacles resulting from attacks and the RR protocol, the cone complementary linearization (CCL) method is exploited to cast them into a convex optimization problem (OP) for its solvability. Then, an online OP regarding a certain upper bound of the concerned objective is provided for the solvability and resilient RMPC-based controller gains are obtained. Finally, two examples, including a high-purity distillation one and a numerical one, are used to demonstrate the effectiveness and the validity of the proposed techniques.},

  abstract     = {In this article, an adaptive output feedback compensation scheme is proposed for a class of uncertain nonlinear systems with a set of redundant actuators and a sensor. The sensor output is the only information available for output feedback. Both the actuators and the sensor may suffer from failures during operation and, therefore, all the system states are not available. To estimate the unmeasured states, a modified high-gain observer is designed which can not only ensure the closed-loop system stability but also improve the tracking performance. In the adaptive controller design, to overcome the complexity due to the unknown actuator and sensor failures coupled with the nonlinear functions and unknown parameters, an upper bound estimation method is adopted, which greatly simplifies the design procedure. It is proved that with the proposed scheme, the actuator and sensor failures can be compensated simultaneously, the reconfiguration can be adaptively updated without fault detection and isolation, and the real-tracking error can converge to a residual set, that is, mainly proportional to the sensor gain variation and measurement error.},

In order to detect cyberattacks, the globally acquired, real-time sensor data needs to be analyzed in a centralized fashion. However, owing to operational constraints, such a centralized sharing mechanism turns out to be a major obstacle. In this article, we propose a blockchain-based decentralized framework for detecting coordinated replay attacks with full privacy of sensor data. We develop a Bayesian inference mechanism employing locally reported attack probabilities that is tailor made for a blockchain framework. We compare our framework to a traditional decentralized algorithm based on the broadcast gossip framework both theoretically as well as empirically. With the help of experiments on a private Ethereum blockchain, we show that our approach achieves good detection quality and significantly outperforms gossip-driven approaches in terms of accuracy, timeliness, and scalability.},

Hence, the heavy computational costs and tedious parameter tuning phase can be remedied. Moreover, both the transient and steady-state suspension performance can be retained by incorporating prescribed performance functions (PPFs) into the control implementation. This guaranteed performance is particularly useful for guaranteeing the safe operation of suspension systems. Apart from theoretical studies, some practical considerations of control implementation and several parameter tuning guidelines are suggested.

Moreover, plant parameters may change in different transportation tasks and are difficult to be measured accurately, which leads to inaccurate gravity (torque) compensation and further brings positioning errors. Hence, most existing controllers based on exact model knowledge cannot ensure satisfactory control performance any longer . In order to handle the above issues, this article designs an adaptive sliding mode tracking controller for DBC systems based on the original complicated nonlinear dynamics without any linearization/simplification operations, which is the first one to effectively achieve both anti-swing and trajectory tracking control in the presence of parametric uncertainties. Not only can the state variables converge to the proposed sliding surface within finite time but also payload swing angles can be completely eliminated; consequently, the working efficiency and operation safety are further guaranteed. The corresponding stability and convergence for the equilibrium point of the closed-loop system are proven by rigorous mathematical analysis based on the Lyapunov techniques and Barbalat’s lemma. Hardware experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the presented controller.},

A systematic framework for analyzing multiasynchronous switching stability and solving controller gains is established. Different Lyapunov functionals are employed, and new tight bound conditions on average dwell time are constructed. Besides, an active packet loss approach for handling packets disorder issues caused by large transmission delays is presented. Since the activation instants of the system, triggering scheme, and controller are mutually staggered with the data updating instants of the actuator, a novel analytical method aiming at the coupling effect is proposed.

The periodic sampling-based adaptive event-triggering schemes with switching structure are first proposed, which can dynamically adjust triggered conditions based on system performance. It is assumed that only the event-triggered and quantized data of the system state and the event-triggered switching signal are available for controllers. However, since the switching signal is sampled and triggered, asynchronous switching may occur between subsystems and subcontrollers. Furthermore, the data injection attacks are considered in the communication network of the system. A time-delay closed-loop switched T–S fuzzy system model is obtained by using a model transformation technique. The resulting criterion provides sufficient conditions to ensure that the closed-loop system subject to data injection attacks is exponential stability with an $H_{\infty }$ performance. Moreover, a set of conditions for the co-design of controllers and adaptive event-triggering schemes is presented.

An adaptive sliding mode control (SMC) strategy is proposed to guarantee practical fixed-time closed-loop stability even in the presence of system uncertainties. Unlike existing methodologies, the sliding mode surface is developed to satisfy a novel sufficient condition of fixed-time stability. The sliding manifold design also circumvents the unwinding phenomenon arising in quaternion representations. Particularly, this controller is developed to generate a smooth control profile by using a new parameter update law. Rigorous Lyapunov analyses are further employed to ensure the fixed-time closed-loop stability irrespective of the system initial states.

Furthermore, this study investigates the negative conductance introduced by constant power loads. Based on the properties of Laplacian matrices, the positive definiteness requirement on the conductance matrix is relaxed. A sufficient stability condition on ZIP loads is obtained with improved adaptability. By using the Lyapunov method, large-signal stability is analyzed rigorously for a wide range of loading conditions.

  abstract     = {In this article, a composite anti-disturbance control of disturbance rejection and attenuation for a class of nonlinear positive systems is proposed for the first time to achieve both positivity and stability. The disturbance observer-based control (DOBC) method is utilized to compensate for the effects of the modeled disturbances, while the $L_{1}$ control strategy is adopted to suppress the effects of the disturbances which are not compensable to satisfy the $L_{1}$ index performance. Besides, two analysis schemes of the closed-loop system are presented. The first scheme is commonly used and is easy for analysis, but it has some conservativeness. The second scheme is proposed novelly with less conservativeness, which releases the positivity constraint of disturbance estimation errors. The corresponding theorems and algorithms are proposed for necessary conditions and solutions. Finally, two examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control schemes.},

  abstract     = {Proximal policy optimization (PPO) is a deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on the actor–critic (AC) architecture. In the classic AC architecture, the Critic (value) network is used to estimate the value function while the Actor (policy) network optimizes the policy according to the estimated value function. The efficiency of the classic AC architecture is limited due that the policy does not directly participate in the value function update. The classic AC architecture will make the value function estimation inaccurate, which will affect the performance of the PPO algorithm. For improvement, we designed a novel AC architecture with policy feedback (AC-PF) by introducing the policy into the update process of the value function and further proposed the PPO with policy feedback (PPO-PF). For the AC-PF architecture, the policy-based expected (PBE) value function and discount reward formulas are designed by drawing inspiration from expected Sarsa. In order to enhance the sensitivity of the value function to the change of policy and to improve the accuracy of PBE value estimation at the early learning stage, we proposed a policy update method based on the clipped discount factor. Moreover, we specifically defined the loss functions of the policy network and value network to ensure that the policy update of PPO-PF satisfies the unbiased estimation of the trust region. Experiments on Atari games and control tasks show that compared to PPO, PPO-PF has faster convergence speed, higher reward, and smaller variance of reward.},

First, the equivalent-input-disturbance method is employed to reconstruct the system state and to estimate the disturbance. A prediction of the disturbance is calculated to reduce the effect of a phase lag caused by the delays. A new predictive scheme is designed for feedback control. Next, the system is divided into two subsystems for analysis and design: one for reference tracking and the other for disturbance rejection. Sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee the system’s stability. An analysis of the method reveals that the disturbance rejection can be viewed as a patch to the predictor-based feedback control.

By utilizing the property of quadratic functions, a reduced algorithm can remove the dependence of initial conditions in the estimation of the upper bound of settling time and achieve a fixed-time result.

In order to lessen the network resources, a novel model-based (MB) adaptive event-triggered (ET) tracking control scheme is put forward in this article for strict-feedback discrete-time nonlinear systems. In this article, an event-based adaptive model is constructed by the combination of an $n$ -step-ahead predictor and event-sampled neural networks. Then, the adaptive neural model is used for designing the MB ET controller. Besides, a modified ET condition is constructed without any delay. By combining a decoupled backstepping framework, the reverse Lyapunov stability technology is developed to verify the ultimate boundedness of all closed-loop signals and the convergence of the tracking error. Compared to the zero-order hold method, which keeps transmitted state signals unchanged in the interevent period, the proposed MB ET control scheme can keep the real-time update of state signals transmitted to the controller. It means that the triggering error will be smaller by the MB trigger mechanism, thereby improving the event-based tracking performance and further saving communication resources. Comparisons of simulation results are given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.},

To address these limitations, in this article, a distributed event-triggered impulsive control strategy for the consensus problem of fractional-order multiagent networks (FOMANs) is investigated. By collecting the local instantaneous access information, the distributed tracking algorithm with a novel triggering condition is proposed, which is available for both linear and nonlinear systems. Combining with general quadratic Lyapunov stability method and discontinuous control theory, the sufficient conditions of consensus in terms of gain parameter and impulsive interval are derived. Furthermore, the minimal length of interevent is proven to be strictly greater than zero, which guarantees the nonexistence of Zeno-behavior in the closed-loop system. In addition, the implementation of the fractional order algorithm, the quantitative relationship between fractional order $\alpha $ or parameter $a$ in the triggering function, and the number of event-triggered impulsive instants are discussed. At the end of this article, two illustrative examples with numerical and circuit simulations are provided to validate the effectiveness of above results.},

In the sense of combined dwell-time and average dwell-time, it is assumed that the switching is slow enough. Suppose that the bound of delay is known but the one of disturbance is unknown. An estimation for the bound of disturbance is used to counteract the unknown disturbance. By extending the approach of the delay-free case, a communication and control strategy is developed by introducing a virtual system. On this basis, the exponential decay and practical stability of the closed-loop system are guaranteed by using a Lyapunov function.

  abstract     = {There is insufficient current understanding of how to apply fully decentralized control to networks of sparsely coupled nonlinear dynamical subsystems subject to noise to track a desired state. As exemplars, this class of problem is motivated by practical requirements of creating decentralized power grids robust to cascade failures, the digital transformation of Industry 4.0 managing IoT connectivity reliably, and controlling transport flow in smart cities by computing at the edge. We demonstrate that an approach utilizing probability theory to characterize and exploit the uncertainty in locally received information, and locally optimized messages passed between neighboring subsystems is sufficient to implicitly infer global knowledge. Thus, control of a global state could be realized through decentralized control signals applied only to local subsystems using only local information without any reference to a global current state. Given a global system that can be decomposed into a set of locally coupled subsystems, we develop a theoretical method of probabilistic message passing and probabilistic control signals all interacting only at the subsystem level, but which promotes a system-wide convergence to a desired state. Our theoretical results are corroborated using computational experiments on a network of a 10-node partially coupled system decomposed into four separated subsystems with control inputs applied and determined at the subsystem level. Comparing the results with a centralized control method utilizing information from all the nodes to achieve global state convergence validates our hypothesis that local decentralized probabilistic control can be affected by the mechanism of local probabilistic message passing without needing access to global centralized information. We also provide a set of numerical experiments increasing the network size showing that the decentralized algorithm is independent of the global system size.},

  abstract     = {Multitasking optimization can achieve better performance than traditional single-tasking optimization by leveraging knowledge transfer between tasks. However, the current multitasking optimization algorithms suffer from some deficiencies. Particularly, on high similar problems, the existing algorithms might fail to take full advantage of knowledge transfer to accelerate the convergence of the search, or easily get trapped in the local optima. Whereas, on low similar problems, they tend to suffer from negative transfer, resulting in performance degradation. To solve these issues, this article proposes an evolutionary multitasking optimization algorithm for multiobjective/many-objective optimization with two-stage adaptive knowledge transfer based on population distribution. The resultant algorithm named EMT-PD can improve the convergence performance of the target optimization tasks based on the knowledge extracted from the probability model that reflects the search trend of the whole population. At the first stage of knowledge transfer, an adaptive weight is used to adjust the search step size of each individual, which can reduce the impact of negative transfer. At the second stage of knowledge transfer, the search range of each individual is further adjusted dynamically, which can improve the population diversity and be beneficial for jumping out of the local optima. Experimental results on multitasking multiobjective optimization test suites show that EMT-PD is superior to other state-of-the-art evolutionary multitasking/single-tasking algorithms. To further investigate the effectiveness of EMT-PD on many-objective optimization problems, a multitasking many-objective optimization test suite is also designed in this article. The experimental results on the new test suite also demonstrate the competitiveness of EMT-PD.},

  abstract     = {In distributed real-time communication systems, common knowledge of the global time is crucial. It prevents message violations on the bus and allows independent components to collaborate within a real-time system on a timely basis. Systems with hard real-time requirements need to have high precision and accuracy of time. This is achieved by hardware-supported frame time-stamping mechanisms as found in dedicated protocols, such as time-triggered CAN (TTCAN), Flexray, and time-sensitive networking (TSN)-enabled Ethernet. However, many microcontroller units are not specifically designed to provide such a hardware-based solution at the communication interface. Therefore, a software-based implementation of the time synchronization algorithm is needed. Nevertheless, some commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) microcontroller units already provide an IEEE 1588-enabled Ethernet interface, including a high-precision timer module with rate correction. This module can be used for time synchronization purposes to align a set of distributed clocks via various communication interfaces. This article investigates the accuracy of software-based and hardware-supported time synchronization algorithm over the controller area network (CAN) protocol using a COTS microcontroller. As a result, we present identified jitter and delay sources as well as the achieved time accuracy. We show that using an advanced timer module combined with additional system knowledge allows submicrosecond precision and accuracies.},

In this article, we propose a data-driven policy optimization with deep reinforcement learning (PODRL) for the adversarial MTA. We design a comprehensive reward function to motivate the optimization of assignment policy. As such, the learned policy can implicitly model the penetration of missiles under an adversarial environment in a data-driven way. We also present a fair sample strategy to improve the sample efficiency and accelerate the policy optimization. Experimental results show that PODRL can adaptively generate satisfactory solutions in both small-scale and large-scale instances.

In this article, we propose a two-dimensional (2-D) parametric polynomial chaotic system (2D-PPCS) as a general system that can yield many 2-D chaotic maps with different exponent coefficient settings. The 2D-PPCS initializes two parametric polynomials and then applies modular chaotification to the polynomials. Setting different control parameters allows the 2D-PPCS to customize its Lyapunov exponents in order to obtain robust chaos and behaviors with desired complexity. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates the robust chaotic behavior of the 2D-PPCS. Two illustrative examples are provided and tested based on numeral experiments to verify the effectiveness of the 2D-PPCS. A chaos-based pseudorandom number generator is also developed to illustrate the applications of the 2D-PPCS. The experimental results demonstrate that these examples of the 2D-PPCS can achieve robust and desired chaos, have better performance, and generate higher randomness pseudorandom numbers than some representative 2-D chaotic maps.},

  abstract     = {Fog computing has been an effective paradigm of real-time applications in the IoT area, which enables task offloading at network edge devices. Particularly, many emerging vehicular applications require real-time interaction between the terminal users and computation servers, which can be implemented in fog-based architecture. However, it is still challenging to apply fog computing in vehicular networks due to high mobility of vehicles and uneven distribution of vehicle density, which may result in performance degradation, such as unbalanced workload and unexpected task failure. In this article, we investigate a new service scenario of task offloading under a three-layer service architecture, where the resources of vehicular fog (VF), fog server (FS), and central cloud (CC) are utilized in a cooperative way. On this basis, we formulate the probabilistic task offloading (PTO) problem by synthesizing task transmission, computation, and result retrieval, as well as characterizing the heterogeneity of computation servers. The objective of the PTO is to minimize the weighted sum of execution delay, energy consumption, and payment cost. To resolve the PTO problem, we propose a comprehensive task offloading algorithm by combining the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMMs) and particle swarm optimization (PSO), called ADMM-PSO. The basic idea of the ADMM-PSO is to divide the PTO problem into multiple unconstrained subproblems and achieve the optimal solution in the form of an iterative coordination process. For each iteration, the solution is achieved by solving each subproblem with the PSO and updated based on a designed rule, which is able to converge to the optimal solution when the stop criterion is satisfied. Finally, we build the simulation model and implement the proposed algorithm for performance evaluation. The simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm under a wide range of service scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Root cause analysis (RCA) methods for effectively identifying the critical causes of abnormal processes have attracted attention because manufacturing processes have grown in scale and complexity. However, the existing methods for building automatic RCA models suffer from the disadvantage of typically requiring expert knowledge. In addition, without a dataset representing the causal relationship of multivariate processes, it is difficult to provide useful information for RCA. Although data-driven RCA methods have been proposed, most are based on classification models. Given that product quality is defined as a continuous variable in many manufacturing industries, classification models are limited in deriving root causes affecting the product quality level. In this article, we propose a regression model-based RCA method, which we call quality-discriminative localization, consisting of a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based activation mapping of multisensor signal data. In our proposed method, the CNN predicts the product quality of a continuous variable. Activation mapping then extracts causal maps that highlight significant sensor signals for each product. To identify the root causes, we generate a root cause map from the weighted sum of quality and causal maps. We consider root causes as locations of abnormal processes and processing times from localized activation scores on the root cause map. We experimentally demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed method with simulated data and real process data from a steel manufacturing process. Our results show that the proposed method successfully identifies root causes with distinct sensor signal patterns.},

The observers allow each agent to share its information with its underlying neighbors only at sampled instants of time, thus making a distinct difference from the existing results that require the exosystem matrix to be accessible to all agents at every continuous instant of time. Second, a sufficient condition is derived such that the observer error systems are exponentially stable under the influence of communication delays among interacting agents. Third, new distributed adaptive fault-tolerant controllers, which promise fewer adaptive parameters, are presented to compensate for the actuator faults. It is shown that the developed controllers are capable to effectively and efficiently solve the cooperative fault-tolerant output regulation problem with reduced computational complexity.

  abstract     = {Currently, visual-tactile fusion learning for robotic object recognition has achieved appealing performance, due to the fact that visual and tactile data can offer complementary information. However: 1) the distinct gap between vision and touch makes it difficult to fully explore the complementary information, which would further lead to performance degradation and 2) most of the existing visual-tactile fused learning methods assume that visual and tactile data are complete, which is often difficult to be satisfied in many real-world applications. In this article, we propose a partial visual-tactile fused (PVTF) framework for robotic object recognition to address these challenges. Specifically, we first employ two modality-specific (MS) encoders to encode partial visual-tactile data into two incomplete subspaces (i.e., visual subspace and tactile subspace). Then, a modality gap mitigated (MGM) network is adopted to discover modality-invariant high-level label information, which is utilized to generate gap loss and further help updating the MS encoders for relatively consistent visual and tactile subspaces generation. In this way, the huge gap between vision and touch is mitigated, which would further contribute to mine the complementary visual-tactile information. Finally, to achieve data completeness and complementary visual-tactile information exploration simultaneously, a cycle subspace leaning technique is proposed to project the incomplete subspaces into a complete subspace by fully exploiting all the obtainable samples, where complete latent representations with maximum complementary information can be learned. A lot of comparative experiments conducted on three visual-tactile datasets validate the advantage of the proposed PVTF framework, by comparing with state-of-the-art baselines.},

First, a distributed TVF and trajectory tracking control protocol employing neighborhood interaction information is developed in the presence of communication delays. Second, since the Laplacian matrix of a graph can be decomposed into the product of two specific matrices, the TVF and trajectory tracking $H_{\infty }$ control problem is converted into the lower dimension asymptotic stability problem of a closed-loop system by applying an appropriate variable conversion. Third, a Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional is constructed to analyze the stability of MASs. Sufficient conditions are obtained in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) to ensure the completion of the TVF and formation center trajectory tracking of MASs. In the meantime, the maximum allowable communication delay can be calculated by the LMIs.

The items with the partial derivative of the virtual controller are combined together by using backstepping, and then the fuzzy logic systems (FLSs) are used to approximate these combined items, so that the designed virtual controller does not have the partial derivative of the previous virtual controllers. Therefore, this method not only reduces the calculation burden in the backstepping method, but also avoids the disadvantages of dynamic surface control (DSC). Finally, a function $\Theta $ is constructed such that the overall performance (dynamic performance and steady-state performance) of the tracking error (OPTE) is constrained by PP functions. The proposed control algorithm ensures that all the signals are semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB), and the tracking error achieves the PPC. Simulation examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Gastroscopy is a widely adopted method for locating gastric lesions and performing the early screening and diagnosis of gastric cancer (GC). However, the effectiveness of traditional GC screening methods depends on the medical skills of the gastroscopy specialist. A lack of knowledge and experience may lead to misdiagnosis and mistreatment, especially in small-scale hospitals. Recently, there has been a significant increase in studies on data-driven computer-aided diagnosis techniques. In this article, we propose a novel intelligent decision-making method for GC screening (ID-GCS), a multimodal semantic fusion-based data-driven decision-making system. ID-GCS exploits a hybrid attention mechanism to extract textual semantics from multimodal gastroscopy reports and performs semantic fusion to integrate the semantics of textual gastroscopy reports and images, resulting in improved interpretability of gastroscopy findings. We evaluated ID-GCS using a real gastroscopy report dataset, and experimental results show that compared with state-of-the-art methods, ID-GCS achieves better sensitivity and accuracy in GC screening.},

However, the tracking control of the FJR is challenging due to its inherent problems, such as underactuation, coupling, nonlinearities, uncertainties, and unknown external disturbances. In this article, a terminal sliding mode control (TSMC) is proposed for the FJR system to guarantee the finite-time convergence of the systems output, and to achieve the total robustness against the lumped disturbance and estimation error. By using two coordinate transformations, the FJR dynamics is turned into a canonical form. A cascaded finite-time sliding mode observer (CFTSMO) is constructed to estimate states and lumped disturbance in a finite time based on two measurable states, which not only attenuates the measurement noise but also reduces the peaking phenomenon. The closed-loop stability and the finite-time convergence are rigorously proved by using Lyapunov theorem. The upper bound of the finite convergence time is derived for the reaching and sliding phase. Comparative study is conducted experimentally in real time on the FJR manipulator to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control method.},

Each robot initially has the position information of all the targets and of those robots that are within its limited communication range, and each target demands a robot with some specified capability to visit it. We propose a decentralized auction algorithm which first employs an information consensus procedure to merge the local information carried by each communication-connected (CC) robot subnetwork. Then, we apply a marginal-cost-based strategy to construct conflict-free target assignments for the CC robots. When the communication network of the robots is not connected, we demonstrate that the robots’ total travel distance might in fact increase when their communication range grows, and more importantly, such a somewhat counterintuitive fact holds for a range of algorithms. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm guarantees that the total travel distance of the robots is at most twice of the optimal when the communication network is initially connected. Finally, Monte Carlo simulation results demonstrate the satisfying performance of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {A cable-driven segmented manipulator (CDSM) has superior dexterity for operations in confined space due to its light-slender body and redundant degree of freedoms (DOFs). However, its inverse kinematics resolving and configuration planning are very challenging due to the complex structure and strict constraints. In this article, we propose a two-layer geometric iteration (TLGI) method for inverse kinematics resolving and configuration-constrained Cartesian path planning. The computation efficiency is largely improved and singularities are avoided. First, the end-effector attitude is decomposed into a direction vector and a rotation angle. The former and the end-effector position are combined into state variables of the inner layer, and the latter is treated separately as the state variable of the outer layer. Then, the TLGI method enables to rapidly reach the desired 6-DOF pose by two-layer iterations, i.e., the inner and outer loop iteration. Second, during the inner loop iteration, the CDSM is modeled as an equivalent articulated arm whose end-effector position and direction is the same as that of CDSM, but its links length and joint angles depend on the current configuration of CDSM. Then, the efficient forward and backward reaching inverse kinematics (FABRIKs) method is extended to apply on CDSM so that it can fast reach the inner state variables. During the outer loop iteration, three different rotation cases, i.e., the rotating around the end, root, and both end and root, are designed to switch automatically to reach the outer state variable iteratively. Moreover, by parameterizing geometric constraints of the environment, a TLGI-based configuration-pose simultaneous planning method is also put forward to efficiently achieve additional configuration constraints for operations of CDSM in confined space. Finally, the proposed method is verified by both the simulations and experiments.},

  abstract     = {In a space telerobot system (STS), effectiveness of the control method in eliminating the time delay’s influences is advisable to be verified under the real circumstance. However, it is difficult and costly for many scholars to obtain confidential information that would allow them to establish an STS. It may be feasible, using some existing results, to model the time delay as close to reality as possible, and to then program a simulation system to generate the simulated time delay, thus verifying validity. In this article, time-delay modeling and simulation problems for relay communication-based STS are first studied. The time delay in relay communication-based STS consists of both processing and communication time delays; the latter is divided into ground and ground-space parts. By extending the available results, processing and ground communication time delays are modeled with the probability distribution function modeling approach. An optimal communication link identification and minimum time-delay realization (OCLIMTDR) method is proposed to model the ground-space communication time delay. In this method, the novel point–vector–sphere (PVS) algorithm serves to judge link connectivity. The PVS algorithm is based on geometric theory, which gives the OCLIMTDR method good extensibility and renders it suitable for any relay communication network in theory. All three parts of the time-delay models are integrated to form the loop time-delay model of the STS. Subsequently, a time-delay simulation system is created by programming the loop time-delay model. Finally, the correctness of the simulation system is further authenticated based on simulations and some prior knowledge.},

  abstract     = {This article presents a novel stochastic event-triggered communication scheme (SETS) and a switching-like $H_{\infty }$ control method for networked control systems (NCSs) through an open bandwidth-limited network. To overcome the stochastic Denial of Service (DoS) attacks and save the limited network resource, a SETS is first proposed to decrease the number of packets transmitted while considering the malicious DoS attacks. Compared with the existing event-triggered schemes under a precondition that all triggered packets must be successfully transmitted, the proposed SETS has outstanding flexibility since it allows part event-triggered packets to be lost during the communication process. To fully use the dynamic features of communication in an open network, a switching-like control scheme is well designed, which can actively choose the different controller gains based on the current network Quality of Services (QoSs). Then, a networked closed-loop model is constructed, which considered both the effects of SETS and stochastic DoS attacks in a unified framework. Sufficient conditions for the existence of the switching-like controller are presented to ensure the stability of the networked control system while achieving the prescribed performance index. Gain matrices of the desired switching-like controller and the SETS parameters are reached in the light of the solutions to certain matrix inequalities. Compared with the existing time-invariant control strategy in a transmission interval, higher control performance can be expected since both the dynamic network information and the latest available state are well considered in the proposed communication and control framework. Finally, an illustrative example is given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

It is proved that all solutions of these nonlinear optimal control problems together assure asymptotic stability of the entire system. Then, in the framework of adaptive critics, the critic-only architecture is built to solve the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equations associated with these solutions. The critic-only architecture is implemented via critic neural networks (NNs) with their weight vectors being tuned through an improved gradient descent method. A remarkable feature of the present gradient descent approach is that it simultaneously utilizes previously stored and instantaneous state data, which makes the persistence of excitation conditions relaxed. After that, with Lyapunov’s techniques being employed, asymptotic stability of the closed-loop auxiliary subsystems and uniform ultimate boundedness of the critic NNs’ weight estimation errors are demonstrated.

  abstract     = {Superior dexterity and extreme flexibility are typical advantages for concentric cable-driven manipulators working in confined spaces. However, its inverse kinematics and configuration planning are very complicated. In this article, we propose a spatial biarc method for the above problem. The distinguishing feature of this method is that input parameters are two positions and two direction vectors in three-dimensional (3-D) space, and the output is a reasonable spatial biarc for controlling a concentric cable-driven manipulator in 3-D space. This method has the following three advantages. First, the positions and direction vectors of the base and inner distal tip are considered simultaneously. In addition, the length and ratio of the overlapped section and separated section can be adjusted by changing the length of the direction vectors. Furthermore, by judging the angular value of the direction vectors, one can predetermine whether the spatial configuration of the entire arm is C- or S-shaped. The proposed method realizes the parameterization of a concentric cable-driven manipulator, which makes it convenient to intuitively control the manipulator to achieve interference-free motion trajectory planning in confined spaces. Finally, trajectory tracking inspections are simulated and experimentally executed. It can be seen from results that the proposed spatial biarc method can provide reasonable solutions for concentric cable-driven manipulators. The method is especially favorable in terms of 3-D-pose-determination problem and trajectory-planning problem. It can also be applied to other manipulators with similar configurations. Without loss of generality, when the given points and direction vectors are coplanar, the proposed spatial biarc method can be transformed to a planar biarc method.},

  abstract     = {This work considers connected testbeds, i.e., engineering testbeds that are remotely accessible over a network, and focuses on the challenge of achieving a high-fidelity closed-loop integration despite the network delays. To address this challenge, a model-free framework is presented. In previous work, a model-free delay compensation framework with a single design parameter was developed. However, having only one design parameter could limit tuning flexibility and thus delay compensation performance. Furthermore, this framework has not yet been validated on an actual connected testbed. To address these two shortcomings, in this article, this delay compensation framework is first expanded into a two-parameter form, and its open-loop stability and performance are studied for constant delays. The predictor stability criterion is established in terms of the two design parameters and the constant network delay. To evaluate the transient delay compensation performance of this framework and understand its advantages and limitations, simulation case studies are conducted on a connected engine testbed representing a medium-duty diesel pickup truck. These studies include two testbed architectures, constant and variable delays, two drive cycles, two levels of driver aggressiveness, and a comparison against wave transformation as a state-of-the-art benchmark. Finally, the framework is tested experimentally on a physical realization of the same connected testbed. The results validate the robustness of the delay compensation performance of the framework under dynamic operations, and show up to 30\% higher integration fidelity due to the additional design degree of freedom introduced through the two-parameter form.},

  abstract     = {Localization and tracking of industrial vehicles have a key role in increasing productivity and improving the logistics processes of factories. Due to the demanding requirements of industrial vehicle tracking and navigation, existing systems explore technologies, such as LiDAR or ultra wide-band to achieve low positioning errors. In this article we propose TrackInFactory, a system that combines Wi-Fi with motion sensors, achieving submeter accuracy and a low maximum error. A tight coupling approach is explored in sensor fusion with a particle filter (PF). Information regarding the vehicle’s initial position and heading is not required. This approach uses the similarity of Wi-Fi samples to update the particles’ weights as they move according to motion sensor data. The PF dynamically adjusts its parameters based on a metric for estimating the confidence in position estimates, allowing to improve positioning performance. A series of simulations were performed to tune the PF. Then the approach was validated in real-world experiments with an industrial tow tractor, achieving a mean error of 0.81 m. In comparison to a loose coupling approach, this method reduced the maximum error by more than 60\% and improved the overall mean error by more than 20\%.},

  abstract     = {The proven efficacy of safety strategies based on 2-D laser rangefinder (LRF) strongly stimulates their application to mobile robots operating in the home environment. However, it remains a challenge for the robot to avoid collisions with all obstacles in the environment. Since LRF can only scan a horizontal slice of the world, some objects cannot be fully observed, such as tables and chairs. In this article, an effective solution based on laser-visual fusion is presented to enhance the safety of the robot. First, a vision sensor is adopted to help detect obstacles that are not fully visible to LRF. Then we propose a method to convert the depth information of the visual image into 2-D pseudo-laser data representation. With this representation, a strategy for 2-D mapping is developed. On this basis, a novel map fusion algorithm is proposed to generate an improved grid map that amends the incorrect representation of obstacles on the traditional 2-D grid map. We further investigate a robot autonomous navigation strategy that considers LRF data and pseudo-laser data to avoid all obstacles. Experimental results show that the improved grid map together with the presented navigation strategy allows the robot not only to plan a “real” collision-free path, but also to navigate safely in both static and dynamic scenarios, and the proposed strategies can significantly enhance the performance of robot navigation in terms of safety, reliability and robustness.},

A novel control protocol is proposed for fixed digraphs by using the same control strategy for two subsystems so that the controller can keep the control strategy unchanged when systems switch. Moreover, this control strategy uses only sampled position data at the current sampling time and the previous sampling time to deal with this possible situation when speed information is difficult to be measured, which is also robustness and low cost. Some necessary and sufficient conditions to achieve consensus are derived about the network topology, structure and sampling period. At last, a few simulation examples are given.},

The system output is assumed to be transmitted through a fading channel, where the fading phenomenon is described by a Rice fading model. The strategy of the attacker is to periodically interfere with the networked channels to reduce the success rate of data transmissions. First, a dynamic linearization method along the iteration domain is introduced to convert the nonlinear system into an equivalent data-related model. Then, a model-free adaptive iterative learning control (MFAILC) scheme is presented, which is independent of model information. The convergence of the MFAILC scheme is deduced theoretically and the influence of DoS attacks and stochastic fading phenomenon on system stability are also analyzed. Finally, the effectiveness of the design is verified by a numerical simulation and a trajectory tracking example of wheeled mobile robots (WMRs).},

To train a high-performance classifier and pursue high accuracy, we learn a credal classifier based on an optimized and adaptive multiestimation (OAME) method for missing data imputation on training and test sets. In OAME, some incomplete training patterns are estimated as multiple versions by a global optimization method thereby expanding the training set. On the other hand, the test pattern is adaptively estimated as one or multiple versions depending on the neighbors. For the test pattern with multiple versions, the corresponding outputs with different discounting factors (weights), represented by the basic belief assignments (BBAs), are fused for final credal classification based on evidence theory. The discounting factor contains two aspects: the importance and reliability factors that are used, respectively, to quantify the importance of the edited version itself and to represent the reliability of the classification result of the version. The effectiveness of OAME is widely validated on several real datasets and critically compared to other related methods.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates the controller design problem for an electromagnetic torsional micromirror with guaranteed transient performance constraint. Specifically, the developed solution works under the output regulation framework and utilizes the internal model principle for model parameter uncertainties and general reference trajectories tracking, incorporated with barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) method to prevent the tracking constraint violation. We first formulate the micromirror model as an output feedback system with relative degree two and unknown control coefficient, and further turn it into a lower triangular system with an extension transformation. Then, using the extended internal model design, we transform the output regulation problem of the transformed system into the stabilization problem of an augmented system. Finally, based on the BLF technique, we develop a stabilization controller for the augmented system to realize the asymptotic tracking of reference trajectory with transient performance constraint, where the effects of the main design parameters on the control performances are also investigated. By such a technical treatment, the entire control architecture is independent of the angular velocity information of the micromirror, which reduces the measurement complexity in practical. This feature behind the control scheme is important since the velocity information is difficult to be available in many microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). Moreover, the enhanced transient performance is beneficial for improving the scanning quality of the packaged micromirror system. The developed control solution is verified on an experimental platform using a field programmable gate array (FPGA)-based hardware, where the scanning and imaging applications are both conducted.},

In the proposed scheme, a machine learning model infers the brain model from the profile model and a feature selection method is applied to reduce the cost, i.e., the number of questionnaire items, of collecting profile information. Since only the top questionnaire items with the highest importance scores are used, we can maintain the inference performance as high as possible while limiting the number of questionnaire items. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme with a performance evaluation using an experimentally obtained brain model and a profile model created from real profile information. The results over different experimental parameters, video lengths, and feature selection methods demonstrate that the proposed scheme successfully identifies the top questionnaire items that contribute most significantly to the inference of brain models.},

After that, by developing an optimization problem, the after-reset value is designed by using system output measurements at each reset time. In this approach, a genetic algorithm is adopted to minimize the proposed cost function of certain transient performances to achieve the best reset time instants. Moreover, sufficient conditions for choosing the DOFC after-reset value are formulated in the form of LMIs. The proposed reset fuzzy DOFC is applied to two nonlinear systems.

Retractable needles are equipped into the capsule-like robot to inject the drug directly into intended tissues, which will contribute to the full and fast absorption of the medication and consequently increase the efficacy of drug delivery. The needle is concealed inside the capsule initially and can be actively protruded and retracted by a magnetic membrane. A second magnetic membrane is employed to discharge the drug out of the reservoir and inject it into the targeted tissue through the needle. Besides active drug releasing, the robotic capsule is able to perform active locomotion controlled by an external magnet wirelessly. Theoretical and experimental analyses were conducted to characterize the magnetic membranes for the selections of these batteries-less soft actuators for wireless in-body drug injection. Both locomotion and drug injection tests were successfully performed with the prototypes inside the samples of the porcine small intestine, which validated the feasibility of the proposed drug delivery system.},

  abstract     = {In this article, a general approach for directed graph clustering and two new density-based clustering objectives are presented. First, using an equivalence between the clustering objective functions and a trace maximization expression, the directed graph clustering objectives are converted into the corresponding weighted kernel $k$ -means problems. Then, a nonspectral algorithm, which covers both the direction and weight information of the directed graphs, is thus proposed. Next, with Rayleigh’s quotient, the upper and lower bounds of clustering objectives are obtained. After that, we introduce a new definition of weak links to characterize the effectiveness of clustering. Finally, illustrative examples are given to demonstrate effectiveness of the results. This article provides a glance at the potential connection between density-based and pattern-based clustering. Compared with other approaches for directed graph clustering, the method proposed in this article naturally avoids the loss of the nonsymmetric edge data because there is no need for any additional symmetrization.},

  abstract     = {Environmental context prediction is important for wearable robotic applications, such as terrain-adaptive control. System efficiency is critical for wearable robots, in which system resources (e.g., processors and memory) are highly constrained. This article aims to address the system efficiency of real-time environmental context prediction for lower limb prostheses. First, we develop an uncertainty-aware frame selection strategy that can dynamically select frames according to lower limb motion and uncertainty captured by Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) for environment prediction. We further propose a dynamic Bayesian gated recurrent unit (D-BGRU) network to address the inconsistent frame rate which is a side effect of the dynamic frame selection. Second, we investigate the effects on the tradeoff between computational complexity and environment prediction accuracy of adding additional sensing modalities (e.g., GPS and an on-glasses camera) into the system. Finally, we implement and optimize our framework for embedded hardware, and evaluate the real-time inference accuracy and efficiency of classifying six types of terrains. The experiments show that our proposed frame selection strategy can reduce more than 90\% of the computations without sacrificing environment prediction accuracy, and can be easily extended to the situation of multimodality fusion. We achieve around 93\% prediction accuracy with less than one frame to be processed per second. Our model has 6.4 million 16-bit float numbers and takes 44 ms to process each frame on a lightweight embedded platform (NVIDIA Jetson TX2).},

Two classes of control schemes and the corresponding event-triggered conditions are presented, respectively. First, a distributed state feedback ETC protocol is developed to reach the leader-following exponential consensus. The leader-following exponential consensus is achieved in the sense of the Mittag-Leffler stability of fractional-order systems. Second, when full-state measurements are not available, a novel observer-type output feedback ETC strategy with some desirable characteristics is provided. For two distributed ETC protocols, consensus conditions are derived and convergence rate of the system can be adjusted. Also, the integral inequality is applied to get the fact that Zeno behavior is excluded, which verifies the feasibility of ETC schemes.

Without any growth assumptions, the adaptive backstepping technique is combined with the parameter separation technique to solve the parametric nonlinearities while the related results need to apply restrictive assumptions or use an approximation-based scheme to deal with them. To alleviate the serious uncertainties caused by output constraint and input delay, the barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) and the Pade approximation method are employed in a unified framework when the control coefficient is known. Under the case of the unknown control coefficient, the Nussbaum gain technique is further combined to compensate it. Then, under both cases, universal adaptive state-feedback control strategies merged with rigorous stability analysis are proposed, respectively, which guarantees all the signals are uniformly ultimately bounded. In addition, the reference signal tracks the system output into a compact set of the origin and the constraint of output is not violated. Finally, the proposed controllers are applied to an inverted pendulum system, which demonstrates the designed controller is effective.},

To tackle the challenge of finding appropriate Lyapunov functions, we introduce Takagi and Sugeno (T–S) fuzzy models and present stability criteria for switched T–S fuzzy systems with MTVDs. Moreover, a novel switching signal is developed to eliminate the effect of the increment energy of Lyapunov functions for all unstable modes. The upshots of our result are that: 1) it allows the upper bound of the derivatives of Lyapunov functionals to be mode-dependent functions which can be positive or negative and 2) it also improves upon the existing results by removing several restrictive conditions.

Due to the impact of the sampling behaviors and the environmental disturbance, the asynchronization between the filter and the estimated system is considered in this article, which can be characterized by the hidden Markov model. Through handling the linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) with some slack matrices, event-triggered fuzzy filters are designed to guarantee the resulting system is stochastically stable and strictly dissipative.

In this model, the exact distribution of the uncertain parameters is unknown, and support set, mean, and covariance information is used to describe the uncertain processing time. The problem aims to determine the assignments, sequences, and time points of the charges to be processed on corresponding machines. The main goal is to minimize the expected value of the production objective while reducing the number of cast break occurrences. The problem is solved in two steps. First, a subproblem is developed by fixing the sequences and the assignments of the charges. This subproblem is formulated as a distributionally robust chance-constrained (DRCC) model, in which the constraints are established with certain probabilities even when the uncertain processing times are in their worst cases. A dual approximation method is proposed to convert the model into a semidefinite programming problem so that it can be solved by standard solvers. Additionally, a linear programming approximation method is used to accelerate the solving procedure. A Tabu search algorithm incorporated with a speed-up strategy is also designed to determine the assignments and sequences of the charges. Both simulated data generated from different distributions and actual production data are used to test the efficacy of our model. Results of the numerical experiments show that the schedule obtained from the DRCC model is more robust, i.e., it causes fewer cast breaks than the nominal schedule obtained from a deterministic model.},

Such robotic systems when deployed in harsh environments often get plagued by faults due to extreme conditions. Consequently, the real-time applications running on FPGA become susceptible to errors which call for a reliability-aware task scheduling approach, the focus of this article. We attempt to address this challenge using a hybrid offline–online approach. Given a set of periodic real-time tasks that require to be executed, the offline component generates a feasible preemptive schedule with specific preemption points. At runtime, these preemption events are utilized for fault detection. Upon detecting any faulty execution at such distinct points, the reliability-aware scheduling approach, RASA, orchestrates the recovery mechanism to remediate the scenario without jeopardizing the predefined schedule. Effectiveness of the proposed strategy has been verified through simulation-based experiments and we observed that the RASA is able to achieve 72\% of task acceptance rate even under 70\% of system workloads with high fault occurrence rates.},

To assess and compare the performance potentiality of the proposed four new RBFNN models, one classification problem, one direct modeling problem, and one inverse modeling problem are solved through computer simulation-based experiments. For comparison and to assign the performance rank of each of the four modified RBFNN models, two conventional and commonly used RBFNN models (models 1 and 2) are also simulated. To access the performance of different models during the training phase of Examples 1 and 2, the root mean-square error (RMSE) value, mean absolute deviation (MAD), and the number of iterations required to achieve convergence are obtained. For the third example, only the first two performance measures are found. During the testing or validation phase, the output responses of the different models of Example 2 are compared with the desired response analysis. For Example 3, the bit-error rate (BER) plots are compared. The observation of all the results demonstrates consistent ranks of all models in the case of all three examples. It is, in general, found that the ranks of the models 1–6 are 6, 4, 3, 2, 5, and 1, respectively.

As the dead zones and control gains are time varying and completely unknown, the control impact on mechanical system becomes completely unknown, making the achievement of fixed-time tracking control nontrivial. The existing studies on fixed-time tracking control cannot effectively estimate and compensate such dead zones, resulting in the upper bound of convergence time being uncertain and even system becoming unstable. To compensate the dead zones in a fixed time, we introduce a bound estimation method to estimate the impact of dead zones and design two fixed-time adaptive laws. Two cases on system uncertainties are considered. By introducing distributed control method, adaptive control method, neural networks and some skillful treatments, two novel distributed adaptive neural fixed-time tracking control schemes are proposed. It is confirmed that, with the proposed control schemes, all followers which are uncertain mechanical systems with completely unknown dead zones track the leader with sufficient precision in a predefined time.},

  abstract     = {This article proposes a novel modeling method for the stochastic nonlinear degradation process by using the relevance vector machine (RVM), which can describe the nonlinearity of degradation process more flexibly and accurately. Compared with the existing methods, where degradation processes are modeled as the Wiener process with a nonlinear drift function formulized as the power law or exponential law, this kind of modeling method can characterize degradation processes with more nonlinear behavior. Instead of modeling the drift coefficient of the Wiener process directly, the weighted combination of basis functions is utilized to express the increment of the Wiener process and the parameters are calculated by a sparse Bayesian learning algorithm. Based on the proposed model, a numerical approximation formula for the probability density function (PDF) of the remaining useful life (RUL) is derived. Finally, comparison studies, including a numerical simulation and a practical case, are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and the accuracy of the proposed methods for RUL estimation.},

Compared with the former one, the in-probability problem considers a more general situation, in which synchronization can be achieved with a positive probability, instead of strictly 100\%. It reflects the intrinsic randomness of biological systems. For both problems, some necessary and sufficient conditions are proposed, based on which two feasible algorithms are presented for checking two kinds of synchronization, respectively. CPBNs can be seemed as a combination of coupled Boolean networks (CBNs) with assigned probabilities. There are also detailed discussions on the impact of the synchronism of CBNs on the two addressed synchronization problems. The existence of invariant synchronization subsets is studied, which deepens our understanding on the difference and difficulty of these problems.

  abstract     = {For distributed estimation arising in the nonlinear least squares (NLLSs) problems over adaptive networks, where every node has the abilities of data processing and learning, only the incomplete local data are exploited by the traditional noncooperative method, thereby resulting in the degradation on estimation performance. In this article, a cooperative diffusion strategy is proposed by using a Gauss–Newton (GN) method in order to fully utilize the diversity of temporal–spatial data on local updates. The proposed algorithm includes two steps, i.e., aggregate then update (ATU), where the aggregating step collects in real time the global information instead of local information due to the diffusion strategy, and the updating step implements the local GN iteration. The resulting ATU diffusion algorithm is a distributed and cooperative system without any increase on communication cost, as compared with the noncooperative version. Based on the detailed convergence analysis for ATU, which is fundamental to the promotion of this algorithm, the sufficient conditions for convergence are derived and the evidences of faster convergence than the noncooperative version are provided. The simulation results confirm the obtained theoretical derivations by applying the ATU algorithm to an NLLS-based target localization problem and show the cooperation gains in many aspects, such as the convergence rate, steady-state accuracy, and robustness to noisy range, step size, node, and link failures.},

  abstract     = {Many real systems are represented in form of multiplex networks composed of a set of nodes, multiple layers of links, and coupling node relationships across all layers. These systems are very vulnerable to damages during both attacks and recoveries due to potential node cascading failures (NCFs). Although some progress has recently been made in studying network robustness and resilience, the comprehensive impacts of coupling node relationships and community structures on NCFs remain unclear. Accordingly, in this article, we study the robustness and resilience of multiplex networks in the presence of NCFs caused by coupling node relationships and community structures. We first model the failure processes of multiplex networks during both attacks and recoveries as node-community cascading failures (called NCCFs), and then theoretically demonstrate the fragility of multiplex networks to random node damages under NCCFs. Subsequently, to improve network robustness and resilience, we adopt a node protection strategy and propose a cost-aware constrained optimization problem. Finally, we devise a degree-based simulated annealing algorithm for solving this optimization problem. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real multiplex networks show that NCCFs make networks more vulnerable to unpredictable damage than classical NCFs. The results also show the superiority of the proposed algorithm over the state-of-the-art algorithms in improving network robustness and resilience.},

The parameters estimation of the LPV EIV systems with nonideal observations is realized using the expectation–maximization algorithm which is particular effective for the incomplete data issue. To ensure the robustness in the identification, the Student’s t-distribution which is characterized by its adjustable degree of freedom, is used to handle the measurement non-normality. Since the posterior distributions of the latent states in the IGM are also involved in the identification process and they are difficult to calculate directly, the particle filter is introduced to recursively approximate them instead.

  abstract     = {Often, when dealing with real-world recognition problems, we do not need, and often cannot have, knowledge of the entire set of possible classes that might appear during operational testing. In such cases, we need to think of robust classification methods able to deal with the “unknown” and properly reject samples belonging to classes never seen during training. Notwithstanding, existing classifiers to date were mostly developed for the closed-set scenario, i.e., the classification setup in which it is assumed that all test samples belong to one of the classes with which the classifier was trained. In the open-set scenario, however, a test sample can belong to none of the known classes and the classifier must properly reject it by classifying it as unknown. In this work, we extend upon the well-known support vector machines (SVMs) classifier and introduce the open-set SVMs (OSSVMs), which is suitable for recognition in open-set setups. OSSVM balances the empirical risk and the risk of the unknown and ensures that the region of the feature space in which a test sample would be classified as known (one of the known classes) is always bounded, ensuring a finite risk of the unknown. In this work, we also highlight the properties of the SVM classifier related to the open-set scenario, and provide necessary and sufficient conditions for an RBF SVM to have bounded open-space risk.},

For the time-varying desired trajectory, the developed triggering condition reduces communication costs by relaxing the restriction of the asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system, and we prove that the tracking error is uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB). The developed ETOTC method entails obtaining the next state of the real system. Therefore, a parallel control approach is proposed to predict the next state by constructing a parallel system for the real system. Neural networks (NNs) and adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) techniques are utilized in the parallel control approach. Moreover, the stability analysis of the closed-loop system is shown, and the tracking error and NN weight estimation errors are proved to be UUB using the Lyapunov approach.

In this situation, conducting paper recommendation to these academic groups is of terrific necessity in that it can further facilitate group activities. However, when producing group recommendation, existing methods fail to make full use of the abundant group information, from which a great deal of valuable information can be inferred to facilitate the recommendation performance. In addition, those methods tend to assign an equal weight to each group member when aggregating their recommendations, which is unreasonable in practice. Although some improvements have been made to remedy this problem by assigning different weights to group members, they fail to take into account the reliabilities of group members. Therefore, a group-oriented paper recommendation method based on probabilistic matrix factorization and evidential reasoning (GPMF_ER) is proposed in this article to tackle these problems. More specifically, the group and paper content information are integrated into the probabilistic matrix factorization model to enhance the accuracy of individual recommendation. Afterward, evidential reasoning rule is introduced in the aggregation step to consider both the weights and reliabilities of group members. Extensive experiments have been conducted on the real world CiteULike dataset and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

They also seem to be more robust in coping with noise-related issues and relevant noise handling operations. They do not make any statistical distributional assumptions regarding the nature of the data. In this article, we develop a hybrid approach based on ANNs and swarm intelligence to reveal the underlying pattern structure of customers of an insurance company in the Republic of Ireland. This model is tailored to the scope of segmenting administrative districts, or “small areas,” given policyholders’ spatial characteristics. To that end, the geospatial features of customers are taken into account. Geodemographically speaking, by implementing such a hybrid model, the relative similarity among spatial objects (small areas in this work) are preserved. In this way, the similarity of each small area to all other small areas is characterized. Consequently, the pattern of customers is analyzed using an optimal and intelligent solution.

  abstract     = {Real-world networks, such as phone-call networks and social networks, are often not static but temporal. Mining cohesive subgraphs from static graphs is a fundamental task in network analysis and has been widely investigated in the past decades. However, the concepts of cohesive subgraphs shift from static to temporal graphs raise many important problems. For instance, how to detect stable cohesive subgraphs on temporal networks such that the nodes in the subgraph are densely and stably connected over time. To address this problem, we resort to the conventional quasi-clique and propose a new model, called maximal $\rho $ -stable ( $\delta, \gamma $ )-quasi-clique, to capture both the cohesiveness and the stability of a subgraph. We show that the problem of enumerating all maximal $\rho $ -stable ( $\delta, \gamma $ )-quasi-cliques is NP-hard. To efficiently tackle our problem, we first devise a novel temporal graph reduction algorithm to significantly reduce the temporal graph without losing any maximal $\rho $ -stable ( $\delta, \gamma $ )-quasi-clique. Then, on the reduced temporal graph, we propose an effective branch and bound enumeration algorithm, named BB&amp;amp;SCM , with four carefully designed pruning techniques to accomplish the enumeration process. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on seven real-world temporal graphs, and the results demonstrate that the temporal graph reduction algorithm can safely reduce 98\% nodes of the temporal graph (with millions of nodes and edges) and BB&amp;amp;SCM is at least two orders of magnitude faster than the baseline algorithms. Moreover, we also evaluate the effectiveness of our model against other baseline models.},

  abstract     = {Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely applied for low-level vision over the past five years. According to the nature of different applications, designing appropriate CNN architectures is developed. However, customized architectures gather different features via treating all pixel points as equal to improve the performance of given application, which ignores the effects of local power pixel points and results in low training efficiency. In this article, we propose an asymmetric CNN (ACNet) comprising an asymmetric block (AB), a memory enhancement block (MEB), and a high-frequency feature enhancement block (HFFEB) for image superresolution (SR). The AB utilizes one-dimensional (1-D) asymmetric convolutions to intensify the square convolution kernels in horizontal and vertical directions for promoting the influences of local salient features for single image SR (SISR). The MEB fuses all hierarchical low-frequency features from AB via a residual learning technique to resolve the long-term dependency problem and transforms obtained low-frequency features into high-frequency features. The HFFEB exploits low- and high-frequency features to obtain more robust SR features and address the excessive feature enhancement problem. Additionally, it also takes charge of reconstructing a high-resolution image. Extensive experiments show that our ACNet can effectively address SISR, blind SISR, and blind SISR of blind noise problems. The code of the ACNet is shown at https://github.com/hellloxiaotian/ACNet .},

An off-policy PGACD algorithm is developed to minimize the iterative $Q$ -function and improve the tracking control performance. The proposed method is realized based on the critic network and the actor network (AN), which are applied to approximate the iterative $Q$ -function and the iterative control policy, respectively. Then, the policy gradient technique is introduced to derive a novel weight updating law of the AN explicitly by using measured system data only. The convergence of the iteration is established through theoretical analysis, and the uniform ultimate boundedness is demonstrated for the closed-loop system under the PGACD-based controller by using Lyapunov’s direct method. To guarantee the stability and increase the data usage efficiency of the learning process, an ER-based learning framework is designed to improve the realizability of the proposed method.

Third-order dynamics are considered for vehicles to take into account the rate of change of acceleration, i.e., the jerk, for which its control can provide comfort to the passengers. Designing consensus protocols for platoon of vehicles with third-order dynamics that can deal with both disturbance and network imperfection is not straightforward and requires new developments. Using the Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional, sufficient conditions are provided to assure that: 1) the consensus error dynamics are asymptotically mean-square consensus stable and 2) a given disturbance attenuation level is achieved in the presence of both network imperfections and disturbances. Simulation results validate the efficiency of the presented approach in dealing with disturbances and network imperfections.},

However, identifying a player’s motive profile from data available during gameplay remains an open research question. Besides a range of subjective and objective techniques for identifying player motivation, electroencephalography (EEG) technology could offer an automatic, objective technique for identifying the profile that best describes a given player. This article proposes a framework to measure player profiles of achievement, affiliation, and power motivation using EEG signals during their engagement within a game. First, an abstract mini-game is proposed to evaluate a player’s motivation. In the mini-game, each human player interacts with four nonplayer characters to gain fortune or friendship through an individual play phase and a social network phase. The game is used within an experimental scenario to collect players’ actions and EEG signals. In addition, data from a psychological test are used to establish ground truth. We propose three subject labeling schemes using the output of the psychological test. Based on a player’s motive profile, behavioral indicators and EEG data analysis indicate that assessing a player’s motive profile is more robust from EEG signals than from behavioral data.},

  abstract     = {As a typical underactuated mechanical system, offshore ship-mounted cranes are widely used to carry out the tasks of transferring cargos from one ship to another in the marine environment. Different from land-fixed cranes as well as traditional harbor cranes, offshore ship-to-ship crane systems work in two noninertial (ship) frames, while the target locations of the cargos are also inevitably influenced by the movements of the target ship. Besides, various external disturbances, which are caused by persistent sea waves, sea winds, or currents, etc., bring much more challenges to the control task of offshore ship-to-ship crane systems. To properly address these practical problems, in this article, we propose an increased adaptive neural network (NN)-based anti-swing tracking control strategy for such coordinated offshore crane systems, with a ship-motion prediction algorithm suggested to generate the target trajectories for cargos, and an adaptive NN proposed to deal with complicated unknown wave-induced disturbances. Bounded tracking performance is also guaranteed through a complete Lyapunov-based stability analysis. To the best of our knowledge, without any simplification of the original nonlinear dynamics, this article provides a high-performance adaptive control approach to deal with the anti-interference tracking control problem for offshore ship-to-ship crane systems, which are subjected to trajectories uncertainties as well as unknown wave motions disturbances. Furthermore, comparative hardware experimental results are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed control method.},

  abstract     = {This article focuses on developing an adaptive fast terminal sliding-mode controller (AFTSMC) with power rate proportional reaching law for the position and altitude tracking of a quadrotor in the presence of parametric uncertainties and bounded external disturbance. A nonlinear fast terminal sliding surface is proposed for the fast and finite-time convergence of the tracking error despite having the system states far away from the equilibrium point. Also, a power rate proportional reaching law has been proposed that ensures fast and finite-time convergence of the sliding manifold while attenuating the chattering phenomena in the sliding phase. To avoid the problem associated with over-estimation of the unknown disturbance bound, which eventually leads to chattering, an adaptive tuning law for gain adaptation is developed based on the Lyapunov’s stability theory that completely eradicates the necessity of knowing the upper bound of the disturbance a priori . The finite-time stability of a closed-loop system is investigated using the Lyapunov theory. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is compared with an adaptive sliding-mode controller (ASMC) using extensive simulation and validated on the DJI Matrice 100 quadrotor as a proof of concept on the hardware platform.},

To mitigate the communication load and improve the flexibility of the data scheduling, the FlexRay protocol (FRP) governed by both the time-triggered and event-triggered rules is exploited to regulate the signal transmission in a cyclic fashion. A new expression of the input signal to the state estimator is formulated with intention to account for the effect of the FRP. Accordingly, a multirate model (orchestrating the sampling/updating rates of the target plant, sensors, and state estimator) is proposed and then transformed into a single-rate one with the help of the lifting technique and the vector augmentation method. Subsequently, sufficient conditions are provided for the true states to always reside in an ellipsoid at each time instant in the presence of the non-Gaussian noises, and such an ellipsoid is then minimized in the matrix-trace sense. An online optimization algorithm is developed to parameterize the estimator gains by means of the solution to certain recursive matrix inequalities. Numerical results demonstrate the validity of the proposed protocol-based set-membership state estimator design scheme.},

The upper layer uses a virtual system to generate a global optimal consensus trajectory which is shared by the agents via a communication network. The lower layer includes an SIFC controller to guarantee asymptotic tracking of the given trajectory. Also in this layer, a model reference adaptive controller is introduced to enhance the dynamic tracking performance of the SIFC controller. This framework enables distributed optimization with time-triggered communication and mild requirements on the team objective.

Many existing subspace learning approaches assume that the gas sensor data follow a certain distribution such as Gaussian, which often does not exist in real-world applications. In this article, we address this issue by proposing a novel discriminative subspace learning method for DA with neighborhood preserving (DANP). We introduce two novel terms, including the intraclass graph term and the interclass graph term, to embed the graphs into DA. Besides, most existing methods ignore the influence of the subspace learning on the classifier design. To tackle this issue, we present a novel classifier design method (DANP+) that incorporates the DA ability of the subspace into the learning of the classifier. The weighting function is introduced to assign different weights to different dimensions of the subspace. We have verified the effectiveness of the proposed methods by conducting experiments on two public gas sensor datasets in comparison with the state-of-the-art DA methods.},

  abstract     = {This article studies the command-filter-based fixed-time bipartite containment control problem for a class of nonlinear stochastic multiagent systems (MASs). The considered stochastic MASs in nonstrict feedback form is subject to unknown nonlinear functions and stochastic disturbances, which can be solved by exploiting the universal approximation property of radial basis function neural networks. In addition, the event-triggered mechanism is used to improve the utilization of communication resources while avoiding Zeno behavior. The control protocol based on the command-filtered backstepping technique is proposed to ensure that the followers can converge to the convex hull formed by the leaders. Moreover, the closed-loop stability of stochastic MASs is proved to be semiglobal practical fixed-time stability. Finally, a numerical example simulation and an actual system simulation about a group of five single-link manipulator systems are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

A fractional-order term is added to a sliding-mode controller to have more adjustable space and better optimization space.

  abstract     = {In most existing linguistic distribution multiple criteria group decision-making (MCGDM) models, the sample size of group linguistic distribution assessment (LDA) is often neglected, and the decision makers are viewed to be independent. The probabilistic distribution is closely related to the sample size, and there exist more or fewer interference effects among different individual opinions. Thus, this article develops a quantum framework for modeling interference effects in the linguistic distribution MCGDM process. First, considering the sample size information, we redefine the LDAs and provide a new computational model for them. Second, to integrate a series of LDAs, the linguistic distribution weighted averaging (LDWA) operator is presented. Mathematic proofs reveal that the new LDWA operator can not only ensure the information integrality but also can avoid the conjunctive and disjunctive operations. Third, to explore the interference effects among individual opinions, a quantum framework is constructed. In this process, individual opinions are viewed as various wave functions occurring synchronously. They interfere with each and influence the aggregation result. Finally, an illustrative example of Internet finance soft power evaluation is provided to verify the effectiveness. Sensitivity and comparative analyses are also implemented to assess the stability and validity of our method.},

  abstract     = {Convergence, diversity and feasibility are three important issues when solving constrained multiobjective optimization problems (CMOPs). To deal with the balance among convergence, diversity and feasibility well, this article proposes a cooperative multiobjective evolutionary algorithm with propulsive population (CMOEA-PP) for solving CMOPs. CMOEA-PP has two populations, including propulsive population and normal population, and these two populations work cooperatively. Specifically, propulsive population focuses on convergence. Normal population gives priority to feasibility and is obligated to maintain diversity. To cross through the infeasible region and reach the Pareto front (PF), propulsive population does not consider constraints in the early stage and only considers constraints in the later stage. To further accelerate the speed of convergence, propulsive population only searches for corner solutions and center solutions, while normal population searches for the whole PF. As a result, propulsive population can cross through the infeasible region because of the lack of attention to feasibility. In addition, propulsive population also can guide and accelerate the convergence of the evolutionary process. Comprehensive experiment results on several sets of benchmark problems demonstrate that CMOEA-PP is better than existing state-of-the-art competitors.},

The zone control methods are usually used to achieve this control objective, but the problem of these methods is that they cannot find a unified zone range, and it is easy to appear singularity in the motion process. In this article, for two-link VPUMs, we propose a control strategy based on trajectory planning and optimization, which does not need to divide the zone range, avoids the singularity problem, and can achieve the control objective quickly and smoothly. We design the trajectory by using the time scale method for the active link according to the initial and target states. Then, we obtain the trajectory parameters by employing differential evolution algorithm to ensure that the passive link can also move from the initial states to the target states simultaneously. We design a sliding mode tracking controller to make the active link move along the designed trajectory, so the EP is moved to VUEP. Meantime, we design a sliding mode stabilization controller to ensure that the system is stable at VUEP. Finally, the universality and robustness of the proposed method are proved by simulations.},

  abstract     = {Typically, it is desirable to design a control system that is not only robustly stable in the presence of parametric uncertainties but also guarantees an adequate level of system performance. However, most of the existing methods need to take all extreme models over an uncertain domain into consideration, which then results in costly computation. Also, since these approaches attempt rather unrealistically to guarantee the system performance over a full frequency range, a conservative design is always admitted. Here, taking a specific viewpoint of robust stability and performance under a stated restricted frequency range (which is applicable in rather many real-world situations), this article provides an essential basis for the design of a fixed-order controller for a system with bounded parametric uncertainties, which avoids the tedious but necessary evaluations of the specifications on all the extreme models in an explicit manner. A Hurwitz polynomial is used in the design and the robust stability is characterized by the notion of positive realness, such that the required robust stability condition is then successfully constructed. Also, the robust performance criteria in terms of sensitivity shaping under different frequency ranges are constructed based on an approach of bounded realness analysis. Furthermore, the conditions for robust stability and performance are expressed in the framework of linear matrix inequality (LMI) constraints, and thus can be efficiently solved. Comparative simulations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach.},

A continuous control scheme is proposed that combines the state of the system and the decoding results to dynamically produce the expected angular velocity of the joint based on the results of the classification. Finally, experiments are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm using an upper-limb neuroprosthesis, achieving the reach and grasp tasks.

In this article, we propose a parallel semisupervised framework to categorize specific game players with a few label-known target samples, which are denoted as bait players. Our approach first presents a feature representation model based on the players’ level granularity, which can acquire aligned feature representations in the lower dimensional space from the players’ original action sequences. Then, we propose a semisupervised clustering method, extended from the bisecting $k$ -means model, to extract the specified players with the help of those bait players. Due to massive amounts of game log data, the computation complexity is an extreme challenge to implement our feature representation and semisupervised extraction approaches. We also propose a hierarchical parallelism framework, which allows the data to be computed horizontally and vertically simultaneously and enables varied parallel combinations for the steps of our semisupervised categorization approach. The comparable experiments on real-world MMORPGs’ log data, containing more than 465 Gbytes and million players, are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed approach compared with the state-of-the-art methods.},

Nonpure net structures are powerful for control of Petri-net-modeled discrete-event systems. However, in the existing work, the formulated ILPPs contain a large number of constraints, which is computationally inefficient. In this article, we propose approaches that formulate ILPPs with fewer constraints such that the computational efficiency is significantly improved. To do so, in formulating ILPPs for optimal Petri-net controllers by using self-loops and data inhibitor arcs, we remove the reachability conditions for legal markings. By doing so, an obtained solution may result in some legal markings unreachable. To solve this problem, a novel technique is developed to design an optimal controller by modifying the initial marking and structure of the obtained supervisor. It is shown that, by the reduced ILPPs, one can find the same feasible solutions as that obtained by the existing work. Finally, the proposed approaches are demonstrated by examples.},

  abstract     = {As the number of people involved in a decision-making problem increases, the complexity of the group decision-making (GDM) process increases accordingly. The size of participants and the heterogeneous information have important effects on the consensus reaching process in GDM. To deal with these two issues, traditional methods divide large groups into smaller ones to reduce the scale of GDM and translate heterogeneous information into a uniform format to handle the heterogeneity problem. These methods face two challenges: 1) how to determine the appropriate group size? and 2) how to avoid or reduce loss of information during the transformation process? To address these two challenges, this article uses fuzzy cluster analysis to integrate heterogeneous information for large-scale GDM problems. First, a large group is divided into smaller ones using fuzzy cluster analysis and the F-statistic is applied to determine the satisfactory number of clusters. The original information is retained based on the similarity degree. Then, a consensus reaching process is conducted within these small groups to form a unified opinion. A feedback mechanism is developed to adjust the small GDM matrix when any group cannot reach a consensus, and the heterogeneous technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) is used to select the best alternative. To validate the proposed approach, an experiment study is conducted using a practical example of selecting the best rescue plan in an emergency situation. The result shows that the proposed approach helps to choose the best rescue plan faster.},

In this article, we propose and study the new optimization problem of placing check-in nodes with the minimum cost, i.e., the problem of finding the minimum-cost check-in nodes (MCCN), which is of great interests for real-world application situations, but even more difficult. We motivate the new algorithms through three typical worse cases by the often-used greedy-type algorithms, i.e., One-to-Many, Many-to-One, and Duplicate-Overrides. With this respect, the proposed novel optimization algorithms utilize a novel metric of contribution density for selecting check-in nodes iteratively, which successfully avoid the occurrence of the two worse cases of One-to-Many and Many-to-One. We also introduce an extra backward extraction step in one of new algorithms, which overcomes the crucial worse case of “duplicate overrides” and largely improves the algorithmic performance in solving the introduced optimization problem of MCCN. Meanwhile, we extend the new contribution density metric to a more general class of functions and study their effectiveness to eliminate the two worse cases of One-to-Many and Many-to-One; also, a detailed analysis on complexity and performance of the proposed algorithms is presented to show their numerical efficiency and accuracy. Extensive experiments over two classical artificial networks, i.e., BA network and ER network, and ten real-world networks, under two typical cost setups, show the proposed algorithms significantly outperform the four state-of-the-art algorithms. We also demonstrate that our proposed algorithms are much reliable and robust with different experiment settings of deployment cost and network-type and scale.},

  abstract     = {Dominance robustness (DR) has been proposed for assessing the ability of the Pareto-optimal solutions to remain to be nondominated when the decision variables are subject to noise. There are two main challenges in search for dominance robust optimal solutions in dominance robust multiobjective optimization (MOP), namely, accurate estimation of the DR measure and a good balance between convergence and DR in the presence of uncertainty. In this article, a novel robust MOP evolutionary algorithm based on decision variable assortment (DVA) is proposed to tackle these challenges. To be specific, an indicator, termed as dominance robust indicator, is proposed to measure the DR based on the dominance level and dominance relationship of the sampled points. Then, the decision variables are divided into low DR-related variables and high DR-related variables based on the DVA strategy. Finally, low and high DR related variables are optimized separately to obtain the dominance robust optimal solutions. In addition, performance indicators to quantify the performance of dominance robust optimal solution set obtained by robust MOP algorithm are proposed. Experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed algorithm is competitive in search for dominance robust optimal solutions.},

First, without consideration of saturation, a distributed fault-tolerant control scheme is put forward by the adaptive technique, and a practical finite-time stability result is established. Second, by employing the fault-tolerant theory and introducing a novel form of parametric algebraic Riccati equation, a modified low-and-high gain feedback approach is developed for the saturated control strategy. It is proven that the practical finite-time stability can be achieved, and both the steady-state consensus error and the settling time can be well estimated.

By using CL, the parameter convergence is guaranteed by exploiting the current and historical data simultaneously. This technique enjoys practicability compared with common methods that need to incorporate external noises to satisfy the persistence of excitation condition for the parameter convergence. Based on the estimated model, we design a barrier Lyapunov function (BLF)-based adaptive control law by the backstepping technique and Lyapunov analysis.

Enhanced by the integration part, the ADTIZD models can resist large additive noises, where even constant noises cannot decrease their precision. All convergence and robustness performance conclusions about our ADTIZD models are supported by rigorous theoretical proofs and numerical experiments.

Firstly, a class of general nonsingular terminal sliding mode control strategy is proposed to achieve global predefined-time stability by switching a control parameter in a form of function. Then, a high-precision trajectory planning method is proposed for a FFSR using the proposed predefined-time stability theorem, which can make the end-effector and the base reach the desired pose within a prespecified time, and reduce the adverse effect on planning accuracy resulted from the singularity avoidance algorithm and the obstacle avoidance one. Subsequently, a trajectory tracking control strategy is proposed for a FFSR employing the proposed general nonsingular predefined-time terminal sliding mode, and the tracking errors can converge within a predefined time to an arbitrarily small neighborhood of zero in the presence of persistent disturbances. The proposed trajectory planning method has the advantage of pose feedback, so can be combined with the trajectory tracking controller in the control process to further enhance the control performance for the FFSR. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed methodologies.},

This article intends to build population games and dynamics with both static and dynamical graphical communication structures. To this end, we formulate a population game model with graphical strategy interactions and derive its corresponding population dynamics. In particular, we first introduce the concept of generalized Nash equilibria for population games with graphical strategy interactions, and establish the equivalence between the set of generalized Nash equilibria and the set of rest points of its distributed population dynamics. Furthermore, the conditions for convergence to generalized Nash equilibrium and particularly to Nash equilibrium are obtained for the distributed population dynamics with both static and dynamical graphical structures. These results provide a new approach to design distributed Nash equilibrium seeking algorithms for population games with both static and dynamical communication networks, and hence, expand the applicability of the population game dynamics in the design of learning and control protocols under distributed circumstances.},

It is further proved that these estimates are the most accurate compared with the existing results. Besides, to suppress the chattering caused by the sign function, some saturation functions are constructed to replace the sign function and the FXTS of the new system obtained by replacing is ensured by rigorous theoretical analysis. As applications, the problem of stabilization for chaotic systems in fixed or preassigned time is explored. Especially, an innovative saturation controller is developed to realize preassigned-time stabilization, where the convergence time is prescribed in advance according to actual requirement and the control gains are finite, the existing control methods with time-varying infinite gains are essentially improved.

However, a significant drawback of learning based on the MP inverse is that the computational memory consumption grows along with the size of a dataset. In this article, based on the partitioning of the MP inverse, we propose a blockwise recursive MP inverse formulation (BRMP) for network learning with low-memory property while preserving its training effectiveness. The BRMP is an equivalent formulation to its batchwise counterpart since neither approximation nor assumption is made in the derivation process. Our further exploration of this recursive method leads to a switching structure among three different scenarios. This structure also reveals that the well-known recursive least squares method is a special case of our proposed technique. Subsequently, we apply BRMP to the training of radial basis function networks as well as multilayer perceptrons. The experimental validation covers both regression and classification tasks.},

To obviate such obstruction, a new control design framework for adaptively compensating the input and output hysteresis is proposed with two adaptive hysteresis inverse operators, which are also utilized to develop a novel adaptive hysteresis operator-based filter.

However, in light of the significant research and development investment required to upgrade products, a new industry trend has emerged in which incumbents collaborate with market entrants to innovate products. At the same time, such collaboration may lead customers to think that the upgraded products are more similar than those innovated without collaboration. Consequently, we consider the following tradeoff: collaboration allows firms to share the innovation investment, but leads to less differentiated products. Specifically, we consider a two-period model where the incumbent is a monopoly during the first period. This incumbent and a market entrant decide whether or not to collaborate to innovate their products, and the two firms sell their products during the second period. We find that both firms can benefit from a higher innovation cost.

  abstract     = {The fully distributed consensus tracking of stochastic nonlinear multiagent systems (MASs) is investigated with Markovian switching topologies and intermittent control strategy, where the dynamics of agents are depicted by Itô differential equations and the leader’s information is just known for a fraction of followers. The switching mechanism of interaction topologies is modeled as a Markov process. A novel class of fully distributed control protocols is proposed via intermittent control method, which is only associated with the relative state measurements of neighbors and does not involve any global information. Meanwhile, the control gains are designed to be intermittently adaptive, which can effectively reduce energy consumption and avoid the gains being larger than those needed in practice. Several sufficient conditions and corresponding proofs are provided by using the Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, numerical simulation is presented to state the feasibility of the theoretical results.},

First, a new kind of distributed average estimator is developed for each agent to estimate the average of the multiple time-varying signals in finite time. The protocol possesses the distinguished feature of robustness to initialization errors, which can recover from network alterations. Then, an observer-based finite-time tracking protocol is proposed to make each agent exactly track the average of the multiple time-varying signals in finite time in the absence of velocity measurement. By carefully analyzing the dynamic properties of the tracking error system, a suitable Lyapunov function is constructed to estimate the settling time for convergence of the tracking error system theoretically. Furthermore, an adaptive DAT protocol is proposed, which is a fully distributed protocol because it can solve the DAT problem without using any global information.

The fixed-time consensus implies that the consensus is reached in a finite time and the convergence time is independent of initial conditions under the nonlinear consensus protocols. A self-triggered control (STC) strategy is developed based on the event-triggered control (ETC) strategy. For the ETC strategy, the nonlinear controllers and the measurement errors are designed based on the hyperbolic tangent function to avoid a nondifferential problem and Zeno behavior. To avoid continuous monitoring, the STC strategy is presented. Furthermore, the minimal interevent interval is strictly positive, which implies that no Zeno behavior occurs in the STC strategy.

  abstract     = {In an automated manufacturing system (AMS), resources are, in general, subject to unpredictable failures, which invalidate many existing deadlock control strategies. In this article, we propose an adaptive deadlock control policy for an AMS with multiple types of unreliable resources. The considered AMS is modeled with a system of simple sequential processes with resources. First, based on an elementary siphon control method, monitors are added for elementary siphons and some particular dependent siphons to ensure the liveness of a system if there are no resource failures. By considering the fact that an unreliable resource may fail in a system, recovery subnets are added to describe the resource failures and recoveries. Since a monitor added for a siphon may not be able to guarantee that the corresponding siphon is always marked if the failure of a resource in the siphon occurs, the concept of switch controllers is presented so as to make the siphon always remarked if it is emptied by resource failures. It is verified that the adaptive controller proposed in this article can guarantee the liveness of the controlled system no matter whether unreliable resources break down or not. More importantly, if there is no resource failure, the system can maintain predefined production without degrading planned system performance. Finally, examples are presented to illustrate the validity of the proposed method.},

The measurement received by the sensor is transmitted to the remote filter through the time-correlated fading channel where the channel coefficient evolves according to a certain dynamics and hence exhibits a time-correlated nature. The parameter uncertainties of the system are described by norm-bounded unknown matrices. By introducing a class of auxiliary variables, an augmented system is constructed to reflect the dynamics of the fading coefficient and state simultaneously. Then, a recursive filter is designed which is capable of online computation. Furthermore, an upper bound is guaranteed for the filtering error covariance (FEC) for the possible parameter uncertainties as well as the time-correlated fading channels. With the help of the completing-the-squares technique, filter gains are parameterized by minimizing the obtained upper bound.

  abstract     = {Abundant data with limited labeling are a widespread bottleneck in multilabel learning. Active learning (AL) is an effective solution to gradually enhance model robustness, however how to effectively extend instance selection criteria to multilabel case remains challenging. Considering the label specificity and label correlation, a granular batch mode-based ranking active model for the multilabel (GBRAML) is proposed. Taking a bottom-up view, three granulation operators are successively constructed to formulate three granular structures. In low-level granulation operator, auxiliary label is introduced to enhance the informativeness and representativeness of each label. The contribution of labels to the usefulness of instances is incorporated with pair-wise label correlation, and is considered in the middle-level granulation operator. The labeling priority is determined by ranking the scorings coming from high-level granulation operator. To alleviate the impact of skewed label correlation, we take a three-way strategy on fitness of representative label correlation, thus a three-way GBRAML model (TGBRAML) is devised. Extensive experiments on six multilabel benchmark demonstrate GBRAML gains 5.4\% and 210.1\% improvement on MicroF1 and Average Precision over state-of-the-art batch mode multilabel active learning. The effectiveness of three-way decisions in multilabel AL is also verified.},

Another one is that a new constrained objective function is proposed to improve the distinguishability of the generated interval type-2 fuzzy sets (FSs) without restricting them to be evenly distributed. Because of the tradeoff between system performance and interpretability, a new multiobjective ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm is proposed to optimize the IT2FLS parameters and improve optimization performance. The evolutionary IT2FLS learning approach is applied to control a real wall-following hexapod robot. The approach shows the advantages of model-free design and interpretability and robustness to noise in the evolved type-2 fuzzy rules. Simulations with performance comparisons and experiments in controlling a real robot show the advantages of the learning approach.},

Our approach advantages are twofold: 1) it is not a pixel-based approach, as it learns spatial features through training examples and 2) it does not require the simulation model and 4-D seismic maps to be in the same domain, enabling a direct comparison of maps in the seismic domain with maps in the numerical simulation domain. Additionally, we present a new methodology to quantitatively assess the performance of each method relative to the expected results. For this purpose, we build an annotated dataset containing the maps that best match the 4-D seismic in different realistic scenarios while taking into account the specialists’ knowledge. We apply our methodology to evaluate if a method is able to perform according to what specialists expect, considering the annotated data. We also propose an improvement to traditional methods using a statistical method to convert maps of different physical properties into a common property, which can be used as an alternative to avoid forward and/or inversion procedures commonly used to bring 4-D seismic and simulation data to the same domain. Finally, we present an extensive comparison, qualitative and quantitative, of our approaches with other methods in the literature, such as the traditional pixelwise strategy for maps in the same domain, and methods based on binarization of maps in different domains. The results show that our proposed methods are capable of more accurately identifying the best-matched models, according to the specialists’ answers.},

  abstract     = {Pairwise comparison matrix (PCM) is an important tool to rank items by deriving priorities and has been used in various applications. Though large-scale sparse PCMs appear frequently in today’s big data environment, it is hard for existing prioritization methods to handle large-scale sparse PCMs efficiently due to the curse of dimensionality. The goal of this article is to propose a new algorithm, bipartite graph iterative method (BGIM), to derive priorities from large-scale sparse PCMs. We first extended graph representations of PCMs to bipartite graphs. A transition matrix was induced by resource allocation on the bipartite graph. Finally, an iterative algorithm was designed to calculate priorities. The theoretical properties of the BGIM were analyzed to show its ability to derive priorities from large-scale sparse PCMs. Two experiments were conducted to validate the proposed approach. The numerical examples indicated that the BGIM can deal with traditional decision problems and derive reliable priorities with minimum Euclidean distance (ED) and minimum violation (MV) among the tested methods. The simulation examples suggested that the BGIM can not only derive reliable priorities from large-scale sparse PCMs but also require the least computation time compared with eight prioritization approaches. To demonstrate its applicability to real-world large-scale problems, we applied the BGIM to rank movies using MovieLens dataset with more than 100 000 ratings for 9125 movies. The results showed that the BGIM was the fastest approach and obtained the best ranking among the average ratings and the five prioritization methods.},

  abstract     = {This article proposes a new discrete-time predictive sliding mode control (DPSMC) for a parallel micropositioning piezostage to improve the motion accuracy in the presence of cross-coupling hysteresis nonlinearities and input constraints. Unlike the traditional linear discrete-time sliding mode control (DSMC), the proposed DPSMC is chattering free and has a faster convergence rate thanks to the design of a nonlinear discrete-time fast integral terminal sliding mode surface. Moreover, by combining with the receding horizon optimization, the sliding mode state is predicted to follow the expected trajectory of a predefined continuous sliding mode reaching law, which also allows the proposed controller to explicitly deal with constraints. The stability of the closed-loop system is analyzed under the model disturbances and constraints, and proves that the proposed DPSMC can offer a smaller quasi-sliding mode bandwidth than the traditional DSMC. The effectiveness of the proposed controller is validated by a series of numerical simulations and experiments. Results demonstrate the advantages of proposed DPSMC over the traditional DSMC method.},

The issue of global exponential stability for impulsive delayed neural networks on time scales is analyzed by employing the convex combination method in this article. Several algebraic and linear matrix inequality conditions are proved by constructing impulse-dependent Lyapunov functionals and using timescale inequality techniques. Unlike the published works, impulsive control strategies can be designed by utilizing our theoretical results to stabilize delayed neural networks on time scales if they are unstable before introducing impulses. Sufficient criteria for global exponential stability in this article are derived based on the timescale theory, and they are applicable to discrete-time impulsive neural networks, their continuous-time analogues, and neural networks whose states are discrete at one time and continuous at another time. Four numerical examples are offered to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our new theoretical results in the end.},

A more universal switching law, persistent dwell-time (DT) switching law, is considered here rather than average DT one of which switching frequency among subsystems is strictly limited, or DT one. Concurrently, time delays are inevitable when transmitting information, then taking the time-varying delays into account makes the constructed systems conform well with the actual situations. The main goal in the work is devoted to designing a state estimator to ensure that the state estimation error system is globally uniformly exponentially stable and satisfies a prescribed $\mathcal {H}_{\infty }$ noise attenuation level. A mixed time/mode-dependent Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional matched with the foregoing switching law is introduced. Through utilizing some reasonable inequalities and common matrix operations, some sufficient criteria which guarantee the aforesaid stability and the solvability of the addressed issue are presented.

First, the pitch and roll motion of ship are predicted by an autoregressive (AR) model to determine an appropriate period for landing. Subsequently, a novel robust sliding mode controller without linear velocity measurements is developed on the basis of the perspective image feature in a virtual image plane. Meanwhile, a modified Chebyshev neural network (CNN) is proposed to estimate the uncertainties, including the linear acceleration of ship and translational perturbation, while an adaptive law is employed to compensate the influence of rotational disturbances. The whole controller only requires the measurements feedback of a vision sensor and an inertial measurement unit (IMU). Ulteriorly, to prevent the visual target on the ship from going beyond the field of view of camera, the constrained controller is developed by a control barrier function and a quadratic programming, where the unknown relative velocity is estimated by a velocity observer. Finally, simulations are implemented to substantiate the capability of the presented shipboard landing control method.},

For the cooperative path following, a containment control approach is incorporated into the design, where each AUV is forced to evenly disperse on a path that is parameterized by a continuous variable over a communication network. The main features of the paper that unlike the existing designs are that: first, by employing the command filtered control technique, the assumption of second-order derivative of the reference path is removed. Second, a globally uniformly ultimately bounded (GUUB) path following control structure is proposed that enables two kinds of controllers to switch under different cases. Third, coordination between multiple AUVs is achieved through a containment design, and a path variable containment cooperative path following controller is derived that enables multiple AUVs to be evenly dispersed and guided by the virtual leaders.

Hence, how to adjust the tradeoff between objective functions and constraints is crucial. In this article, we propose a dynamic selection preference-assisted constrained multiobjective differential evolutionary (DE) algorithm. In our approach, the selection preference of each individual is suitably switching from the objective functions to constraints as the evolutionary process. To be specific, the information of objective function, without considering any constraints, is extracted based on Pareto dominance to maintain the convergence and diversity by exploring the feasible and infeasible regions; while the information of constraint is used based on constrained dominance principle to promote the feasibility. Then, the tradeoff in these two kinds of information is adjusted dynamically, by emphasizing the utilization of objective functions at the early stage and focusing on constraints at the latter stage. Furthermore, to generate the promising offspring, two DE operators with distinct characteristics are selected as components of the search algorithm. Experiments on four test suites including 56 benchmark problems indicate that the proposed method exhibits superior or at least competitive performance, in comparison with other well-established methods.},

The main feature of this article is that we have used the phase angle of the transfer function, $G(s)$ , in model order reduction for the first time in the proposed method, which results in more accurate reduced-order models. It is worth noting that this hypothesis has been never made before in any other model order reduction techniques. Furthermore, new gramians are calculated corresponding to their associated new Riccati equations and Lur’e equations, which are in turn achieved by using Kalman–Yakubovic–Popov (KYP) lemma and linear matrix inequalities (LMI). Thereafter, a novel passivity preserving model order reduction algorithm, which takes the phase angle of the transfer function, $G(s)$ , into account, is presented. It is demonstrated that the proposed method is a generalization of the positive real balanced truncation (PRBT) method, and it is perfectly capable of providing more accurate approximation error compared to PRBT. Finally, numerical examples are included to figure out the effectiveness of the presented method.},

  abstract     = {Credit purchasing has seen dramatic growth recently, requiring retailers to adapt their operations in response to an online platform’s strategic credit offering. This article presents a model for exploring the platform’s strategy for offering credit and the retailer’s response, considering consumer spillover, that is, how much the benefit of credit outweighs the drawbacks. The consumers differ in their disposable personal incomes and valuations for the product, and they may perceive a spillover from the credit. We study an integrated system, where the platform acts as a retailer and determines the credit-offering strategy and the price simultaneously. We find that the platform will offer credit only when the spillover is above a given negative threshold, and will charge an interest rate for credit only when the spillover is positive. In addition, the price exhibits a nonmonotonic change with the credit spillover, but the demand remains unchanged at a high level. We then extend the analysis to an independent system, where the retailer sells through the platform. We find that the revenue-sharing percentage the retailer pays is critical for the platform to optimize its credit strategy. Specifically, the platform will never offer interest-free credit when the percentage is low, but in other cases may do so and the credit offering does not harm the retailer’s profit. Interestingly, when the spillover is moderate, the demand may decrease instead of increase, indicating a deviation from the presumed intention of offering credit.},

Fully complex extreme learning machine (CELM) is a much faster training algorithm than the complex backpropagation (CBP) scheme. However, it is at the cost of using more hidden nodes to obtain the comparable performance. An upper-layer-solution-aware algorithm has been proposed for training single-hidden layer feedforward neural networks, which performs much better than its counterparts, pseudo-inverse learning (PIL)/extreme learning machine and gradient decent-based backpropagation neural networks. Consequently, there exist two challenges that need to be dealt with: 1) How to combine the advantages of CBP and CELM to develop a novel complex learning algorithm? and 2) What is the convergent behavior of the presented algorithm? In this article, an input weights dependent complex-valued (IWDCV) learning algorithm based on Wirtinger calculus has been proposed, which effectively solves the nonanalytic problem of the common activation functions during training neural networks. In addition, the monotonicity of the error function and the deterministic convergence of the proposed model have been strictly proved, which theoretically guarantee the efficiency and effectiveness of the given model, IWDCV. Finally, for real and complex-valued problems, a variety of simulations have been done to demonstrate the comparable performance of the proposed algorithm which support the theoretical observations as well.},

In the ESO, three factors: 1) nonderivative structure; 2) insufficient usage of innovation; and 3) no compensation of the unknown character of a nonlinear function, causing low type and low accuracy of observation are identified. The convergence problem of the ESO is also raised. A simple linear compensation function observer (CFO) is proposed. The CFO adopts the derivative form overcoming the structure problem of the ESO, fully uses the available innovation, and then introduces a compensator to replace the unknown function. The filtering compensator counteracts the effect of the time-varying nonlinear unknown model to make the error equation behave with desired poles. The convergence of the CFO is theoretically proved. The CFO is the Type-III system, whereas the ESO is a Type-I system; therefore, the CFO has a qualitative leap over the ESO in accuracy improvement of observation. The CFO can observe nonlinear functions, including lumped disturbances, uncertainties, and unmodeled parts for nonlinear systems. The CFO decouples the multi-input and multioutput (MIMO) systems. Five unknown typical nonlinear functions are tested and demonstrates that the CFO qualitatively prevails over the ESO. The MIMO chaotic attitude system of a small-scale unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) helicopter is conducted with results that CFO performance of function observation is highly improved over that of ESO about 29 times.},

  abstract     = {This article deals with the distributed $\mathcal {H}_{\infty }$ robust control problem for linear multiagent systems perturbed by external disturbances and norm-bounded uncertain parameters over the Markovian randomly switching communication topologies. To tackle this problem, the distributed observer-based controller is proposed, which requires the relative information between neighbors and the absolute information of a subset of the nodes, and thus is intrinsically distributed. It is of great interest to see that the distributed $\mathcal {H}_{\infty }$ robust control problem governed by such a controller can be converted to the stabilization with $\mathcal {H}_{\infty }$ disturbance attenuation problems of some decoupled linear systems, whose dimensions equal those of a single node. Then, the $\mathcal {H}_{\infty }$ stochastic robust performance region is defined to indicate the robustness of this controller against the variation of communication topologies. It is theoretically shown that the distributed observer-based controller yields bounded and connected robust performance region. Finally, the theoretical results are verified by conducting numerical simulations and experiments.},

  abstract     = {Real-time forecasting of the financial time-series data is challenging for many machine learning (ML) algorithms. First, many ML models operate offline, where they need a batch of data, which may not be available during training. Besides, due to a fixed architecture of the majority of the offline-based ML models, they suffer to deal with the uncertain nature of financial time-series data. In contrast, online learning mode evolving-structured ML models could be promising for financial time-series forecasting. For real-time deployment of such models, low memory demand is a must. Besides, the model’s explainability plays a crucial role in forecasting financial time-series. Considering all the requirements, a rule-based autonomous neuro-fuzzy learning algorithm called the parsimonious learning machine (PALM) is proposed here to forecast time-varying stock indices. To provide efficient automation of the proposed algorithm by maintaining the model explainability in terms of limited number linguistic IF-THEN rules, two popular multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MEAs), such as a real-coded genetic algorithm (GA) and a self-adaptive differential evolution (DE) algorithm are utilized here. In addition, fuzzy type-2 variants of PALMs’ are considered here due to better uncertainty handling capacity than their type-1 counterparts. To evaluate the proposed algorithm’s performance, the closing stock price of fifteen (15) different stock market indices are predicted here. From the results, it is observed that the MEA-based PALMs are performing better than the state-of-the-art benchmark online ML models and providing a rule-based explainable model to the end-user.},

  abstract     = {The three-dimensional morphable model (3DMM) is the most widely used representative model for obtaining a three-dimensional (3-D) face from a target on an image. Although 3DMMs have demonstrated the powerful capability to represent various facial shapes on natural images, they are limited to capturing texture variations of in-the-wild human faces. Based on the fact that fitting a 3-D facial model to an image determines the corresponding UV map, we propose a novel method for facial fitting and synthesis by competitively training two deep learning networks for facial alignment and UV texture completion. When the completion network is trained using well-aligned UV maps, it can model facial textures precisely and, consequently, fill the missing regions more completely. Accordingly, we use a UV completion network, denoted as a UV energy-based generative adversarial network (UV EB-GAN), to discriminate whether a UV map from the alignment network is well aligned by defining the generative loss of the completion network as the energy. Competitive learning facilitates training the completion network without ground-truth facial UV maps and training the alignment network without hard constraints and regularization terms. The proposed network can be trained in an end-to-end manner. The facial texture, albedo, lighting parameters, and 3-D facial shape can be obtained through this network. The results of the experiments on 2-D alignment, 3-D reconstruction, texture synthesis, and illumination estimation verified that the proposed method achieves remarkable improvements over the state-of-the-art methods.},

The error dynamics is modeled based on the proposed distributed control protocols for two large classes of general network topologies. The performance indices, such as stability, scalability, speedability, and string stability (4S) indices, are investigated. The necessary and sufficient conditions of stability for CVSs are derived and properties of characteristic roots are discussed. These roots are dependent on information of the given network topology. The sufficient conditions of stability, which are independent of network topology, are given by analyzing the range of eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix of the corresponding network topology, so scalability is guaranteed. To guarantee fast convergence speed, the upper boundary of stability margin is derived, which is also independent of the size of the network topology and can be conveniently tuned by the controller gains and model parameter. The necessary and sufficient conditions of stability are also achieved for the bidirectional-leader following (BLF) network topology. The conditions of string stability are further derived to ensure that spacing errors (caused by disturbances) decay along the vehicle platoon. Furthermore, combining the conditions of stability, speedability, and string stability, the CVSs are proven to be not only stable but also string stable and quickly convergent. Thus, the 4S indices can be guaranteed. Numerical simulations are provided to validate the theoretical results.},

To provide a model to describe these shortcomings, we define complexity in terms of a system’s sensors and the number of environments or situations in which it performs. The complexity is not looked at in terms of the difficulty of design, but in the final performance of the system as a function of the sensor and environmental count. As the complexity of AI, or any system, increases linearly the contingencies increase exponentially and the number of possible design performances increases as a compound exponential. In this worst case scenario, the exponential increase in contingencies makes the assessment of all contingencies difficult and eventually impossible. As the contingencies grow large, unexpected and undesirable contingencies are all expected to increase in number. This, the worst case scenario, is highly connected, or conjunctive. Contingencies grow linearly with respect to complexity for systems loosely connected, or disjunctive. Mitigation of unexpected outcomes in either case can be accomplished using tools such as design expertise and iterative redesign informed by intelligent testing.},

Critical observability is a property related to the safety concern of cyber-physical systems. With the aim of checking this property of a net system, it is required to detect whether a set of markings consistent with any observed word of the net system is a subset of a set of critical states representing undesirable operations or a set of noncritical states. In this work, we prove a necessary and sufficient condition to check critical observability when the critical state set is described by an arbitrary subset of reachable markings. Then, the result is extended to the case when a critical state set is modeled by all the reachable markings that satisfy disjunctions of generalized mutual exclusion constraints. The proposed method is derived from the solutions of integer linear programming problems and is applicable to net systems with liveness and boundness.

  abstract     = {The dynamic estimation of epidemic spreading on networks is essential for controlling morbidity. Nonlinear Kalman filters, which are capable of estimating the hidden state of a nonlinear system, can be utilized for dynamic state estimation of epidemic spreading. Traditional nonlinear Kalman filters perform optimization using the minimum mean square error (MMSE) criterion. Since observable measurements are generally corrupted by non-Gaussian noise, maximum correntropy criterion (MCC)-based nonlinear Kalman filters have been used for improving robustness against non-Gaussian noise. In comparison with the MCC, generalized correntropy is more robust and flexible in the presence of non-Gaussian noise. In this article, epidemic spreading is described by a compartmental model, i.e., susceptible-infected-recovered-susceptible model. Based on the compartmental model, the generalized correntropy-based sparse Gauss–Hermite quadrature filter (GCSGHQF) is proposed for epidemic tracking on homogeneous networks. The GCSGHQF approximates the Gaussian-weighted integrals by utilizing the sparse Gauss–Hermite quadrature rule. In addition, the generalized correntropy is applied to enhancing robustness in the presence of non-Gaussian noise. Simulation results show that the GCSGHQF exhibits a higher filtering accuracy and improves robustness compared to traditional nonlinear Kalman filters.},

  abstract     = {Predicting attention-modulated brain responses is a major area of investigation in brain–computer interface (BCI) research that aims to translate neural activities into useful control and communication commands. Such studies involve collecting electroencephalographic (EEG) data from subjects to train classifiers for decoding users’ mental states. However, various sources of inter or intrasubject variabilities in brain signals render training classifiers in BCI systems challenging. From a machine learning perspective, this model training generally follows a common methodology: 1) apply some type of feature extraction, which can be time-consuming and may require domain knowledge and 2) train a classifier using extracted features. The advent of deep learning technologies has offered unprecedented opportunities to not only construct remarkably accurate classifiers but also to integrate the feature extraction stage into the classifier construction. Although integrating feature extraction, which is generally domain-dependent, into the classifier construction is a considerable advantage of deep learning models, the process of architecture selection for BCIs generally depends on domain knowledge. In this study, we examine the feasibility of conducting a systematic model selection combined with mainstream deep learning architectures to construct accurate classifiers for decoding P300 event-related potentials. In particular, we present the results of 232 convolutional neural networks (CNNs) (4 datasets $\times58$ structures), 36 long short-term memory cells (LSTMs) (4 datasets $\times9$ structures), and 320 hybrid CNN-LSTM models (4 datasets $\times80$ structures) of varying complexity. Our empirical results show that in the classification of P300 waveforms, the constructed predictive models can outperform the current state-of-the-art deep learning architectures, which are partially or entirely inspired by domain knowledge.

Meanwhile, power constraint, feedback and feedforward loops constraints of the systems are also taken into account. The tracking performance expression is described by inner–outer factorization, which is obtained by all stabilizing two-degree-of-freedom compensators. The results will illustrate that tracking performance limitation is decided by nonminimum phase zeros and unstable poles of the given plant. Moreover, time delay, encoding–decoding, channel noise, quantization, and bandwidth constraints also impact the performance. The accuracy of the method is verified by simulation examples.},

Different from the finite-time convergence, the convergence time of the fixed-time convergence is independent of initial conditions. Then, an event-based control strategy is presented to reach the fixed-time average consensus under switching topologies and intermittent communication. Because the nonlinear dynamics, external disturbances, switching topologies, and triggering condition for intermittent communication are considered, the fixed-time consensus problem is more challenging under the event-based control than under the continuous-time control. Besides, a new measurement error is designed based on the hyperbolic tangent function to avoid Zeno behavior. Furthermore, an improved triggering function is designed to avoid continuous monitoring. Hence, resource consumption is reduced significantly. Finally, the effectiveness of the algorithms is validated by three simulation examples.},

A major obstacle is that the paths of the stochastic disturbances are nowhere differentiable almost surely which causes that the stochastic disturbances cannot be refined into the control input channel by the usual way of state transformation. To overcome this obstacle, a set of second-order extended state observers is first designed to estimate, in real time, the disturbance in each channel, and then a backstepping ADRC based on feedforward compensation and a constructive backstepping procedure is developed, guaranteeing that the closed-loop output tracks a time-varying reference signal in practically mean square and the closed-loop states are practically bounded in probability first defined in this article. Finally, some numerical simulations are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed backstepping ADRC approach.},

  abstract     = {The logistics industry faces high risk as demands for logistics services are stochastic. Facing the market demand volatility, individual logistics service providers (called “agents”) who are individual decision makers have their own preferences with respect to their profit targets. It is commonly observed that some agents are more risk taking (and hence they set very ambitious profit targets) whereas some are more risk averse. This creates a situation in which some agents over-reserve logistics capacities but some under-reserve. In the sharing economy, the logistics capacities can be balanced out and shared via platforms. In this article, we analytically build newsvendor problem-based optimization models to explore the value of a capacity-balancing-platform, in the presence of multiple agents. We propose two capacity-balancing mechanisms (called Rules 1 and 2) for the platform: 1) Rule 1 is an equal balancing rule in which all the capacities of agents will be collected and evenly distributed to all agents and 2) Rule 2 is a surplus balancing rule in which all capacities of agents will be collected and classified, and balancing is done with respect to surplus in capacity reservation. We then compare Rule 1 and Rule 2 with the original system when the platform is absent (Rule 0). We analytically prove that Rule 2 always outperforms Rule 0 with respect to the total systems expected profit. For the homogeneous case, Rule 1 is the optimal allocation rule and outperforms (with respect to the total systems expected profit) the more complex rule, i.e., Rule 2, which interestingly shows that “simplicity is better.” To generate more insights and to check the robustness of findings, we extend the analyses to cover more cases.},

The proposed algorithm not only can ensure the consensus of estimated terminal times at appointed time, but also can make the estimates finally be equal to the actual terminal times. To avoid Zeno behavior, the explicit expression of the norm of the consensus error is formulated, based on which the sampling interval sequence is modified to realize appointed-time approximate consensus of the actual terminal times. Local controller is also designed for each vehicle to ensure the fixed-time convergence of the relative velocity normal to the line of sight, and thus the singularity of control input at terminal time instant is successfully avoided.

By setting hierarchical prior distributions over the model weights and the parameters of the automatic relevance determination kernel function, respectively, a Gaussian approximation method is designed to approximate the intractable exact marginal likelihood by using the law of the total expectation and the total covariance. Furthermore, in this study, the joint posterior distribution over the model weights and the kernel parameters is estimated by combining the Gibbs sampling with a Laplace approximation. Thus, feature selection is performed by examining the posterior over the kernel parameters. To verify the performance of the proposed method, a series of benchmark datasets and two practical industrial datasets are employed. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method not only produces higher prediction accuracy than other methods but also performs better in feature selection, especially in industrial case.},

  abstract     = {This article is focused on the design of an output tracking control scheme for a class of continuous-time periodic piecewise time-varying systems (PPTVSs) with actuator saturation and nonlinear perturbations. The energy-to-peak tracking performance is studied based on an equivalent condition on the definiteness property of matrix polynomials. Considering the actuator saturation and nonlinear perturbation, matrix polynomial-based sufficient conditions are derived through the Lyapunov method using periodic matrix functions. From a perspective of subinterval segmentation aimed at PPTVSs, the proposed conditions can achieve less conservatism for tracking the output of a periodic time-varying reference system, while the controller gains can be computed using convex optimization. Moreover, a heuristic algorithm is constructed to simultaneously guarantee the closed-loop state convergence and the output tracking performance. The reduction in conservatism and the effectiveness of algorithm are demonstrated by illustrative case studies.},

  abstract     = {This article addresses the cooperative learning formation control problem for multiple homogeneous marine surface vessels (MSVs) subject to external time-varying disturbances and modeling uncertainties under the prescribed performance constraint. The modeling uncertainties, including hydrodynamic damping terms and unmodeled dynamics are identified/learned by the localized radial basis function neural networks (NNs) in a cooperative way. Disturbance observers are incorporated into the formation control design to compensate for the external time-varying disturbances. A novel cooperative learning formation controller is proposed, which is shown to be capable not only of fulfilling the predefined formation pattern with guaranteed prescribed performance but also of identifying/learning the associated uncertain dynamics based on the cooperative deterministic learning theory. Moreover, the learned knowledge on identified uncertain dynamics is stored in NN models with converged constant NN weights. Based on the stored knowledge, an experience-based formation controller is developed, which can improve the control performance including reduction of the computational burden, while guaranteeing prescribed performance of formation tracking errors. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed formation control protocol.},

  abstract     = {In this study, first, a comprehensive model is introduced to model actuator faults, and then a novel fault-tolerant control (FTC) strategy is proposed to compensate the loss of actuator’s effectiveness in networked control systems (NCSs). A Markov chain is exploited to represent networked-induced random delays, and data packet dropouts as well as disorders to address the stochastic characteristic of the network issues. Accordingly, the resulting closed-loop system lies in the framework of Markovian jump systems (MJSs). Moreover, partly unknown transition probabilities are considered in the current study since the identification of the exact value of transition probabilities of the Markov chain is difficult or even impractical due to the complex structure of the network. Sufficient conditions for the stochastic stability are derived by means of the solutions of a finite set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) to design a novel robust FTC through the output feedback technique, which requires only the outputs. A numerical example and an engineering benchmark system are presented to verify the capability of the proposed method in practical applications.},

The objective is to steer a fleet of UAVs along the path(s) while achieving the desired sequenced inter-UAV arc distance. In contrast to the previous coordinated path-following studies, we are able through our proposed hybrid control law to deal with the forward speed and the angular speed constraints of fixed-wing UAVs. More specifically, the hybrid control law makes all the UAVs work at two different levels: 1) those UAVs whose path-following errors are within an invariant set (i.e., the designed coordination set) work at the coordination level and 2) the other UAVs work at the single-agent level. At the coordination level, we prove that even with speed constraints, the proposed control law can make sure the path-following errors reduce to zero, while the inter-UAV arc distances converge to the desired value. At the single-agent level, analysis for the path-following error entering the coordination set is provided. We develop a hardware-in-the-loop simulation testbed of the multi-UAV system by using actual autopilots and the X-Plane simulator. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is corroborated with both numerical simulation and the testbed.},

Several critical and practical application-oriented control issues, including robustness, tracking error limitation, double-pendulum effects, and input dead zone nonlinearity, are considered simultaneously, which have never been well addressed in the existing literature. Technically, neural networks are employed to approximate the functions with uncertain/unknown dynamics and nonideal inputs. Several barrier Lyapunov functions are proposed that can circumvent the violation of tracking error limitations in the proposed control method. Importantly, based on the designed adaptive neural network tracking control method, the jib and trolley can track their desired trajectories very fast, and the hook and payload sway can be completely eliminated. The Lyapunov stability theory and Babalat’s lemma are utilized to theoretically prove the convergence and stability of the proposed control system. Finally, well-designed simulation studies are carried out to verify the excellent performance and strong robustness of the control method.

Besides, the undersampling process adopted in them is always subjective and unilateral. To address the above issues, we first propose a hybrid classifier ensemble (HCE) framework to conduct binary imbalanced data classification, which mainly includes a metric-based data space transformation (MDST) and an adaptive two-stage undersampling process (ATUP). The MDST aims to find a more appropriate embedding space for original imbalance data sets, and the ATUP considers both informative and representative samples to generate balanced data sets. Furthermore, we design a progressive HCE (PHCE) framework to improve the performance of HCE by utilizing a progressive mechanism with local and global evaluation criteria to select ensemble members. Extensive comparative experiments conducted on 28 real-world data sets exhibit that our method PHCE outperforms the majority of imbalance ensemble classification approaches.},

Accordingly, sufficient conditions for (fixed-) TSS are presented. On the basis of these formulations of the time-synchronized convergence property, the classical sign function, and also a norm-normalized sign function , are first revisited. Then in terms of this notion of TSS, we investigate their differences with applications in control system design for first-order systems (to illustrate the key concepts and outcomes), paying special attention to their convergence performance. It is found that while both these sign functions contribute to system stability, nevertheless an important result can be drawn that norm-normalized sign functions help a system to additionally achieve TSS. Furthermore, we propose a fixed-time-synchronized sliding-mode controller for second-order systems; and we also consider the important related matters of singularity avoidance there. Finally, numerical simulations are conducted to present the (fixed-) time-synchronized features attained; and further explorations of the merits of the proposed (fixed-) TSS are described.},

  abstract     = {The increasing application requirements of multilegged walking robots in outdoor environments pose new challenges regarding the design of their teleoperation systems. Some of these challenges arise from the multiple degrees of freedom of the telerobotic system and nonpassive exogenous disturbance. Herein, a novel control system based on a dual-master/single-slave bilateral haptic teleoperation framework using a semiautonomous strategy for hexapod robots walking on deformable rough terrains is proposed. In this teleoperation system, the body velocities and postures of the hexapod robot are determined according to the positions of two haptic master robots. The proposed teleoperator includes a time-domain passivity control approach to compensate for the system’s potential nonpassivity induced by the contact slippage between the foot and the ground. Furthermore, a posture-level bilateral controller is designed to overcome the unpredictable posture vibration. Information about the velocity loss and posture error is displayed to the human operator in the form of haptic force. In the underlying controller of the slave robot, a foot-force optimization algorithm is developed to improve the local autonomy of the teleoperation system. Furthermore, the stability of the system is demonstrated by its passivity. Experimental results indicate that the proposed controllers can provide a stable and transparent bilateral haptic teleoperation system for a hexapod robot under environmental perturbations.},

As well-known disturbance rejection methods, composite hierarchical anti-disturbance control (CHADC) can effectively compensate and suppress disturbance, which improves the control performances of complex systems. To enhance the capability of anti-disturbance and control precision, this article proposes a novel composite hierarchical anti-disturbance (CHAD) dynamic surface control (DSC) for the fast subsystem considering highly dynamic disturbance, and CHAD proportion-integration (PI) control for the slow subsystem with slow-varying harmonic disturbance. The disturbances are supposed to be generated by an exogenous system based on partially known information with model uncertainty, and the stabilities of both fast and slow closed-loop subsystems are analyzed. Meanwhile, the compensability of disturbances is discussed. Finally, simulations for an F-8 aircraft are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.},

However, process noises are not well analyzed in traditional CVA and corresponding fault identification methods are less studied. To solve these issues, a variational Bayesian CVA (VBCVA) model is proposed for dynamic process monitoring. Through a probabilistic perspective, the inevitable noises in realistic industrial processes can be captured in the new model. Moreover, the proposed model is further extended in the variational Bayesian framework to overcome the common problems in probabilistic methods. Besides, an improved fault identification approach based on fault relevance is introduced, which avoids the smearing effect caused by data reconstruction. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed process monitoring scheme is verified on the TE benchmark and a real wastewater treatment process.},

In this article, we consider the supervisory control layer of CPSs, focusing on closed-loop control systems vulnerable to sensor-reading modification attacks (SM-attacks), which may disguise the occurrence of an event as a different event by modifying appropriately sensor readings in sensor communication channels. In particular, we consider the plant modeled as a bounded Petri net and the control specification consisting in liveness enforcing. Based on repeatedly computing a more restrictive liveness-enforcing supervisor under no attack and constructing a so-called basic supervisor, a method that synthesizes a liveness-enforcing supervisor tolerant to an SM-attack is proposed.},

  abstract     = {This article addresses the problem of synchronization of impulsive networks with switching topologies. A new synchronization framework is established with an emphasis on settling time estimation. The impulsive networks consist of physical nodes and cyber modules. For physical nodes, states are changed impulsively at discrete time instants due to some switching phenomena or unexpected sudden noises. For cyber modules, two cases of switching scenarios are considered for information exchange patterns during specific time intervals. In the first case, cyber modules lose all the communication links with others, resulting in disconnected topologies. Then, a distributed controller is proposed for nodes without intrinsic nonlinear dynamics. A distinguished feature of this controller is its capability to estimate a bound for settling time, beyond which the synchronization with respect to a virtual target is guaranteed. In the second case, cyber modules lose some communication links but build other new ones with the help of a smart communication center to form connected topologies. A distributed controller is further designed for nodes in the presence of intrinsic nonlinear dynamics. Accordingly, a sufficient condition is derived to achieve synchronization with an estimated settling time bound. For both cases, the estimated bounds are able to reveal the relationship between the impulsive strength and the synchronization performance. Finally, numerical examples including a case study on a modified IEEE 34 bus test feeder are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controllers.},

  abstract     = {A mixed-integer programming (MIP) problem contains not only constraints but also integer restrictions. Integer restrictions divide the feasible region defined by constraints into multiple discontinuous feasible parts with different sizes. Several popular methods (e.g., rounding and truncation) have been proposed to deal with integer restrictions. Although it is easy for these methods to generate an integer, they tend to converge to an integer which is located in a feasible part with a big size. If the optimal solution is not in this feasible part, they are very likely to converge to a local optimal solution due to the loss of diversity of the population. To overcome this shortcoming, a biobjective optimization-based two-phase method is proposed in this article. In the first phase, a measure function is designed to compute the degree that a solution violates integer restrictions. By employing this measure function as the second objective function and removing integer restrictions, a MIP problem is transformed into a constrained biobjective optimization problem (CBOP). It can be proven that the Pareto optimal solution of the transformed CBOP which satisfies integer restrictions is the optimal solution of the original MIP problem. To solve the transformed CBOP, a new comparison rule is designed. After the first phase, the population can approach the Pareto optimal solution which satisfies integer restrictions. Then, the second phase is implemented to enhance the convergence precision and obtain the optimal solution. In addition, we design 12 test problems to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results demonstrate that the proposed method shows better performance against five state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms for MIP.},

It shows that reciprocal agents are convergent (including consensus and clusters) whenever the scaling parameters of an agent, corresponded to continuous/discrete dynamics, enjoy the same proportion value that matches to all agents. Otherwise, all participating agents share nothing eventually, that is, they achieve stability. This immediately gives rise to that the final aggregated values of agents are entirely determined by the underlying parameters, on condition that the connection property of communication topologies is preserved. Therefore, the proposed setup features a unified perspective on consensus, clusters (including bipartite consensus), and stability that are separately studied in most of the existing literature.

The results on some challenging data sets and the comparison of our algorithm with some other excellent methods demonstrate that the proposed method DCDP-ASC is more advantageous in identifying complex structured clusters containing a lot of noises.},

As the complexity of CPS increases, it becomes more challenging to efficiently formalize the integrated multidomain views with flexible automated verification across the entire lifecycle. This article illustrates a model-based systems engineering tool-chain to support CPS development with an emphasis on automated parameter value selection for co-simulation. First, a domain-specific modeling approach is introduced to support the formalizations of CPS artifacts, development processes, and simulation configurations. The domain-specific models are used as the basis to generate a Web-based process management system for automated parameter value selections, which coordinates Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration services of development information and technical resources (models, data, and tools) in order to support automated co-simulation. The services are deployed by a service orchestrator based on a decision-making algorithm for parameter value selection. Finally, developers make use of the WPMS to implement simulations and to select system parameter values for co-simulation automatically. The approach is illustrated by a case study on auto-braking system development and we evaluate the efficiency of this tool-chain by both qualitative and quantitative methods. The results show that parameter values are selected more efficiently and effectively when implementing co-simulations using our tool-chain.},

  abstract     = {Area coverage and network lifetime are two contradictory issues to the architecture development of a wireless sensor network (WSN). A satisfactory balance could be achieved by deploying abundant sensor nodes randomly and dividing them into $k$ exclusive cover sets. Toward self-organized partition with higher efficiency, we address the problem from the perspective of networked potential games and propose a memorial mixed-response algorithm (MMRA), which is implemented in a distributed and synchronous manner. Being viewed as a game player, each sensor node first updates its memory using a temporary action, which is generated by following a mixed response rule. After this, the coordination evolves into the next iteration by each player randomly drawing an action from its memory with equal probabilities. We prove that our algorithm converges with probability 1 to a convention of Nash equilibria, with the worst approximation ratio strictly larger than 0.5. Moreover, it is also found that a tradeoff between solution efficiency and computation time could be achieved via the adjustment of the amount of randomness introduced via the memory length $m$ as well as the probability $p_{m}$ , where better partition results are more likely to be generated using a larger $m$ and smaller $p_{m}$ . Comparisons with existing distributed methods demonstrate the superiority of our method in terms of solution refinement as well as convergence speed.},

In this article, a novel wavelet-driven deep neural network, termed as WaveletKernelNet (WKN), is presented, where a continuous wavelet convolutional (CWConv) layer is designed to replace the first convolutional layer of the standard CNN. This enables the first CWConv layer to discover more meaningful kernels. Furthermore, only the scale parameter and translation parameter are directly learned from raw data at this CWConv layer. This provides a very effective way to obtain a customized kernel bank, specifically tuned for extracting defect-related impact component embedded in the vibration signal. In addition, three experimental studies using data from laboratory environment are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method for mechanical fault diagnosis. The experimental results show that the accuracy of the WKNs is higher than CNN by more than 10\%, which indicate the importance of the designed CWConv layer. Besides, through theoretical analysis and feature map visualization, it is found that the WKNs are interpretable, have fewer parameters, and have the ability to converge faster within the same training epochs.},

  abstract     = {A noniterative fractional-order (FO) two-dimensional (2-D) adaptive filtering mechanism is proposed in this article. Quartiles-based adaptive textural segmentation is employed for the calculation of texture-dependent FO. Statistically, the quartiles/quintiles/quantiles are cut points for dividing the range of a probability distribution into continuous intervals with equal probabilities. For the purpose of texture-based isolation of the spatial regions, a 2-D textural map is framed by evaluating spatial entropy by considering a pixel-wise local circular neighborhood. A novel end-to-end framework is proposed for FO texture-dependent image sharpening in an independent manner without influencing the other classes of textural regions. A novel inclusion of texture-wise adaptive gamma correction is also proposed in this article by drafting a mechanism where different kinds of textural regions can be separately processed in an independent manner. A novel quintiles-based multiscale Retinex (MSR) inspired approach for reflectance computation is coined in this article for suppressing environmental artifacts and unbalanced/nonuniform illumination. In this context, various scales required for MSR are themselves computed through quartiles-based intensity levels. The proposed model is highly modular. So, it can also be pipelined in a parallel manner, along with any well-established state-of-the-art contrast enhancement approach. Also, this approach is noniterative and highly robust. It can be proposed as an add-on for several possible (as well as pre-existing) image processing procedures. Rigorous comparative evaluations are performed so that the excellence of the proposed approach can be underlined.},

To overcome this drawback, a new fuzzy swarm control for OMRs system is designed, which introduces the fuzzy logic to replace switching control in traditional sliding-mode control (SMC). The fuzzy SMC (FSMC) can weaken chattering for sliding-mode strategy in the OMRs system. However, it is difficult to design swarm control law for OMRs because of model uncertainties, external disturbance and the introduction of fuzzy logic. The FSMC is proposed in this article and its stability is analyzed. Simulation and experiment results show that the fuzzy swarm control based on sliding-mode strategy with self-organized OMRs system can realize stability asymptotically and chattering is weakened.},

  abstract     = {As the first decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) cryptocurrency system allowing people to trade with pseudonymous addresses, Bitcoin has become increasingly popular in recent years. However, the P2P and pseudonymous nature of Bitcoin make transactions on this platform very difficult to track, thus triggering the emergence of various illegal activities in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Particularly, mixing services in Bitcoin, originally designed to enhance transaction anonymity, have been widely employed for money laundering to complicate the process of trailing illicit fund. In this article, we focus on the detection of the addresses belonging to mixing services, which is an important task for anti-money laundering in Bitcoin. Specifically, we provide a feature-based network analysis framework to identify statistical properties of mixing services from three levels, namely, network level, account level, and transaction level. To better characterize the transaction patterns of different types of addresses, we propose the concept of attributed temporal heterogeneous motifs (ATH motifs). Moreover, to deal with the issue of imperfect labeling, we tackle the mixing detection task as a positive and unlabeled learning (PU learning) problem and build a detection model by leveraging the considered features. Experiments on real Bitcoin datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our detection model and the importance of hybrid motifs including ATH motifs in mixing detection.},

Many complicated factors, such as semi-Markov jump parameters, positivity, T–S fuzzy strategy, and external disturbance, are taken into consideration. Practical systems under positivity constraint conditions and unpredictable structural changes are characterized by positive semi-Markov jump systems (S-MJSs). First, by the key properties of the supplementary variable and the plant transformation technique, phase-type S-MJSs are transformed into Markov jump systems (MJSs), which means that, to an extent, these two kinds of stochastic switching systems are mutually represented. Second, with the help of the normalized membership function, the associated nonlinear MJSs are transformed into the local linear MJSs with specific T–S fuzzy rules. Third, by choosing the linear copositive Lyapunov function (LCLF), stochastic stability (SSY) criteria are given for the corresponding system with $\mathcal {L}_{1}$ performance. Some solvability conditions for positive $\mathcal {L}_{1}$ filter are constructed under a linear programming framework.

The lower and upper membership functions (LUMFs) are first applied to networked MASs to capture parameter uncertainties. The malicious behavior of DoS attacks that cause the loss of information for MASs is considered. Whereafter, based on attack situations, i.e., whether the attack invades the communication channels successfully or not, the uncertain nonlinear networked MAS is remodeled as a switched version with four subsystems and analyzed via the average dwell-time approach. In view of long-term utilization or burn-in of components, the actuator faults are taken into account for considered MASs. Afterward, on the basis of the Lyapunov stability theory, a novel IT2 fuzzy dynamic containment control protocol is proposed such that the states of followers can converge to the convex hull governed by those of leaders in spite of DoS attacks and actuator faults. Finally, a demonstrative example is shown to illustrate the effectiveness and practicabilities of the proposed fuzzy containment control strategy.},

  abstract     = {In this article, the robust control problem of uncertain nonlinear systems subject to magnitude and rate saturation (MRS) is investigated via active disturbance rejection control. To this purpose, we propose a novel robust controller that involves an improved extended state observer (IESO), a composite loop, and two anti-windup loops. The IESO is designed to estimate the state and the total disturbance, which includes the uncertain dynamics and external disturbance. Compared with the traditional ESO, IESO absorbs an anti-windup loop to ensure accurate estimation under MRS. The convergence analysis of IESO is further carried out to theoretically verify the accurate estimation of IESO. The composite loop is generalized to cancel the total disturbance based on the output of IESO. Moreover, a rate anti-windup loop is designed to attenuate the effect of rate saturation on the estimation/cancellation of total disturbance. An algorithm for anti-windup gains computation is correspondingly established, in order to minimize the effect of external disturbance in terms of $L_{2}$ gain while guaranteeing the local asymptotic stability. Finally, the proposed method is applied to aeroengine, which involves large uncertainty and suffers from disturbance and MRS. The experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {In structural health monitoring (SHM), measuring and evaluating structural dynamic responses are critical for safety management of civil infrastructures. Particularly, online forecasting of the structural responses under extreme external loading conditions (e.g., earthquakes) takes a significant role in SHM to provide early warning and ensure safe operation. In practice, complex causality and intrinsic interactions between seismic excitation and structural response make it challenging to establish a reliable predictive scheme. The present paper proposes a novel deep recurrent neural network (RNN) model implemented in the architecture of a time-series attention-based RNN encoder–decoder (TSA-RNN-ED), for predictive analysis of structural responses under seismic excitation. In the proposed data-driven model, upcoming sequential responses are predicted through sequence-to-sequence learning from historical multivariate time-series signals. A time-series attention mechanism is proposed to exploit the heterogeneous, but directly related, hidden features between the seismic loads and the corresponding structural responses. The proposed architecture can reliably regress excitation-response interactions to predict dynamic responses subjected to future earthquakes while satisfying the need of real-time forecasting for on-site practical implementation. This article systematically evaluates the proposed model by using two real-world structural cases: 1) the tallest building in China, the Shanghai Tower and 2) a woodframe classroom on a shake table at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada. The experimental results demonstrate the accurate and efficient performance of the proposed methodology in forecasting the seismic responses of the structures under investigation.},

Based on the traditional traveling salesman problem (TSP), this decision-making problem is formulated as an open dynamic traveling salesman problem with fixed start (ODTSP-FS). Incorporating the modified transition rule, elitist global update rule, and additional local update rule, an efficient algorithm is proposed to handle this decision-making problem. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves fast convergence and smaller cost compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms. In the lower level planner, based on the pipeline of rapid-exploring random tree (RRT) scheme, a novel real-time path planning algorithm is introduced, which can adjust itself to moving obstacles and moving targets by retaining the whole tree and using two rewiring strategies. Finally, the proposed two-level planner is evaluated in a simulation environment similar to the airport to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.},

Then, in order to further lower the communication consumptions, several new triggered sampled-data-based communication rules under fixed and switched networks are established, where the communications are performed only at some specific instants and, thus, the ideally continuous-time signal transmission among neighbors can be avoided. Note that sufficient criteria for achieving the coordination of the underactuated systems are derived in terms of the Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional method.

The WTODP is utilized to mitigate unnecessary network congestion occurring in the channel between DMNNs and the state estimator. In order to ensure resilience against possible realization errors, the estimator gain is permitted to undergo some norm-bounded parameter drifts. Our objective is to design a resilient set-membership estimator (RSME) that is capable of resisting gain variations and unknown-but-bounded noises by confining the estimation error to certain ellipsoidal regions. By resorting to the recursive matrix inequality technique, sufficient conditions are acquired for the existence of the expected RSME and, subsequently, an optimization problem is formalized by minimizing the constraint ellipsoid (with respect to the estimation error) under WTODP. Finally, numerical simulation is carried out to validate the usefulness of RSME.},

To lay the foundations for the corresponding theoretical analyses, the proposed MNI algorithm is first converted into a homogeneous linear equation with a residual term.

First, based on the considerations of the designed AETS and stochastic cyber-attacks, one constructs a newly fractional-order estimation error system model. Then, by employing the Lyapunov functional approach and the properties of Mittag–Leffler (M–L) functions, a sufficient condition is obtained to ensure the augmented error system stochastic mean-square stability; moreover, by making use of matrix’s singular value decomposition (SVD), the desired nonfragile state estimator is designed, and the estimator gains can be obtained by finding the feasible solutions of linear matrix inequality (LMI).

The unknown bias attached to velocity measurements is successfully handled by the proposed estimator. Simulation results illustrate the robustness of the proposed filter in discrete form, demonstrating its utility for the six-degrees-of-freedom (6 DoF) pose estimation as well as feature estimation in three-dimensional (3-D) space. In addition, the quaternion representation of the nonlinear filter for SLAM is provided.},

  abstract     = {Gaussian processes (GPs) are widely used in surrogate-assisted evolutionary optimization of expensive problems mainly due to the ability to provide a confidence level of their outputs, making it possible to adopt principled surrogate management methods, such as the acquisition function used in the Bayesian optimization. Unfortunately, GPs become less practical for high-dimensional multiobjective and many-objective optimization as their computational complexity is cubic in the number of training samples. In this article, we propose a computationally efficient dropout neural network (EDN) to replace the Gaussian process and a new model management strategy to achieve a good balance between convergence and diversity for assisting evolutionary algorithms to solve high-dimensional multiobjective and many-objective expensive optimization problems. While the conventional dropout neural network needs to save a large number of network models during the training for calculating the confidence level, only one single network model is needed in the EDN to estimate the fitness and its confidence level by randomly ignoring neurons in both training and testing the neural network. Extensive experimental studies on benchmark problems with up to 100 decision variables and 20 objectives demonstrate that, compared to state of the art, the proposed algorithm is not only highly competitive in performance but also computationally more scalable to high-dimensional many-objective optimization problems. Finally, the proposed algorithm is validated on an operational optimization problem of crude oil distillation units, further confirming its capability of handling expensive problems given a limited computational budget.},

  abstract     = {In this article, a virtual-goal-guided rapidly exploring random tree (RRT)-based visual servoing approach is proposed for nonholonomic mobile robots to simultaneously satisfy the field-of-view (FOV) constraint and the velocity constraints during the motion toward the desired pose. The presented approach contains two parts: 1) trajectory planning in the scaled Euclidean space and 2) trajectory tracking control. For the trajectory planning part, a new virtual-goal-guided RRT algorithm is designed to guarantee the FOV constraint and the velocity constraints by iteratively exploring the scaled Euclidean space in the presence of unknown image depth. Specifically, a virtual goal directly behind the desired pose is set to guide the tree to extend laterally into the area wherein the robot is easier to satisfy the FOV constraint. In addition, the lateral extension of the tree also helps decrease the lateral error of the robot as much as possible. Following each successful extension toward the virtual goal node, a greedy extension from the newly explored node to the desired pose is attempted using a polar stabilization controller, so that the planned trajectory can accurately arrive at the desired pose. Each newly explored edge in the scaled space is projected into the image space to check for the FOV limit. For the visual tracking part, the final searched trajectory in the scaled space is first transformed into image feature trajectories, which are then tracked by an image-based visual tracking controller. Experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {Research on robotic manipulation of fragile, compliant objects, such as food items, is gaining traction due to its game-changing potential within the food production and retailing sectors, currently characterized by manually intensive and highly repetitive tasks. Food products exhibit high levels of frailness, biological variation, and complex 3-D shapes and textures. For these reasons, introducing greater levels of robotic automation in the food and agricultural sectors remains an important challenge. This article addresses this challenge by developing a human-centered, haptic-based, learning from demonstration (LfD) policy that enables pretrained autonomous grasping of food items using an anthropomorphic robotic system. The policy combines data from teleoperation and direct human manipulation of objects, embodying human intent and interaction areas of significance. We evaluated the proposed solution against a recent state-of-the-art LfD policy as well as against two standard impedance controller techniques. Results show that the proposed policy performs significantly better than the other considered techniques, leading to high grasping success rates while guaranteeing the integrity of the food at hand.},

Correspondingly, the augmented dimension parameter updated laws and the unknown bound estimation of the compounded disturbance with a positive continuous integrable function are skillfully introduced. Also, by introducing a suitable decreasing function of tracking error variables, an improved adaptive event-triggered mechanism is constructed to achieve the asymptotic tracking and the communication load can be effectively alleviated. Moreover, it is shown that all the signals in the closed-loop system are uniformly bounded and the tracking errors converge to zero in a preset compact set. Finally, the validity of the proposed method is illustrated by simulation on an inverted pendulum model.},

However, feature representation has a decisive influence on both accuracy of value function approximation and convergence rate. Therefore, it is important to develop the feature selection theory and methods that can efficiently prevent overfitting and improve estimation accuracy in TD learning algorithms. In this article, we propose an online sparse TD learning algorithm for policy evaluation by using $\ell _{1}$ -regualrization for feature selection. The per-step-time runtime computational complexity of the proposed algorithm is linear with respect to feature dimension. The loss function is defined as a nested optimization with $\ell _{1}$ -regularization penalty, and the solver minimizes two suboptimization problems by running stochastic gradient descent and regularized dual averaging method, alternately. The convergence results for the fixed points are also established. The experiments on benchmarks with high-dimensional features show the abilities of learning and generalization of the proposed algorithms.},

The objective of this study is to review a number of clustering paradigms aimed at the construction of information granules, discuss the development of granular prototypes, and conduct a comprehensive evaluation of quality of numeric prototypes and their corresponding augmentations coming in the form of granular prototypes. We have been witnessing many studies devoted to the construction of information granules, but a comparative analysis of the quality of information granules constructed on a basis of prototypes produced by different clustering algorithms is still lacking. In this regard, the review of the clustering algorithms supporting the formation of information granules and the comprehensive comparative study of their usefulness in classification and modeling tasks offered in this study make sense.

Cryptographic chips must be strictly tested to guarantee the correctness of the encryption and decryption. Scan-based design-for-testability (DFT) provides high test quality. However, it can also be misused to steal the cipher key of cryptographic chips by hackers. In this article, we present a new scan design methodology that can resist scan-based side-channel attacks by the dynamical obfuscation of scan input data and scan output data. The scan test is managed by a test password, which consists of load password and scan password. When the chip enters into the test mode, it is required to apply the test password via some external input ports. Once the correct load password is delivered, the scan password can be loaded into a special shift register. If the scan password is also correct, the chip testing can proceed normally. In case the load password or the scan password is wrong, the data in scan chains cannot be propagated correctly. Specifically, some elusory bits are sneaked into scan chains dynamically. The advantage of the proposed method is that it has no negative impact on design performance and test flow when powerfully protecting cryptographic chips. The area penalty is also acceptably low compared with other schemes.},

The formation is within the leader–follower control framework, in which every follower is controlled to track its leader and maintain a desired relative distance and bearing angle with respect to its leader such that the prescribed formation geometry is achieved based on local sensing capability. The onboard sensor systems are of limited range and angle of view, thus defining a cone of detectable region for every follower. Each follower can detect its leader, if and only if the relative distance and bearing angle keep always inside the predefined detectable region such that the connectivity between the follower and its leader is maintained over time. In addition to the consideration of connectivity maintenance, no collision between the follower and its leader is also considered. A transverse function control approach is introduced to overcome the difficulties caused by the off-diagonal system matrix and underactuation. The barrier Lyapunov function and adaptive backstepping procedure are incorporated into the formation control design to achieve the boundedness of the closed-loop systems with guaranteed transient performance. Collision avoidance and connectivity maintenance between every follower and its leader are also proven mathematically.

Owing to this, a feedback control based on the hidden Markov model is developed through which the information on the current state of the actual system can be accessed through a series of observations. Moreover, the forward and backward delays of the master and slave manipulators are assumed to be asymmetric and varying with time. For the stability analysis, the Lyapunov–Krasovskii technique has been adopted for which its derivatives are dealt by employing Jensens’ inequality and extended reciprocal convex matrix inequality. Finally, simulation results were provided to validate the proposed methodology guaranteeing the closed-loop system to be asymptotically stable.},

  abstract     = {This article designs the static and dynamic event-triggered control (ETC) and self-triggered control (STC) algorithms to achieve the semiglobal stabilization of discrete-time systems with input constraints. First, a novel static ETC algorithm based on the discrete-time parametric Lyapunov equation (DPLE) is designed. In order to further increase the interevent times (IETs), the corresponding dynamic ETC is designed. Next, both static and dynamic STC, where the next control law updates depend on the previous triggered states, are proposed to avoid monitoring the measurement errors. The proposed algorithms are not only capable of reducing the number of transmissions significantly but also build a very simple and clear relationship between the only design parameter and the nontrivial IET (NIET). This allows us to change regularly IETs by adjusting the design parameter so that the nontriviality of static and dynamic ETC and STC is guaranteed and a tradeoff between the IETs and the control performance can be easily found. Specifically, by exploring the properties of DPLE, the designed algorithms avoid the complex relationship between the nontrivial condition and the system matrices. Finally, the designed static and dynamic ETC and STC algorithms are applied to the design of the spacecraft rendezvous control system and their effectiveness is verified by simulation results.},

  abstract     = {In this article, to solve trajectory tracing problem and vibration suppression for a planar two-link rigid-flexible manipulator subject to joint-velocity measurement noise, a novel uncalibrated visual servoing control is proposed. To begin with, the manipulator’s dynamic model is established by the assumed mode method (AMM). On this basis, based on the singular perturbation theory, two subsystem controllers are designed, one is slow subsystem controller, and the other one is fast subsystem controller. In the slow subsystem, to cope with the complication of the camera calibration, an adaptive algorithm is formulated to evaluate the parameters of a fixed camera online. Aiming to overcome the challenge that exact joint-velocity measurement may be disturbed by external noise, a nonlinear sliding observer is developed to estimate the state of joint velocity accurately. The asymptotic convergence of image tracking error is proved by means of Lyapunov analysis. Additionally, for the purpose of restraining the flexible beam’s elastic vibration, a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) approach is adopted in the fast subsystem control design. The realistic comparing simulation experiments are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed controller.},

An intelligent self-organizing double function-link fuzzy brain emotional control system is proposed which comprises a self-organizing double function-link fuzzy brain emotional controller (SDFLFBEC) and a compensation controller. The proposed SDFLFBEC consists of four substructures and a fuzzy inference system. The substructures are the prefrontal cortex, the amygdala, a double function-link network (FLN) and a self-organizing structure. The prefrontal cortex and the amygdala networks work as a mathematical form that presumes the judgment and emotion of a brain. Specifically, a new double FLN is designed to support the above networks for updating their weights. Next, a self-organizing structure can automatically add or prune the layers to achieve efficient network structure. In addition, the fuzzy inference rules are presented to explain the inference processes of the amygdala and orbitofrontal networks. From the above factors, the proposed SDFLFBEC can effectively reduce the tracking error and achieve favorable control performance. The parameters of the control system are adjusted online using the derived adaptation laws that are taken from a Lyapunov function so that the stability of the system is ensured. Simulation studies of a biped robot and the experimental results of a magnetic levitation system are employed to validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed SDFLFBEC.},

Second, three types of $P$ -invariants, from the special to the general, are developed to implicitly or explicitly invariant control the siphons. In the most general case, the virtual $P$ -invariants are constructed in the PNs. Third, the extended principle is further applied to the supervisor simplification. In the paradigm of the extended principle, it presents the redundancy from a structural perspective in contrast to several typical methods, and shows the significant importance of structural analysis in PNs, especially the important role of $P$ -invariants. As a consequence, the extended $P$ -invariant control principle can be considered as the fundamental principle of siphon control as well as its supervisor simplification.},

In the aforementioned switching mechanism, the concept of stage consisting of the persistent portion and the DT portion is introduced. Based on the singular perturbation theory, a two-time-scaling variables containing fast and slow states are taken into account on the CDNs simultaneously, which make the constructed networks more realistic. Furthermore, the main aim is to design a mode-dependent estimator to track the state information that cannot be directly obtained and further ensures the global uniform exponential stability of the investigated systems with a generalized dissipativity property. Some sufficient criteria on the existence of the desired mode-dependent state estimator are established by utilizing a modified matrix decoupling method.

  abstract     = {This article considers heterogeneous, cold standby systems performing missions with the fixed amount of work when a failure of an operating element results in a mission failure. A system is operating in a random environment modeled by the Poisson process of shocks. Each shock decreases the remaining lifetime of an operating element and, therefore, its preventive replacement (PR) is scheduled on experiencing the predetermined number of shocks. An important feature of the discussed model is that the failure can also occur during these PRs (task transfers) with two elements involved. The duration of the task transfer depends on the time from the start of a mission. The recursive equations for obtaining the mission success probability are derived and the corresponding numerical algorithm is developed. The number of shocks triggering elements’ replacements is obtained as a solution of the formulated optimization problem. The numerical example with the detailed analysis for a set of virtual machines operating in a cloud computing environment is presented.},

Despite a plethora of research studied sensor networks, most of them ignored this problem or assumed the considered sensor network comes with an ideal number of sensor nodes. We revisit this problem in the current paper. To this end, the minimal number of sensor nodes problem is first formalized and a novel observability condition, namely, minimal nodes uniform observability (MNUO), is then proposed. Next, this MNUO is applied to study the stability issues of the distributed Kalman filtering algorithm. In what follows, under the condition of MNUO, conditions to ensure its stability are given and the results about the relation of the filtering performance before and after selecting the minimal number of sensor nodes are obtained. Finally, optimization solutions and an example are given to find the minimal number of sensor nodes for a sensor network.},

Based on that, a cascaded bounded control framework is developed to regulate the roll and pitch angles within the predefined energy-efficient ranges, while a successful inspection trajectory tracking can be achieved simultaneously. Experimental studies are carried out to prove the effectiveness of the proposed method through a mock-up scenario of wind farm inspection. Compared to the conventional cascaded control framework, the proposed energy saving control strategy is capable of saving 5\% energy for the same inspection assignment under wind disturbance.},

The main challenge is that the coexistence of multiplicative noise and antagonistic information does not allow the multiplicative noise term to be converted into an error equation. Based on the semi-decomposition method and Lyapunov-based technique, we derive sufficient conditions for stochastic approximation step size to assure the mean square bipartite consensus. Moreover, the convergence rate of the consensus error is explicitly formulated, which is tightly linked to the step size and the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix.

However, most of the previous results on dynamical bifurcations are limited to few nodes coupling neural networks which modeled by differential equations with integer-order derivative, and few efforts have been contributed to studying the bifurcation behaviors of large-scale fractional-order neural networks. Furthermore, the structural characteristics of networks are also of great research value. Among them, the ring structure is a common phenomenon in neural networks. Although there are few papers on the bifurcation analysis of ring-structured neural networks recently, they consider only the case of a single ring. In this article, the dynamical analysis and design for a class of large-scale-delayed fractional-order neural networks with multiple rings and hub structure are investigated. First, the time delay is considered to be the bifurcation parameter and the formula of Coates’ flow graph is adopted to obtain the characteristic equation of large-scale networks. Second, by analyzing the complex radial and circular connections of neurons, the delay-induced Hopf bifurcation sufficient conditions for the neural network are established. Finally, the theoretical results are substantiated by a number of numerical simulation experiments and the relationships between the onset of bifurcation and the fractional order, the number of neurons, and the number of rings are revealed.},

Generally, different solution-sorting methods possess different advantages in dealing with distinct MaOPs. Focusing on this characteristic, this article proposes a general voting-mechanism-based ensemble framework (VMEF), where different solution-sorting methods can be integrated and work cooperatively to select promising solutions in a more robust manner. In addition, a strategy is designed to calculate the contribution of each solution-sorting method and then the total votes are adaptively allocated to different solution-sorting methods according to their contribution. Solution-sorting methods that make more contribution to the optimization process are rewarded with more votes and the solution-sorting methods with poor contribution will be punished in a period of time, which offers a good feedback to the optimization process. Finally, to test the performance of VMEF, extensive experiments are conducted in which VMEF is compared with five state-of-the-art peer many-objective EAs, including NSGA-III, SPEA/R, hpaEA, BiGE, and grid-based evolutionary algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that the overall performance of VMEF is significantly better than that of these comparative algorithms.},

Each cluster is equipped with a virtual leader which produces the desired trajectory for the agents to track. It is required only a fraction of systems is influenced by the leader. The interaction topology, which describes the information exchange among the dynamical systems as well as the virtual leaders, is allowed to be time varying with a well-defined average over an infinite horizon. That is, each augmented cluster, consisting of the agents as well as the corresponding virtual leader, in the time-average network topology is required to have a directed spanning tree. We then transform the cluster synchronization problem into a stability problem via the averaging method. It is proved that the convergence property for both types of dynamical systems is exclusively determined by the averaging system if the network topology switches sufficiently fast compared to original systems. Finally, it is concluded that if the intracluster coupling strength of the time-average topology is stronger than a threshold, then bounded cluster synchronization can be realized for a fast switching linear or nonlinear systems.

Second, in the second part, we derive coalitions’ payoffs under the two objectives of profit and link security and propose the biobjective Banzhaf values to allocate the corresponding cooperative games in all strategy situations. Then, a biobjective noncooperative game is formed on the basis of the obtained biobjective Banzhaf values. Third, we redefine Pareto–Nash equilibriums (in the sense of pure strategies) and obtain the Pareto–Nash equilibriums of the biobjective noncooperative game in the first part. Subsequently, the choice of the obtained Pareto–Nash equilibriums is regarded as a biobjective group decision-making problem, which is solved by employing the redefined Borda choice function method with objective weights. Hence, we can obtain the optimal strategy choices of all the nodes (players) for the entire bilateral link network formation.

In addition, the individual personality also plays an important role in crowd emotional contagion. However, few existing works have investigated the two factors jointly. To solve this problem, we propose a personalized virtual and physical cyberspace-based emotional contagion model (PVP-ECM) to simulate the process of crowd emotional contagion. First, we construct an individual emotion model and propose the personalized emotional contagion rules to consider the influences of the individual personality on crowd emotional contagion coupling the virtual and physical cyberspaces. Second, we use mean field theory to derive an evolution process and obtain mean field equations for the PVP-ECM. Then, we solve the PVP-ECM numerically using the finite difference method. Third, we construct a personalized BA scale-free network for the PVP-ECM simulation to further verify the stability of the model. Finally, we perform the PVP-ECM simulation and implement a simulation system to visualize the results of our theoretical analysis.

  abstract     = {This article investigates the leader-following output consensus problem of heterogeneous linear multiagent systems, where the nonidentical followers are subject to norm bounded parameter uncertainties. Two novel distributed event-triggered consensus strategies based on state feedback and output feedback, respectively, are proposed to solve the leader-following output consensus problem. A dynamic event-triggering mechanism which involves internal state variables is proposed to determine the next triggering instant. It should be noted that the controllers can be designed without the knowledge of some global graph information, such as the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix associated with the corresponding communication graph and the number of agents. In addition, the interevent time can be prolonged and the Zeno behavior can be excluded with the proposed dynamic triggering mechanism. Finally, an example is presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed controllers.},

  abstract     = {The scheduling of agile Earth observation satellites is to select a subset of candidate targets each associated with a profit during their visible time windows in order to maximize the collected profits, under some operational constraints. For each pair of two consecutive observations, a transition time is required to perform a rotating movement of the camera, depending on the start times of the two observations. This time-dependency significantly increases the complexity of the scheduling problem. To solve this problem efficiently, we model the time-dependent transition time and prove that it satisfies the first-in–first-out rule and the triangle inequalities rule. On this basis, we develop a novel hybrid heuristic, called “greedy randomized iterated local search” (GRILS). A specific insert operator, including a fast feasibility check and an assignment procedure are specifically designed to address the operational constraints of the scheduling. Extensive experiments on the single satellite instances and multisatellite instances demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms with respect to solution quality and computation time.},

  abstract     = {The structural control of floating wind turbines using active tuned mass damper is investigated in this article. To our knowledge, this is for the first time that reinforcement learning-based control approach is employed to this type of application. Specifically, an adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) algorithm is used to derive the optimal control law based on the nonlinear structural dynamics, and the large-scale machine learning platform Tensorflow is employed for the design and implementation of the neural network (NN) structure. Three fully connected NNs, i.e., a plant network, a critic network, and an action network, are included in the proposed NN structure. Their training requires the gradient information flowing through the whole network, which is tackled by automatic differentiation, a popular technique for deriving the gradients of complex networks automatically. While to our knowledge, the network structures in the existing literature are rather simple and the training of the hidden layer is usually ignored. This allows their gradients to be derived analytically, which is infeasible with complex network structures. Thus, automatic differentiation greatly improves the employed ADP algorithm’s ability in solving complex problems. The simulation results of structural control of floating wind turbines show that ADP controller performs very well in both normal and extreme conditions, with the standard deviation of the platform pitch displacement being reduced by around 40\%. A clear advantage of ADP controllers over the $H_{\infty }$ controller is observed, especially in extreme conditions. Moreover, our design considers the tradeoff between the control performance and power consumption.},

In this way, not only the complexity of developing a large system can be reduced but also the versatility of supporting diversified missions can be ensured. Furthermore, the proposed architecture is fully distributed that each UAV performs the decision-making procedure autonomously so as to achieve better scalability. Moreover, different kinds of aerial platforms can be feasibly extended by using the control allocation matrices and the integrated hardware box. A prototype swarm system based on the proposed architecture is built and the proposed architecture is evaluated through field experiments with a scale of 21 fixed-wing UAVs.

In the EMMSIQDE, a new differential mutation strategy of a difference vector is proposed to enhance the search ability and descent ability. Then, a new multipopulation mutation evolution mechanism is designed to ensure the relative independence of each subpopulation and the population diversity. The feasible solution space transformation strategy is used to achieve the optimal solution by mapping the quantum chromosome from a unit space to solution space. Finally, some multidimensional unimodal and multimodal functions are selected to demonstrate the optimization performance of EMMSIQDE.

  abstract     = {Real-time and high-performance segmentation is a crucial but challenging perception task for computationally constrained robots, such as the humanoid NAO robot used in the RoboCup Soccer Standard Platform League. However, most existing convolutional neural network (CNN)-based models for semantic segmentation suffer from massive computational costs, which prevents them from being applied to performing real-time inference with a NAO. In this article, we first publish meticulously annotated datasets for training and evaluating semantic segmentation models. Then, we propose a fast downsampling module that downsamples the image while maintaining the spatial information and a novel dense learning module that learns high-level semantic information while recovering the spatial details. Based on these operations, by using a multiscale fusion method to recover the resolution, we propose a more efficient and real-time segmentation model called RoboSeg primarily aimed at offering better speed and accuracy tradeoffs. Finally, to accommodate practical engineering applications, we offer a promising deployment guideline for the CNN model describing how to deploy it on computational resource-limited robots and achieve real-time performance. The experimental results show that the RoboSeg exceeds the state-of-the-art networks in RoboCup scene segmentation: we attain a mean IoU of 87.35\% and a pixel accuracy of 96.88\% on our dataset using a model that contains only 0.29M parameters and performs just 0.73 GFLOPs. Under the proposed deployment strategies, the network can run at above 30 FPS on NAO robots with downsampled frames.},

Some relations have been obtained between this NDS and descriptor systems about their observability/controllability. A necessary and sufficient condition is established with the associated matrices depending affinely on subsystem parameters/connections. An attractive property of this condition is that all the required calculations are performed independently on each individual subsystem. Except well posedness, not any other conditions are asked for subsystem parameters/connections. This is in sharp contrast to recent results on structural observability/controllability, which is proven to be NP-hard. Some characteristics are established for a subsystem that are helpful in constructing an observable/controllable NDS. It has been made clear that subsystems with an input matrix of full column rank are helpful in constructing an observable NDS while subsystems with an output matrix of full row rank are helpful in constructing a controllable NDS. These results are extended to an NDS with descriptor form subsystems. As a byproduct, the full normal rank condition of previous works on network observability/controllability has been completely removed. On the other hand, satisfaction of this condition is shown to be appreciative in building an observable/controllability NDS.},

  abstract     = {Mobile crowdsensing (MCS) is an emerging human-powered service for large-scale sensing and data collection. Most existing frameworks for controlling MCS services focus on a system-initiated setting where the crowdsourcer selects a subset of contributors and incentivizes them to collect the sensing data after the queries from the consumers arrive at the system. Such a system-initiated setting may cause large delays for the system to answer the consumers’ queries, which is not suitable for many real-time sensing applications. In this article, we propose contributor-initiated proactive sensing (CIPS) frameworks for MCS where the sensing data are collected in a proactive manner before the consumers’ queries arrive. In CIPS, the consumers can get answers about their queries with virtually no delay, which opens the door for MCS to many real-time applications. We first propose a centralized algorithm called C-CIPS as a benchmark for sensing scheduling by assuming the contributors are truthful and the consumer queries are known a priori . Next, we propose a distributed algorithm called D-CIPS to deal with strategic contributors and unknown consumer queries. Through rigorous theoretical analysis, we prove that both C-CIPS and D-CIPS can achieve near-optimal solutions. Furthermore, D-CIPS is proved to be truthful. Through comprehensive simulations with both synthetic and real-world data sets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.},

  abstract     = {We investigate a general solution based on reinforcement learning for the agile satellite scheduling problem. The core idea of this method is to determine a value function for evaluating the long-term benefit under a certain state by training from experiences, and then apply this value function to guide decisions in unknown situations. First, the process of agile satellite scheduling is modeled as a finite Markov decision process with continuous state space and discrete action space. Two subproblems of the agile Earth observation satellite scheduling problem, i.e., the sequencing problem and the timing problem are solved by the part of the agent and the environment in the model, respectively. A satisfactory solution of the timing problem can be quickly produced by a constructive heuristic algorithm. The objective function of this problem is to maximize the total reward of the entire scheduling process. Based on the above design, we demonstrate that Q-network has advantages in fitting the long-term benefit of such problems. After that, we train the Q-network by Q-learning. The experimental results show that the trained Q-network performs efficiently to cope with unknown data, and can generate high total profit in a short time. The method has good scalability and can be applied to different types of satellite scheduling problems by customizing only the constraints checking process and reward signals.},

  abstract     = {The accurate information of sideslip angle (SA) and tire cornering stiffness (TCS) is essential for advanced chassis control systems. However, SA and TCS cannot be directly measured by in-vehicle sensors. Thus, it is a hot topic to estimate SA and TCS with only in-vehicle sensors by an effective estimation method. In this article, we propose a novel fuzzy adaptive robust cubature Kalman filter (FARCKF) to accurately estimate SA and TCS. The model parameters of the FARCKF are dynamically updated using recursive least squares. A Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy system is developed to dynamically adjust the process noise parameter in the FARCKF. Finally, the performance of FARCKF is demonstrated via both simulation and experimental tests. The test results indicate that the estimation accuracy of SA and TCS is higher than that of the existing methods. Specifically, the estimation accuracy of SA is at least improved by more than 48\%, while the estimators of TCS are closer to the reference values.},

There is also a lack of research on crowd-based active learning on MTS data. To efficiently address the above issues, we propose a new framework of active semi-supervised learning. First, two criteria are advanced to measure the importance of an unlabeled sample from different perspectives. A dynamic time wrapping (DTW)-based similarity matrix is used to represent the MTS data. Next, to confidently label the most valuable samples with minimum cost, we advance a cost-effective crowd selection model and an adaptive labeler selection approach (ALS) to select the most suitable labelers, which could minimize the total cost of labeling and achieve better classification performance. Experiments on ten datasets show the effectiveness of our proposed methods.},

Under uncertain conditions, according to the random environment model and Gaussian distribution model, the collision probability between multiple vehicles is estimated by comprehensive trajectory prediction. The proposed method considers collision probabilities of different prediction points within and outside the prediction range and obtains long-term accurate prediction results. The method is suitable for the situation risk assessment of sensor systems in the presence of unexpected dynamic obstacles, sensor failures or communication losses in traffic, and different environmental sensing accuracy. The experimental results show that in the dynamic traffic environment, the proposed scenario assessment method can not only accurately predict and assess the situation risks within the prediction range, but also provide accurate scenario risk assessment outside the prediction range.},

By utilizing such improved model, extra adjustments on the process output changes and input changes are achieved and smoother dynamics for the controlled system are anticipated. Then, an IHLQ control is designed, where more degrees of freedom are obtained by additional weighting coefficients in the related performance index, hence modified control performance is yielded. With the existence of actuator faults, the process is theoretically an uncertain system. Therefore, robustness conditions for controller in terms of process parameter uncertainty are proposed using the Lyapunov theory.

And the compact form dynamic linearization (CFDL) technique is utilized to describe the unknown nonlinear dynamics of agents along iteration axis. Then, the MIMO MFAILC-based consensus tracking algorithm is proposed for MASs under fixed topology. From the proof, we can obtain that the consensus tracking error can converge to zero along iteration axis asymptotically. Next, the MFAILC-based consensus tracking algorithm is extended to controlling the MASs under iteration-switching topologies and the MASs with external disturbances, respectively. Compared with prior work, the main features of this article are the MFAILC-based consensus strategy can be utilized for MIMO MASs, and the framework of robust MFAILC is built for MIMO MASs with external disturbances. Finally, three simulations are given to verify the effectiveness of the consensus strategy for MASs under fixed and switching topology and MASs with external disturbances, respectively.},

  abstract     = {To implement the human–robot interactions in a noisy environment, the speech improvement-based (SIB) stratified adaptive finite-time saturation control (SAFTSC) for omnidirectional service robot (OSR) is developed. From the outset, the feature vectors of nine designed speech commands are extracted from their frequency signals and then trained by multiclass support vector machine. Two background noises are on-line filtered with the characteristic: “the smaller error in power spectrum is, the larger recovery from noisy power spectrum is.” Comparisons among without or with noise, and filtering are addressed. To achieve the zero pose error of OSR in finite time, an adaptive finite-time indirect trajectory (AFTIT) is constructed. To track the AFTIT with the zero error in finite time, the adaptive finite-time saturation control (AFTSC) is also established. Both AFTIT and AFTSC possess nonlinear switching gain increasing the high-frequency motion capability to fulfill the classified speech command. Simply put, the proposed SIB stratified AFTSC includes the speech improvement for classification, the AFTIT, and the AFTSC. Besides the stability of the closed-loop system is verified by the Lyapunov stability theory, three categories of SIB experiments are compared.},

In most previous works, the control input can avoid saturation by utilizing the low gain feedback (LGF) method whereas requiring the knowledge of agent dynamics, and SDTMASs just can attain semi-global containment control. Distinct with the previous works, first, based on the $Q$ -learning (QL) technique, this article defines a $Q$ -function and deduces the corresponding QL Bellman equation, which is the most important part of the QL algorithm. Then, in order to solve the QL Bellman equation, we propose two iterative model-free algorithms using state and output feedback, and the LGF matrix can be acquired from that solution directly. Furthermore, under the state and output feedback control protocols with the feedback matrices obtained from the proposed model-free algorithms, the SDTMASs can achieve global containment control instead of semi-global containment control. Finally, we present some simulations to confirm the validity of the proposed algorithms.},

The state feedback protocol and output feedback protocol are proposed, respectively, to render all states consensus errors to converge to zero asymptotically. First, the hierarchical decomposition algorithm is used to construct a refreshed communication graph to address the mutual dependence problem of controllers. Then, by introducing a local neighborhood consensus errors-based transformation, the leader-following consensus problem is converted into the stabilization problem for the consensus error system. Using the backstepping method and tuning function technique, the distributed adaptive state feedback controller is designed to render all followers&amp;#x2019; states to track the leader&amp;#x2019;s ones. Further, by constructing the reduced-order dynamic gain k-filter to estimate unmeasured states, a distributed adaptive output feedback controller is designed. In both controller design methods, the traditional Lipschitz condition need not be satisfied any more for all time-varying nonlinear functions, and different from most of the existing results on the high-order nonlinear MASs, full states consensus can be obtained.

To realize the control objective, fuzzy-logic systems are used to approximate the unknown nonlinear functions, and a high-gain fuzzy state observer is developed. By using the Nussbaum function technique and combining with the adaptive backstepping control design, a fuzzy adaptive finite-time output-feedback FTC scheme is proposed.

This procedure is based on the measurement of the similarity in the frequency domain between the collected data and a small amount of labeled reference signals (LRSs). The LRSs are obtained under various known operation conditions using fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm. The proposed approach is suitable for a real-time implementation and capable of successfully overcoming the challenge of condition monitoring of rotating machines under noisy environment and with limited labeled data. The merits, fastness, and also robustness against noise of the proposed technique are demonstrated experimentally through different practical applications, as well as compared to state-of-the-art procedures on a database of vibration signals measured under a variety of machine health and working conditions.},

The uncertain portion in the system is bounded, nonlinear, and time-varying which is within prescribed fuzzy set. Thus, this is a fuzzy system. Then, the proof based on the Lyapunov minimax approach shows that the novel high-order robust controls are able to assure deterministic system performance, which is uniform boundedness and ultimate uniform boundedness. Furthermore, the optimal choice of the tunable parameters in the control is considered. We creatively apply the Stackelberg strategy to solving the optimization problem. Two parameters are regarded as leader and follower in a sequential game, respectively. Based on the Stackelberg game rules, we are able to design different cost functions for different parameters. The cost functions include both performance measures and control cost. Finally, the simulations of an electronic throttle system are presented for demonstration.},

We assign an adaptive estimator to each uninformed agent to estimate the velocity of the leader.

The designed flocking control ensures that the velocity of followers asymptotically is converged to that of the VL. Also, the agents’ network remains connected, and no collision occurs among agents.

First, the optimization problem with parameter uncertainties is formulated, including two objective functions: 1) a trajectory length and 2) an expected value of drill-string torque. Then, an outlier-removal mechanism is devised in the sorting process of NSGA-II to reduce the negative effects of parameter uncertainties.

In light of the communication topology, the DCC forces each agent to reach a consensus on the given trajectory, which is from the reference signal of the common exosystem. Here, the output consensus problem is first equivalently converted into a stabilization one. Second the DCC involves a mapping ${\mathcal{ L}}_{d}$ of Laplacian matrix ${\mathcal{ L}}$ , i.e., every diagonal element of the Laplacian matrix is multiplied by a parameter $d_{i}$ . ${\mathcal{ L}}_{d}$ moves Ger š gorin circles of ${\mathcal{ L}}$ . By the merit of ${\mathcal{ L}}_{d}$ , the equivalent stabilization problem is solved by the strictly positive real (SPR). In fact, the DCC is an approximate distributed decoupling control, when $d_{i}$ is sufficiently large. In addition, under the framework of the DCC, the assignment problem of the dominant poles for each agent is also solved by inverse optimal regulator technology in this article.

  abstract     = {Recently, most background modeling (BM) methods claim to achieve real-time efficiency for low-resolution and standard-definition surveillance videos. With the increasing resolutions of surveillance cameras, full high-definition (full HD) surveillance videos have become the main trend and thus processing high-resolution videos becomes a novel issue in intelligent video surveillance. In this article, we propose a novel content-adaptive resizing framework (CARF) to boost the computation speed of BM methods in high-resolution surveillance videos. For each frame, we apply superpixels to separate the content of the frame to homogeneous and boundary sets. Two novel downsampling and upsampling layers based on the homogeneous and boundary sets are proposed. The front one downsamples high-resolution frames to low-resolution frames for obtaining efficient foreground segmentation results based on BM methods. The later one upsamples the low-resolution foreground segmentation results to the original resolution frames based on the superpixels. By simultaneously coupling both layers, experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve better quantitative and qualitative results compared with state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the computation speed of the proposed method without GPU accelerations is also significantly faster than that of the state-of-the-art methods.

First, as for input-constrained problems, the fundamental smooth assumption is not satisfied for the value function. To deal with this problem, we employ the method of vanishing viscosity solutions to relax this smooth assumption to a continuity assumption for the value function, which broadens the scope of RL applications. Second, the control cost functions take a more general form which guarantees the continuity of the optimal control policy instead of the specific integrand form used in previous input-constrained RL-based schemes. Based on these results, we introduce a novel identifier&amp;#x2013;critic&amp;#x2013;actor structure to extend the conventional critic&amp;#x2013;actor RL framework into a distributed model-free one, where the learning of the identifier, critic, and actor is online and simultaneous. We provide the simulation examples to validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

  abstract     = {The manipulating robots receive much attention by offering better services, where object grasping is still challenging especially under background interferences. In this article, a novel two-stream grasping convolutional neural network (CNN) with simultaneous detection and segmentation is proposed. The proposed method is cascaded by an improved simultaneous detection and segmentation network BlitzNet and a two-stream grasping CNN TsGNet. The improved BlitzNet introduces the channel-based attention mechanism, and achieves an improvement of detection accuracy and segmentation accuracy with the combination of the learning of multitask loss weightings and background suppression. Based on the obtained bounding box and the segmentation mask of the target object, the target object is separated from the background, and the corresponding depth map and grayscale map are sent to TsGNet. By adopting depthwise separable convolution and designed global deconvolution network, TsGNet achieves the best grasp detection with only a small amount of network parameters. This best grasp in the pixel coordinate system is converted to a desired 6-D pose for the robot, which drives the manipulator to execute grasping. The proposed method combines a grasping CNN with simultaneous detection and segmentation to achieve the best grasp with a good adaptability to background. With the Cornell grasping dataset, the image-wise accuracy and object-wise accuracy of the proposed TsGNet are 93.13\% and 92.99\%, respectively. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by the experiments.},

  abstract     = {Recently, blockchain technology has become a topic in the spotlight but also a hotbed of various cybercrimes. Among them, phishing scams on blockchain have been found to make a notable amount of money, thus emerging as a serious threat to the trading security of the blockchain ecosystem. In order to create a favorable environment for investment, an effective method for detecting phishing scams is urgently needed in the blockchain ecosystem. To this end, this article proposes an approach to detect phishing scams on Ethereum by mining its transaction records. Specifically, we first crawl the labeled phishing addresses from two authorized websites and reconstruct the transaction network according to the collected transaction records. Then, by taking the transaction amount and timestamp into consideration, we propose a novel network embedding algorithm called trans2vec to extract the features of the addresses for subsequent phishing identification. Finally, we adopt the one-class support vector machine (SVM) to classify the nodes into normal and phishing ones. Experimental results demonstrate that the phishing detection method works effectively on Ethereum, and indicate the efficacy of trans2vec over existing state-of-the-art algorithms on feature extraction for transaction networks. This work is the first investigation on phishing detection on Ethereum via network embedding and provides insights into how features of large-scale transaction networks can be embedded.},

  abstract     = {Machine learning models have gained popularity nowadays for their potential to solve real-life issues when trained on pertinent data. In many cases, the real-life data are class imbalanced and hence the corresponding machine learning models trained on the data tend to perform poorly on metrics like precision, recall, AUC, F1, and G-mean score. Since class imbalance issue poses serious challenges to the performance of trained models, a multitude of research works have addressed this issue. Two common data-based sampling techniques have mostly been proposed-undersampling the data of the majority class and oversampling the data of the minority class. In this article, we focus on the former approach. We propose two novel algorithms that employ neural network-based approaches to remove majority samples that are found to reside in the vicinity of the minority samples, thereby undersampling the former to remove (or alleviate) the imbalance issue. We delineate the proposed algorithms and then test the proposed algorithms on some publicly available imbalanced datasets. We then compare the performance of our proposed algorithms to other popular undersampling algorithms. Finally, we conclude that our proposed algorithms outperform most of the existing undersampling approaches on most performance metrics.},

The hot metal is the final product of blast furnace, and its silicon content not only reflects the quality of hot metal but also characterizes the operation status of the blast furnace, so its accurate prediction is very important for the operation of the blast furnace. Given the bottleneck problem in the application of the existing prediction model of hot metal silicon content in the blast furnace, this article proposed a novel data-driven modeling method. First, a nonlinear Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) fuzzy model is constructed for the hot metal silicon content to completely capture the nonlinear dynamics of the blast furnace process. Then, considering the doubts of blast furnace operators about the predicted results of the model, the Bayesian method is used to identify the consequent parameters of the fuzzy model to obtain the probability output, to present the credibility of the predicted results. Furthermore, to improve the robustness of the fuzzy model to the initial fuzzy rules, the sparse priori is adopted to construct a compact fuzzy model with strong generalization performance, in which the key fuzzy rules were screened out. In addition, two optimization methods are derived for each of the above models. Finally, the validity of the proposed methods is verified by the test of actual blast furnace data.},

In order to quantitatively describe the system observability, we propose a series of metrics for BOT. Being derived based on the condition number, the novel metrics can reflect the observability degree as well as evaluate the tracking performance.

The technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) is widely used for multiple-attribute decision problems. The commonly used relative closeness measure in the TOPSIS is not a mathematical distance and thus does not have all the nice properties of such a distance. To improve the TOPSIS, particularly its relative closeness measure, we propose two measures, named optimistic distance (OD) and pessimistic distance (PD), based on our RED, and use them to measure the relative closeness in the TOPSIS. Both measures are positive definite, symmetric, and satisfy the triangle inequality. The best choice in OD (or PD) is on the Pareto frontier.

Disassembly sequence planning focuses on finding the best disassembly sequence for a given EOL product by considering economic and environmental performance. In a practical disassembly process, one may face a disassembly operation failure risk due to the difficulty of knowing EOL products’ exact information in advance. Despite its importance in impacting disassembly outcomes, the existing work fails to consider it comprehensively. This work proposes a stochastic biobjective DSP problem with the objectives of maximizing disassembly profit and minimizing energy consumption by doing so. A chance-constrained programming model is established, where a chance constraint ensures a fixed confidence level of disassembly failure. To solve it efficiently, a multiobjective multiverse optimization algorithm with stochastic simulation is proposed. Experiments are carried out on four products. Results demonstrate that it outperforms some state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of solution performance.},

In this work, we present a novel RL method, namely, sparse filtering with adaptive basis weighting (SFABW) whose architecture is a three-layer neural network. The first and the last two layers are responsible for basis learning and basis weighting, respectively. We formulate a loss function to model such architecture and develop an iterative algorithm to minimize it, also we prove the convergence of this algorithm in theory. Through optimizing the whole network, we are able to obtain a group of bases together with their weights simultaneously. A subset of top-ranked bases with great weights is retained while the rest bases are discarded. The experimental results on a motor bearing dataset and a gear dataset have demonstrated the effectiveness of our method.},

First, a new quasi-fast finite-time practical stability (QFPS) criterion is proposed for a class of general nonlinear systems. Then, the presented QFPS criterion is applied to design the desired adaptive finite-time neural tracking controller for a class of nonstrict-feedback nonlinear systems. The presented design scheme for the nonstrict-feedback nonlinear system has the following two features: 1) the “explosion of complexity” issue of the backstepping design is addressed by utilizing the DS technique and 2) the structural feature of Gaussian functions is applied to solve the design difficulties caused by the nonstrict-feedback form. It is proved that the designed controller for the nonstrict-feedback nonlinear system can make the resulting closed-loop system stabilizable in a quasi-fast finite time and the tracking error converges to a sufficiently small neighborhood of the origin. Finally, the simulation results are given to show the validity and practicability of the proposed design scheme.},

  abstract     = {The plants of nano air vehicles (NAVs) are generally unstable, adversely coupled, and uncertain. Besides, the autopilot hardware of a NAV has limited sensing and computational capabilities. Hence, these vehicles need a single controller referred to as robust simultaneously stabilizing decoupling (RSSD) output feedback controller that achieves simultaneous stabilization (SS), desired decoupling, robustness, and performance for a finite set of unstable multi-input–multioutput adversely coupled uncertain plants. To synthesize an RSSD output feedback controller, a new method that is based on a central plant is proposed in this article. Given a finite set of plants for SS, we considered a plant in this set that has the smallest maximum $v-$ gap metric as the central plant. Following this, the sufficient condition for the existence of a simultaneous stabilizing controller associated with such a plant is described. The decoupling feature is then appended to this controller using the properties of the eigenstructure assignment method. Afterward, the sufficient conditions for the existence of an RSSD output feedback controller are obtained. Using these sufficient conditions, a new optimization problem for the synthesis of an RSSD output feedback controller is formulated. To solve this optimization problem, a new genetic algorithm-based offline iterative algorithm is developed. The effectiveness of this iterative algorithm is then demonstrated by generating an RSSD controller for a fixed-wing NAV. The performance of this controller is validated through numerical and hardware-in-the-loop simulations.},

To begin with, a class of generalized Gaussian-wavelet-type activation functions is adopted to extend the number of stable equilibrium states. On this basis, a distributed impulsive controller is constructed to realize the multiple synchronization of the delayed CMNNs. Under the concepts of $\mu $ -stability, Filippov solution, and differential inclusion, some sufficient conditions are derived such that the addressed system can possess $(2r + 1)^{n}\,\,\mu $ -stable synchronization manifolds. The convergence performance of solutions is determined by the time delays. As the time delays increase, the stability of synchronization manifolds will transform from exponential stability to power-stability, log-stability, or log–log-stability as special cases. Moreover, considering the modeling error and external disturbance, we further investigated the multisynchronization of delayed CMNNs with parametric uncertainties and stochastic perturbations, and some robust multisynchronization criteria are obtained. Finally, the effectiveness of the obtained results is verified by numerical simulations.},

Specifically, the fitness value of each dandelion in the next generation, which is calculated by linear prediction, is compared with the current best dandelion, and the loser is replaced by a new offspring. Current DA generates new offsprings without considering historical information. This work improves its offspring generation process by exploiting historical information with an estimation-of-distribution algorithm. Three historical information models are designed. They are best, worst, and hybrid historical information feedback models. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithms outperform DA and its variants, and the proposed algorithms are superior or competitive to nine participating algorithms benchmarked on 28 functions from CEC2013. Finally, the proposed algorithms demonstrate the effectiveness on four real-world problems, and the results indicate that the proposed algorithms have better performance than its peers.},

Two FTCC strategies are proposed for two different cases, i.e., leader’s input can be obtained by its neighboring follower agents and the input of the leader is not available by any followers, respectively. In the first case, a distributed observer-based adaptive FTCC protocol is presented to achieve the containment control objective. In the second case, a distributed adaptive FTCC method which is independent of global information about the communication topology and upper bounds of the leader’s input is developed using the local containment error. An auxiliary controller gain is proposed to solve the problem of partial loss of effectiveness faults, and the potential singularity brought by the auxiliary controller gain to the controller can be avoided by introducing a projection operator. It is shown that each follower converges asymptotically to a convex hull spanned by the leaders with external input. Finally, the developed method is demonstrated by simulation results.},

In this article, the first-ever survey of recent studies in deep learning-based small object detection is presented. Our review begins with a brief introduction of the four pillars for small object detection, including multiscale representation, contextual information, super-resolution, and region-proposal. Then, the collection of state-of-the-art datasets for small object detection is listed. The performance of different methods on these datasets is reported later. Moreover, the state-of-the-art small object detection networks are investigated along with a special focus on the differences and modifications to improve the detection performance comparing to generic object detection architectures.

For a traditional model, it is shown that finite-time convergence requires a complete topology and that by removing neighbors with duplicate opinions reduces in half the number of links. Finite-time convergence is proved for two novel models even when nodes contact two other nodes of close opinion. In a deterministic setting, the network connectivity influences the final consensus and changes the relative weight of each node on the final value. In the case of mobile robots, a similar communication constraint is present which makes the analysis of the social network so relevant in the domain of control systems as a guideline to save resources and obtain finite-time consensus.

In this article, we focus on strategies designing problem for sensor and denial-of-service (DoS) attacker in WNCS based on linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) cost. In this scenario, a sensor measures the output of the system and transmits its local state estimate to the remote estimator via an unreliable channel which may suffer interference from an intelligent DoS attacker. In each step, the sensor demands to determine the power to transmit its packet data, at the same time, the attacker needs to determine the interference power to degrade the performance of the WNCS. To analyze this interactive decision-making process, we construct a two-player zero-sum stochastic game and propose an improved LQG cost considering energy-efficient factors. Then, for continuous power-level setting, we discuss the existence and the structure of equilibrium strategies of the sensor&amp;#x2013;attacker game. For a discrete power set, an algorithm is developed to solve equilibrium strategies for both players. Finally, we present an example to illustrate our results.},

It is shown that the proposed ADO is nonoverestimated and the first derivative upper bound of disturbance is unknown. Then, based on the proposed observers, a novel controller is designed to suppress flexible vibration and realize attitude control. The remarkable feature of the designed algorithm is that flexible vibration is suppressed and attitude tracking is guaranteed simultaneously without intelligent materials which are used to suppress flexible vibration in the previous work.

Benefit from the given comprehensive real-time scheduling model, these time-varying differences on time vertical dimension and two different transverse dimensions are for the first time integrated into fuzzy stabilization and two key alterable weights are also introduced. Consequently, much considerable freedom can be produced and, thus, it brings much less conservative results than the reported ones in recent literature. More importantly, a very simple workable way has been provided to online recognize the specific enabled mode at each sampling instant so that those existing time-consuming online operations in referred literature can be avoided to ease online implementation costs. Indeed, this feature is very beneficial to the practical application of our theoretical results. Finally, the superiority of our developed method over previous ones is validated adequately via two benchmark simulations.},

  abstract     = {Currently, the diagnosis of single fault marked by distinct characteristics has received mass concern, and the related research achievements are remarkable. However, the diagnosis of early multiple intermittent (EMI) faults commonly existing in industrial systems is still an intractable problem, owing to: 1) the scarcity of fault data and the faintness of features and 2) the mutual interaction of components and the coupling of fault characteristics. In order to address the problem, this article proposes an improved sparse autoencoder and multilevel denoising strategy (MDS-ISAE) for diagnosing EMI faults. First, a relational constraint term is constructed to mitigate the effect of data correlation. Second, a multilevel denoising strategy is designed to enhance the robustness of AE feature learning with strong background noise. Third, a resizable resampling strategy is planned to tackle the skew distribution of diagnosis data. Based on the above strategies, an MDS-ISAE-based model is constructed to achieve EMI faults diagnosis. Further, the evaluation criteria of diagnosis performance are proposed and the applicability of the method is tested. Finally, the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed method are verified by artificial damage and real fault experiments, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Packet routing is one of the fundamental problems in computer networks in which a router determines the next-hop of each packet in the queue to get it as quickly as possible to its destination. Reinforcement learning (RL) has been introduced to design autonomous packet routing policies with local information of stochastic packet arrival and service. However, the curse of dimensionality of RL prohibits the more comprehensive representation of dynamic network states, thus limiting its potential benefit. In this article, we propose a novel packet routing framework based on multiagent deep RL (DRL) in which each router possess an independent long short term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN) for training and decision making in a fully distributed environment. The LSTM RNN extracts routing features from rich information regarding backlogged packets and past actions, and effectively approximates the value function of Q-learning. We further allow each route to communicate periodically with direct neighbors so that a broader view of network state can be incorporated. The experimental results manifest that our multiagent DRL policy can strike the delicate balance between congestion-aware and shortest routes, and significantly reduce the packet delivery time in general network topologies compared with its counterparts.},

As some optimal solutions locate on the boundary of local constraints, we further provide an alternative suboptimal solution based on the $\epsilon $ -exact penalty function method. Different from the existing distributed optimal allocation results, the (sub)optimal solutions can be obtained in the fixed time and the optimization protocols can be implemented in an initialization-free manner. Thus, the convergence time can be offline preassigned and the initial states can be chosen arbitrarily such that a better robust performance is achieved for the new algorithms.

In this article, a Markov jump system with controlled and hidden modes (MJSCHM) is employed to model a class of human-in-the-loop (HiTL) control systems which passively monitor human internal state (HIS) and take appropriate control actions to the human and the machine. By means of the MJSCHM, the human model, the machine model, and their interaction can be integrated in a probabilistic framework. In the MJSCHM, a controlled hidden Markov model (CHMM) is used for the human behavior modeling, which takes into account the random nature of HIS reasoning and the uncertainty from HIS observation, as well as the effect of control input for the human on the HIS. The stability analysis and human-assistance control design for linear discrete-time HiTL systems are addressed using the stochastic Lyapunov functional and linear matrix inequality (LMI) technique. Necessary and sufficient condition for stochastic stability of the HiTL system is first developed on the basis of the MJSCHM model. An LMI approach to the human-assistance control design is then proposed such that the HiTL system is stochastically stable. Finally, simulation results on a driver-assistance system are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.},

Based on the FO sliding-mode surfaces, the NDOs are first developed to estimate the lumped uncertainties due to the aerodynamic parameter perturbations, wind disturbances, and actuator faults. Then, adaptive FWNNs with updating weighting matrices, mean vectors, and deviation vectors are constructed to effectively attenuate the adverse effects induced by the NDO estimation errors. Furthermore, to compensate the FWNN approximation errors, robust controllers are integrated into the developed control scheme to enhance the approximation abilities. It is shown that by using Lyapunov methods, all UAVs can track their attitude references.

  abstract     = {Offspring generation plays an important role in evolutionary multiobjective optimization. However, generating promising candidate solutions effectively in high-dimensional spaces is particularly challenging. To address this issue, we propose an adaptive offspring generation method for large-scale multiobjective optimization. First, a preselection strategy is proposed to select a balanced parent population, and then these parent solutions are used to construct direction vectors in the decision spaces for reproducing promising offspring solutions. Specifically, two kinds of direction vectors are adaptively used to generate offspring solutions. The first kind takes advantage of the dominated solutions to generate offspring solutions toward the Pareto optimal set (PS) for convergence enhancement, while the other kind uses those nondominated solutions to spread the solutions over the PS for diversity maintenance. The proposed offspring generation method can be embedded in many existing multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (EAs) for large-scale multiobjective optimization. Experiments are conducted to reveal the mechanism of our proposed adaptive reproduction strategy and validate its effectiveness. Experimental results on some large-scale multiobjective optimization problems have demonstrated the competitive performance of our proposed algorithm in comparison with five state-of-the-art large-scale EAs.},

  abstract     = {Evolutionary algorithms and swarm intelligence algorithms have been widely used for constrained optimization problems for decades and numerous techniques for constraint handling have been proposed. The ${\varepsilon }$ -constrained method is a very effective one. In the literature, the ${\varepsilon }$ value was usually controlled via an exponential function, which is not competent for solving certain types of constrained optimization problems, e.g., whose global optima are located near the boundary of the feasible and infeasible regions. To solve this problem, this article proposes a new adaptive ${\varepsilon }$ control method and incorporate it into a basic differential evolution (DE) algorithm: (DE/rand/1/exp). Based on the information of constraint violation in the current population, the adaptive method controls the value of ${\varepsilon }$ through a simple heuristic rule. Compared with the traditional exponential function-based control methods, the proposed adaptive method can prevent the algorithm from being trapped into local optima while retaining the obtained near-optimal candidate solutions in the infeasible region for generating promising searching paths. Besides, we set the crossover rate (CR) as a more reasonable value for DE/rand/1/exp, which can enhance the efficiency significantly. The well-known 2006 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC 2006) competition on real-parameter single-objective constrained optimization benchmark is adopted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive ${\varepsilon }$ -constrained DE. Fifteen constrained engineering optimization problems are collected from the literature to test the proposed algorithm. Moreover, the adaptive ${\varepsilon }$ control method is extended to an adaptive algorithm to solve the benchmark problems from CEC 2017. The comparison results confirm the superiority of the proposed method.},

The estimated load value is used to compensate the voltage loop controller, therefore, the voltage loop gains more robustness against the load perturbation and its disturbing effect is greatly reduced. The effectiveness and advantage of the proposed control strategy has been verified through theoretical analysis, simulations, and the real-application experiments conducted on a 5 KVA laboratory AFE. The results show that the proposed control strategy provides obvious improvement of the dc-link voltage control performance comparing with the conventional PI controller and demonstrates stronger robustness against the operating point variations caused by the changes in external load and dc-link capacitance.},

  abstract     = {During decades, the automatic train operation (ATO) system has been gradually adopted in many subway systems for its low-cost and intelligence. This article proposes two smart train operation (STO) algorithms by integrating the expert knowledge with reinforcement learning algorithms. Compared with previous works, the proposed algorithms can realize the control of continuous action for the subway system and optimize multiple critical objectives without using an offline speed profile. First, through learning historical data of experienced subway drivers, we extract the expert knowledge rules and build inference methods to guarantee the riding comfort, the punctuality, and the safety of the subway system. Then we develop two algorithms for optimizing the energy efficiency of train operation. One is the STO algorithm based on deep deterministic policy gradient named (STOD) and the other is the STO algorithm based on normalized advantage function (STON). Finally, we verify the performance of proposed algorithms via some numerical simulations with the real field data from the Yizhuang Line of the Beijing Subway and illustrate that the developed STO algorithm are better than expert manual driving and existing ATO algorithms in terms of energy efficiency. Moreover, STOD and STON can adapt to different trip times and different resistance conditions.},

In contrast to the state-of-the-art approaches for ensuring the $\ell _{1}$ -stability of the positive system which are based on bilinear matrix inequalities, the proposed optimal robust control design under $\ell _{1}$ -induced performance is derived based on linear programming framework.

  abstract     = {Optimal iterative learning control (OILC) has been recognized as an excellent model-based means for regulating batch process with abundant successful applications reported in the past decades but also received considerable criticisms for its poor robustness against model mismatch that is common for many industrial situations. Despite numerous attempts to address the issue, many of them are still not able to yield satisfactory control performance particularly in the presence of a possible combination of time-varying uncertainties and conservatively designed controllers, which may compromise the learning mechanism, hence rendering the robustness issue of OILC far from well explored. This article intends to investigate the aforementioned issue by proposing a new OILC method resting upon the minimization of a dynamic upper bound on tracking error which is distilled from better exploitation of the time variation of uncertainties. We also show that the problem can be formulated in the framework of convex–concave game that can be efficiently solved by a subgradient method with an excellent balance of optimality and computation time. Such a formulation enables us to gain: 1) guaranteed monotonic convergence on tracking error; 2) remarkably reduced conservatism on controller synthesis; and 3) controllable computation complexity. It is further shown that the proposed method is capable of handling nonlinearity, for example Volterra system, a classic representation of nonlinear process. The efficacy of the method is verified by numerical experiments on a continuous stirred tank reactor model.},

Under the assumption that the communications among the vehicles are bidirectional and continuous, a synchronized path following strategy is proposed that regulates the speed of each vehicle along its path to reach consensus in relative position. Moreover, collision-free transient paths from the vehicle initial positions to a group of suitable selected positions along the desired paths are designed. Building on the backstepping technique, the proposed path following controller for each individual vehicle drives the quadcopter toward, and to stay within an arbitrarily small neighborhood of its corresponding desired path, achieving global uniformly ultimately boundedness. In addition, the devised controller guarantees that the actuations are bounded with respect to the position error. The controller is also made robust to external constant or slowly time-varying disturbances by the introduction of dynamic estimators for the disturbances. A projection operator is used to ensure that the estimates remain within the prescribed bounds and are sufficiently smooth to be backstepped. In order to validate the effectiveness and performance of the proposed methodology, we present and analyze both simulation and experimental results.},

This article presents an adaptive fuzzy controller based on the sliding-mode control theory. The proposed self-adaptive interval Type-2 fuzzy controller (SAF2C) is based on the Takagi–Sugeno (TS) fuzzy model and it accommodates the “enhanced iterative algorithm with stop condition” type-reducer, which is more computationally efficient than the “Kernel–Mendel” type-reduction algorithm. We developed an integrated multi-input–multi-output (MIMO) SAF2C-controller to reduce the computation time so that we can expedite the learning process of our control algorithm by 80\% compared to separate single-input–single-output (SISO) controllers. The stability of our controller is proven using the Lyapunov technique. To ensure the applicability of the presented control scheme, we implemented our controller on various nonlinear systems, including a hexacopter unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). We also compare the accuracy of our controller with a conventional proportional–integral–derivative autopilot system. Our research indicates around 20\% improvement in its transient response, in addition to achieving a better noise rejection capability with respect to a Type-1 fuzzy counterpart.},

These surgical devices are designed to navigate anatomical pathways via single-port access, such as natural orifices or minimal incisions and intraluminal interventions. With improved precision, spatial flexibility and dexterity, the robotic technology can enhance surgery such that minimally invasive flexible access would become a faster, safer, and more convenient method for intra-body interventions without multiple or wide incisions. However, a lot of works are still required for global acceptance of existing flexible robotic surgical platforms. This review provides extended insights on the design details of two types of flexible robotic systems used for endoscopic and endovascular procedures. As of today, several prototypes of both platforms have been proposed; however, their global acceptability and applicability remains very low. To address these, we present an extensive review on design constraints and control methods which are vital for safer, faster, and better operation of the flexible robotic systems in minimally invasive surgery (MIS).

In this article, a constrained adaptive backstepping control scheme is proposed for the quarter-car suspension with parameter uncertainties, in which the primary control objective is to stabilize the vertical motion of the vehicle body and the suspension mechanical structure constraint can be satisfied in the meanwhile, and energy analysis has been made to demonstrate the potential of energy regeneration and reducing energy consumption for the designed active suspension system. In terms of dealing with the hard constraint, a specific nonlinear filter is employed in order to integrate the main control objective and time-domain constraint into a single controlled variable. In addition, a barrier Lyapunov function is selected to make the defined controlled variable converge to zero and stay in the allowable limit, which means that the vertical motion of the vehicle body can be stabilized and the suspension deflection restriction will not be transgressed. Experiments are carried out on the active suspension test plant to verify the effectiveness of the designed control scheme. Since the high energy consumption of active actuators is one of the drawbacks to be overcome, the energy flow of the dc motors is analyzed in the latter part of this article so as to provide a theoretical basis for energy harvesting design in further study. Finally, the energy consumption of the active suspension plant in experiments is figured out and its potential of energy recovery is demonstrated in detail.},

  abstract     = {The control reliability of model predictive control is largely determined by the accuracy of the process model. The Hammerstein–Wiener (HW) model is an important nonlinear process modeling technique that has obtained great success in some process industries. Disturbances result in model mismatch and steady-state deviation, but little effort has been devoted to the coupling effects and inertial information in measured disturbances. In addition, few studies try to construct a disturbance observer (DO) to alleviate unmeasured disturbances. The present work proposes prompt disturbance rejection. First, a spatial–temporal long short-term memory-based measurable disturbance encoder is devised to analyze time-series information from measured disturbances and their coupling effects. The encoder can further clarify the status of inertial interference components and the disturbance intensity. Second, a DO is designed to estimate and attenuate unmeasured disturbances. Third, to create the new HW network, which is improved by integrating the disturbance encoder and observer differential, neural networks are used as nonlinear parts. Finally, a model predictive controller based on this improved model is constructed for real-time industrial process control. Simulation comparison experiments have demonstrated the superiority of the proposed methods. Real industry application in the country’s largest lead-zinc froth flotation plant in China validated the proposed model’s effectiveness in controlling chemical reagents.},

Hence, an effective spill coverage and removal strategy will play a significant role in environmental protection. In recent years, low-cost water surface robots have emerged as a solution, with their efficacy verified at small scale. However, practical limitations, such as connectivity, scalability, and sensing and operation ranges significantly impair their large-scale use. To circumvent these limitations, we propose a novel asymptotic boundary shrink control strategy that enables collective coverage of a spill by autonomous robots featuring customized operation ranges. For each robot, a novel controller is implemented that relies only on local vision sensors with limited vision range. Moreover, the distributedness of this strategy allows any number of robots to be employed without inter-robot collisions. Finally, features of this approach including the convergence of robot motion during boundary shrink control, spill clearance rate, and the capability to work under limited ranges of vision and wireless connectivity are validated through extensive experiments with simulation.},

Compared with the fixed value as a trigger condition, the dynamically changing thresholds as trigger conditions are more general and universal. The time-varying full-state constraint problem is solved by using the barrier Lyapunov function. In addition, the radial basis function neural networks are employed to approximate the unknown terms. Then, all signals in the resulted system are bounded, and the Zeno behavior can be avoided successfully. Moreover, all the system states satisfy their corresponding constraint condition.

  abstract     = {This article addresses the tracking control problem for a class of nonlinear systems described by Euler–Lagrange equations with uncertain system parameters. The proposed control scheme is capable of guaranteeing prescribed performance from two aspects: 1) a special parameter estimator with prescribed-performance properties is embedded in the control scheme. The estimator not only ensures the exponential convergence of the estimation errors under relaxed excitation conditions but also can restrict all estimates to predetermined bounds during the whole estimation process and 2) the proposed controller can strictly guarantee the user-defined performance specifications on tracking errors, including convergence rate, maximum overshoot, and residual set. More importantly, it has the optimizing ability for the tradeoff between performance and control cost. A state transformation method is employed to transform the constrained optimal tracking control problem to an unconstrained stationary optimal problem. Then, a critic-only adaptive dynamic programming algorithm is designed to approximate the solution of the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation and the corresponding optimal control policy. Uniformly ultimately bounded stability is guaranteed via a Lyapunov-based stability analysis. Finally, numerical simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.},

Currently, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, solid research on the most preferable viewing angle for obtaining numerical subjective evaluation scores has not been conducted. In this study, we investigate a metric that can be used to quantify the view of a 3-D human model, whose value is maximized at the most favorable camera angle in accordance with subjective assessments done by users. For an objective assessment in a numerical form, in this study, we define three view selection metrics: the 1) normalized limb length sum ; 2) normalized area of a two-dimensional bounding box ; and 3) normalized visible area of a 3-D bounding box . Finally, we formulate a viewpoint optimization problem whose objective function is the sum of the metrics. However, the objective function is nonconcave, and the solution set of the constraint is nonconvex. To overcome this difficulty, we employ decomposition and penalty methods. From the simulation results, it is verified that the average of the viewpoint selection error between the ground truth viewpoint and the optimal viewpoint obtained by the proposed algorithm is very close to the lower bound of the viewpoint selection error.},

However, improving the performance of palmprint recognition with insufficient training samples per person is still a challenging task.

In this article, by regularly sampling different local regions of the palmprint image, we learn complete and discriminative convolution features by using deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs). With this powerful palmprint description, a joint constrained least-square regression (JCLSR) framework, which performs representation for each local region of the same palmprint image requiring all regular local regions of the palmprint image to have similar projected target matrices, is presented to exploit the commonality of different patches. The proposed method can well solve the undersampling classification problem in palmprint recognition. Experiments were conducted on the IITD, CASIA, noisy IITD, and PolyU multispectral palmprint databases. It can be seen from the experimental results that the proposed JCLSR consistently outperformed the classical palmprint recognition methods and some subspace learning-based methods for palmprint recognition.},

A great deal of previous research has regarded community detection as an optimization process, where a variety of internal quality metrics are typically treated as objective functions, such as modularity ( ${Q}$ ) and weighted community clustering (WCC). However, purely optimizing a predefined quality metric probably results in an extreme unbalance in the scale of the detected communities, e.g., few giant communities with many very small communities. To reveal the true mesoscopic structure inside a big network under the suitable number of communities, we propose a novel community detection framework called LL-GMR, which is a local learning framework based on generalized metric with neighboring regularization. LL-GMR is qualified for both nonoverlapping and overlapping detection tasks. In LL-GMR, we propose a generalized representation and illustrate that it can be instantiated into 12 well-known internal quality metrics. When the generalized metric is used as an objective function, we encode node-level and community-level neighborhood information into two regularization terms to alleviate the dilemma of unbalanced communities. The experimental results show that our LL-GMR consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art community detection approaches in terms of discovering ground-truth communities in six real-life networks.},

It commonly relies on a nonconvex and bilinear optimization process, where the effects of first-order solvers maybe significantly reduced. Higher order solvers like a Newton-type method are expected to make a breakthrough; however, its computation efficiency and scalability are greatly limited due to the numerous parameters involved in a Hessian matrix. To address this issue, this article proposes an approach for assimilating second-order information for building NLFA-based recommenders. The key idea is an inner second-order solver that employs a Hessian-free method for avoiding the highly expensive manipulations of a Hessian matrix. Empirical studies on eight data cases emerging from real industrial applications indicate that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art models in prediction accuracy with affordable computational burden.},

The proposed TT-TJU methodology is composed of two key phases. During Phase I, it robustly computes a LOS; while during Phase II, it systematically computes a set of neighboring LOSs. A theoretical foundation is developed for the proposed TT-TJU methodology. The existence of an optimal solution is shown to be equivalent to the existence of a stable equilibrium point of a class of nonlinear dynamical system derived from the constrained optimization problem under study. From a computational viewpoint, Phase I is numerically implemented in a 3-stage procedure for fast and robust computation of an optimal solution. The second phase makes use of the TRUST-TECH methodology to lead the search away from a computed optimal solution and continue to deterministically compute neighboring LOSs. The proposed methodology has been evaluated on an illustrative bivariate example and a benchmark problem with 110 variables and 55 constraints with promising results.},

A static control is first adopted to retain the steady-state tracking response, while an optimal control derived via the ADP method is proposed to regulate the tracking error by minimizing a cost function. A critic NN is then trained online to obtain the solution of the associated Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equation. The learning of the identifier NN and critic NN is performed online simultaneously by tailoring a novel adaptation method, which can guarantee the convergence of the estimated NN weights. Consequently, the critic NN can be used to construct the optimal control policy directly, such that the actor NN used in the previous ADP schemes is avoided. Simulations are performed to verify the suggested control, and experiments on a helicopter plant are carried out to show its feasibility and improved control response.},

Here, removing the reduced order method, the stabilization of delayed IMNNs is directly studied under the framework of the second-order system. To decrease control cost, the aperiodically intermittent control strategy is adopted. This strategy implies that work time (with control input) alternates with rest time (without control input), and every work or rest width may be different. By constructing a suitable Lyapunov functional, some algebraic criteria are achieved to guarantee the stabilization of the considered system. Note that the obtained control gains are often larger than practical needs due to the conservatism deriving from inevitable inequality scaling. For further saving control resources, an intermittent adaptive control strategy is applied to stabilize the delayed IMNNs.

At the same time, we adapted the concept of densely connected mechanism in the proposed network architecture to reuse features and prevent gradient disappearance. Therefore, the model acquires two convincing advantages: first, our model preserves the maximum information flow and has a much faster convergence rate. Second, our model avoids overfitting even if training with limited data. The experimental dataset contains 1189 left-hand $X$ -ray scans of children and teenagers. The proposed method achieves 85.27\% and 91.68\% for radius and ulna classification, respectively. Extensive experiments prove that our model performs better than using other network structures.},

  abstract     = {Catastrophic forgetting is a chronic problem during the online training process of deep neural networks. That is, once a new data set is used to train an existing neural network, the network will lose the ability to recognize the original data set. In literature, online contrastive divergence (CD) with generative replay (GR) exploits the generative capacity of the neural network to facilitate online training. It greatly alleviates catastrophic forgetting but cannot totally eliminate it. To overcome this shortcoming and further solve the challenging issue, in this article, we propose a novel approach named asynchronous dual-channel online restricted Boltzmann machine, where online CD with dual-channel GR plays an important role in further eliminating catastrophic forgetting. The asynchronous gradient estimation, by which the Markov chain sampling and the network calculation are conducted asynchronously on separate computing nodes, is designed to speed up training. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms several algorithms in increasing training speed and minimizing catastrophic forgetting. Besides, online learning with dual-channel can be effectively extended to other online learning neural networks with GR and has achieved excellent results in our verification experiments.},

  abstract     = {For many application scenarios where raw and even multidomain training data can be easily collected, and at the same time, validation data (as ground-truth data) are available, it becomes naturally desirable for us to perform an enhanced classification/prediction on only validation data with the appropriate leverage of training data. In this article, a novel ensemble framework EP-TSK-FK of Takagi–Sugeno–Kang (TSK) fuzzy subclassifiers, is proposed to achieve the following distinctive characteristics: 1) each interpretable TSK fuzzy subclassifier on each training subset can be quickly built in parallel such that its outputs provide the values of the corresponding augmented features of the original validation data space; 2) as a novel ensemble method of fuzzy subclassifiers, EP-TSK-FK trains all the interpretable TSK fuzzy subclassifiers only once and does not explicitly reuse them while predicting a testing sample, which thereby reduces the computational complexity of the ensemble process for prediction; 3) after running the proposed iterative fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm iterative fuzzy C-means clustering (IFCM) on the augmented validation data to obtain the representative centroids, the fast classification/prediction of EP-TSK-FK on the testing samples is realized by using the $k$ -nearest neighbor (KNN) method on the representative centroids with the original features; and 4) enhanced classification performance by the IFCM &amp; KNN method is theoretically revealed, and the experimental results on the benchmarking datasets indicate the effectiveness of EP-TSK-FK and its parallel learning method in the sense of enhanced classification performance, running time, and interpretability.},

  abstract     = {Time-varying matrix reciprocal problems are widely appeared in different matrix computations and engineering fields. Neural networks as a powerful tool have been developed to solve the time-varying problems. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are designed considering mainly for two aspects: 1) convergent precision and 2) convergent time. The core part of the existed neural methods is to design various kinds of activation function for time-varying matrix solving. However, most of the activation functions of neural networks are with infinite value, which demands long convergent time and are not applicable in practical engineering fields. This note proposes theoretical analyses and simulation results on the performance of terminal RNN (TRNN) and accelerated TRNN (ATRNN) with finite-time convergence, which is not only designed for constant matrix inversions but also for time-varying reciprocal matrix. Compared to the traditional RNNs, TRNNs are of limit-valued activation function and possess a finite time convergence property. The simulation results for time-varying reciprocal solving validate the perfect performance solved by TRNN and ATRNN. In addition, a quadratic program (QP) of velocity minimization based on TRNN is proposed to solve the trajectory tracking problems without considering the initial position error of the redundant manipulators. Finally, practical experiments of the redundant manipulators based on PUMA560 show the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed approaches.},

Then, all followers in the system work cooperatively to estimate the full state of the leader. By using parameterized Riccati equation and output regulation theory, sufficient conditions are given to design the distributed observers and the output consensus protocol.

First, a system identification technique based on neural networks (NNs) is adopted to identify completely unknown systems. Second, a critic NN is employed to approximate the value function. A novel weight updating rule is developed based on the event-triggered control law and time-triggered disturbance law, which reduces controller execution times and guarantees the stability of the system. Subsequently, concurrent learning is applied to the weight updating rule to relax the demand for the traditional persistence of excitation condition that is difficult to implement online.

Resilient cluster censoring strategies are proposed to ensure cluster consensus against locally bounded Byzantine nodes in a purely distributed manner, where neither the number/identity of Byzantine nodes nor the division of clusters is assumed. We do not require complicated algebraic conditions or any balance conditions over intercluster structures, distinguishing the current work from previous results on cluster consensus problems besides a fortiori the attack-tolerant feature. Sufficient conditions are established in all the three scenarios based on the graph robustness. Furthermore, we solve the heterogenous cluster robustness problems and resilient scaled cluster consensus problems as extensions.

Compared with the popular deep learning structures, such as deep neural networks, BLS has the ability of rapid incremental learning and can remodel the system without the usual tedious retraining process. However, given that BLS is still in its infancy, it still needs analysis, improvements, and verification. In this article, we first analyze the principle of fast incremental learning ability of BLS in depth. Second, in order to provide an in-depth analysis of the BLS structure, according to the novel structure design concept of deep neural networks, we present four brand-new BLS variant networks and their incremental realizations. Third, based on our analysis of the effect of feature nodes and enhancement nodes, a new BLS structure with a semantic feature extraction layer has been proposed, which is called SFEBLS. The experimental results show that SFEBLS and its variants can increase the accuracy rate on the NORB dataset 6.18\%, Fashion-MNIST dataset by 3.15\%, ORL data by 5.00\%, street view house number dataset by 12.88\%, and CIFAR-10 dataset by 18.42\%, respectively, and the four brand-new BLS variant networks also obviously outperform the original BLS.},

  abstract     = {Powered by virtualization, the cloud computing has brought good merits of cost effective and on-demand resource sharing among many users. On the other hand, cloud users face security risks from co-residence attacks when using this virtualized platform. Particularly, a malicious attacker may create side channels to steal data from a target user’s virtual machine (VM) that co-resides with the attacker’s VM on the same physical server. This article models a cloud service undergoing the co-residence data theft attacks. The threshold-voting-based ${N}$ -version programming (NVP) is implemented to improve the service reliability, where multiple service component versions (SCVs) are activated in parallel to perform the requested service. The final output is determined upon receiving a threshold number of identical outputs from the SCVs, immediately followed by canceling all outstanding SCVs to reduce expenses. Probabilistic models are first introduced to evaluate performance metrics of the considered service, including the data theft probability, service success probability, expected service operation time, and expected utility. Optimization problems are further solved to find the optimal number of SCVs maximizing the expected utility. Interactions among different model parameters and VM allocation policies, as well as their effects on the considered performance metrics and on the optimization solutions are studied through examples.},

It uses the target-induced change in the received signal strength (RSS) of the wireless links to locate the target. It is useful for the applications in security monitoring and emergency rescue. However, it is difficult for the existing RSS-based DFL algorithms to acquire a high localization accuracy and a low computational complexity simultaneously. To address this issue, a novel hierarchic radio imaging (HRI)-based DFL algorithm is proposed in this article. The algorithm groups the wireless links according to the length of links and assigns a priority to each link group. Furthermore, a grid normalized model is proposed to calculate the grid values, and then a square human model is used to locate the target. In addition, in order to reduce the computational complexity, the location information of the target at the previous moment is used to limit the regional range of the target location. Extensive experiments are conducted with results showing that the HRI algorithm not only greatly reduces the computational complexity but also achieves high localization accuracy and high localization stability. Therefore, the HRI algorithm is very suitable for the real-time-based applications.},

To begin with, this article proposes multimode function synchronization by the mathematical expression for the first time, which is a generalization of exponential synchronization, power-rate synchronization, logarithmical synchronization, and so on. Moreover, two adaptive controllers are designed to achieve robust multimode function synchronization of memristive neural networks (MNNs) with mismatched parameters and uncertain parameters. Each adaptive controller includes function $r(t)$ and update gain $\sigma $ . By choosing different types of $r(t)$ , multiple types of complete synchronization, including power-rate synchronization and exponential synchronization can be obtained. And update gain $\sigma $ can be used to adjust the speed of synchronization. Therefore, our results enlarge and strengthen the existing results.

  abstract     = {Sensor drift is one of the severe issues that gas sensors suffer from. To alleviate the sensor drift problem, a gas sensor drift compensation approach is proposed based on local discriminant subspace projection (LDSP). The proposed approach aims to find a subspace to reduce the distribution difference between two domains, i.e., the source and target domain. Similar to domain regularized component analysis (DRCA) which is a recently proposed sensor drift correction method, the mean distribution discrepancy is minimized in the common subspace in our approach. LDSP extends DRCA in two aspects, i.e., it not only takes the label information of the source data into consideration to reduce the possibility of the case that samples in the subspace with different class labels stay close to each other, but also borrows the idea of locality-preserving projection to deal with multimodal data. Specifically, inspired by local Fisher discriminant analysis (LFDA), the label information is utilized to maximize the local between-class variance of source data in the latent common subspace and simultaneously minimize the local within-class variance. The formulation of LDSP is a generalized eigenvalue problem that can be readily solved. The experimental results have shown the proposed method outperforms other gas sensor drift compensation methods in terms of classification accuracy on two public gas sensor drift datasets.},

A novel pull-based event-triggered protocol combined with aperiodic sampled-data mechanism is first presented, where each agent merely updates controller at its own triggering instants. Under the proposed control protocols, the information is only exchanged and calculated at the aperiodic sampling instants, therefore, it can reduce communication congestion and save computing resources. Furthermore, the Zeno behavior is naturally excluded because the trigger instants are in the set of aperiodic sampled instants. By virtue of the algebraic graph theory and Lyapunov stability analysis, it is shown that the active leaders can reach their desired states predefined arbitrarily and all followers are driven to the convex hull formed by the leaders. Finally, an illustrative example is given to validate the theoretical results and emphasize the advantages of the proposed protocols.},

The proposed CFCC framework is designed for fleets to reduce the recovery time to get the intended speed back after sudden braking, which can improve the driving efficiency of fleets. In addition, CFCC can determine the critical safety spaces of car following and lane changing for fleet vehicles to avoid the accident of rear-end and side collisions due to emergency braking. Furthermore, fleet lane changing can be coordinated between fleet vehicles in the original lane and neighboring vehicles in the target lane for ensuring safety and improving efficiency. According to our review of relevant research, CFCC is the first fleet cruise control system to provide the following features: 1) extending the car following risk of individual vehicles to the fleet following risk of fleet vehicles; 2) minimizing the acceleration and deceleration of fleet vehicles to reduce the speed recovery time; and 3) coordinating individual cars and fleet vehicles to provide the sufficient lane changing space as soon as possible. Simulation results show that our framework outperforms existing car following and lane changing methods and can significantly improve the driving safety and recovery efficiency of fleets as emergency events occur.},

Especially, a resource redistribution process is explored in the user–object network that gives mass diffusion a higher recommendation accuracy and heat conduct a greater diversity by considering the social degree of users whilst calculating the user degree in the network. A tuning parameter is introduced to adjust the weight of resources that the objects finally receives from users based on their social relationships.

  abstract     = {Social Networks represent a cornerstone of our daily life, where the so-called social reviewing systems (SRSs) play a key role in our daily lives and are used to access data typically in the form of reviews. Due to their importance, social networks must be trustworthy and secure, so that their shared information can be used by the people without any concerns, and must be protected against possible attacks and misuses. One of the most critical attacks against the reputation system is represented by mendacious reviews. As this kind of attacks can be conducted by legitimate users of the network, a particularly powerful solution is to exploit trust management, by assigning a trust degree to users, so that people can weigh the gathered data based on such trust degrees. Trust management within the context of SRSs is particularly challenging, as determining incorrect behaviors is subjective and hard to be fully automatized. Several attempts in the current literature have been proposed; however, such an issue is still far from been completely resolved. In this study, we propose a solution against mendacious reviews that combines fuzzy logic and the theory of evidence by modeling trust management as a multicriteria multiexpert decision making and exploiting the novel concept of time-dependent and content-dependent crown consensus. We empirically proved that our approach outperforms the main related works approaches, also in dealing with sockpuppet attacks.},

As an important data structure, graphs are widely used in IIoT applications, where entities and their relationships can be expressed in the form of graphs. With the widespread adoption of IIoT and cloud computing, an increasing number of individuals or organizations are outsourcing their IIoT graph data to cloud servers to enjoy the unlimited storage space and fast computing service. To protect the privacy of graph data, graphs are usually encrypted before being outsourced. In this article, we propose a search pattern privacy system for approximate shortest distance query of encrypted graphs in IIoT. To realize search pattern privacy, we adopt two noncolluded cloud servers to accomplish different tasks. We leverage the first server to store the encrypted data and perform query operations, and use the second one to rerandomize the contents and shuffle the locations of the queried records. Before queries, we generate the trapdoors by using different random numbers. After queries, we ask the second server to rerandomize the contents of the records that the first server touched. In addition, we shuffle the physical locations of original records by inserting some fake records. In this way, all contents and physical locations of the touched records change, so that the first server cannot distinguish whether two queries are the same or not. To enhance the efficiency on the user side, we further improve this system by moving some heavy workloads from the user to the cloud. The security analysis and the performance evaluation show that our work is secure and efficient.},

Several methods have been developed along this direction, such as methods that combine neighborhood constraints and the modified Banker’s algorithm, as well as methods based on critical places. To explore their effectiveness and performance, we not only conduct a comparison investigation but also develop new theoretical results. According to the experimental results, critical place-based approaches are simpler, more efficient, and more comprehensive than the Banker’s algorithm-based approaches in response to resource failures.

  abstract     = {Internet of Things (IoT) realizes the interconnection of heterogeneous devices by the technology of wireless and mobile communication. The data of target regions are collected by widely distributed sensing devices and transmitted to the processing center for aggregation and analysis as the basis of IoT. The quality of IoT services usually depends on the accuracy and integrity of data. However, due to the adverse environment or device defects, the collected data will be anomalous. Therefore, the effective method of anomaly detection is the crucial issue for guaranteeing service quality. Deep learning is one of the most concerned technology in recent years which realizes automatic feature extraction from raw data. In this article, the integrated model of the convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent autoencoder is proposed for anomaly detection. Simple combination of CNN and autoencoder cannot improve classification performance, especially, for time series. Therefore, we utilize the two-stage sliding window in data preprocessing to learn better representations. Based on the characteristics of the Yahoo Webscope S5 dataset, raw time series with anomalous points are extended to fixed-length sequences with normal or anomaly label via the first-stage sliding window. Then, each sequence is transformed into continuous time-dependent subsequences by another smaller sliding window. The preprocessing of the two-stage sliding window can be considered as low-level temporal feature extraction, and we empirically prove that the preprocessing of the two-stage sliding window will be useful for high-level feature extraction in the integrated model. After data preprocessing, spatial and temporal features are extracted in CNN and recurrent autoencoder for the classification in fully connected networks. Empiric results show that the proposed model has better performances on multiple classification metrics and achieves preferable effect on anomaly detection.},

  abstract     = {Passive electroencephalogram (EEG) brain–computer interfaces (BCI) have common usage in the area of Driver Drowsiness Detection. The approach presented herein identifies the cognitive state of the user while no mental action is required. Data recorded in EEG-based BCI experiments are generally noisy, nonstationary, and contaminated with artifacts that can deteriorate any analyzer’s performance. Recently, common spatial patterns (CSPs) have been adapted with EEG state-space incorporating spatiospectral optimization using fuzzy time delay (FTD-CSSP). Temporal phase disparity sequence (TPDS) is used to measure synchrony between EEG signals. The output of Linear transforms operating on the TPDS constitute useful features for EEG regression problems. On similar lines, this article proposes spatiospectral optimized fuzzy-independent phase-locking value (SSO-FIPLV) representations (exploiting the spatiospectral information from TPDS) for EEG signals to monitor a user’s cognitive states. Specifically, we analyze changes in EEG synchronization for a car driver as she/he drifts between alert and drowsy states. We use neural networks (NNs) for prediction. This article also proposes a cutting-edge method for training NN using the Euler–Lagrangian formulation. A stability proof is provided for the intended training approach alongside, and the performance is corroborated on the EEG reaction time prediction task, both within and across subjects, using a publicly available dataset. The NN trained by the proposed approach performs better than other competitive approaches in terms of minimizing root-mean-squared error and maximizing correlation coefficient. Channelwise feature importance in terms of average relevance values calculated from NN feature representations is visualized in the form of Topoplots using layerwise relevance propagation for regression.},

  abstract     = {Existing decision support system frameworks for diagnosing Parkinson’s disease (PD) through handwriting, speech, or gait characteristics share very similar pipelines. Although in some cases, patient data can be captured by commercially available devices, specialized devices or even custom-made prototypes are often required for such tasks. Captured data are used for extracting features that are carefully designed on the basis of domain and problem knowledge. These features are then fed to classifiers that provide a final decision. In this article, we present an approach in which end-to-end processing by a convolutional neural network (CNN) is utilized to diagnose PD from handwriting images, without the use of additional signals. This eliminates any need for specialized devices or feature engineering. To improve the performance of the proposed pretrained CNN, we propose the idea of multiple fine tuning to bridge the gap between semantically different source and target datasets and facilitate more efficient transfer learning. The proposed architecture, which is based on multiple fine tuning and an ensemble of multiple-fine-tuned CNNs, achieves 94.7\% accuracy in the classification of PD from offline handwriting.},

  abstract     = {Influenza poses a significant risk to public health, as evidenced by the 2009 H1N1 pandemic which caused up to 203 000 deaths worldwide. Predicting the spatiotemporal information of disease in the incubation period is crucial because the prime aim of it is to provide guidance on preparing a response and avoid presumably adverse impact caused by a pandemic. This article designs and analyzes a prediction system about influenza-like illness (ILI) from the latent temporal and spatial information. In this system 1) Gaussian function model and multivariate polynomial regression are employed to investigate the temporal and spatial distribution of ILI data; 2) the phase space reconstructed by delay-coordinate embedding is used to explore the dynamical evolution behavior of the 1-D ILI series; and 3) a dynamical radial basis function neural network (DRBFNN) method which is the kernel of the system, is proposed to predict the ILI values based on the correlations between the observations space and reconstructed phase space. The performance analysis of our system shows that the regression equations coupling with spatial distribution information can be used to supplement the missing data, and the proposed DRBFNN method can predict the trends of ILI for the following one year. Furthermore, the prediction system in this article applies a model-free control schemes, i.e., there are no restriction equations between the multivariable inputs and outputs. This prediction system is expected to be used in predicting the output signals, even the chaotic output signals, in meteorology, industry, medicine, economy, and other fields. An example of predicting the Standard &amp; Poors 500 index is given to introduce the application of our proposed system. The trend of open prices of the following eight trading days is well predicted.},

This article introduces a new deep learning-based multistep ahead approach to improve the forecasting performance of global horizontal irradiance (GHI). A deep convolutional long short-term memory is used to extract optimal features for accurate prediction of the GHI. The performance of such deep neural networks directly depends on their architectures. To deal with this problem, a swarm evolutionary optimization method, called the sine-cosine algorithm, is applied and advanced to automatically optimize the network architecture. A three-phase modification model is proposed to increase the diversity of population and avoid premature convergence in the optimization mechanism. The performance of the proposed method is investigated using three datasets collected from three solar stations in the east of the United States. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in comparison to other forecasting models.},

  abstract     = {In actual microgrids (MGs) networks, the information exchange between distributed energy resources (DERs) agents may be subject to various types of measurement noises and effected by communication time delays. This article proposes a resilient distributed multiagent control scheme for ac MG networks subject to additive noise and time-delay disturbances. The proposed multiagent control scheme is composed of three distributed consensus protocols, which is able to synchronize the output voltages and frequencies of inverter-based DERs to their reference values and achieve the optimal active power-sharing property by a low bandwidth communication network with noise and time-delay disturbances in almost sure convergence. By means of the stochastic analysis tools and algebraic graph theory, distributed consensus control protocols are designed to be employed for the secondary control level of MGs. On this basis, we deduce the stability criteria of the closed-loop MG system under noise and time-delay disturbances. As a result, the proposed consensus protocols can well restore the voltage and frequency’s derivation produced at the primary control level, meanwhile, can well achieve the optimal power sharing even though there exist communication disturbances. Several simulation scenarios on an islanded MG network are provided to verify the proposed control protocols’ performance.},

A dual-objective optimal energy operation model of WE is formulated with the consideration of economical benefit and security operation under different time scenarios. Due to the inaccurate model of distributed generation devices and loads, a multipolicy convex hull reinforcement learning (MCRL) algorithm is proposed. It can find the multiobjective strategy set with model-free feature. Moreover, considering the limitations of artificial intelligence technology and the human advantages in information processing for complex task, a two-channel Human-in-the-loop (HITL) method is designed to combine with MCRL to avoid decision-making risks. The one channel of HITL can evaluate the operation strategy by human under normal conditions so that the understanding of human for complex operating conditions can be incorporated into the machine learning algorithms to improve the confidence of intelligent systems. The other channel of HITL can allow human to participate in real-time adjustment under abnormal conditions to avoid system out of control. Simulation studies of modified EI are confirmed that the proposed algorithm can improve system performance effectively.},

  abstract     = {In smart grids, the large-scale integration of distributed renewable energy resources has enabled the provisioning of alternative sources of supply. Peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading among local households is becoming an emerging technique that benefits both energy prosumers and operators. Since conventional energy supply is still needed to help fill the gap between local demand and supply when the local solar generation is not sufficient, demand–response management will keep playing an important role in the future P2P energy market. Blockchain and smart contract technology has gained increasing attention in P2P trading for its secure operation. The performance of blockchain-based P2P energy trading still remains to be improved, in terms of latency and cost of computation resources. This article studies the challenges of demand–response management in P2P energy trading and proposes a blockchain-empowered energy trading system for a community-based P2P market. The proposed demand–response mechanism is developed using two noncooperative games, in which dynamic pricing is applied for suppliers. The proposed energy trading system is prototyped on a cluster network, with a coordinator running as a smart contract in a Hyperledger blockchain. We implemented both on-chain and off-chain processing modes to study the system performance. The results from experiments with our prototype indicate that our proposed demand–response games have a great effect on reducing the net peak load, and at the same time, the off-chain processing mode provides lower latency and overhead compared to the on-chain mode while still keeping the same system integrity as the on-chain mode.},

  abstract     = {Resilient distributed coordination control is studied on multiarea power systems with low inertia under hybrid attacks, including denial-of-service (DoS) attack and deception attack. The communication among various areas under the DoS attack is deteriorated to switching residual topologies whose time characteristic is modeled by model-dependent average dwell time (MDADT). Deception attack with malicious strategy targeting at negative feedback control is modeled by a sign function. To obtain resilience performance of the power system under low inertia and hybrid attacks, resilient distributed scheme combining load-frequency control (LFC) with virtual inertia control (VIC) is proposed. Then, resilient frequency control problem of the studied power system is converted to $H_{\infty }$ control of the switched nonlinear system. By employing the Lyapunov stability theory and switched system method, the resilient conditions are given by the lower bound of the average dwell time of each residual topology and the upper bound of deception attacks. Furthermore, a linear matrix inequality (LMI) technique is used to design the distributed resilient control gains of the LFC-VIC scheme. Finally, a simulation of four-area power systems is carried out to verify the validness of our theory.},
