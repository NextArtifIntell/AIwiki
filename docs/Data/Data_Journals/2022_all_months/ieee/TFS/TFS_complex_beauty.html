  abstract     = {Numeric models (including fuzzy models) produce numeric results. There are no ideal models that deliver a complete match with the data. In this study, we advocate that a way of evaluating the quality of models can be realized at the higher level of abstraction by developing a concept of granular prediction. In this way, modeling results are expressed in the form of information granules, in particular as intervals or fuzzy sets. The study formulates a general conceptual and algorithmically supported statement: a meaningful evaluation framework to assess the quality of numeric models is the one engaging information granules. This general observation comprises a special case commonly investigated in regression analysis, where the quality of numeric results is expressed via granular constructs, namely, confidence or prediction intervals. The original design of prediction information granules is formulated as an optimization problem, in which the criteria of coverage of data and specificity of granular results are considered. In the optimization process, we also engage some nonlinear transformation of the level of information granularity depending upon the value of the numeric result. The proposed development is model agnostic and can support a variety of modeling architectures; the experimental part of the study is focused on rule-based models. Further generalizations of prediction information granules are covered by involving granular parameters in the design process.},

For the first time, the variation bound of two adjacent time-variant Lyapunov matrices encountered in the synthesis of fuzzy observer is characterized by a contraction factor, and thus the key replacement of the lagged term is developed in order to construct an effective synchronization framework of fuzzy observer synthesis. Since there only exist the current-time normalized fuzzy weighting functions in the obtained synchronization framework, the conservatism caused by the mismatch of different sampling instants can be avoided. Based on this, a lightweight gain-scheduling law is designed in which a large number of redundancy gains in recent multiinstant observers can be condensed in order to save computing resource to the greatest extent. Finally, two benchmark examples are borrowed for validating the superiority of our proposed results.},

This framework allows us to obtain theoretical insight as well as algorithms on a general level and observe their special cases by choosing various types of parameterizations. This way, we study methods for automated reasoning with different types of if–then rules in a single framework that covers existing as well as novel types of rules. Our approach supports a large family of if–then rules, including fuzzy if–then rules with various types of semantics. The main results in this article include new observations on the syntactic inference of if–then rules, complete collections of rules, reduced normal forms of collections of rules, and automated reasoning methods.

  abstract     = {The consistency of interval-valued fuzzy preference relations (IFPRs) is a prerequisite for the application of IFPRs in real problems. To support the application of IFPRs, various types of consistency of IFPRs have been developed. They all satisfy some fixed mathematical conditions under the assumption that decision makers are perfectly rational. In practice, this assumption is usually violated because decision makers generally have bounded rationality. Considering the bounded rationality of decision makers, this article develops a new type of consistency of IFPRs called triangular bounded consistency, which is based on the historical preferences of decision makers. A triangular framework is designed to describe the three IFPRs of any three alternatives. The strict transitivity of IFPRs is defined as the restricted max-max transitivity of IFPRs, which is reconstructed in the triangular framework. In this situation, under the assumption that the preferences of a decision maker are consistent in similar circumstances, the triangular bounded consistency of IFPRs is defined by use of the historical IFPRs of decision makers. Based on the developed consistency, the process of determining the optimal estimations of missing IFPRs in an incomplete IFPR matrix is developed. A problem of selecting suppliers of simulation systems is analyzed using the multicriteria group decision-making (MCGDM) process with the triangular bounded consistency of IFPRs to demonstrate the application of the developed consistency in MCGDM.},

  abstract     = {The generation of collective preference assessments occupies a critical position in deriving accurate and reliable alternative rankings in the context of large-scale group decision making (LSGDM). In general, the collective opinion generation framework entails the following three phases, which are clustering analysis, weighting clusters, and preference aggregation. However, the clustering of experts has been frequently based on preference similarities among them without taking into account individual opinions in which knowledge elicitation plays a crucial role. The traditional collective opinion generation framework suffering from this drawback may result in unreliable decision outcomes. To this end, we propose an expertise-structure and risk-appetite-integrated two-tiered collective opinion generation framework to address this concern. The first tier of the two-tiered collective opinion generation framework divides the entire expert group into several subgroups based on individual expertise structures, which are extracted from hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set (HFLTS)-based preference assessments, and it then weighs the resulting clusters in accordance with the overall expertise levels. The second-tier clusters the first-tier subgroups conditioned on the indicator of individual assessment similarities and gathers the generated subgroup preference constructs in the use of the risk appetite-oriented power average operator. In addition, the notion of proportional HFLTSs was introduced to manifest collective evaluations in second-tier subgroups to eliminate information loss and distortion. The effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed collective opinion generation algorithm are eventually illustrated by a case study and a comparison analysis.},

  abstract     = {Classification algorithms have recently acquired great popularity due to their efficiency to generate models capable of solving high complexity problems. Specifically, black box models are the ones that offer the best results, since they greatly benefit from the enormous amount of data available to learn models in an increasingly accurate way. However, their main disadvantage compared to other simpler algorithms, e.g., decision trees, is the loss of interpretability for both the model and the individual classifications, which may become a major drawback because of the increasing number of applications where it is advisable and even compulsory to provide an explanation. A well-accepted practice is to build an explainable model that can mimic the behavior of the (more complex) classifier in the neighborhood of the instance to be explained. Nonetheless, the generation of explanations in such white box models is not trivial either, which has generated intense research. It is common to generate two types of explanations, factual explanations and counterfactual explanations, which complement each other to justify why the instance has been classified into a certain class or category. In this work, we propose the definition of factual and counterfactual explanations in the frame of fuzzy decision trees, where multiple branches can be fired at once. Our proposal is centered around the definition of factual explanations that can contain more than a single rule, in contrast to the current standard that is limited to considering a single rule as a factual explanation. Moreover, we introduce the idea of robust factual explanation. Finally, we provide procedures to obtain counterfactual explanations from the instance and also from a factual explanation.},

Thanks to this new belief structure, the proposed model can handle the interclass overlaps in a natural way and better capture the underlying multimodel structure of data streams in the form of prototypes. Utilizing data-driven soft thresholds, the proposed model self-organizes a set of prototype-based if – then fuzzy belief rules from data streams for classification, and its learning outcomes are practically meaningful. With no requirement of prior knowledge in the problem domain, the proposed model is capable of self-determining the appropriate level of granularity for rule-based construction, while enabling users to specify their preferences on the degree of fineness of its knowledge base.

A novel fractional differential inequality is established to estimate the settling time of the addressed system, which is more general and less conservative than the existing results. In addition, owing to the noncommutativity of multiplication of quaternions, the decomposition method is usually adopted to discuss the finite-time stabilization (FTS) of quaternion-valued neural networks, which inevitably doubles the dimensionality of the system and brings a great computational burden. To avoid the aforementioned issues, some new properties of the quaternion-valued signum function are presented for exploring the FTS of FQFNNs by the direct quaternion method without any decomposition. Then, 1-norm and 2-norm control strategies are designed to stabilize the addressed system in finite time, and several sufficient criteria are derived to ensure the FTS of FQFNNs. Finally, the validity of the obtained theoretical results and the superiority of the proposed estimation method are illustrated by numerical simulations.},

First, an adaptive hybrid fuzzy state observer and a serial-parallel estimation system are constructed to estimate the unmeasured system states and incorporate them into the control design scheme, respectively, where some appropriate fuzzy logic systems are introduced to approximate the unknown nonlinear functions. According to the dynamic surface control technique, the designed adaptive fuzzy control approach can surmount the deficiency of “complexity explosion.” Then, an observer-based adaptive event-triggered control algorithm is developed by constructing the Lyapunov–Krasovskii functionals and estimating the compounded disturbances. Furthermore, it is proved that under the drive of the reference signals, all the signals in the closed-loop system are semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded and Zeno behavior can be successfully excluded. Finally, an example with numerical simulations is utilized to exhibit the applicability of the obtained observer-based event-triggered adaptive fuzzy control approach.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning is a compelling technique for feature extraction due to its adaptive capacity of processing and providing deeper image information. However, for the task of leaf cultivar classification, the deep learning-based classifier model is unable to extract contour features of leaf images deeply due to the lack of large specialized datasets and expert knowledge annotations. Also, the scale/size of the current leaf cultivar dataset does not meet the needs of deep neural networks (DNNs). In particular, the high model complexity of DNNs implies that deep-learning-based neural networks seem to must require a large dataset to achieve good performance, but facing the fact that the leaf cultivar dataset often is small, even some classes in this kind of datasets contain less than ten images/examples. To overcome these problems and inspired by the resounding success of fuzzy logic, we propose a novel fuzzy ensemble model for leaf cultivar classification. To extract the contours of leaves, we first propose generative adversarial networks-based methods. Second, to improve the ability of feature representation, we present a data augmentation method to transform our contour features. Third, to get the essential features of leaves, we design a novel generation of the fuzzy random forest . Finally, to achieve accurate classification, we design a novel deep learning strategy, namely deep fuzzy representation learning , integrating and cascading a lot of our fuzzy random forests. Experimental results show that our model outperforms other existing state-of-the-arts on three real-world datasets, and performs much better than the original deep forest and DNN-based algorithms particularly.},

The main control issue is to design an adaptive fuzzy controller such that the system output follows the reference signal, meanwhile, all the state variables abide by their constrained requirements. Differing from the existing way to build barrier function, the constructed virtual control signal is employed to build the barrier function. Furthermore, a backstepping-based adaptive fuzzy control design process is presented in this article. Compared to the control schemes in the existing literature on full-state constrained systems, the current control scheme has the following advantages: 1) the built virtual control signals in this article are ensured to satisfy corresponding state constraints, rather than assuming that they do, as in the existing articles; 2) the choice of initial values is independent of the norm of the virtual control signal. So, the conservatism of initial value selection is considerably reduced. It is shown that the proposed adaptive fuzzy controller not only ensures perfect tracking performance, but also ensures that all the states abide by the preassigned state constraints during the operation. At last, simulation study further verifies the efficacy of the proposed control strategy.},

The system consists of four parts: human body segmentation, 3-D body voxel model construction, feature extraction, and classification. A region-dependent Gaussian mixture model with shadow removal is proposed for human body segmentation. The silhouette volume intersection method with computation speedup is then used to construct the 3-D body model using the segmented images from two cameras. After that, fuzzy 3-D body voxel features for posture classification are extracted from a minimum enclosed cube of the 3-D model. For classification, this article proposes an FC with soft margin minimization (FC-SMM) and its hierarchical structure to improve the classification performance. The consequent and antecedent parameters are optimized through a linear batch support vector machine and margin selective gradient descent algorithm, respectively. The FC-SMM also shows the advantage of model interpretability through visualization of the fuzzy rules. Experimental results of the comparison of different feature extraction methods and classifiers in different videos show the superiority of the proposed classification method.},

Based on those RDFs, Bustince et al. introduced a generalization of the Choquet integral (CI), called d-Choquet integral, where the authors replaced standard differences with RDFs, providing interesting theoretical results. Motivated by such worthy properties, joint with the excellent performance in applications of other generalizations of the CI (using its expanded form, mainly), this article introduces a generalization of the expanded form of the standard Choquet integral (X-CI) based on RDFs, which we named d-XC integrals. We present not only relevant theoretical results but also two examples of applications. We apply d-XC integrals in two problems in decision making, namely a supplier selection problem (which is a multicriteria decision-making problem) and a classification problem in signal processing, based on motor-imagery brain-computer interface (MI-BCI). We found that two d-XC integrals provided better results when compared to the original CI in the supplier selection problem. Besides that, one of the d-XC integrals performed better than any previous MI-BCI results obtained with this framework in the considered signal processing problem.},

  abstract     = {In real world, a typical decision-making problem in the medical field can be seen as an uncertain hesitant fuzzy multiattribute decision-making problem when existing experiences of decision-makers are insufficient. A three-way decision model is an effective tool to deal with uncertain decision-making problems, which can realize the classification of objects. However, different psychological behaviors of decision-makers are likely to affect decision-making results in actual decision-making processes. In order to address this challenge, we first propose a regret-theory-based three-way decision model in hesitant fuzzy environments, which mainly combines regret theory with hesitant fuzzy sets to calculate the perceived utility value of objects. Second, since one of the core ingredients for regret theory is the regret–rejoice function, we put forward a new regret–rejoice function that preserves the original indecisive uncertainty in hesitant fuzzy environments. In addition, according to the inherent relationship of the used data, this article provides a three-way classification method based on the preference ranking organization method for enrichment evaluations I method. Finally, the practicability, rationality, and superiority of the proposed method are shown via the case analysis and comparative analysis in the medical field.},

Different from most of the existing results on neural or fuzzy adaptive finite/fixed-time tracking control of switched systems, where the tracking error goes to a small neighborhood of the origin within finite time, the proposed one can ensure the output tracking error to reach user-defined accuracy within predefined time, which can be arbitrarily preassigned by the designers. Technically, based on the mode-dependent fuzzy state observer, an adaptive output-feedback predefined-time controller is constructed by incorporating a new state-scale transformation function into the barrier Lyapunov function, ensuring predefined transient behavior and tracking accuracy. Besides, by extending the adaptive control problem to the admissible edge-dependent average dwell time framework, the proposed adaptive control scheme can guarantee that all the closed-loop signals are bounded under switching signals with an admissible edge-dependent average dwell time property. It is less conservative than the average dwell time and mode-dependent average dwell time. Finally, two illustrative examples validate the performance of the method presented.},

However, the existing uncertainty in data and the computational demand of the granulation process make it difficult for these methods to accurately and efficiently achieve long-term prediction. In this article, a fuzzy-probabilistic prediction approach with evolving clustering-based granulation is proposed. First, the evolving clustering-based granulation strategy is proposed to transform the original numerical data into information granules. The granulation process is performed in an incremental way and the information granules are represented with the triplets, which can efficiently reduce the computation overhead. Then, the proposed information granule clustering is used to derive the group relations in the information granules. Based on the logical relationships of information granules in the temporal order, the information granule forecasting the integrated fuzzy and probability theory is proposed to deal with uncertainties and perform final long-term prediction. A series of experiments using publicly available time series are conducted, and the comparative analysis demonstrates that the proposed approach can achieve a better performance for regular and Big Data time series than the existing granular and numeric models for long-term prediction.},

We first use a very simple method to impute the missing values and generate multiple imputed versions of the data. These views are then clustered together to obtain a common partition matrix and a common set of centroids. As the clustering framework, we use a multiview version of the Fuzzy-c-Means (MVFCM) and a multiview version of Kernelized Fuzzy-c-Means (MVKFCM). To find the importance (weights) of different views, we use an entropic regularization term using the weights. After obtaining the optimal weights, the final imputation is done as a weighted sum (convex combination) of the imputed values used to generate the views. The final clustering is done on this imputed data set. We compare the performance of the proposed algorithms with several algorithms using Normalized Mutual Information, Adjusted Rand Index, and cluster accuracy on 12 benchmark data sets. Of these algorithms, the MVKFCM is found to perform the best. The MVFCM and MVKFCM use $5 \times r$ views, where $r$ is the number of classes (note that the class labels are not used). However, $r$ may not be known, and also for large $r$ , there will be too many views. So we propose two variants of MVKFCM: $MVKFCM_{FV}$ and $MVKFCM_{RFV}$ ( FV stands for a fixed number of views and RFV stands for a robust version with fixed views). The $MVKFCM_{RFV}$ generates views in a manner that helps to obtain robust performance. As expected, $MVKFCM_{RFV}$ is found to be the best performing algorithm.},

Early prediction of ADDIs has become an increasingly concerning task for the safety of pharmacotherapy during clinical treatments. In this article, we propose an adaptive regularized multiattribute fuzzy distance (MAFD) learning model for ADDI prediction. Unlike the existing works that only focus on whether an adverse interaction occurs or not for a specific drug pair and do not consider their implicit medication risks, MAFD employs fuzzy distance learning by designing a fuzzy membership matrix to model the adverse distance with a fuzziness level for exploring the medication risks of adverse drug pairs. Meanwhile, for each attribute, we develop two projection matrices to respectively map its original feature and adverse interaction spaces into a common space for eliminating noisy information and capturing their compact and informative representations. Besides, adaptive regularization is explicitly designed to investigate the underlying characteristics of different attributes in ADDI modeling and neighborhood structure preservation is seamlessly integrated to benefit the prediction results. The optimization problem is solved by an iterative algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers with detailed convergence proofs. Experiments on real-world dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of MAFD when compared with ten baselines and its five variants.},

The continuous event detection and triggering Zeno behavior are avoided via aperiodic sampling. Then, the time-dependent Lyapunov functional approach together with the dwell time technique is utilized, such that the estimation errors converge to zero exponentially. Furthermore, the observer-based fuzzy controllers are developed to ensure the solvability of the cooperative output regulation.

  abstract     = {Subjective evaluation is a commonly used method in the real recognition process. Generally, two fuzziness can be found in evaluation information, namely what values should be given to fully describe the information and how to distinguish different values. The recently developed probabilistic hesitant fuzzy set could perfectly address these issues. In this article, we propose a dual-fuzzy convolutional neural network (DF-CNN) by fusing the hot neural network algorithm into the probabilistic hesitant fuzzy environment and then using it in a practical handwritten image recognition process. For this new DF-CNN, we provide the whole calculation process including the forward propagation, backward propagation, and parameter updating calculations. Also, the optimization algorithm of the DF-CNN is given to derive its optimal results. Finally, we apply the DF-CNN and its optimization algorithm to deal with a real issue, namely the handwritten numeral image recognition. The calculation process and the comparison fully demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed new model and algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Large-scale multiagent reinforcement learning requires huge computation and space costs, and the too-long execution process makes it hard to train policies for agents. This work proposes a concept of fuzzy agent, which is a new paradigm for training homogeneous agents. Aiming at a lightweight and affordable reinforcement learning mechanism for large-scale homogeneous multiagent systems, we break the one-to-one correspondence between agent and policy, designing abstract agents as the substitute for the multiagent to interact with the environment. The Markov decision process models for these abstract agents are conducted by fuzzy logic, which also acts on the behavior mapping from abstract agent to entity. Specifically, just the abstract agents execute their policy at a time step, and the concrete behaviors are generated by simple matrix operations. The proposal has lower space and computation complexities because the number of abstract agents is far less than that of entities, and the coupling among agents is retained implicitly. Compared with other approximation and simplification methods, the proposed fuzzy agent not only greatly reduces required computing resources but also ensures the effectiveness of the learned policies. Several experiments are conducted to validate our method. The results show that the proposal outperforms the baseline methods, while it has satisfactory zero-shot and few-shot transfer abilities.},

  abstract     = {Real-world decision-making is based on human cognitive information, which is characterized by fuzziness and partial reliability. In order to better describe such information, Zadeh proposed the concept of Z-number. Ranking the Z-number is an indispensable step in solving the decision-making problem under the Z-number-based information. Golden rule representative value is a new concept introduced by Yager to rank interval values. This article expands it and proposes a new golden rule representative value for fuzzy numbers, and then, apply it to the ranking of the Z-number. Some new rules involving the centroid and fuzziness of fuzzy numbers are constructed to capture the preference of decision-makers. The Takagi–Sugeno–Kang fuzzy model is used to implement these rules. The obtained Rep function is used to construct a new golden rule representative value fuzzy subset of the Z-number and associate this new fuzzy subset with a scalar value. This fuzzy subset not only implies the fuzzy aspect of the Z-number but also contains the information in the hidden probability distribution. The scalar value is regarded as the golden rule representative value of the Z-number to participate in the ranking. The proposed method greatly retains the original information of the Z-number and can overcome the shortcomings of the existing methods. Some numerical examples are used to describe the specific process of the proposed method. The comparative analysis and discussion with existing methods clarify the advantages of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Monotonic classification is a common task in the field of multicriteria decision-making, in which features and decision obey a monotonic constraint. The dominance-based rough set theory is an important mathematical tool for knowledge acquisition in monotonic classification tasks (MCTs). However, existing dominance-based rough set models are very sensitive to noise information, and only a misclassified sample will lead to large errors in acquiring knowledge. This unstable phenomenon does not meet the requirements of practical applications. On the other hand, feature selection is supposedly an effective dimensionality reduction approach for classification tasks. In the real world, feature combinations with multiple correlations can often provide important classification information, where the multiple correlations include redundancy, complementarity, and interaction between features. To the best of our knowledge, most of the existing feature selection methods for MCTs only consider the relevance between features and decision, while ignoring the multiple correlations. To overcome these two drawbacks, in this article, we propose a robust fuzzy dominance rough set model, and develop a feature selection method that considers multiple correlations based on the robust model for MCTs. First, a soft fuzzy dominance rough set (SFDRS) with robustness is proposed. Second, a feature evaluation index considering multiple correlations is presented. Finally, a feature selection algorithm based on SFDRS is designed to select an optimal feature subset. Extensive experiments are conducted on 12 public datasets, and the results show that the SFDRS model has good robustness and the proposed feature selection algorithm has excellent classification performance.},

  abstract     = {One drawback of using the existing one-step forecasting models for long-term time series prediction is the cumulative errors caused by iterations. In order to overcome this shortcoming, this article proposes a trend-fuzzy-granulation-based adaptive fuzzy cognitive map (FCM) for long-term time series forecasting. Different from the original FCM-based forecasting models, a class of trend fuzzy information granules is built to represent the trend, fluctuation range, and trend persistence of various segments of time series, which are more instrumental and comprehensive than simple magnitude information. Thus, the proposed forecasting model is a granular model according to the form of its inputs and outputs. In an original FCM-based forecasting model, the causal relationships among concepts remain unchanged throughout the training of the whole dataset, however, in reality, the causal relationships may change with the state of concepts. Therefore, it is unreasonable to use the invariable causal relationships which often result in poor predictions. In view of this, we construct an adaptive FCM where different causal relationships are built to forecast concepts of different states. This is the first time to forecast trend fuzzy information granules using an adaptive FCM. Compared with the existing classical forecasting models, the proposed forecasting model achieves superior performance which is verified through a series of experimental studies.},

Especially, to reduce chattering and decrease energy consumptions on the premise of ensuring the stability of the system, an inequality is introduced to construct a continuous term which can replace the sign function.

  abstract     = {Uncertainties are widespread in real-world situations. In the existing studies, the uncertainties expressed by the agents engaged in a conflict situation have been extensively investigated. However, to what extent these agents can be trusted is often ignored and seldom taken into account. In this article, to manage these two sides of uncertainties, we propose a mathematical framework for multilevel conflict analysis from an outsider&#39;s perspective. Concretely, in order to indicate the analysis levels and manage the conflict situation with an extent-intent view, we resort to fuzzy formal concept analysis. At first, we explain what is multilevel data analysis. After that, based on fuzzy concept lattices, we present a general framework for multilevel conflict analysis and a method for computing the maximal coalitions and minimum conflict sets. And then, we describe how to update conflict analysis results when increasing analysis levels. Experimental analysis demonstrates that managing two sides of uncertainties can bring much more conflict resolution, and increasing analysis levels is helpful for postponing decision making and bringing more economical conflict resolutions. Finally, case studies are made to show the application of multilevel conflict analysis model and some interesting findings are obtained. Specifically, once the cost of increasing analysis levels is taken into consideration, it is interesting to choose the optimal analysis level for making the most economic decision. The main contribution of this study is the model of multilevel conflict analysis based on fuzzy concept lattices, which can incorporate the uncertainties of two sides.},

A novel auxiliary system, to tactfully establish a feedback mechanism between input saturation and prescribed performance, is constructed. By introducing the generated nonnegative modifications into the TPP, the resulted saturation-tolerant prescribed performance (SPP) is capable of flexibly degrading performance constraints in the case of saturation; and recovering back to the user-specified performance in the case without saturation. Furthermore, the proposed control scheme guarantees not only finite-time convergence, but also SPP-constrained tracking performance despite the input saturation and uncertainties.

Second, the delay-dependent T–S fuzzy state feedback controller is designed by employing the T–S fuzzy model. Third, the free-weighting matrices and delay-dependent Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional with multiple integral terms are employed to derive the delay-dependent exponential admissibility conditions and prescribed H-infinity performance is guaranteed.

The convex hull lemma is employed to convert the closed-loop system with saturation input into the closed-loop system without saturation input to enhance controller design flexibility. The Schur complement lemma and Gronwall Bellman lemma are employed to derive the less conservative delay-dependent stability conditions for determining controller gain matrices.

  abstract     = {The system nonlinearity, sensor saturation, and the uncertainty will hamper the analysis and affect the control performance. Filtering is a signal processing method which facilitates the system analysis and synthesis by signal estimation or noise suppression. To achieve generalized filtering problem for nonlinear systems with sensor saturations with lower computational burden, this article addresses the reduced-order extended dissipative filter design for nonlinear sensor-saturated system which is modeled by interval type-2 (IT2) T–S fuzzy system. For IT2 T–S fuzzy systems, the main challenge exists in the acquisition of the information in IT2 membership functions (MFs) for analysis and design. A membership-function-dependent (MFD) method is applied to capture the information of the MFs for reducing the conservativeness introduced by MFs not involved in the analysis. An extended dissipative filtering method, under imperfect premise matching (IPM) concept that the membership functions of the filter are different from those of the model, is proposed for sensor-saturated IT2 fuzzy systems. The proposed method has a high flexibility in parameters adjustment of both the filter and the design condition, including extended dissipative matrices, approximation MFs, and sensor saturation degree, one can freely choose the parameters according to the required performance of the fuzzy filter. A numerical example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the results.},

More importantly, a new kind of time-variant balanced matrix is introduced for the first time for adjusting positive/negative terms of different monomials in a more flexible way. As a result, the conservatism of resilient fuzzy stabilization can be further reduced even if the alert threshold condition becomes more difficult to be violated.

  abstract     = {Liang et al. in 2000 defined interval type-2 fuzzy sets (IT2FSs), which constitute a subset of type-2 fuzzy sets. While the membership degrees in the former are functions from [0, 1] to [0, 1] (fuzzy truth values), the membership degrees in IT2FSs only take their values in $\lbrace {\text{0}},{\text{1}}\rbrace$ . Although all the initial work on IT2FSs involved convex membership degrees only, in 2015, Bustince et al. began the study on IT2FSs in general, including certain sets with nonconvex membership degrees. However, these are obviously early stages, with a lot of open problems regarding the theoretical structure of IT2FSs. For example, as far as we know, no negation operator has been obtained in this context. Therefore, it seems appropriate to continue with the study started in previous papers, delving deeper into the properties and operations of IT2FSs. Consequently, this work studies the structure of the set of functions from [0, 1] to $\lbrace {\text{0}},{\text{1}}\rbrace$ (expanding the set considered by Bustince et al. ), from which we have removed the constant function $\mathbf{0}$ , to offer a different study to the one carried out by Walker and Walker. More specifically, we consider join and meet operations, partial order derived from each one, and the negation operators in that set. Among other results, we provide new characterizations of join and meet operations and of partial orders on the set of functions from [0, 1] to $ \lbrace {\text{0}},{\text{1}} \rbrace $ ; we also present the first negation operators on this set.},

The sensors of plant are divided into two groups according to engineering practice, where the individual sensor group transmits the measurements to the controller via a respective communication channel undergoing specific fading effects. Considering the complicated nature of the signal fading with the transmission channels, two stochastic models (i.e., the independent and identically distributed fading model and the Markov fading model) are simultaneously employed to describe the mixed fading effects of the two communication channels corresponding to the two sensor groups. The objective of this article is to design a nonfragile PID controller such that the closed-loop system is exponentially stable in mean square and extended stochastically dissipative. With the assistance of the Lyapunov stability theory and stochastic analysis method, sufficient conditions are obtained to analyze the system performance. Then, within the established theoretical framework, an iterative optimization algorithm is proposed to design the desired controller parameters by using the convex optimization technique. Finally, two simulation examples are given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control schemes.},

The access status of the sensor and actuator is described by two independent Markov chains. To deal with the complexity of two Markov chains on the control design, the mapping technique is used to generate a new variable obeying a Markov chain, which can simultaneously reflect the access status of the sensor and actuator. Furthermore, a scheduling signal-dependent fuzzy sliding mode controller is designed, and the MF-dependent sufficient conditions are given to ensure the stochastic stability of the controlled system and the reachability of the sliding surface. Besides, an optimization-based solving algorithm is proposed to search the sliding matrix and obtain the optimized control gains for reducing the energy consumption of control input.

Then, a novel stochastic Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional (LKF) is constructed in mode-dependent augmented form by taking full advantage of the variable characteristics related to the actual sampling pattern. At the same time, a membership function dependent $H_\infty$ performance index is introduced for the first time to attenuate the impact of disturbances on the closed-loop FMJS. Based on the novel $H_\infty$ performance index and LKF, new delay-dependent conditions are derived in the framework of linear matrix inequalities to ensure stochastic stability of the closed-loop system and its reachable set is bounded by an ellipsoid in the presence of bounded disturbances. Finally, two illustrated application problems validate theoretical results with less conservatism in the sense of enlarging the sampling period and minimizing the disturbance attenuation level.},

  abstract     = {Multiview clustering is an important topic in multiview learning, where the cooperation of different views is used to improve clustering performance. Although multiview clustering has made considerable progress, most existing methods only utilize the information of the original visible views, or only consider some hidden space information shared by different views. Two of the challenges are: 1) insufficient exploitation of cooperative learning between visible and hidden information despite some preliminary attempts, and 2) inadequate consideration of topological information for improving multiview clustering. To meet the challenges, we propose the cooperation enhanced multiview fuzzy clustering method (CE-MVFC) in this article. First, we characterize multiview data with two hidden views, which are obtained by adaptive multiview non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) and fuzzy partition information of each sample in different clusters. Then, we integrated the hidden views and the original visible views to realize visible-hidden cooperation learning. Furthermore, we establish a similarity matrix for each visible view and the hidden view obtained through NMF to describe the data topology in these views. Based on the spatial topological relationship of the samples and the representation of hidden view obtained by fuzzy partition, the network least absolute shrinkage and selection operator is constructed to constrain multiview learning. Finally, we develop the multiview clustering method by exploiting the visible-hidden information cooperation and the spatial topological information constraints. Experiments on benchmark multiview datasets are conducted to demonstrate the highly competitive performance of the proposed CE-MVFC against the state-of-the-art methods.},

First, the embedding area is composed of the edge and complex texture areas of images, according to the complexity-first rule. Edge detection is realized by an improved fuzzy enhancement function, optimized by the grey wolf optimizer to detect both the weak and strong edges. Second, the minimum average classification error rate is used to assess the choice of the complex texture areas. Third, under the spreading rule, two different average filters and one KerBohme filter are used to design the cost function in the embedding areas. Finally, confidential information is adaptively embedded through syndrome-trellis codes. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms seven classical adaptive image steganography algorithms on two steganalytic feature sets.

  abstract     = {In this article, we study the robust quantized feedback control problem for nonlinear discrete-time systems that are described by Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) fuzzy model with norm-bounded uncertainties. The dynamic quantizer composed of a dynamic parameter and a static quantizer is considered to quantize the control input signal. An improved two-step approach to design controller and dynamic quantizer for T–S fuzzy system is proposed based on the LMI technique. In the first step, a robust controller is designed to guarantee that the quantized fuzzy closed-loop system with norm-bounded uncertainties is asymptotically stable with prescribed $\mathcal {H}_{\infty }$ performance. Then, the parameter-dependent (membership function) scalar variable is obtained to determine the dynamic quantizer’s parameter in the second step. Finally, the simulation result of truck–trailer system is presented to validate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed two-step design approach.},

In control design,fuzzy logic systems (FLSs) are adopted to approximate the unknown nonlinear dynamics, and under the frameworks of adaptive backstepping recursive design and finite-time stability theory, an adaptive fuzzy finite-time consensus control method is developed. To save communication resources and reduce the numbers of controller execution times, a dynamic event-triggered mechanism with a relative threshold is established. Subsequently, an event-triggered-based finite-time fuzzy adaptive control scheme is formulated. Furthermore, by constructing novel integral-type Lyapunov functions and adding a power integrator technique, the finite-time stability of the closed-loop system and the convergence of consensus tracking errors are proved.

A new mode-dependent integral barrier Lyapunov function (MIBLF) can handle conservative feasibility conditions that only assure asymmetric full-state constraints and all subsystems share a common controller. To handle unknown input backlash nonlinearities in the presence of unknown nonconstant control gain function, fuzzy logic systems are utilized and a new parameterized smooth backlash inverse (PSBI) is presented. It is hard to construct the barrier Lyapunov function-based controller in the presence of unknown backlash, switching framework, and full-state constraints. By employing the fuzzy logic systems and the PSBI, a novel MIBLF-based adaptive fuzzy controller is presented to overcome this challenge. Furthermore, the presented controller not only prevents violation of all constrained states, but also ensures the boundedness of the closed-loop system. Eventually, feasibility of achieved theoretical results can be proven by two examples.},

  abstract     = {Feature selection is an important preprocessing step for high-dimensional data mining and machine learning; it is viewed as the selection of the optimal granularity to describe the target concept in rough set theory. Currently, research on rough sets mainly focuses on granularity selection in flat classification scenarios, while organizing hundreds of labels for hierarchical classification (HC) can provide additional external information and achieve better performance in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. However, HC also faces the following problems: 1) the current measures’ failure to characterize the uncertainty in HC; 2) the inability to select the optimal granularity of the target concept in HC; and 3) no valid approach to select features in a decision system with hierarchical classification (HieDS). To address these problems, this article introduces HC into rough set theory and proposes an approach to granularity selection for HC. First, we introduce the knowledge distance to reflect the uncertainty of HC and define related important characteristic functions to describe a HieDS. Then, from the perspective of uncertainty, granularity selection for the target concept and feature selection are presented based on these characteristic functions. Finally, we experimentally realize granularity selection and demonstrate excellent performance of feature selection in a HieDS in terms of both feature selection and classification accuracy.},

In contrast to the state of the art, the most distinguishing feature of our control design lies in avoiding using conventional recursive design methods (e.g., backstepping technique, dynamic surface control, etc.) and in not relying on full-state availability. In the velocity control loop, an asymmetric integral barrier Lyapunov function is adopted to confine velocity variable within a well-defined compact set all the time. In the altitude control loop, after utilizing its cascaded property and proposing a novel scaling function, the original constrained system is transformed to an unconstrained one, which facilitates the control design and stability analysis. Moreover, the proposed control algorithm only involves one fuzzy logic approximator as well as one fixed-time differentiator in the transformed system and guarantees that the tracking errors of velocity and altitude converge into the user-defined residual sets within fixed time. Several comparative simulations have been conducted to highlight the superiorities of the developed method.},

  abstract     = {Twin support vector machines (TSVMs) have been successfully employed for binary classification problems. With the advent of machine learning algorithms, data have proliferated and there is a need to handle or process large-scale data. TSVMs are not successful in handling large-scale data due to the following: 1) the optimization problem solved in the TSVM needs to calculate large matrix inverses, which makes it an ineffective choice for large-scale problems; 2) the empirical risk minimization principle is employed in the TSVM and, hence, may suffer due to overfitting; and 3) the Wolfe dual of TSVM formulation involves positive-semidefinite matrices, and hence, singularity issues need to be resolved manually. Keeping in view the aforementioned shortcomings, in this article, we propose a novel large-scale fuzzy least squares TSVM for class imbalance learning (LS-FLSTSVM-CIL). We formulate the LS-FLSTSVM-CIL such that the proposed optimization problem ensures that: 1) no matrix inversion is involved in the proposed LS-FLSTSVM-CIL formulation, which makes it an efficient choice for large-scale problems; 2) the structural risk minimization principle is implemented, which avoids the issues of overfitting and results in better performance; and 3) the Wolfe dual formulation of the proposed LS-FLSTSVM-CIL model involves positive-definite matrices. In addition, to resolve the issues of class imbalance, we assign fuzzy weights in the proposed LS-FLSTSVM-CIL to avoid bias in dominating the samples of class imbalance problems. To make it more feasible for large-scale problems, we use an iterative procedure known as the sequential minimization principle to solve the objective function of the proposed LS-FLSTSVM-CIL model. From the experimental results, one can see that the proposed LS-FLSTSVM-CIL demonstrates superior performance in comparison to baseline classifiers. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed LS-FLSTSVM-CIL on large-scale classification problems, we evaluate the classification models on the large-scale normally distributed clustered (NDC) dataset. To demonstrate the practical applications of the proposed LS-FLSTSVM-CIL model, we evaluate it for the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease and breast cancer disease. Evaluation on NDC datasets shows that the proposed LS-FLSTSVM-CIL has feasibility in large-scale problems as it is fast in comparison to the baseline classifiers.},

Second, a novel RPCFNN framework is designed to further enhance the ability to deal with uncertainty. Due to the added probabilistic estimation and dynamic fuzzy operator, the developed RPCFNN controller possesses superior nonlinearity handling capability. Meanwhile, the stability of RPCFNN is proved by the Lyapunov theory. Finally, active power filter is taken as the representative of nonlinear systems to verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method. Simulation and experimental results show that the novel RPCFNN controller has good steady-state and dynamic performance and has excellent robustness to deal with uncertain disturbances.},

The disturbance filter provides estimations of the state vector in the canonical model such that disturbances are represented as parameterized forms with exponentially decaying errors. The disturbance rejection can be converted into the adaptive control. Based on the adaptive vectorial fuzzy backstepping, the disturbance rejection formation controller is designed with the fuzzy logic systems approximating the model unknown dynamics. The adaptive robust control term attenuates fuzzy approximation errors. In contrast to the existing results, the adaptive fuzzy disturbance rejection formation control realizes the estimation and rejection for unknown frequency disturbances without requiring the a priori knowledge of model dynamics.

And, the LKF is augmented by considering more features of the second-order Bessel–Legendre inequality (BLI). Then, the second-order BLI and the generalized reciprocally convex matrix inequality are employed to dispose the derivative of the LKF, where the $d^{2}(t)$ -dependent term exists. Meanwhile, by setting an adjustable parameter, the $d^{2}(t)$ -dependent term of the condition is handled by a relaxed quadratic function negative-determination condition. As a result, a less conservative admissibility criterion for T–S FSSs is obtained. And, the relationship between the conservatism and the numerical burden is better considered.

We design an interaction mechanism between trust and consensus based on the dynamic experts’ influence which is computed by the multiplex PageRank centrality measure, especially focusing on the negative impact of trust on consensus. Besides, we compute consensus levels based on the density and intensity of CENs to determine when should the negotiation end. The proposed model can not only consider the mutual influence between trust and consensus in SNGDM, but also detect and analyze the negative influence of trust on consensus. An example examines the effectiveness of the proposed model and a comparative analysis shows its flexibility for studying the complex consensus situation of SNGDM.},

  abstract     = {This article addresses the stabilization of the nonlinear reaction–diffusion equation with an unknown but bounded delay. Based on Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) fuzzy rules, a T–S fuzzy partial differential equation (PDE) model is constructed to describe the nonlinear distributed parameter system. More importantly, we contribute to the large delay compensation and the future state prediction by introducing a chain of subpredictors for the T–S fuzzy PDE model, and the convergence of observation errors is guaranteed as well. Different from the conventional approaches, the proposed observer can compensate a larger delay. To stabilize the system, for the first time, a new subpredictor-based T–S fuzzy control law is suggested by using the proposed observer, which is composed of elementary observers connected in series. The implementation of the subpredictor feedback is simpler than the classical methods that only one of the elementary observers is employed. Via Lyapunov–Krasovskii approach, sufficient exponential stability conditions are established in the framework of linear matrix inequalities. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of theoretical results.},

The proposed variant does not use backpropagation and grid partitioning, but the least-squares method with fractional Tikhonov regularization. The fractional regularization is a generalization of the standard regularization and is applied here to the learning process of the ANFIS scheme for the first time. This results in a simpler rule base, with a low number of rules, allowing to handle problems with many input variables with relatively low computational time while keeping high accuracy. We present new theoretical results on the fractional Tikhonov regularization. Such results are the basis for a formal discussion on how much the choice of a different architecture, resulting in a different matrix in the least-squares minimization, could affect the accuracy. We perform several numerical experiments on benchmark examples, first to assess the impact of the fractional regularization on the accuracy and then to compare our results against the most recent ones reported in the literature by other ANFIS-like or neuro-fuzzy systems. The numerical results show the good performance of the proposed approach.},

The interconnection of the overall system is completely compensated via the cyclic-small-gain condition theorem, and the small-gain theorem is introduced to overcome the unmodeled dynamics in each subsystem. Furthermore, assumptions from prior literature are relaxed, and computing burden is reduced through the design of less adaptive laws. This article proves that under the designed control scheme, the closed-loop systems are controlled to be input-to-state practically stable and that all signals are guaranteed to be semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded.

An adaptive event-triggered scheme is introduced to bring down the costs of the communication network from the system to the fuzzy fault detection filter (FDF), in which the triggering parameter can be adaptively tuned with the system dynamics. A hidden Markov model (HMM) is employed to characterize the asynchronous phenomenon between the system and the FDF. Unlike the existing results, the transition probabilities of the plant and the FDF are allowed to be partially known.

This article proposes an SLA violation risk mitigation model that uses ordered weighted average (OWA) in long short-term memory for complex QoS prediction. The OWA operator is weighted with a minimax disparity approach to manage the risk of SLA violation. The approach intelligently predicts deviation in custom prioritized QoS parameter and recommend exigency of mitigating action by considering all possible attitudinal behavior of the service provider.

However, the existing literature exposes some shortcomings: 1) incapability of quantifying and analyzing the leaked information through side channels of the intelligent IoT and 2) inability to devise efficient and accurate SCA algorithms. To address these challenges, we propose a side-channel fuzzy analysis-empowered AI model extraction attack in the intelligent IoT. First, the integrated AI model extraction framework is proposed, including power trace-based structure, execution time-based metaparameters, and hierarchical weight extractions. Then, we develop the information theory-based analysis for the AI model extraction via SCA. We derive a mutual information-enabled quantification method, theoretical lower/upper bounds of information leakage, and the minimum number of attack queries to obtain accurate weights. Furthermore, a fuzzy gray correlation-based multiple-microspace parallel SCA algorithm is proposed to extract model weights in the intelligent IoT. Based on the established information-theoretic analysis model, the proposed fuzzy gray correlation-based SCA algorithm obtains high-precision AI weights. Experimental results, consisting of simulation and real-world experiments, verify that the developed analysis method with the information-theoretic perspective is feasible and demonstrate that the designed fuzzy gray correlation-based SCA algorithm is effective for AI model extraction.},

Therefore, this article studies the scheduling strategy of multiple mobile sinks and proposes a heuristic strategy based on interval type-2 fuzzy rough neural network. The energy and lifetime of sensor nodes, as well as location information of the mobile sink and special nodes are taken as input features. Through neural network learning, the outputs determine whether to move, moving direction, moving distance, and residence time, which can complete the scheduling task. The scheduling problem is regarded as a multiobjective optimization problem, and the network lifetime, the moving path length, and the network interpretability are optimized at the same time, so as to obtain a lightweight network with good interpretability and performance. Based on the parallel multiobjective evolutionary algorithm, a multiobjective neural evolutionary framework is constructed. This framework can balance multiple objectives and complete complex scheduling tasks. Compared with static sinks, random-moving sinks, sinks with manually designed strategy, gene expression programming-based sinks, as well as the other state-of-the-art multiobjective evolutionary algorithms, the proposed framework can achieve superior results.},

  abstract     = {Cyber-physical systems (CPS) consist of a variety of multicore architectures, including central processing units (CPU) and graphical processing units (GPU). In general, programmers assign sequential programs to the CPU while parallel applications are assigned to the GPU. This article provides a method for mapping an OpenCL application to a heterogeneous multicore architecture using active fuzzy learning to determine the adequacy and processing capabilities of the application. During learning, subsamples are created by developing a machine learning-based device suitability classifier that predicts which processors would have excessive computational compatibility for running OpenCL programs. In addition, this study integrates an active learning model based on entropy with a fuzzification model to find nonoverlapping patterns. To minimize rule generation, the fuzzification-based weighted probabilistic technique is presented. The defuzzification process is optimized by using uncertainty values in conjunction with classification probability. In addition, 20 different features are proposed for extraction using the newly developed LLVM-based static analyzer. The correlation analysis approach is used to determine the optimal subset of features. The synthetic minority oversampling approach with and without feature selection is used to differentiate the class imbalance problem. Instead of manually modifying the machine learning classifier, a tree-based pipeline construction approach is used to determine the optimal classifier and associated hyperparameters. Experiments are then conducted on a set of benchmarks to verify the performance of the designed model. The results show that by increasing the number of training examples and including an entropy uncertainty measure, the proposed model is able to support and improve decision boundaries. We achieved a high F-measure of 0.77 and a ROC of 0.92 by optimizing and reducing the feature subsets.},

Despite the efforts on feature engineering and classification backend designing, established intrusion detection systems sometimes lack robustness and are inflexible against the shift of the traffic distribution. To deal with these disadvantages, we design a fuzzy system for the online defense of IoT. Our framework incorporates a full Bayesian possibilistic clustering module for feature processing and an ensemble module motivated by reinforcement learning and adaptive boosting that dynamically fits the streaming data. The proposed clustering module overcomes the issue of determining the number of clusters and can dynamically identify new patterns. The classifier backend combines a collection of fuzzy decision trees that provide readable decision boundaries. The ensembled classifiers can accommodate the drift of data distribution to optimize the long-time performance. Our proposal is tested on settings including one dataset collected from real IoT systems and is compared to numerous competitors.

  abstract     = {The development of the Internet of vehicles (IoV) has spawned a series of driving assistance services (e.g., collision warning), which improves the safety and intelligence of transportation. In IoV, the driving assistance services need to be met in time due to the rapid speed of vehicles. By introducing edge computing into the IoV, the insufficiency of local computation resources in vehicles is improved, providing high quality services for users. Nevertheless, the resources provided by edge servers are often limited, which fail to meet all the needs of users in IoV simultaneously. Thereby, how to minimize the tasks processing latency of users in the case of limited edge server resources is still a challenge. To handle the above problem, a task offloading scheme fuzzy-task-offloading-and-resource-allocation (F-TORA) based on Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy neural network (T–S FNN) and game theory is designed. Primarily, the cloud server predicts the future traffic flow of each section through T–S FNN and transmits the prediction results to the roadside units (RSUs). Then, the RSU adjusts the current load based on the captured future traffic flow data. After the load balancing of each RSU, the optimal task offloading strategy is determined for the users by game theory. Following, the edge server acts as an agent to allocate computing resources for the offloaded tasks by $Q$ -learning algorithm. Finally, the robust performance of the proposed method is validated by comparative experiments.},

  abstract     = {Despite massive research in deep learning, the human activity recognition (HAR) domain still suffers from key challenges in terms of accurate classification and detection. The core idea behind recognizing activities accurately is to assist Internet-of-things (IoT) enabled smart surveillance systems. Thereby, this work is based on the joint use of discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and recurrent neural network (RNN) to classify and detect human activities accurately. Recent approaches on HAR exploit the three-dimensional (3-D) convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract spatial information, which adds a computational burden. In our case, features are extracted using 3D-DWT instead of 3-D CNNs, performed in three steps of 1D-DWT to reflect the spatio-temporal features of human action. Given the features, the RNN produces an output label for each video clip taking care of the long-term temporal consistency among close predictions in the output sequence. It is noticed that feature extraction through 3D-DWT essentially recovers the multiple angles of an activity. Many HAR techniques distinguish an activity based on the posture of an image frame rather than learning the transitional relationship between postures in the temporal sequence, resulting in degraded accuracy. To address this problem, in this article, we designed a novel rank-based fuzzy approach that segregates activities precisely by ranking the probabilities of activities based on confidence scores. FuzzyAct achieved an average mean average precision (mAP) of 0.8012 mAP on the ActivityNet dataset, and outperformed the baseline counterparts and other state-of-the-art approaches on benchmark datasets. Finally, we present a mechanism to compress the proposed RNN for edge-enabled IoT applications.},

  abstract     = {The encoder–decoder framework has been widely used in various practical artificial intelligence cyber-physical systems, including intelligent translation systems. The decoding process in such a framework usually demands the target-side representation, which is often learned by an autoaggressive decoder to simulate the target context information at the current time-step. However, the autoaggressive decoder only captures the previously generated partial target fragment and fails in simulating the global contextual information. In this article, we propose a new data-driven fuzzy context representation strategy to simulate the global target information. Specifically, we design two fuzzy methods to the global target contextual information, which are bag-of-words of target language generated via a softmax layer from the source-side representation and whole target sentence retrieved from the translation memory according to the source-side representation. Both methods facilitate the autoaggressive decoder to handle the global target context at the current time-step, thereby learning a more effective context vector for the generation of target translation. Extensive experiments on two machine translation tasks demonstrated that the proposed method achieved 3\% improvement of BLEU score over a strong baseline.},

  abstract     = {This article proposes a fuzzy adaptive fault-tolerant control strategy solving the fast fixed-time constrained tracking problem for hypersonic flight vehicles. To handle the actuator faults, a two-step design method is first proposed that only needs to estimate the upper and lower bounds of actuator parameters, under which the adverse influences of actuator faults (e.g., lock-in-place, loss of effectiveness, etc.) have been compensated via an adaptive fashion instead of conventional robust ways. In comparison with the state-of-the-art, a new fixed-time corollary that has proved a smaller upper bound of convergence time under the same condition of conventional fixed-time stability is presented. To avoid singularity issues often encountered in fixed-time designs, a piecewise but differentiable switching control laws whose continuity and differentiability are guaranteed everywhere through an appropriate design is introduced. Such a design not only preserves the continuity and differentiability of virtual and actual control laws, but also ensures the continuity of their time derivatives. Fuzzy logic systems are exploited to tackle continuous unknown dynamics and asymmetric time-varying barrier functions are utilized to confine flight states within some predefined compact sets all the time provided their initial conditions remain therein. This property is of great significance in dealing with the challenge that the operating regions of the flight state variables are asymmetric and time-varying in practice, especially when executing various flight missions. Comparative simulations have been performed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme in terms of fixed-time convergence, smoothness, and time-varying constraints satisfaction.},

Due to constant technical progress, online spamming activities have been more and more concealed. This brings much fuzziness to spammer detection scenarios, yielding the issue of fuzzy detection of spammers. Although existing detection techniques for spammers utilized idea of deep learning, they still ignore to release power of label spaces. As real nature about a user may be usually fuzzy, but the label annotated for a user is always certain. To remedy such gap, this article proposes a label smoothing-based fuzzy detection method for spammers (Fuz-Spam). First of all, deep representation is still utilized to deeply fuse features, which acts as the foundation of neural computing. On this basis, generative adversarial learning is introduced to transform previous label spaces into distributed forms. In addition, two groups of experiments are carried out on two real-world datasets for evaluation. The results demonstrate that the Fuz-Spam improves identification efficiency about 10\% to 20\% than previous ones, and that the Fuz-Spam is endowed with proper stability.},

By introducing two important universal-constrained functions and using coordinate transformation technology, the stochastic HONS with full-state constraints is transformed into an equivalent one without state constraints. Compared with the existing control schemes, the proposed scheme not only eliminates the feasibility conditions, but also accurately analyzes the scope of tracking error. Moreover, the limitation that the constraint functions need to be bounded is also removed; thus, the proposed scheme is a unified approach that can be applied to stochastic HONSs with or without state constraints. With the help of fixed-time stability theory and adaptive fuzzy control technology, a novel fixed-time fuzzy controller is designed. In addition, an adaptive event-triggering mechanism that the threshold parameters can be adjusted adaptively according to the tracking performance is introduced to reduce the communication burden.

  abstract     = {This article proposes a fractional-order intelligent fault-tolerant synchronization tracking control (FO-I-FTSTC) scheme for multiple unmanned airships (UAs) against actuator faults. Within the developed control architecture, fixed-time prescribed performance functions (PPFs) are first designed to transform the synchronization tracking errors into a new set of error variables, such that the original errors are strictly confined within the prescribed bounds. Then, fractional calculus and sliding mode surface are sequentially introduced to construct the FO errors. Moreover, to handle the unknown terms and bias faults in the FO sliding-mode error dynamics, fuzzy neural networks with recurrent loops are artfully constructed to act as the intelligent learning units. Furthermore, the norm of the loss-of-effectiveness fault factors is introduced for each UA to reduce the number of adaptive parameters. The distinct feature of the proposed method is that the FO-I-FTSTC performance is significantly enhanced by integrating recurrent fuzzy neural networks, fractional calculus, and fixed-time PPFs into a unified framework, leading to a high-precision control scheme. It is shown by Lyapunov analysis that all UAs can track their desired references in a synchronized manner, and the synchronization tracking errors are bounded and strictly confined within the prescribed error bounds. Comparative hardware-in-the-loop experiments are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed FO-I-FTSTC scheme.},

In this article, we propose a novel offline approach to solve this problem, where the control law is online searched in a receding horizon cache, which is only a small portion of the lookup table. The cache is refreshed in a one-step-ahead fashion to guarantee that the proper one-step-ahead state-to-input mapping can be found in the cache. The recursive feasibility and stability hold.

  abstract     = {In modeling of consumer preferences based on online comments, nonlinearity and fuzziness exist in the relationship between the product design attribute and the consumer preference. On the other hand, consumer preferences are not static and changing over the time. Previous studies have proposed few approaches to model the variational consumer preferences based on online comments. However, the obtained models have black box problems and are not easy to be understood by humans as explicit models cannot be shown, which give rise to the research area of explainable artificial intelligence. Therefore, it is necessary to develop understandable and accurate consumer preferences’ models. In this article, a nonlinear time series fuzzy regression method is proposed to model the variational consumer preference based on online comments, which can generate a fuzzy dynamic consumer preference model with interactive terms, second-order and/or higher order terms. The datasets are first extracted from online comments using the sentiment analysis. Then, the polynomial structure of the fuzzy dynamic consumer preference model is established by using multiobjective chaos optimization algorithm. Then, the fuzzy regression method is used to allocate the fuzzy coefficients of each item of the model. Using sweeping robot as a case study, the validation results from the proposed approach are compared with those from fuzzy least squares regression, time series fuzzy least squares regression, fuzzy regression, and time series fuzzy regression, and it is found that the proposed approach performs better than the other four approaches in terms of mean relative errors and mean system credibility.},

  abstract     = {In this work, a robust static output feedback (SOF) design for continuous-time nonlinear systems under norm bounded uncertainties, described as a Takagi–Sugeno (TS) system is proposed. The key features are that a switching control law is used to activate the SOF gains to stabilize the uncertain TS fuzzy system and the SOF design does not require the measurements of all premise variables in real time as in the standard fuzzy parallel distributed compensation design. The main result is given in terms of linear matrix inequalities, which guarantees a ${\mathcal {H}}_{\infty }$ attenuation level of $\gamma$ for the SOF control system. The efficiency of the main results is illustrated with examples, including a nonlinear active suspension system under uncertain driver masses, and compared with other published results from the literature.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates the predefined-time stabilization problems of Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) fuzzy systems. For addressing the considered problems, a class of novel integral sliding mode surface is first designed based on the time-regulator function, on which the system states are forced to converge to the origin in a predefined time after the sliding mode surface is reached. Further, the proposed sliding surface is employed to construct predefined-time integral sliding mode controller for the time delayed and disturbed T–S fuzzy system. The settling time appears as the sum of two predefined-time parameters in the controller design, which, respectively, adjusts the convergence time for reaching the sliding mode surface and the convergence time for arriving the origin from the sliding mode surface. The sufficient conditions for maintaining the predefined-time stability of the T–S fuzzy systems are obtained through systematic Lyapunov stability analysis. Finally, a numerical simulation example on delayed and disturbed Chua circuit is presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed predefined-time integral sliding mode controller.},

In order to effectively decrease the end-effector position errors, a novel dual fuzzy-enhanced neurodynamic (DFEN) scheme is put forward for solving the position error accumulation problem followed by achieving accurate tracking control results. The proposed scheme is established based on a zeroing neurodynamic approach in conjunction with two fuzzy adjustment units that are capable of tuning the control parameters by monitoring the tracking error. Moreover, the DFEN scheme can effectively solve the tracking problem without requiring knowing a priori knowledge of the kinematic model of the robot. The convergence and the stability of the proposed approach are demonstrated by theoretical analysis. The effectiveness, accuracy, and robustness of the proposed DFEN scheme are verified on the simulative redundant manipulator, continuum robot, and hybrid robot (integrating the redundant manipulator and the continuum robot). A practical experiment is provided to validate the proposed scheme as well.},

  abstract     = {Decision making could be an extremely complicated process. Especially, in situations in which the diversity of backgrounds and experience of decision makers (DMs) may require various forms to model their opinions. DMs’ rational choice even may be distorted by their judgements due to limitations of human cognitive competence. Generally, the interactions between criteria, the bipolar scale with negative values, and linguistic-valued aspirations on criteria are also needed to be addressed. In addition, several types of input information may be stochastic or uncertain, such as criteria evaluations, capacities, and preference coefficients. Our aim is to address all previous issues simultaneously by proposing a novel model that incorporates Choquet integral, bicapacity, regret theory, and stochastic multiobjective acceptability analysis (SMAA), i.e., SMAA–bicapacity–Choquet–regret for heterogeneous linguistic multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) problems with interactive criteria with bipolar scale and 2-tuple aspirations. The heterogeneous linguistic information can offer a highly flexible way to express DMs’ preference; a novel 2-tuple aspirations-based utility within regret can better reflect the subjective perceptions of DMs in MCDM problems with 2-tuple aspirations on criteria; bicapacity can weigh the criteria and their coalitions, and Choquet integral concerning bicapacity can aggregate interactive criteria with bipolar scale; and finally, an application to evaluate medical waste disposal technologies is given, and a comparative analysis is performed to verify the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed model.},

For the first issue, in addition to the original use of randomness in FRF, a doubly randomness is newly introduced into the generation of both the candidate attributes and the best splitting attributes in FRF. For the computational speed issue, while the proposed new fuzzy information gain (NFG) measure does not apply to all candidate attributes, the remaining NFG values can be quickly retrieved by copying from the dynamically generated dictionary. As a result, a new method called enhanced fuzzy random forest (E-FRF) is proposed and justified theoretically from the consistency perspective. Our extensive experimental results indicate that the proposed method E-FRF has at least comparable performance to the comparative methods, and is an advantageous alternative to FRF in terms of both testing accuracy and running speed in most of the adopted high dimensional datasets.},

Under the nonperiodic DoS attacks, the state error caused by the packets loss phenomenon is transformed into an uncertain variable in the designed event-triggered condition. Then, an RET strategy based on the uncertain event-triggered variable is firstly proposed for the nonlinear NCSs. The existing results that utilized the hybrid triggered scheme have the defect of complex control structure, and most of the security compensation methods for handling the impacts caused by DoS attacks need to transmit some compensation data when the DoS attacks disappear, which may lead to large performance loss of the systems. Different from these existing results, the proposed RET strategy can transmit the necessary packets to the controller under nonperiodic DoS attacks to reduce the performance loss of the systems and a new security controller subject to the RET scheme and mismatched membership functions is designed to simplify the network control structure under DoS attacks. Finally, some simulation results are utilized to testify the advantages of the presented approach.},

In the proposed optimized control, on the one hand, the state observer method can avoid to require the design constants making its characteristic polynomial Hurwitz, which is universally demanded in the existing observer methods; on the other hand, the RL is significantly simple in algorithm, because the critic and actor training laws are derived from the negative gradient of a simple positive function, which is produced from the partial derivative of Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equation, instead of the square of approximated HJB equation. Therefore this optimized scheme can be more easily applied and widely extended. Finally, from two aspects of theory and simulation, it is demonstrated that the desired objective can be fulfilled.},

Our IRW-FCM utilizes $c$ not $dc$ intermediate variables to update $\mathbf {F}$ , which can decrease space complexity. Extensive experiments including objective-function value comparison and clustering-performance comparison show that IRW-FCM can obtain better local minima than FCM with fewer iterations. And according to the time-complexity analysis, it is verified IRW-FCM has the same linear time complexity with FCM.

By contrast with the state feedback case, the SOF control generally results in nonconvex design conditions. To circumvent this problem, we develop a successive convex optimization algorithm, which is based on solving a sequence of more tractable convex optimization problems obtained by approximating the nonconvex constraints with some convex ones. As a heuristic algorithm, the validity of the developed successive convex optimization algorithm is highly affected by initial conditions, and, recognizing this, we put forward an iterative procedure for determining the feasible initial condition.

In a nutshell, while the fuzzy C-means clustering to define the positions of radial basis functions (RBFs) based in the unsupervised learning manner is usually used in a FRBFNN, the parameters (cluster centers and their ensuing polynomial coefficients) refinement of FRBFNN through the proposed iterative method lead to superb classification performance by relocating the positions of RBFs over the input space implied by supervised learning. The idea of the proposed approach is to relocate the centers (prototypes) of the fuzzy clusters by using WFCM clustering algorithm and to re-estimate the coefficients by weighted least square estimation with the aid of the cross-entropy loss values of data so that the classification performance is improved. The weight related to each data is determined by some auxiliary information (i.e., the modified version of the cross-entropy loss value of each data). When it comes to the estimation of the coefficients of the consequent polynomial in IFRBFNN, they are estimated by the weighted least square error estimation technique, where the weights of the coefficients are defined based on the cross-entropy loss values. The auxiliary information such as the weights for relocation of the centers of RBFs and the weights for the re-estimation of the polynomial coefficients should be defined from the viewpoint of enhancement of the classification performance. The cross-entropy loss value of each data is able to meet the necessity of the required supervision signal. Several numerical experiments are provided to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed design method for the FRBFNN for classification problems.},

Specifically, nonlinear factors and uncertain parameters existing in turbine and governor dynamics are modeled and analyzed under the interval type-2 fuzzy method. New memory-based adaptive event-triggered mechanisms, whose directions and threshold parameters are dynamically updated based on the output change trend and relative output error of multiple memories, are proposed to further save network energy. Aiming at communication topology changes in multiarea power systems, a novel switched control system is established by introducing a time-varying communication matrix. Then, the system’s asymptotic stability is ensured by the piecewise Lyapunov–Krasovskii method. Furthermore, to further relax stability conditions, slack matrices are considered with the boundary information of membership functions. Finally, three-area power systems are shown to demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed distributed load frequency control strategies.},

To this end, the nonlinear fault-tolerant control strategy with an online fault detection system monitoring the system stability performance degradation induced by faults is first introduced by means of the stable image and kernel representations. On this basis, the T–S fuzzy models are applied to approximate the nonlinear system, and a design approach of the fuzzy observer-based controller is proposed for the system stabilization via the iterative linear matrix inequality method. With the controller gains, the fuzzy-model-based nominal stable image representation of the system is formulated, which leads to the generation of the input and output error signals. Then, with the reference signal and system input and output error signal data, a data-driven algorithm is given to online estimate the evaluation function defined in terms of system uncertainties and faults. By virtue of the $L_{2}$ input–output stability of the controller stable kernel representation, a threshold calculation method is presented and, thus, the stability performance-based fault detection system based on fuzzy models is realized. Furthermore, for fault-tolerant purpose, the fault-tolerant controller design is discussed, which aims to retain the system stability. Two examples are provided in the end to illustrate the proposed results.},

A class of SMDLF is constructed for continuous-time switched T–S fuzzy systems, and relaxed stability conditions are presented for the system with both stable and unstable subsystems, using a larger switching signal space. Then, novel stability conditions are deduced for all stable and unstable subsystems in terms of slow and fast MDADT switching signals, respectively.

  abstract     = {In this article, we introduce a design methodology of reinforced fuzzy models based both on univariate analysis and multivariable analysis to cope with high-dimensional problems. This approach is aimed at reducing the design process and curbing computing overhead inherently associated with the increasing volume of data in terms of both their number and the dimensionality of the feature space. The critical features of the proposed fuzzy models are highlighted as follows: First, the essential input variables of the model are selected by running the univariable and multivariable analyses. In univariate analysis, input variables with a strong linear relationship with the output variable are selected through correlation analysis completed for each input space and output space. On the contrary, in multivariable analysis, input variables are chosen by comparing the determination coefficients obtained from the subsets of input variables. Second, according to the analysis of the input variable, we construct two different kinds of fuzzy models. The first fuzzy model comprises the design of the univariable-based fuzzy model (UFM) and its aggregation. The UFMs are made by the individual input variables selected from the univariable analysis using a correlation coefficient. The subspaces formed by correlation analysis are applied for determining the centers of the membership function (MF). The results produced by individual fuzzy models are aggregated through some t -conorms. The second fuzzy model is with the fuzzy clustering for improving the form of fuzzy space in the premise part of a fuzzy rule. To curb the dramatic increase in size of fuzzy rule in high-dimensional problems, the clustering space is employed as the fuzzy space, and the partition matrix produced by fuzzy provided the required degrees of the MF. Experimental studies include a suite of synthetic and publicly available data. The superiority of the proposed design methodology was demonstrated by using 34 publicly available datasets and also compared with the conventional models associated with the fuzzy rule-based models as well as the state-of-the-art models reported in the literature.},

Parallel distributed compensation (PDC) event-triggered dynamic output quantization (ETDOQ) control is considered for the DTSTSFSs, where event-triggered (ET) mechanism without Zeno behavior is designed, which is mode-dependent and does not restrict the dwell time of each mode. By using the mode-dependent Lyapunov function method, two sufficient conditions termed by linear matrix inequalities are provided. Different from most of existing results, no inequality is resorted in dealing with the uncertainties coming from the quantization. It is interesting that the controlled modes are not required to be stable. New algorithm is designed for the control gains of the ETDOQ controller and the parameters of the ET condition, which overcomes the mismatching difficulty of the parameters induced by the PDC.

Specifically, the network complexity can be minimized to generate concise and few fuzzy rules for improving the network explainability. Inspired by the extreme learning machine and the broad learning system, an enhanced distributed parallel multiobjective evolutionary algorithm is proposed.

However, the traditional FCM and most of its variants cannot address incomplete inputs. To this aim, a novel fuzzy clustering framework is put forward to perform highly accurate clustering on incomplete data. It adopts twofold ideas: 1) Utilizing a nonnegative latent factor model to prefill the missing data in the inputs by rigidly extracting involved entities’ latent features, where the principle of a minibatch gradient descent algorithm is incorporated into a single latent factor-dependent, nonnegative and multiplicative update algorithm to accelerate the convergence rate; and 2) integrating the distribution of inputs and the weights of local features into the objective function through sparse self-representation and weighting allocation to focus on crucial features. In this way, a NLF analysis-incorporated and feature-weighted fuzzy double $c$ -means clustering (NF $^2$ D) method is achieved, where the data distribution and instance correlation are simultaneously considered with care. Experiments on 12 real-world datasets including both data and images with different missing rates show that the proposed NF $^2$ D method has a significant superiority over state-of-the-art fuzzy clustering methods.},

In addition, the uncertainties typically pose substantial difficulty in the controller synthesis. Here, by invoking the methodology of fuzzy sets, the uncertainties in the UMSs are elegantly represented; and with this, the formulation becomes such that a closer link between the uncertain dynamical model of the UMSs and the real world is established. The reference trajectories are regarded appropriately as servo constraints, and subsequently an adaptive robust controller is designed to accomplish the trajectory tracking task from a specific viewpoint of servo constraint tracking. As supported by rigorous proofs, the closed-form solution to the proposed controller is obtained with guaranteed Lyapunov stability. Leveraging on the closed-form solution, the global optimizer to the controller gain parameter can be determined, which is shown to exhibit several important properties including existence and uniqueness.

  abstract     = {Rough clustering has attracted increasing attention due to well dealing with the fuzziness and uncertainty of data. It is well known that it needs to manually set the threshold to determine the upper and lower approximations of rough clusters, which may bring a great effect on the clustering performance. When applied to image segmentation, rough clustering is always sensitive to the initialized cluster centers and image noise. Furthermore, only one clustering criterion is considered in rough clustering, which cannot satisfy diverse practical requirements. To handle these issues, a particle competitive mechanism based multiobjective rough clustering algorithm (PCM-MORCA) for image segmentation is proposed. First, a rough intraclass compactness function considering the nonlocal spatial information derived from an image is constructed to overcome the sensitivity to image noise. Next, the constructed rough intraclass compactness function and an interclass separation function are optimized simultaneously to make cluster centers meet diverse segmentation requirements. Then, an adaptive threshold determination mechanism by which the threshold adaptively varies with the clustered data is presented to well determine the upper and lower approximations of rough clusters. After that, to effectively search appropriate cluster centers, a novel pair competition-based particle weight updating strategy is designed for multiobjective particle swarm optimization by improving the elite particle selection and particle update. Finally, a rough clustering index with the nonlocal spatial information is constructed for selecting the optimal solution for PCM-MORCA. Segmentation experiments on Berkeley and magnetic resonance images reveal that PCM-MORCA behaves well on the segmentation accuracy and noise robustness.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates the periodic event-triggered sliding mode control problem for switched uncertain Takagi–Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy systems with the external nonlinear disturbance. Firstly, to reduce the utilization of the network bandwidth, a logistic event-triggering scheme is designed, and the triggering threshold can be adaptively adjusted based on the current triggering information. Then, for preventing the controller from using the extra information, an auxiliary function known as the triggering sliding mode function is constructed and added into the triggering condition. The T-S fuzzy event-triggered sliding mode controller and the sampling period are designed simultaneously to deal with structured uncertainty. Then, the sufficient criteria of practical stability and the border of the practical sliding mode region around the specified sliding surface are given, respectively. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is showed by a tunnel diode circuit system model.},

Considering that various uncertain data are inevitable in the process of addressing actual problems, uncertain $Z$ -numbers are introduced to express information and measure information reliability. Powerful tools are essential when dealing with uncertain information; then, complex fuzzy sets (CFSs) are employed. First, the parameter $B$ in $Z$ -numbers is interpreted from the perspective of the phase term, and uncertain $Z$ -numbers are transformed to interval-valued CFSs. Next, arithmetic operators, aggregation operator, generalized entropy, distance measure, and similarity measure are defined. Besides, a multicriteria group decision-making method is suggested by combining the proposed entropy, distance measure, and aggregation operator. The algorithm is applied to select the brand of the inertial navigation system. The comparison analysis with other widely used methods is conducted to verify the feasibility and validity of $Z$ -information in the application.},

In order to indicate the perturbations of control gain, the Bernoulli sequence is applied to the designed control scheme. At the same time, the membership function dependent $H_{\infty }$ performance index is introduced to attenuate the disturbances of continuous-time T–S fuzzy systems for the first time. By utilizing the novel $H_{\infty }$ performance index together with the appropriate Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional, including the information of sampling period and signal transmission delay, the sufficient conditions are derived in the framework of linear matrix inequalities. These conditions ensure the stabilization of concerned T–S fuzzy systems and enlarging the maximum sampling period.

  abstract     = {Nonlinear positive systems are ubiquitous in practical applications. The constraint of positive conditions makes the design of this system still quite challenging even for the existing advanced control theory. In addition, when uncertainty and external disturbance also act on the positive nonlinear system at the same time, it will aggravate the complexity of the problem. In response to this problem, for the first time, this article presents a feasible robust tracking control strategy for the positive nonlinear systems with external disturbance and subject to uncertainty. In the proposed control strategy, the positive Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) fuzzy model is used to effectively represent the nonlinearity of the positive system, and the interval type-2 (IT2) fuzzy sets are used to deal with the uncertainty. The focus of tracking control is to design a reasonable IT2 fuzzy controller, which can make the states of the plant follow those of the given stable positive reference system as accurately as possible under the $H_\infty$ performance. Different from the tracking control research of general systems in the existing literature, in the tracking control analysis of positive systems, the generation of nonconvex conditions is inevitable. This article smoothly removes the obstacle of this problem. In addition, this article successfully attempts to relax the conservativeness of the basic analysis conditions by improving IT2 membership-function-dependent method, thereby improving the tracking effect under $H_\infty$ performance.

  abstract     = {When a fuzzy system is presented with an incomplete (or sparse) rule base, fuzzy rule interpolation (FRI) offers a useful mechanism to infer conclusions for unmatched observations. However, most existing FRI methodologies are established for Mamdani inference models, but not for Takagi–Sugeno–Kang (TSK) ones. This article presents a novel approach for computing interpolated outcomes with TSK models, using only a small number of neighboring rules to an unmatched observation. Compared with existing methods, the new approach helps improve the computational efficiency of the overall interpolative reasoning process, while minimizing the adverse impact on accuracy induced by firing those rules of low similarities with the new observation. For problems that involve a rule base of a large size, where closest neighboring rules may be rather alike to one another, a rule-clustering-based method is introduced. It derives an interpolated conclusion by first clustering rules into different groups with a clustering algorithm and then, by utilizing only those rules that are each selected from one of a given, small number of closest rule clusters. Systematic experimental examinations are carried out to verify the efficacy of the introduced techniques, in comparison with state-of-the-art methods, over a range of benchmark regression problems, while employing different clustering algorithms (which also shows the flexibility in ways of implementing the novel approach).},

Extended restricted equivalence functions allow us to compare any two general type-2 fuzzy sets and to generate a similarity measure for type-2 fuzzy sets. The result of this similarity is a fuzzy set on the same referential set (i.e., domain) as the considered type-2 fuzzy set. The latter is crucial for applications such as explainable AI and decision-making, as it enables an intuitive interpretation of the similarity within the domain-specific context of the fuzzy sets. We show how this measure can be used to compare type-2 fuzzy sets with different membership functions in such a way that the uncertainty linked to type-2 fuzzy sets is not lost. This is achieved by generating a fuzzy set rather than a single numerical value. Furthermore, we also show how to obtain a numerical value for discrete referential sets.},

  abstract     = {Data obtained from the real-world tends to be uncertain: Measurement inaccuracies, variability in opinions, and human errors are just some of the reasons that make the information collection process noisy. In recent years, fuzzy sets have been used to capture the uncertainty in data and then build automatic reasoning systems. In some contexts, data on a given subject is gathered from multiple sources and each instance modeled through a fuzzy set. A typical example of this scenario is represented by surveys, in which many participants express their opinions on the same topics. The fuzzy sets representing individual instances can be combined in a new (type-1 or type-2) fuzzy set in order to capture expert or measurement variation. In this article, we propose a novel approach which combines uncertain data modeled through parametric fuzzy sets in an intuitive manner, using the recently introduced constrained interval type-2 (IT2) fuzzy sets . By intuitive, we mean that each resultant constrained IT2 fuzzy set preserves the shape used to represent a single data instance, while making use of the footprint of uncertainty to represent uncertainty around its parameters. This novel constrained parametric approach is applied to interval-valued data gathered from real surveys and compared to the other algorithms in the literature, showing how it differs from them, with discussion of the contexts in which it represents a valuable alternative. Finally, it is shown how this novel approach can be used to model not just intervals but data in which individual instances can be modeled through any parametric fuzzy sets (e.g., triangular).},

  abstract     = {This article investigates the polynomial fuzzy impulsive control problem for positive nonlinear systems subject to parameter uncertainties. The positive nonlinear systems are represented as positive interval type-2 (IT2) polynomial fuzzy-model-based systems, while the parameter uncertainties are captured by the IT2 membership functions (MFs). Considering that the controller being designed needs to be implementable and practical, in addition to ensuring the positivity and stability of the system, there are still some potential requirements for the controller, such as lower implementation cost and control cost. To reduce the implementation cost, the IT2 polynomial fuzzy impulsive controller is designed under the imperfect premise matching concept that the premise MFs and the number of rules of fuzzy controller are different from those of fuzzy model. To reduce the control cost, the impulsive controller that can tolerate larger impulse control interval (ICI) is designed by the following two novel methods. The first one is the proposed impulse-time-dependent discretized polynomial copositive Lyapunov function whose Lyapunov variable is designed as the interpolation polynomial function of time. The second one is the advanced IT2 membership-function-dependent (IT2MFD) analysis method which is improved by a novel footprint of uncertainty partitioning method proposed by this paper, so that this advanced IT2MFD method can alleviate the negative impact of parameter uncertainties on the ICI. Finally, a simulation example using lipoprotein metabolism and potassium ion transfer model as the nonlinear system to be controlled is used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed impulsive control methods.},

  abstract     = {The increased demand for safety in control systems has motivated the research for fault-tolerant controllers (FTCs). This article presents the static output feedback FTC design and relaxed stability analysis for positive nonlinear systems on account of polynomial fuzzy models. A polynomial copositive Lyapunov function candidate is proposed for the stability analysis of positive polynomial fuzzy-model-based (PPFMB) control systems for the first time. This method develops the decision variable on the polynomial copositive Lyapunov function candidate to be a polynomial vector and also makes it independent of the form of the positive polynomial fuzzy model. Thus, it can be applied to a more extensive range of PPFMB control systems and potentially generates more relaxed stability analysis results. To achieve the stability analysis and control synthesis, the following challenges are overcome: 1) approximate the nonconvex terms in stability and positivity conditions into convex ones through the idea of matrix decomposition; 2) eliminate the nonconvex conditions resulting from the derivative of the polynomial Lyapunov function by employing an sum-of-squares (SOS) optimization method; 3) relax the results of stability analysis and control design by introducing the advanced membership-function-dependent technique to develop both the stability conditions and the positivity conditions. The relaxed conditions are obtained on the basis of SOS form so that the MATLAB third-party toolbox, SOSTOOLS, can be used to find feasible solutions. Finally, two simulation examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {An inherent property of natural languages is the possibility of distinct meanings for the same word in different sentences. Word sense induction (WSI) is the unsupervised process of discovering the meanings of a word. The meanings form a sense inventory, which is used for word sense disambiguation (WSD). Fuzzy logic’s capability at uncertainty representation makes it perfectly applicable for handling the vague information processed in natural languages for WSI and WSD. In this article, a novel fuzzy-based methodology is proposed for extracting meaningful information from ambiguous words, where both word senses and sense inventories are modeled as linguistic variables. The proposed method aims to gather a term set of level-2 fuzzy values for the variables representing words’ meanings, to achieve WSI. The values in the term set are, then, used for linguistic approximation using a fuzzy inference system designed for WSD based on word’s context. The fuzzy word senses are extracted from an input corpus by word substitution, i.e., predicting words suitable as substitutes for the target word using masked language models. These fuzzy substitute sets are, then, clustered to discover similarities in the semantics they represent. Finally, each cluster is reformed into a sense value and added to the term set for the target word. The experimental results show that the proposed system outperforms the systems submitted to the standard SemEval 2010 and 2013 WSI and WSD tasks and achieves comparable performance with other fuzzy and nonfuzzy state-of-the-art methods.},

The fuzzy logic systems are employed to compensate and approximate uncertain functions. On the premise of maintaining formation structure and coupling communication topology, time-varying transformation equations containing exponential signals are introduced to ensure that state capability boundaries for different physical quantities of agents are not violated. It not only guarantees own state performance and collision avoidance among agents, but also realizes the specified transient and steady formation performance. Furthermore, focusing on convergence rate, the adaptive fuzzy fast finite-time strategy is designed that can guarantee all agents will follow the desired formation configuration in fast finite-time. Through the abovementioned approaches provide a good way to improve the convergence and ensure the security for decentralized formation control. Finally, the validity of the theoretical method is proved by fast finite-time stable theory and Lyapunov stability theory.

To decrease the frequency of data communication, a novel adaptive memory-event-triggered mechanism is presented to choose the “necessary” control signals, which has the following two benefits. First, a weighted average signal over a historic period is utilized as the input of event-triggered scheme, instead of the current system information in the conventional one. This could reduce the control signal updating rate and avoid the false triggering events incurred by stochastic environment noises and disturbances. Second, a dynamic triggering threshold is adopted to adaptively regulate the control signal updating frequency along with the average signal. By applying the distributed delay system method to describe the weighted historic signal, a new uncertain T–S fuzzy wind turbine system with distributed delay is established. With the aid of the measured outputs and the integral inequality based on the weighting function of the average signal, the memory-event-triggered static output controller design conditions are obtained to ensure the system exponential stability and the $H_{\infty}$ performance. Lastly, an experiment platform integrating Zigbee modules as the wireless network is set up to illustrate the advantages of the proposed strategy.},

  abstract     = {This article providesa systematic approach for the design of an interval type-3 (IT3) Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) fuzzy logic system (FLS) using $\alpha $ - plane representation. An IT3 FLS is designed with the baseline of the general type-2 (GT2) FLS in a similar manner as an IT2 FLS was designed from the baseline of type-1 FLS. Hence, IT3 FLS evolved as a successor of GT2 FLS, where secondary membership function is an interval type-2 fuzzy set (FS), and values of tertiary membership are unity over the footprint of uncertainty of secondary membership. This extra degree of freedom in IT3 FLS provides better modeling capability as compared to GT2 FLS in the presence of a high degree of uncertainty and vagueness. The proposed system will be more appealing while dealing with uncertain information or data, which is supposed to be generated from uncertain sources; i.e., there exist uncertainties even in the presence of uncertainty. The computations needed for the design of IT3 FLS are derived using IT2 FS and GT2 FS mathematics. The design algorithms adopted for the baseline IT2 T–S fuzzy system are as per the modified interval type-2 fuzzy c-regression model clustering algorithm and hyper-plane-shaped membership function. The proposed methodology is applied to several benchmark examples and obtained results are compared with recently developed fuzzy modeling methods having a comparable number of rule bases. The proposed IT3 T–S FLS shows good performance in terms of accuracy when data is corrupted by noise and uncertainties related to missing or unvarying data exist. The computational cost is linear with design parameters and by optimum choice of $\alpha $ -planes, it is still bearable considering advantages and nature of applications.},

From the perspective of realistic decision, the final decision of all alternatives should be determined according to this criterion fuzzy set. In view of this, this article proposes the criterion-oriented three-way ranking and clustering strategies, which can solve the qualitative clustering and ranking problems of all alternatives from the perspective of criterion fuzzy sets. First, we define a criterion fuzzy set as a criterion-oriented fuzzy concept and propose a criterion-oriented relative risk loss model and discuss related properties accordingly. Meanwhile, we use the generalized fuzzy rough lower (upper) approximation to estimate the absolute (relative) conditional probability between the binary fuzzy class of the alternative and the criterion-oriented fuzzy concept. Then, a criterion-oriented absolute (relative) three-way clustering strategy is proposed, which can perform qualitative analysis on all alternatives. Furthermore, based on the three-way semantics and global cost function, we recommend a criterion-oriented absolute (relative) three-way ranking strategy, which can rank all alternatives. Finally, through numerical example, comparative analysis and sensitivity analysis, we test the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed criterion-oriented three-way ranking and clustering strategies.},

  abstract     = {This article focuses on the stability analysis and control design of an interval type-2 sampled-data fuzzy-model-based output-feedback (IT2SDFMBOF) tracking control system, which is formed by the interval type-2 (IT2) Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) fuzzy model, the stable reference model, and the interval type-2 sampled-data output-feedback (IT2SDOF) fuzzy controller. The design goal is to establish a proper IT2SDOF fuzzy controller that is able to drive the states of the nonlinear plant subject to uncertainties to track those of the stable reference model, and the $H_\infty$ performance index is adopted to optimize the tracking control performance. To improve the robustness of the IT2SDOF fuzzy controller against uncertainties of the nonlinear plant, IT2 fuzzy sets are utilized. Considering that the tracking control system is sampled-data (SD) type, a two-sided looped-functional-based approach exploiting the information on the interval from time $t_k$ to $t$ and the interval from time $t$ to $t_{k+1}$ is applied to enhance the stability analysis. The imperfect premise matching (IPM) concept permits the number of rules and the premise membership functions of the IT2 T-S fuzzy model and the IT2SDOF fuzzy controller to be different, which can be employed to promote the design flexibility. The tracking control system with the SD type and IPM design will cause the membership grades between the IT2 T-S fuzzy model and the IT2SDOF fuzzy controller to be mismatched. In addition, the membership-function-dependent stability analysis approach that can introduce the boundary information of membership functions into the stability analysis is used to relax the stability conditions. The relaxed stability conditions subject to the $H_\infty$ performance building on the Lyapunov stability theory are developed in terms of linear matrix inequalities. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed IT2SDFMBOF tracking control system.},

  abstract     = {This article focuses on the $\mathcal {L}_{2}-\mathcal {L} _{\infty}/ \mathcal {H}_{\infty}$ optimization control issue for a family of nonlinear plants by Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) fuzzy approach with actuator failure. First, considering unmeasurable system states, sufficient criteria for devising fuzzy imperfect premise matching dynamic output feedback controller to maintain asymptotic stability while guaranteeing a mixed performance for T–S fuzzy systems are provided. Therewith, in the light of feasible areas of dynamic output feedback controller membership functions (MFs), a new MFs online learning policy using gradient descent algorithm is proposed to learn the real-time values of MFs to acquire a better $\mathcal {L}_{2}-\mathcal {L}_{\infty}/ \mathcal {H}_{\infty}$ control effect. Different from the traditional method using an imperfect premise matching scheme, under the proposed optimization algorithm, the trajectory of mixed performance index is lowered effectively. Afterward, a sufficient criterion is presented for assuring the convergence of the error of the cost function. Finally, the superiority of this online optimization learning policy is confirmed via simulations.},

  abstract     = {In semisupervised fuzzy clustering, this article extends the traditional pairwise constraint (i.e., must-link or cannot-link) to fuzzy pairwise constraint. The fuzzy pairwise constraint allows a supervisor to provide the grade of similarity or dissimilarity between the implicit fuzzy vectors of a pair of samples. This constraint can represent more complicated relationship between the pair of samples and avoid eliminating the fuzzy characteristics. Then, we propose a semisupervised fuzzy clustering with fuzzy pairwise constraints (SSFPC). The nonconvex optimization problem in our SSFPC is solved by a modified expectation-maximization algorithm, involving to solve several indefinite quadratic programming problems (IQPPs). Further, a diagonal block coordinate decent (DBCD) algorithm is proposed for these IQPPs, whose stationary points are guaranteed, and the global solutions can be obtained under certain conditions. To suit for different applications, the SSFPC is extended into various metric spaces, e.g., the reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets and a facial expression database demonstrate the outperformance of our SSFPC compared with some state-of-the-art clustering models},

  abstract     = {Entropy is a powerful tool for nonlinear analysis of time series. We have recently introduced dispersion entropy (DispEn), which has widely drawn attention from researchers in a variety of settings in data analysis. However, DispEn is sensitive to its parameters, especially number of classes (quantization level). Additionally, in some cases, a small change in the signal amplitude due to noise changes the quantized series and so entropy value. To address these limitations, we develop fuzzy dispersion entropy (FuzzDispEn) on the basis of fuzzy membership functions for the quantization of a signal and Shannon entropy (ShEn). In FuzzDispEn, the concept of fuzzification in ShEn-based methods is introduced for the first time. Several straightforward concepts in signal processing using a set of time series were utilized to show the advantages of FuzzDispEn over DispEn in terms of the detection of the dynamical variability of signals. The results showed that FuzzDispEn has lower sensitivity to noise and signal length compared to DispEn. FuzzDispEn was also applied to five real world applications: mechanical fault detection in gearbox, fault diagnosis of rolling element bearings, damage level detection of bearings, detection of blood pressure in salt-sensitive rats, and detection of seizure and seizure-free electroencephalographics (EEGs). The results suggest that FuzzDispEn outperforms DispEn as well as popular sample entropy and permutation entropy in distinguishing different kinds of dynamical patterns in synthetic and real data.},

This article defines and analyzes the properties of the data-driven F-transform, with a focus on the construction of the class of data-driven membership functions, which are multiscale, local, linearly independent, intrinsic, and robust to data discretization. Data-driven membership functions are defined by applying a 1-D filter to the Laplace–Beltrami operator, which encodes the geometric and topological properties of the input data. Then, we address the efficient computation of the data-driven F-transform through a polynomial or a rational polynomial approximation of the input filter. In this way, the computation of the data-driven F-transform is independent of the evaluation of the membership functions at any point of the input domain and reduces to the solution of a small set of sparse and symmetric linear systems. Finally, the data-driven F-transform is efficiently evaluated on large and arbitrary data, in terms of dimensionality, structure, and size.},

Then, improved delay-dependent stability and stabilization criteria are derived for the studied systems. Compared with the traditional methods, since the third-order Bessel–Legendre inequality and the extended reciprocally convex matrix inequality are well employed in the derivative of the constructed LKF to give tighter bounds of the single integral terms, the conservatism of derived criteria is further reduced. In addition, the quadratic fuzzy Lyapunov matrix introduced in LKF, which contains the quadratic membership functions, is also an important reason for obtaining less conservative results. Finally, numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed method is less conservative than some existing ones and the studied system can be well controlled by the designed controller.},

Specifically, for achieving classification task, we first propose a method to update the granular reduct, and then explore the updating mechanism of fuzzy granular rule in a reduced dataset. Second, a novel fuzzy rule-based classification model named FRCM is presented for fuzzy granular rule learning.

For the asymmetric cylinder hydraulic actuator over actuated by multiple servo valves, optimal servo valve openings are dynamic regulated to track the target force with weight adaptive nonlinear model predictive lower control. Benefiting from saved communication resource while more sparsely generating piecewise target force, as well as precise regulation by reasonably allocating over actuated valve openings to produce required force, the obtained results indicating more comfortable ride performance and less tire dynamic loads within smaller suspension chatter space favorably demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.},

The nonlinear MASs contain unknown dynamics and only an output variable can be measured. The other states are not measured directly and are reconstructed via fuzzy state observers. The presence of output feedback makes the proposed design significantly different from the existing literature on control with funnel performance. In particular, appropriate adaptive laws must be defined to handle the presence of uncertain dynamics and local output information from a few neighboring nodes. Interestingly, with a suitable error transformation, it is shown that the proposed control law has a simpler structure than barrier function methods proposed in the literature to handle funnel-like performance. With respect to this point, simulation studies illustrate that the proposed method can dramatically reduce the control effort while satisfying transient and steady-state performance imposed by the funnel.},

  abstract     = {Three-way decision is consistent with human cognitive processes and applied to different information systems. However, since the real world is more imprecision, hesitation, and ambiguity, experts can select interval fuzzy information to represent their evaluations. In the evaluation process, experts sometimes may not guarantee the interval fuzzy information satisfy the constraint between membership and nonmembership, which further impacts make decisions. Interval-valued $q$ -rung orthopair fuzzy set (IVq-ROFS) are proposed to improve the fault-tolerant ability and ensure the experts’ evaluation make sense. In this case, this article generalizes IVq-ROFS to three-way decision, which consists of the construction of three-way decision and the aggregation of interval continuity of IVq-ROFS. For considering the aggregation of interval continuity of IVq-ROFS, we first investigate the IVq-ROFS integral to aggregate continuous IVq-ROFSs by developing simplified interval-valued $q$ -rung orthopair fuzzy set. Particularly, in order to obtain integrable region, we design $\varepsilon$ -amendment to amend integral region of IVq-ROFS for removing unmeaning point in advance. To simplify the calculation, we further utilize Taylor series of the integral function to replace the complicated integral function. Second, a new equivalence class method is constructed to support three-way decision. Third, with the aid of the integral of IVq-ROFS and equivalence class method, we availably fuse the loss functions of the equivalence class and obtain the classifying rules of three-way decision by comparing the expected losses. Finally, we elaborate three-way decision by using a case of medical diagnosis about nephropathy and prove the validity of the investigated model.},

Fuzzy logic systems are introduced to solve the problem of unknown nonlinear dynamics. And on this basis, a fuzzy-based state observer is designed to observe the unmeasurable state. Further, by combining the adaptive back-stepping control algorithm and the nonlinear filters, a novel dynamic surface control (DSC) method is proposed, which not only solves the computational complexity explosion problem inherent in the back-stepping control algorithm, but also improves the control performance, in contrast to the traditional DSC methods with linear filters. Besides, to further improve the tracking performance under the structure of full-states prescribed performance, a new Lyapunov function is designed considering the transform error constraint. Based on the Lyapunov theory, the stability of the closed-loop system is analyzed to ensure that all signals of the closed-loop system are semiglobal practical finite-time stability. Finally, to elaborate on the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed control method, a simulation example is provided.},

  abstract     = {Recently, frequent emergencies seriously impact people’s life and production. The timely emergency material can save more people. Hence, emergency material demand prediction is a core of emergency rescue. However, emergency is a continuous, uncertain evolution process. The emergency of different periods has various situations. The time-varying and uncertain characteristics of emergency have made this representation and prediction work much more complex. In order to address this concern, this article proposes a time-varying intuitionistic fuzzy set (TVIFS) to precisely depict the time-varying scenario and the uncertainty of emergencies. For utilizing the TVIFS of different time frames, we deeply explore the integral aggregation operator of TVIFS, which can take full account of decision hesitation and possible information. Due to the different time importance of different time frames, we investigate the integral of TVIFS with constant period weight in advance. Considering the time-varying period weight, the TVIFS integral with time-varying period weight is investigated. For the sake of calculation feasibility, inspired by the relationship between continuity and dispersion, we translate the TVIFS integral with variable period weight into the TVIFS integral with constant period weight. Furthermore, we develop time-varying intuitionistic fuzzy case-based reasoning (CBR) model to forecast the emergency materials demand by designing hybrid similarity between cases. Finally, we elaborate the application of time-varying intuitionistic fuzzy CBR model by using an example of forest fire and verify the validity of our proposed method.},

  abstract     = {As one of the most commonly used clustering methods, the fuzzy C-means (FCM) clustering strategy extends the notion of hard clustering to associate each pattern with every cluster using a membership function. Although a lot of efforts have been made by the clustering community, it is still unclear how to evaluate the fuzziness of different versions of FCM. To fill this theoretical blank, by observing a family of objective functions, a definition of fuzzy degree is provided to quantify the fuzziness of different versions of FCM according to their dedicated objective functions. Then, a general fuzzy C-means (GFCM) clustering algorithm is proposed to solve the clustering problem of using FCM under different distance metrics and fuzzy degrees. From the perspective of fuzzy attribute, the using of this fuzzy degree can be used to reveal the essential difference among a group of FCM-based clustering algorithms, and the proposed GFCM achieves the aim of using objective functions to control the fuzziness of clustering results. Additionally, some properties and relations of these FCM-based clustering algorithms under different fuzzy degrees are discussed and the convergence and stability of the proposed GFCM are proved. Finally, extensive experiments have been performed to demonstrate that by comparison with the effect caused by distance metric, the choices of fuzzy degree have a more significant effect and improvement on the performances of a FCM-based clustering algorithm.},

For the stabilization process, a controller that does not share the same membership functions as the system is considered and the state feedback is quantized by using a logarithmic quantizer. The desired stability criterion for the addressed fuzzy system is first derived without the control term. It is then extended to the case in which the proposed controller is present. The stability criteria are given in the form of matrix inequalities, which are supported by the augmented Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional, generalized free-weighting-matrix approach and Finsler’s lemma. Moreover, as a special case, an asymptotic stability criterion is obtained and used in a comparative study. As a result, the time-delay interval is much larger than some of the works published very recently, which is due to the augmented Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional construction. In addition, the effectiveness and practicability of the theoretical findings are validated with simulation examples.},

To improve the generalization performance, an FNN with a multiobjective optimization algorithm (MOO-FNN) is proposed in this article. First, the multilevel learning objectives are designed around the generalization performance to guide the training process of an FNN. Then, the method utilizes the approximation error, the structure complexity, and the output smoothness indicators instead of a single indicator to improve the evaluation accuracy of generalization performance. Second, an MOO algorithm with continuous–discrete variables is developed to optimize the FNN. Then, MOO is able to use a novel particle update method to adjust both the structure and parameters rather than adjusting them separately, thereby achieving suitable generalization performance of the FNN. Third, the convergence of MOO-FNN is analyzed in detail to guarantee its successful applications. Finally, the experimental studies of MOO-FNN have been performed on model identification of nonlinear systems to verify the effectiveness. The results illustrate that MOO-FNN has a significant improvement over some state-of-the-art algorithms.},

  abstract     = {This article proposes a novel Stackelberg-game-oriented optimal control approach to address the bounded constraint-following control problem for uncertain mechanical systems. First, the uncertainties (possibly fast time-varying) in the system are assumed to be bounded with an unknown boundary, which lies in a specified fuzzy evidence number. In practical engineering, bounded system performance is always demanded, such as the inequality constraint. A diffeomorphism transformation approach is proposed to transform the constrained system into a restructured one satisfying the bounded constraint. Second, we propose an adaptive robust control oriented by the constraint-following control to render the restructured system to follow the specified constraints accurately with deterministic performance (guaranteeing uniform boundedness and uniform ultimate boundedness). The self-adjusting adaptive law (leakage-type) can compensate for the uncertainties and avoid overcompensation. Third, a Stackelberg-game-oriented optimization approach is proposed to obtain the optimal control parameters based on the fuzzy evidence theory. In the optimization approach, the two control parameters $\sigma$ and $\varepsilon$ are considered as two players with respective cost functions related to system performance and control cost. Furthermore, the optimization problem is solved by obtaining the Stackelberg strategy, which is proved to exist in analytic form. Ultimately, the permanent magnet synchronous linear motor system simulation is presented to show the design process and the excellent performance of the proposed optimal control scheme.},

Traditional machine learning in distributed environment often involves sharing sensitive information with other sites or transferring data to a central server on which a global model is trained. These situations increase the communication overhead and pose serious threats to the privacy of sensitive data. Federated learning opens up the possibility for collaboratively training a global model on a basis of distributed on-site data without sacrificing data privacy. While fuzzy rule-based models have been used in system modeling due to their substantial modeling abilities and good interpretability, the implementation of fuzzy rule-based models in a distributed environment without compromising data privacy still requires careful consideration. This article proposes a two-step federated learning approach to train a global model on a basis of private data located across different sites without their centralization. The first step concerns the determination of the structure of the data through federated collaborative clustering. Subsequently, a shared global model is trained jointly by all the participating clients. An advantage of the proposed method is that it achieves high accuracy without violating data privacy. A series of experimental studies are conducted to gain a detailed insight into the realization steps and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

It takes the role of normalization and accumulation of local risks coming from each action either splitting data from a cluster or merging data into a cluster. fRisk( C ) exploits the local distribution information of the database to catch the global information of the clustering process in the form of the risk degree. Based on the monotonous reduction property of fRisk( C ), which is proved theoretically, we present a fRisk-based new algorithm named fRisk4-bA for determining C opt . In the algorithm, the well-known L-method is employed as a supplemented tool to catch C opt on the graph of the fRisk( C ). Along with the stable convergence trend of the method to be proved theoretically, numerical surveys are also carried out. The surveys show that the high reliability and stability, as well as the sensitivity in separating/merging clusters in high-density areas, even if the presence of noise in the databases, are the strong points of the proposed method.},

A common drawback of the existing algorithms for monotonic classification is their sensitivity to noise data which particularly refer to monotonicity violations in the monotonic circumstance. Motivated by weakening the impact of noises, the fuzzy monotonic K -nearest neighbor (FM K NN) is proposed in this article, which constructs monotonic classifiers by taking advantage of the fuzzy dominance relation between a pair of instances, especially that between incomparable instances for the first time. Through tuning the thresholds of fuzzy dominance relation degrees, FM K NN intends to decrease the disturbance caused by noises which considerably affect the selection range of the K -nearest neighbors in different extent. The experimental results show that the best average improvement degrees of FM K NN in terms of the K NN-based and non- K NN-based classifiers on all the involved datasets arrive at 28 $\%$ , 11 $\%$ , and 29 $\%$ with respect to ACCU, MAE, and NMI, respectively, which demonstrates the superiority of our proposed FM K NN over other state-of-the-art monotonic classifiers including the monotonic fuzzy K -nearest neighbor (MF K NN) which disperses the impact of noise data by converting crisp class labels into class membership vectors.},

In this article, we focus on exploring the connection and interplay of these two methods, and further propose the hierarchical fuzzy rough approximations in the dynamic fuzzy open-world environment. We utilize the temporal-spatial perspectives of three-way decisions to construct multigranularity structures and implement multigranularity learning. The temporality of data and the spatiality of model parameters are both considered in such frameworks. Subsequently, we discuss the interpretation and representation of fuzzy three-way regions in fuzzy rough sets with some definitions and properties. The max, double, and aggregated evaluation-based models of three-way approximations are proposed to gradually transform a fuzzy concept to a crisp concept by the time-evolving attributes. Finally, the comparative experimental results between static and dynamic approaches demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed hierarchical approximation learning models.},

  abstract     = {Complex networks have been widely adopted to represent a variety of complicated systems. Given a complex network, it is of great significance to perform accurate clustering for better understanding its intrinsic organization. To this end, a fuzzy-based clustering algorithm, i.e., FCAN, has been developed. Though effective, FCAN suffers from the disadvantage of slow convergence, which in return constrains its efficiency. To address this issue, this article proposes a fast fuzzy clustering algorithm, namely, F $^2$ CAN, which incorporates a generalized momentum method into FCAN. Its fast convergence is rigorous justified in theory. Empirical studies on five datasets from real applications demonstrate that F $^2$ CAN achieves a better performance when compared with FCAN and several state-of-the-art clustering algorithms in terms of convergence rate and clustering accuracy simultaneously. Hence, F $^2$ CAN has potential for addressing the clustering analysis of large-scale complex networks emerging from industrial applications.},

  abstract     = {Network security requires effective detection and proper analysis of abnormal network behavior. To address the uncertainty associated with the process of network intrusion detection, this article proposes a network intrusion-detection algorithm based on dynamic intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs). We use the classic network intrusion datasets KDD 99, NSL-KDD, and the massive, high-dimensional dataset UNSW-NB15 to evaluate the performance of our proposed algorithm. First, we perform data preprocessing on these three datasets and select features based on the results of a chi-square test. Second, using time-series processing, we construct dynamic intuitionistic fuzzy patterns from the feature-selected datasets. At last, we use a proposed distance measure for the dynamic IFSs to generate a classifier that facilitates the detection of network intrusion. Experimental results show that the classification performance of the proposed algorithm is superior to that of other state-of-the-art algorithms on the three aforementioned datasets. The achieved improvement in classification performance is particularly significant for large datasets.},

Dealing with affine nonlinear system based on T–S fuzzy model has drawn much attention in the literature recently. In this article, a robust control method is proposed for affine nonlinear system with disturbance based on T–S fuzzy model. First, an optimization T–S fuzzy model is constructed focusing on optimizing the parameters of the weight functions by using differential evolution algorithm. Second, in order to reconstruct the disturbance, an interval observer is designed for the affine nonlinear system, and then a novelty disturbance reconstruction method based on the interval observer is developed. The disturbance reconstruction value can asymptotically approach the actual disturbance value, and furthermore, it decouples the control input. Third, by taking the optimization T–S fuzzy model as design model and by introducing the reconstruction of disturbance into controller, a feedback robust controller with disturbance compensation is designed to stabilize the affine nonlinear system. Finally, a simulation example of the crane model is given and some comparisons are provided to verify the effectiveness and show the advantages of the proposed method.},

Next, the fuzzy redundancy is defined by using the difference between the fuzzy relevance and the fuzzy conditional relevance. Thereby, the evaluation index of the feature importance is obtained by using the idea of unsupervised minimum redundancy and maximum relevance. Finally, a fuzzy-mutual-information-based unsupervised feature selection algorithm is designed to select feature sequences. Extensive experiments are conducted on public datasets, and six unsupervised feature selection algorithms are compared. The selected features are evaluated by classification, clustering, and outlier detection methods.

While there have been intensive studies on building and analyzing federated regression models, this topic has not been analyzed so far in the area of fuzzy systems. To narrow down this gap, in this study, we formulate and solve a problem of unsupervised federated learning by designing an original federated FCM (F-FCM) clustering which could serve as a basis toward building a spectrum of fuzzy set constructs including rule-based models. Following a general client–server structure, where the local data residing with each client are not available globally and cannot be centralized (as commonly encountered in learning scenarios), the aim is to discover an overall structure across all data. The federated gradient-based optimization realized in the horizontal mode is developed. An overall learning process is derived, which is composed of communicating gradients coming from clients and providing updates of the prototypes at the server side and passing them on to the clients. It is also shown that the relevance of the globally constructed structure is conveniently assessed in terms of granular footprints of the prototypes constructed by the F-FCM. Some illustrative examples are covered to illustrate the efficiency of the developed federated algorithm.},

This article puts forward a novel granulation algorithm involving two-stage partitioning scheme so that information granule established there exhibits well-articulated semantics at the time level, while at the same time, it gives full consideration to the varying patterns of data. On this basis, a new association rule based on this type of information granules is presented. Unlike most fuzzy association rules, the proposed association rules can extract and derive the correlations between two collections of trend features corresponding to the past and future, which is in accord with human&#39;s reasoning. Keeping in mind that the prediction process should center on essential rules while freeing from the interference of irrelevant rules, which contributes to a reliable prediction result, thus, a rule selection algorithm is involved so as one makes sure the accuracy and interpretability of the forecasting results. The design of short-term forecasting model based on fuzzy inference system is implemented, where the concept of granulation eliminates the commonly used alternative, i.e., the recursive iterations of one-step prediction.

Meanwhile, an augmented Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional (LKF) is newly constructed, which strengthens the correlations of the PDE subsystem and ODE subsystem. Then, on the ground of the fuzzy-dependent PWI and the augmented LKF, new exponential stabilization criteria are set up for the PDE-ODE coupled systems.

The main idea consists of finding a continuous fuzzy gain such that any linear behavior, defined by the adequate selection of eigenvalues, is induced in the closed-loop fuzzy system. Therefore, by continuity, if the fuzzy model is an approximation sufficiently close to the mechanical system, then such a nonlinear system is also stabilized by the fuzzy controller. A notable advantage of the proposed method, when compared with similar approaches, is the simplicity of the resulting gain. The validity of the approach is illustrated through the numerical simulation of a sufficiently complex nonlinear system.},

  abstract     = {In this article, the issue of intermittent event-triggered exponential stabilization for state-dependent switched fuzzy neural networks with mixed delays is discussed and resolved. By combining event-triggered control with intermittent control, an intermittent event-triggered control strategy is proposed, which only focuses on events during control time. Consequently, compared with some existing event-triggered control strategies, it greatly reduces the amount of samplings and saves control costs. Based on the fuzzy intermittent event-triggered controller designed in this article, two event-triggering mechanisms are proposed to determine the trigger instants. In this context, some easily testified algebraic conditions are obtained for the exponential stabilization of the state-dependent switched fuzzy neural networks with mixed delays. In addition, a positive lower bound for the inter-event time is given. The results of theoretical analysis are verified through a simulation example.},

First, a CPS-based fuzzy LFC system is established to reduce the wear and tear of the generating unit equipment. Then, based on the Lyapunov stability theory, a stability criterion of the LFC system is proposed to ensure the stable operation of the LFC system, which considers the threshold parameter of the event-triggered condition and the fuzzy gain in the fuzzy LFC system. Next, based on the stability criterion and the Gaussian-type curve-fitting method, a functional expression between the fuzzy gain and the threshold parameter is obtained. According to the expression, the threshold parameter is updated in real time with the change of fuzzy gain, so as to further save usage of the communication network bandwidth. Case studies based on a one-area power system and an IEEE 39-bus benchmark test system are undertaken. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves three objectives: 1) to comply with CPS1 and CPS2 in the North American Electric Reliability Council; 2) to reduce wear and tear of the generating unit equipment; and 3) tosave more communication network resources.},

  abstract     = {The issue of mining influential nodes in complex networks is a topic of immense interest. Recently, many methods have been proposed, but they suffer from certain limitations. In this article, a novel centrality measure based on local fuzzy information centrality (LFIC) is proposed. LFIC puts forward the concept that the inner structure of a node’s box contains information about the node’s importance. LFIC uses the amount of information contained in the node’s box as a measure of its importance. In LFIC, the uncertainty of information contained in nodes’ boxes is measured by the improved Shannon entropy. Most importantly, fuzzy logic is applied to deal with the uncertainty of neighbor nodes’ contributions to the center node’s importance, which is neglected by most existing methods. To verify the effectiveness of our proposed method, six existing methods are used for comparison and five experiments are conducted using six real-world complex networks. The experimental results indicate that the influential nodes identified by LFIC can cause a wider scope of infection in networks and have a larger effect on the network connectivity, thereby proving the effectiveness and accuracy of LFIC. The correlation between nodes’ LFIC values and their real infection ability is highly positive according to Kendall’s tau coefficient, proving LFIC’s credibility and superiority. The extension of LFIC, namely the bi-directional local fuzzy information centrality, is also proposed to explore its feasibility in weighted directed complex networks.},

It not only improves the accuracy and interpretability of neuro-fuzzy models but also solves the challenging problem that models are incapable of determining the optimal architecture autonomously. BL-DFIS first accomplishes a TSK fuzzy system under the framework of BLS, in which an extreme learning machine auto-encoder is employed to obtain feature representation in a fast and analytical way, and an interpretable linguistic fuzzy rule is integrated into the enhancement node to ensure the high interpretability of the system. Meanwhile, the extended-enhancement unit is designed to achieve the first-order TSK fuzzy system. In addition, a dynamic incremental learning algorithm with internal pruning and updating mechanism is developed for the learning of BL-DFIS, which enables the system to automatically assemble the optimal structure to obtain a compact rule base and an excellent classification performance. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed BL-DFIS can achieve a better classification performance than some state-of-the-art nonfuzzy and neuro-fuzzy methods, simultaneously using the most parsimonious model structure.},

Specifically, the deception attacks are considered in the filter, where the adversary attempts to inject some false information data in the measurement output to modify the transmitted signal in the communication networks. We introduce, respectively, two sets of stochastic variables satisfying the Bernoulli distribution to depict the probability of the data transmitted by the network being subjected to time-varying coupling delays and deception attacks. By using Lyapunov–Krasovskii stability theory and Abel lemma-based finite-sum inequality, a new set of sufficient conditions is established, which ensures the stochastic stability of the resulting error system with a prescribed mixed $H_\infty$ and passivity performance index. The proposed filter parameters are obtained by solving linear matrix inequalities. Ultimately, both the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed asynchronous filter with deception attacks are verified by two numerical examples including a tunnel diode circuit model.},

The overall control objective lies in utilizing an event-triggered control input to regulate the angular velocities of the rigid body and stabilize the vibrations of the flexible panel under unknown input disturbances and prescribed spatial motion performance. We collectively address the posture regulation and disturbance rejection purposes by introducing a barrier Lyapunov function and a fuzzy logic system. The event-triggered solution only updates the control signals at some discrete-time instants, and hence the communication burden is reduced significantly.

More specifically, we assume that the TBox component is coherent, stable, and fully reliable. However, the ABox component may be inconsistent with respect to the TBox, partially preordered and uncertain. Uncertainty is encoded in the framework of possibility theory. In this context, we propose an extension of standard possibilistic DL-Lite. We represent the ABox as a symbolic weighted base, where the weights attached to the assertions are ordered according to a strict partial order. We define a tractable method for computing a single possibilistic repair for a partially preordered weighted ABox. The idea is to consider the possibilistic compatible bases of such an ABox, which intuitively encode all the possible extensions of a partial order, and compute the possibilistic repair of each compatible base. We then compute the intersection of all these possibilistic repairs to obtain a single repair for the initial ABox. We also provide an equivalent characterization by introducing the notion of $\pi$ -accepted assertions. This ensures that the computation of the partially preordered possibilistic repair can be achieved in polynomial time in DL-Lite.},

First, with a suitable Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional and an integral inequality in stochastic setting, an AET control criterion of SPFSSs considering asynchronous premise is established to ensure the mean-square admissibility and extended dissipativity of the closed-loop singular system. Additionally, a simple lemma is employed to approximate the nonconvex sum-of-squares (SOS) conditions with the convex SOS conditions due to the difficulty in solving the nonconvex SOS design conditions.

  abstract     = {This article proposes an integrated design approach addressing the state/fault estimation (SFE) and fault-tolerant control (FTC) issues for switched T–S fuzzy systems with sensor and actuator faults and external disturbances. A switched fuzzy observer is developed to simultaneously estimate the system states and the sensor and actuator faults from measurement outputs affected by sensor faults. Based on this observer, a switched fuzzy FTC is designed to stabilize the closed-loop system and compensate for the effects of different considered faults, taking into account the presence of external disturbances. The mutual coupling between the estimation unit (SFE) and the control unit (FTC) supports the integrated design of these two units instead of the separated one. However, the separated design is the most adopted in the literature because the integrated design leads to complex stability conditions in the form of bilinear matrix inequalities. This work focuses on the integrated design considering the different interactions between the observer and the controller and thus ensuring good performance in terms of estimation, control, robustness, and fault compensation. For this purpose, a two-step integrated design strategy and a single-step integrated design strategy are proposed to formalize the integrated SFE and FTC design as linear matrix inequalities instead of bilinear ones. These strategies are based on the mode-dependent average dwell time concept, the piecewise Lyapunov function technique, and the robust $H_{\infty }$ approach. The applicability and efficiency of the developed results are illustrated by studying a numerical example and a single-link robotic manipulator.},

Second, two novel resilient adaptive event-triggered mechanisms are proposed to resist the impact of denial-of-service attacks and discard unnecessary data packets, in which the dynamic threshold variable is designed to adjust the event-triggered condition adaptively. A problem caused by the event-triggered mechanism is that the controller or filter cannot receive the system mode signal during the trigger interval. To surmount this problem, this article designs an estimator to compensate for the unavailable system mode. Then, an adaptive event-triggered controller or filter related to the estimated mode is designed to track the desired signal. Under this framework, by constructing a membership-function-dependent Lyapunov function, the conservativeness of the stability criterion is relaxed.

However, the TSK fuzzy system becomes complex and challenging to interpret as the data dimension increases. Here, we report an ensemble classifier, which is an enhanced adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) integrating improved bagging and dropout to build concise fuzzy rule sets. First, the high-dimensional feature space is decomposed into a series of low-dimensional feature subsets using the bagging and random subspace method to train multiple ANFISs. An improved dropout strategy is then applied in training ANFISs by temporarily disabling rules in each training epoch and deleting rules after training to obtain sparse rulesets with high-quality rules. These sub-models are subsequently aggregated to perform the fuzzy inference. Results on high-dimensional benchmark datasets confirm that both the bagging and dropout strategies are effective, providing high interpretability by reducing the co-firing degrees and rules of sub-models while guaranteeing accuracy at the same time.},

For the time-independent linear performance function with independently, regularly, and identically distributed fuzzy inputs, the analytical relationship is first derived between the failure credibility and fuzzy safety index, and the relation form is established between fuzzy safety index and fuzzy first two moments of the performance function. Second, in the standard space of fuzzy inputs, the minimum infinite norm distance from the coordinate origin to the linear limit state surface is analytically derived, and the point with the smallest infinite norm distance located on the limit state surface is defined as the fuzzy design point. Based on this definition, the geometric and physical meanings are explained for the fuzzy safety index and fuzzy design point, and the FFOSM method for time-independent failure credibility analysis is established for both linear and nonlinear performance function. Third, for time-dependent performance functions, the equivalence is proved between time-dependent fuzzy safety index and the minimum value of transient fuzzy safety indices, on which the iteration steps of the FFOSM method is designed for time-dependent fuzzy safety index and failure credibility estimation.

  abstract     = {Trading strategies can be divided into two categories, i.e., those with momentum characteristic and those that appear contrarian. The characteristics of trading strategies have been widely studied; however, there has been relatively little work on the characteristics of stocks. Furthermore, there is no standard approach to the classification of stocks in terms of momentum and contrarian. This article presents a fuzzy momentum contrarian uncertain characteristic system for the classification and quantification of stock characteristics. Random trading, stop-loss, and take-profit mechanisms are first used to identify characteristics, and then, a novel profitability index with a type-2 fuzzy set module is used to quantify them. In the experiments, 41 stocks on the Taiwan 50 index were deemed suitable for momentum strategies, whereas nine stocks were deemed suitable for contrarian strategies. An uphill relationship between profitability index and trading performance is observed, which produced correlation coefficients of 0.148–0.539 and a classification accuracy of 52.0–60.0\%. However, the proposed system greatly improved classification performance, resulting in correlation coefficients of 0.572–0.722 with an accuracy of 63.6–84.5\%. In the real-world application, the proposed system outperforms the benchmark among all datasets and increases the profitability by 1.5 times on the Taiwan 50 dataset. These results clearly demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed system in the quantification and classification of stocks suited to momentum- and contrarian-type trading strategies and also in the real-world applications.},

First, a new scale-limited Halanay inequality is demonstrated by timescale theory. Next, on the basis of inequality techniques on time scales, some new scale-limited algebraic criteria and linear matrix inequality criteria of Lagrange stability are obtained by comparison strategy and generalized Halanay inequality. All scale-limited sufficient criteria of Lagrange stability for FMNNs not only apply to continuous-time FMNNs and their discrete-time analogs, but also could deal with the arbitrary combination of them.

  abstract     = {Recently, distributed semisupervised learning (DSSL) algorithms have shown their effectiveness in leveraging unlabeled samples over interconnected networks, where agents cannot share their original data with each other and can only communicate nonsensitive information with their neighbors. However, existing DSSL algorithms cannot cope with data uncertainties and may suffer from high computation and communication overhead problems. To handle these issues, we propose a distributed semisupervised fuzzy regression (DSFR) model with fuzzy if-then rules and interpolation consistency regularization (ICR). The ICR, which was proposed recently for semisupervised problem, can force decision boundaries to pass through sparse data areas, thus increasing model robustness. However, its application in distributed scenarios has not been considered yet. In this work, we proposed a distributed fuzzy C-means (DFCM) method and a distributed interpolation consistency regularization (DICR) built on the well-known alternating direction method of multipliers to respectively locate parameters in antecedent and consequent components of DSFR. Notably, the DSFR model converges very fast since it does not involve back-propagation procedure and is scalable to large-scale datasets benefiting from the utilization of DFCM and DICR. Experiments results on both artificial and real-world datasets show that the proposed DSFR model can achieve much better performance than the state-of-the-art DSSL algorithm in terms of both loss value and computational cost. Our code is available online. 1},

Moreover, the jumping property presented by system modes is described by the Markov chain of which transition probabilities are considered to be piecewise time-varying, and is described by adopting the more flexible persistent dwell-time switching rule. Based on the stochastic analysis approach and Lyapunov stability theory, some sufficient conditions are established to ensure the resulting closed-loop system being mean-square exponentially stable with the prescribed $\mathcal {H}_{\infty }$ performance. Furthermore, the desired controller gains can be obtained through solving a convex optimization problem.

Then, an event-triggered output feedback control method is constructed for SbW systems to achieve the prespecified tracking performance. Much significantly, the jumping phenomenon of the control input caused by event-triggering communication can be eliminated by the proposed event-triggered control systems. Furthermore, theoretical analysis shows that the tracking error can converge to the preset neighborhood of origin within finite time, while the Zeno behavior can be avoided.

Different from intermittent control strategies referred in existing literatures, the control duration of the control strategy used in this article is based on discrete-time state observations, which makes the control used in this article somewhat less demanding and more effective. Under the aperiodically intermittent discrete-time state observations control strategy, a valid approach combining Lyapunov method with graph theory is proposed in this article. Throughout this article, a theorem and a corollary to the quasi-synchronization criterion of fuzzy heterogeneous complex networks are established. The results show that when the control gain is larger, the convergence domain is smaller.

To formulate the asynchronous phenomena between the system modes and the anticipant controller modes, the hidden Markov model is proposed. The primary attention is focused on the explicit design of the dynamic event-triggered strategy that can be dynamically adjusted in line with system information, which mitigates the communication burden efficiently. On this occasion, the information renewal of the controller is aperiodic. Furthermore, the nonlinear characteristics are effectually disposed through utilizing a unique IT2 T-S fuzzy model, which is with mismatched membership functions (MFs). As a result, the resulting closed-loop fuzzy multiagent systems are accompanied by mismatched MFs and asynchronous modes, whereafter, via solving the convex optimization problem, the desired controller gains are acquired. Eventually, the validity and practicability of the developed control scheme are illustrated by two examples.},

Although multiple view learning has achieved great success in many applications, it still faces several challenges. One of them is how to reduce the negative impact of the missing views in incomplete multiple view datasets by fully exploiting the information available. Another challenge is how to enhance the interpretability of the multiple view model for scenarios with high transparency requirement. To address these challenges, this article proposes a novel modeling method for incomplete multiple view fuzzy system. Based on fuzzy interpretable rules, the method integrates missing view imputation and hidden view learning as one single process to yield a model of high interpretability, where cooperative learning is used to mine the complementary information between the visible views and the hidden view. The proposed method has four advantages when compared with existing approaches: 1) the method is more interpretable, attributed to the fuzzy interpretable rules that it is based on, 2) missing view imputation is integrated into the modeling to make it more efficient than the existing two-step strategy, 3) the method not only imputes missing views, but also mines the hidden view shared by the multiple visible views, and 4) cooperative learning is used to mine the complementary information, which significantly reduces the negative impact of missing views. Experiments on real datasets demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method.},

One is that the introduction of fixed or adaptive single neighboring information with narrow receptive field limits contextual constraints leading to clutter segmentations. The other is that the incorporation of superpixels with wide receptive field enlarges spatial coherency leading to block effects. To address these challenges, we propose fuzzy STUDENT’S t-distribution model based on richer spatial combination (FRSC) for image segmentation. In this article, we make two significant contributions. The first is that both the narrow and wide receptive fields are integrated into the objective function of FRSC, which is convenient to mine image features and distinguish local difference. The second is that the rich spatial combination under STUDENT’S t-distribution ensures that spatial information is introduced into the updated parameters of FRSC, which is helpful in finding a balance between the noise-immunity and detail-preservation. Experimental results on synthetic and publicly available images further demonstrate that the proposed FRSC addresses successfully the limitations of FCM algorithms with spatial information, and provides better segmentation results than state-of-the-art clustering algorithms.},

An application to a CE150 helicopter with abrupt and intermittent faults is provided to verify the above approaches. The innovation of the article lies in the following points: i) The fault detection and fault-tolerant control for NSPSs are handled under the united model, which can avoid the incomplete decoupling problem caused by decomposing NSPSs as the slow and fast subsystems; ii) the estimate values for actuator faults are regarded as a state vector of the FHFD, and the output feedback control law is introduced into FHFD, which make the FHFD not only can accurately detect faults but also can stabilize the closed-loop system; iii) a new method to transform the nonlinear matrix inequalities into the LMIs is proposed; and iv) the presented FHFTC can avoid the problems of missing or inaccurate status information caused by the sensor faults because it adopts the state feedback of the FHFD.},

  abstract     = {In this study, we propose an adaptive fuzzy event-triggered control scheme for an autonomous aerial refueling hose system involving uncertainty, an event-triggered mechanism, and actuator failures. The unknown nonlinear function is approximated using the designed fuzzy logic systems. Through introduction of the adaptive compensation scheme, the problem of an infinite number of actuator failures, including partial and complete failures, is solved. In addition, the event-triggered control strategy is designed to achieve vibration suppression while decreasing the communication burden between the controllers and actuators. The stability of the closed-loop system is demonstrated via the Lyapunov direct method. Finally, simulation examples are presented to confirm the validity of the proposed control scheme.},

By designing a brand-new unknown input observer (UIO), unknown state, sensor, and actuator faults can be reconstructed simultaneously, where some constraints imposed on the actuator fault such as the first derivative of fault being equal to zero required in the previous results are not needed in our work. With the support of this estimation information, a FTC scheme is well established, by which the system may recover its performance even in the occurrence of faults. Another contribution of the developed method is that all the stability criteria are deduced via fuzzy Lyapunov functions. It makes the obtained conditions more relaxed than the ones derived by quadratic Lyapunov functions. Finally, simulation results conducted on two practical dynamics are provided to show the validity of the achieved procedure.},

  abstract     = {Wang–Mendel (WM) fuzzy system is an effective and interpretable model for solving tabular data classification problem. However, original WM fuzzy system is weak in handling dataset with high dimensionality or large volume. Meanwhile, its capability of characterizing data is narrow, which results from lacking hierarchical transformation of features like deep learning-based models. In this article, we propose a deep fuzzy rule-based classification system (DFRBCS) based on improved WM method, in which fuzzy technique and deep learning strategy are combined to make a desirable tradeoff between model’s interpretability and prediction accuracy. We first redefine the consequent part of fuzzy rule in WM fuzzy system with class probability vector, which endows the improved WM fuzzy system with capacity for serving as building block of deep model. The model structure of DFRBCS is designed in layer-by-layer manner, where raw features can be transformed hierarchically. For every layer in DFRBCS, it contains many improved WM fuzzy systems whose input spaces are generated by shuffling and sliding window operation on concatenated outputs of fuzzy systems in previous layer. Comparative experiments are conducted on 45 real-world datasets with various sizes and dimensionality between our method, five baseline models, and the other deep fuzzy classifiers (D-TSK-FC, HID-TSK-FC, FCCI-TSK, DSA-FC, and MEEFIS). The experimental results show that DFRBCS is competitive in classification performance and promising in model’s interpretability.},

However, this function only retains the maximum membership degree of a sample to one decision class, it cannot describe the classification error. Therefore, in this article, a novel criterion function for feature selection is proposed to overcome this weakness. To characterize the classification error rate, we first introduce a class of irreflexive and symmetric fuzzy binary relations to redefine the concepts of fuzzy rough approximations. Then, we propose a novel concept of dependency: inner product dependency to describe the classification error and construct a criterion function to evaluate the importance of candidate features. The proposed criterion function not only can maintain a maximum dependency function, but also guarantees the minimum classification error. The experimental analysis shows that the proposed criterion function is effective for datasets with a large overlap between different categories.},

To save mankind from this apocalyptic onslaught, it is essential to curb the fast spreading of this dreadful virus. Moreover, the absence of specialized drugs has made the scenario even more badly and thus an early-stage adoption of necessary precautionary measures would provide requisite supportive treatment for its prevention. The prime objective of this article is to use radiological images as a tool to help in early diagnosis. The interval type 2 fuzzy clustering is blended with the concept of superpixels, and metaheuristics to efficiently segment the radiological images. Despite noise sensitivity of watershed-based approach, it is adopted for superpixel computation owing to its simplicity where the noise problem is handled by the important edge information of the gradient image is preserved with the help of morphological opening and closing based reconstruction operations. The traditional objective function of the fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm is modified to incorporate the spatial information from the neighboring superpixel-based local window. The computational overhead associated with the processing of a huge amount of spatial information is reduced by incorporating the concept of superpixels and the optimal clusters are determined by a modified version of the flower pollination algorithm. Although the proposed approach performs well but should not be considered as an alternative to gold standard detection tests of COVID-19. Experimental results are found to be promising enough to deploy this approach for real-life applications.},

However, the feature evaluation function developed with kernelized fuzzy rough sets cannot better reflect the affinity relationship of samples and is time-consuming. To overcome these drawbacks, in this article, the problem of feature selection with kernelized fuzzy rough sets is studied based on the spectral graph theory. First, the within-class and between-class sample similarity matrices by using kernelized fuzzy approximation operators are constructed. Two operators, which can capture the affinity relationship of samples, are then introduced based on the sample similarity matrices. The proposed operator can be regarded as the sum of the weighted kernelized fuzzy approximation operators. Second, based on the ratio criterion, a feature evaluation function and its corresponding feature selection algorithm FRKF are presented, which can effectively evaluate the importance of features. Third, to illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithm, extensive experiments have been carried out to compare FRKF and other well-known feature selection methods, including the feature ranking methods and feature subset selection methods on various classification tasks. The experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that FRKF achieves the high performances in terms of the robustness, efficiency, and effectiveness.},

In this study, we briefly revisit the methodology and concepts of interpretability of Takagi–Sugeno (T-S) rule-based models and develop a conceptual framework involving several levels at which rules are interpreted. The layers at which interpretability is positioned are structured hierarchically by starting with the initial fuzzy set level (originating from the design of the rules), moving to information granules of finite support (where interval calculus is engaged) and finally ending up with symbols built at the higher level. As T-S rule-based models are endowed with local functions forming the conclusion parts of the rules, with the use of the principle of justifiable granularity, we develop a way of forming an interpretable conclusion in the form of information granule. To facilitate interpretability of conditions of the rules, multidimensional fuzzy sets (coming as a result of clustering) are decomposed into a Cartesian product of 1-D fuzzy sets and the quality of the resulting decomposition is evaluated. The quality of granular rules is assessed by analyzing the relationship between specificity of condition and conclusion information granules. The rules emerging at the level of symbols are further interpreted by engaging linguistic approximation, which helps approximate a collection of linguistic terms of subconditions producing a linguistic summarization in the form τ (inputs are A ) consisting of a certain linguistic quantifier τ . The performance of summarization is provided in the form of ranking of the relevance of the rules. Experimental studies using publicly available data are completed and analyzed.},

To solve this problem, a syncretic fuzzy-neural controller (SFNC) was developed and analyzed in this article. First, the knowledge obtained from the operation conditions was made full use by a knowledge reconstruction mechanism to construct the initial condition of SFNC. Then, the proposed SFNC was able to obtain the accurate parameters and compact structure in the initialization phase. Second, a syncretic-form strategy (SFS) was designed to syncretize the knowledge from the fuzzy rules and the data from the operation process to optimize the structure of SFNC. Then, the adaptability of SFNC can be improved to achieve good control performance in the presence of insufficient data. Third, the stability of the developed SFNC was proved by using Lyapunov stability theorem. Then, the stability of SFNC was given to guarantee its successful application. Finally, the proposed controller was tested on the Benchmark Simulation Model No.1 to confirm its effectiveness. The results demonstrated that the proposed SFNC can achieve superior control performance than some other existing controllers.},

  abstract     = {This article addresses the fixed-time control problem for the constrained quarter active vehicle suspension systems (AVSSs) via an event-triggered based adaptive fuzzy fixed-time control method. The benefit of the usage of the time-varying barrier Lyapunov function is to avoid the violation of the time-varying displacement constraint so that the stability and safety of AVSSs can be guaranteed. The relative threshold based event-triggered controller is devised so as to reduce the communication burden from the controller to the actuator. In the light of fixed time theory, it is proved that both the stability and tracking performance of the closed-loop system can be obtained in fixed time. The fixed-time based event-triggered control strategy is independent of initial states of AVSSs in comparison with the existing finite-time results. Some simulation results and comparisons on a quarter-car AVSS indicate better performance in terms of feasible fixed-time control and exact trajectory tracking.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we present a study on the development in the theory and application of the Z-numbers since its inception in 2011. The review covers the formalization of Z-number-based mathematical operators, the role of Z-numbers in computing with words, decision-making, and trust modeling, application of Z-numbers in real-world problems such as multisensor data fusion, dynamic controller design, safety analytics, and natural language understanding, a brief comparison with conceptually similar paradigms, and some potential areas of future investigation. The paradigm currently has at least four extensions to its definition: multidimensional Z-numbers, parametric Z-numbers, hesitant-uncertain linguistic Z-numbers, and Z*-numbers. The Z-numbers have also been used in conjunction with rough sets and granular computing for enhanced uncertainty handling. While this decade has seen a plethora of theoretical initiatives toward its growth, there remains a major work scope in the direction of practical realization of the paradigm. Some challenges yet unresolved are automated translation of (imprecise, sarcastic, and metaphorical) linguistic expressions to their Z-number forms, discernment of probability–possibility distributions to map real-world situations under consideration, analysis of linguistic equivalents of Z-operator results to intuitive human responses, the endogenous arousal of belief in intelligent agents, and analysis of biases embedded in expert-belief values that are primary inputs to Z-number-based expert systems. After a decade of the Z-numbers, the paradigm has proved to be of use in expert-input-based decision-making systems and initial value problems. Its applicability in high-risk, high-precision areas, such as deep-sea exploration and space science, remains unexplored.},

Fuzzy systems, can not only depict uncertain and vague concepts widely existing in the real world, but also improve the prediction accuracy in deep learning models. Thus, it is important and necessary to go through the recent contributions about the fusion of deep learning and fuzzy systems. At first, we introduce the deep learning into fuzzy community from two perspectives: statistical results of relevant publications and conventional deep learning algorithms. Then, the fusing framework and graphic form of deep learning and fuzzy systems are constructed. Followed by, are the current situations of several types of fuzzy techniques used in deep learning, some reasons why use fuzzy techniques in deep learning, and the application fields of the fusion, respectively. Finally, some discussions and future challenges are provided regarding the fusion technology of deep learning and fuzzy systems, the application scenarios of fusing deep learning and fuzzy systems, and some limitations of the current fusion, respectively. After summarizing the recent contributions, we have found that this field is an emerging research direction and it is increasingly paying much more attention. Especially, fuzzy systems make great effects on deep learning models in the aspect of classification, prediction, natural language processing, auto-control, etc., and the fusion is applied into different fields, like but not limited to computer science, natural language, medical system, smart energy management systems and manufacturing industry.},

Many of the reported advances have provided more and more relaxed results via choosing higher order dependent gain matrices, which will be a trouble in the case of real-time implementation. Therefore, a multi-instant gain-scheduling fuzzy state-feedback controller with different working modes is given to stabilize the closed-loop systems by updating the enabled pair of lower order gain matrices in cycle. For each possible working mode, the real-time situation information of the normalized fuzzy weighting functions can be fully considered by using a set of time-variant balanced matrices in accordance to certain rules and, thus, much freedom is introduced for proposing less conservative results. More importantly, our relaxed result is obtained without requiring higher order dependent gain matrices than the existing ones, i.e., its conservatism is reduced in a more meaningful way and thus it is more conducive to real-time implementation. Finally, both the effectiveness and the superiority of the proposed results are discussed and validated in the numerical section.},

Different from the general quadratic Lyapunov function, the fuzzy Lyapunov functions contain the product of three term functions. Since the general Leibniz formula cannot be satisfied for fractional derivative, the current results on the fractional derivative for the quadratic Lyapunov functions cannot be extended to the fuzzy Lyapunov functions. Therefore, to estimate the fractional derivative of fuzzy Lyapunov functions, the fractional derivative rule for the product of three term functions is proposed. Based on the proposed fractional derivative rule, the corresponding stability and stabilization criteria are established, which extend the existing results.

Different from those existing methods, the enabled working pattern at each sampling instant can be determined in cycle according to utilization of the updated information of adjacent normalized fuzzy weighting functions in depth, and then the featured time-varying free matrices are introduced for each working pattern, which can remove those existing constraints on traditional free matrices. Consequently, the conservatism can be reduced significantly and it does broaden the range of application for observer-based fuzzy state estimation. Despite the fact that the quantity of the free matrices becomes much bigger than before, it needs to be pointed out that the actual computational complexity only increases by a small amount through depressing the number of cycles. Given that the developed designing process belongs to an offline computation, it is an acceptable tradeoff between the increasement of computational burdens and the reduction of conservatism.

In addition, the SERCFNN develops the advantages of the self-evolving fuzzy neural network (SEFNN), recurrent fuzzy neural network (RFNN), and Chebyshev function network (CFN).

The RFNN improves the performance for coping with a temporal problem with the capability to store prior information. The CFN is capable to enlarge the dimensionality of the input variables.

The merits of designed control can be presented as twofold: 1) by incorporating an EE-based technique into pioneering prescribed performance control methodology, the defined intermediate and output tracking errors are kept within the regions represented by preassigned functions and control parameters simultaneously and 2) expansive errors-related residual nonlinearity is approximated by fuzzy logic systems, which further ameliorates the output tracking performance by compensating the affects raised by composite inner and interconnection nonlinearities among subsystems. With the designed expansive errors-based fuzzy adaptive prescribed performance control, all the closed-loop signals are kept bounded in the sense of Lyapunov stability theorem.

  abstract     = {As a novel fuzzy covering, fuzzy $\beta$ covering has attracted considerable attention. However, the traditional fuzzy- $\beta$ -covering-based rough set and most of its extended models cannot well fit the distribution of samples in real data, which limits their application in classification learning and decision making. First, the upper and lower approximations of these models have no inclusion relation, so they cannot characterize a given objective concept accurately. Moreover, most of these models are hard to resist the influence of noise data, resulting in poor robustness in feature learning. For these reasons, a robust rough set model is set forth by combining fuzzy rough sets, covering-based rough sets, and multigranulation rough sets. To this end, the optimistic and pessimistic lower and upper approximations of a target concept are reconstructed by means of the fuzzy $\beta$ neighborhood related to a family of fuzzy coverings, and a new multigranulation fuzzy rough set model is presented. Furthermore, a fuzzy dependence function is introduced to evaluate the classification ability of a family of fuzzy $\beta$ coverings at different granularity levels. The dimensionality reduction of a given fuzzy covering decision table is carried out from the perspective of maintaining the discrimination power, and a forward algorithm for feature selection is developed by using the optimistic significance of candidate features as heuristic information. Three groups of numerical experiments on 16 different types of datasets demonstrate that the proposed model exhibits good robustness on datasets contaminated with noise and outperforms some state-of-the-art feature learning algorithms in terms of classification accuracy and the size of the selected feature subset.},

In this article, in order to address this issue, the sampled-data ESO design is investigated for a class of uncertain nonlinear systems. First, based on the fuzzy modeling approach with reasonable fuzzy rules and sets, the nonlinear functions of the ESO are suitably approximated by several local linear models weighted by membership functions. Then, a novel methodology of Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy extended state observer (TSFESO) is developed for the first time. By virtue of fuzzy membership functions, the estimating action is implemented in a nonlinear pattern, while taking advantages of Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy formulation, the observer gains can be calculated in a linear manner. As a result, the nonlinear estimating efficiency and linear numerical tractability are integrated in a unified framework. Second, for the aperiodic sampling case, the exponential convergence criterion for the TSFESO is presented by constructing a sampling- and time-dependent Lyapunov functional, in which the information on sampling action is taken into full consideration for desirable feasibility. Moreover, the observer design approach is also put forward. Finally, the superiorities and effectiveness of the proposed approaches are demonstrated by numerical examples.},

  abstract     = {This article presents a novel network, contribution-degree-based spiking neural network (CDSNN), which combines ideas of spiking neural network (SNN) and fuzzy set theory. In this framework, two types of information, interval and instantaneous information conveyed by the membrane potential are described by two concepts such as area under membrane potential (AUM) and firing strength. Given that the neuron with large AUM or strong firing strength would enhance the frequency of action potentials of its postsynaptic neurons, the connection between the neuron and its postsynaptic neurons should be strengthened. Combined with an idea of membership function, three contribution degrees ( $\boldsymbol{\mu}_E$ , $\boldsymbol{\mu}_S$ , and $\boldsymbol{\mu}_{ES}$ ) are defined to quantify the ability of a neuron to provide information for postsynaptic neurons. According to these three degrees, the corresponding SpikeProp learning algorithms, referred to as SPE, SPS, and SPES, are developed. Experimental results obtained on ten benchmark datasets, one high-dimensional feature dataset, one big dataset, and one time series dataset with some commonly used algorithms, networks and CDSNN demonstrate that CDSNN can achieve improved performance in terms of accuracy, generalization, precision, recall and F-measure. The article demonstrates that the mechanism by which interval-instantaneous information is simultaneously learned in a SNN is feasible.},

  abstract     = {Non-Gaussian noises always exist in the nonlinear system, which usually lead to inconsistency and divergence of the regression and identification applications. The conventional evolving fuzzy systems (EFSs) in common sense have succeeded to conquer the uncertainties and external disturbance employing the specific variable structure characteristic. However, non-Gaussian noises would trigger the frequent changes of structure under the transient criteria, which severely degrades performance. Statistical criterion provides an informed choice of the strategies of the structure evolution, utilizing the approximation uncertainty as the observation of model sufficiency. The approximation uncertainty can be always decomposed into model uncertainty term and noise term, and is suitable for the non-Gaussian noise condition, especially relaxing the traditional Gaussian assumption. In this article, a novel incremental statistical evolving fuzzy inference system (SEFIS) is proposed, which has the capacity of updating the system parameters, and evolving the structure components to integrate new knowledge in the new process characteristic, system behavior, and operating conditions with non-Gaussian noises. The system generates a new rule based on the statistical model sufficiency which gives so insight into whether models are reliable and their approximations can be trusted. The nearest rule presents the inactive rule under the current data stream and further would be deleted without losing any information and accuracy of the subsequent trained models when the model sufficiency is satisfied. In our article, an adaptive maximum correntropy extend Kalman filter is derived to update the parameters of the evolving rules to cope with the non-Gaussian noises problems to further improve the robustness of parameter updating process. The parameter updating process shares an estimate of the uncertainty with the criteria of the structure evolving process to make the computation less of a burden dramatically. The simulation studies show that the proposed SEFIS has faster learning speed and is more accurate than the existing evolving fuzzy systems (EFSs) in the case of noise free and noisy conditions.},

  abstract     = {Social network large-scale decision-making (SN-LSDM) has attracted much attention in the field of decision science. Clustering and consensus building are two important processes for solving SN-LSDM problems. Traditional clustering methods are typically based on the opinion similarity. When extending decision-making to social network contexts, we argue that trust relationships among decision-makers (DMs) serve as a reliable resource for clustering. This study proposes a trust Cop-Kmeans clustering algorithm, which is a semisupervised clustering technique using prior knowledge of trust constraints generated by trust relationships. The consensus-reaching process (CRP) is an effective tool for reducing differences of opinion. In general, the costs and resources associated with the CRP are limited. Therefore, minimum-cost consensus (MCC) models have been developed and used widely in various group decision-making contexts. As an important resource influencing decision-making, trust provides a common-sense perception that the opinion of a DM with a high trust degree is considered to be widely recognized by others. We hold that the DM with high trust and low consensus can reduce the consensus cost by voluntarily losing some trust. Consequently, an improved MCC model considering voluntary trust loss is developed. Finally, a numerical example is presented to illustrate the feasibility of the proposed clustering algorithm and consensus model. A comparative analysis is implemented to explore the influence of the trust constraint on clustering and the influence of trust loss on the CRP.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we study the problems of bipartite and cooperative consensus with a strictly dissipative performance for fuzzy multiagent systems (MASs) in a unified framework. First, we prove that bipartite consensus over a structurally balanced signed graph is equivalent to cooperative consensus over the corresponding unsigned graph by leveraging the gauge transformation for a class of nonlinear MASs. Then, a polynomial fuzzy model is constructed to describe the nonlinear MAS formed by one leader and followers. For mitigating communication and computational load, a mode-dependent event-triggered transmission strategy is proposed. By establishing the switching topologies through Markovian process, a new sampled-data event-triggered consensus protocol is designed. With a mode-dependent Lyapunov–Krasovskii function, a novel relaxed dissipative criterion is obtained. The criterion guarantees that all agents can achieve both event-triggered cooperative consensus and event-triggered bipartite consensus with the same magnitude but opposite signs for MASs over structurally balanced signed directed graphs and Markovian switching topologies. Moreover, the event-triggered parameters and consensus control gains can be numerically solved via the sum-of-squares method. Simulation results are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed design method.},

Based on the IT2 fuzzy S-MSSs and the state feedback control method, a novel IT2 mode-dependent fuzzy guaranteed cost (GC) controller is developed under the mismatched membership functions. Then, some new sufficient conditions are given to ensure that IT2 fuzzy S-MSSs are finite-time (FT) stochastically stable based on the designed IT2 mode-dependent fuzzy GC controller. Furthermore, the transition rate boundary condition is relaxed, and a new incomplete transition rate boundary model is constructed to reflect the transition rate information. For both the incomplete transition rate boundaries and the actuator fault phenomenon, the improved stability criteria are provided to stabilize the IT2 fuzzy S-MSSs within an FT interval and determine the gains of the IT2 mode-dependent fuzzy GC controller, resulting in a much greater design flexibility. Distinct from the existing results, the presented FTGC control scheme is more suitable for many practical systems because the IT2 fuzzy S-MSS model, which is more general compared with the traditional fuzzy system and S-MSSs, is considered. Finally, three illustrative examples are offered to explain the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed FTGC control approach.},

The target velocity is unavailable, and the ASVs are subject to sideslip effects, unknown control gains, and uncertain kinetics. The control objective is to drive a fleet of ASVs to surround a moving target at a desired range and maintain a spaced formation. An integrated distributed guidance and model-free control method is presented based on extended state observers (ESOs) and a data-driven fuzzy predictor. Specifically, by using two ESOs to estimate the unknown relative kinematics induced by the unknown target velocity and unknown sideslip and a distributed target estimator to recover the target position, intermediate range keeping and phase keeping guidance laws are designed to achieve a circular motion and an evenly spaced formation, respectively. Next, a model-free fuzzy control law is developed based on a data-driven fuzzy predictor, which learns the unknown control gains and uncertain kinetics simultaneously. Finally, the closed-loop control system is proven to be input-to-state stable through Lyapunov analysis. The salient feature of the proposed method is that cooperative circumnavigating a maneuvering target with unknown velocity can be achieved without the global target information and knowledge of vehicle kinetics. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed distributed guidance and control method for cooperative target enclosing of ASVs.},

On the one hand, an improved bioinspired metaheuristic algorithm, elite symbiotic organisms search, is designed as optimization strategy to improve the global convergence of fuzzy modularity optimization. On the other hand, a neighbor-based membership modification operation is proposed to intensify exploitation ability and speed up convergence, by efficiently utilizing local information (i.e., node neighborhood) of network topology. Experimental results on both of synthetic and real-life networks with different scales and characteristics show that SOSFCD can find max-modularity fuzzy partitions and coverings, and outperforms many state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of accuracy and stability.},

  abstract     = {Based on the interval type-2 fuzzy (IT2F) approach, this article investigates the fault detection filter design problem for a class of nonhomogeneous higher level Markov jump systems with uncertain transition probabilities. Considering that the mode information of the system cannot be obtained synchronously by the filter, the hidden Markov model can be seen as a detector to handle this asynchronous problem, and the parameter uncertainty can be processed by the IT2F approach with the lower and upper membership functions. Then, the asynchronous IT2F filter is designed to deal with the fault detection problem. Furthermore, the Gaussian transition probability density function is introduced to describe the uncertainty transition probabilities of the system and the filter. Based on the Lyapunov theory, the existence of the designed asynchronous IT2F filter and the dissipativity of the filter error system can be well ensured. In this article, the simulation study on a quarter-car suspension system verifies that the designed asynchronous IT2F filter can detect faults without error alarms.},

  abstract     = {Multioutput regression aims to predict multiple continuous outputs simultaneously using the common set of input variables. The significant challenge arises from modeling relevance between inputs and outputs. Moreover, the shortage of labeled multioutput data and the divergence of data are other factors that impede the development of multioutput regression problems. The recent emergence of transfer learning techniques, which have the ability of leveraging previously acquired knowledge from a similar domain, provide a solution to the above issues. In this article, a novel fuzzy transfer learning method is proposed to tackle the multioutput regression problems in homogeneous and heterogeneous scenarios. By considering output–input dependencies and inter-output correlations, fuzzy rules are extracted to reflect the shared characteristics of different outputs and capture their uniqueness. For a homogeneous scenario, fuzzy rules are first accumulated in a related domain (called the source domain), which has a sufficient amount of training data. Based on different transform strategies, the fuzzy rules are then transferred to improve the new but similar regression tasks in the current domain (called the target domain), where only a few data have multiple responses. On this basis, we handle a more complex heterogeneous scenario by learning a latent input space to reduce the disagreement of variables between domains. The experiment results on thirteen real-world datasets with multiple outputs illustrate the effectiveness of our method. The impact of core coefficients on performance is also analyzed.},

Knowledge tracing (KT) is aimed at tracking the cognition function of students according to their performance on various exercises at different times and has attracted considerable attention. Existing KT models primarily use bisection representations for the performance and cognitive states of students, thus limiting the application scope of these models and the accuracy of the evaluation of student cognitive performance in learning processes. Therefore, fuzzy Bayesian KT models (namely, FBKT and T2FBKT) are proposed to address continuous score scenarios (e.g., subjective examinations) so that the applicability of KT models may be broadened. Moreover, fine-grained cognitive states can be discerned. In particular, referring to type-2 fuzzy theory, T2FBKT mitigates the model uncertainty of FBKT induced by uncertain parameters. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed fuzzy KT models.},

  abstract     = {In multilabel learning, the curse of dimensionality is one of major challenges. Existing single-label feature selection methods cannot be directly applied to multilabel data, and multilabel feature selections have thus been widely studied. As an effective granular computing tool, rough set theory has been applied to multilabel feature selections for addressing various realistic applications. However, existing rough set-based methods not only cannot effectively characterize the ability of features to distinguish multilabel sample pairs, but also usually own high time complexity. In this article, we propose two novel multilabel feature selection methods from the perspective of discerning sample pairs. First, relative discernibility pair matrixes of features are defined in the framework of fuzzy rough set, where each element represents the degree of distinguishing the corresponding sample pair by features. On this basis, a novel evaluation measure of feature subsets is defined. Afterwards, a heuristic multilabel feature selection approach titled RDPM based on the proposed measure is put forward. Inspired by sampling and ensemble strategies, another efficient and robust multilabel feature selection approach titled RDPM_SE is proposed as well. Finally, extensive experiments on 13 real-world multilabel datasets are conducted, and experimental results show that the proposed algorithms outperform seven state-of-the-art methods in terms of performances and the running time.},

However, high computational cost has become a bottleneck which limits its applications in large-scale problems. Moreover, most fuzzy clustering algorithms are sensitive to noise. To address these issues, a novel fuzzy clustering algorithm, called fast fuzzy clustering based on anchor graph (FFCAG), is proposed. The FFCAG algorithm integrates anchor-based similarity graph construction and membership matrix learning into a unified framework, such that the prior knowledge of anchors can be further utilized to improve clustering performance. Specifically, FFCAG first constructs an anchor-based similarity graph with a parameter-free neighbor assignment strategy. Then, it designs a quadratic programming model to learn the membership matrix of anchors, which is very different from traditional fuzzy clustering algorithms. More importantly, a novel balanced regularization term is introduced into the objective function to produce more accurate clustering results. Finally, we adopt an alternating optimization algorithm with guaranteed convergence to solve the proposed method. Experimental results performed on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the proposed FFCAG can significantly reduce the computational time with comparable, even superior, clustering performance, compared with state-of-the-art algorithms.},

However, they are parametric linear and the corresponding weights are additive measures. In this article, we give a novel method for MCDM based on fuzzy covering rough sets by using the nonadditive measure [i.e., fuzzy measure (FM)] and the nonlinear integral [i.e., Choquet integral (ChI)]. First, two nonadditive measures are presented by fuzzy covering lower and upper approximation operators, respectively. Moreover, both of them are FMs which are called $\beta$ -neighborhood approximation measures. Second, two types of ChIs with respect to $\beta$ -neighborhood approximation measures are constructed. A novel method, which considers the association, is presented to solve the problem of MCDM under the fuzzy covering rough set model. Third, a new approach based on $\beta$ -neighborhood approximation measures is proposed for attribute reductions in a fuzzy $\beta$ -covering information table. This approach of attribute reductions is used in MCDM. Finally, both new methods above are compared with other methods through some numerical examples and UCI datasets, respectively.},

Incorporating integral SMC scheme can be used along with the event-triggered control to deal with the simultaneous external disturbances and unnecessary waste of system resources. To further accommodate the characteristic of event-triggered integral SMC (ETISMC), two fuzzy integral switching surfaces are established. One is the triggered-state dependent switching surface which is proposed to obtain the ETISMC law. The other one is the conventional continuous-state dependent switching surface which is designed to ensure the robustness of the controlled system from the initial time instance. The proposed ETISMC is applicable for both single–input and multi–input, and despite the previous studies, a more reasonable ETISMC law is proposed with asynchronous premise variables. Based on Lyapunov function and adopting a decreasing time-varying triggering threshold in the event-triggered condition, the ultimately bounded stability of the closed-loop system is guaranteed. Sufficient conditions for the ultimate bounded of the trajectories of the system states are formulated in terms of new offline linear matrix inequalities. Moreover, the positive lower bound of the internal execution is ensured, which means that there is no Zeno phenomenon. To demonstrate the superiority of the proposed technique, the suggested ETISMC is applied to a two-degree freedom helicopter system and the simulation results verify the validity of the proposed control strategy.},

  abstract     = {This article addresses the state and fault estimation problems for a class of quantized Takagi–Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy systems with sensor and actuator faults. Two types of observer design methods are developed for two different network transmission environments. In the first case, the signal quantization effect is only considered on the channel between sensor and controller, and a sliding mode observer is designed, which can reconstruct the actuator faults. In the second case, the quantization effects are considered in both the sensor-controller side and the controller-actuator side, which is more difficult to be dealt with compared to the first case, and the sliding mode observer method cannot be effective now since the discontinuous term is difficult to be designed. A descriptor reduced-order observer is presented to solve this problem, where the jumping behavior that resulted from the signal quantization is considered in the observer, which is novel and effective to compensate the quantization effects. Finally, simulation examples of rigid-body satellite attitude control T-S fuzzy system are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed observer design approaches.},

This article investigates the design issue of adaptive fuzzy second-order sliding-mode (SOSM) controller, which aims to handle a class of nonlinear systems with output constraints. The unknown bounds of uncertainties are approached dynamically by fuzzy logic systems. Through designing a new barrier Lyapunov function, the output constraint problem has been well solved. Then, by integrating adding a power integrator technology and adaptive fuzzy control, a novel adaptive fuzzy SOSM controller is proposed. It is proved that the proposed method makes the output variable not violate the specified constraint region. At the same time, it can be shown, based upon the Lyapunov approach, that the finite-time stability of the resulting closed-loop system under output constraint is ensured. Finally, a numerical example and a practical pendulum system are presented to demonstrate the validity of the proposed SOSM control strategy.},

The random jumps in the studied system are governed by the discrete-time semi-Markov process. Therefore, the storage characteristics of the transition probability between systems are fully considered. To analyze the $\sigma$ -mean-square stability of the filtering error system, a mode-dependent filter, which is based on the discrete-time fuzzy semi-Markov jump model, is constructed to estimate the state of the system. Thereafter, based on the Lyapunov stability theory and the discrete-time semi-Markov kernel concept, a set of sufficient criteria to ensure the $\sigma$ -mean-square stability and $l_{2}-l_{\infty }$ performance are derived. In addition, by using the Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy model, the nonlinear problem is effectively solved.

  abstract     = {Linguistic multiple attribute decision making (LMADM) has been widely used in different decision contexts to achieve a final solution, e.g., obtaining the ranking of alternatives. Evaluation information using linguistic scales in LMADM is usually expressed in simple discrete linguistic terms. In this article, we consider that each simple linguistic term in LMADM actually has a continuous representation (denoted as a linguistic two tuples) whose rounding operation matches the linguistic term. Under such conditions, the ranking of alternatives based on the simple linguistic terms may not be consistent with that based on the linguistic two tuples. Thus, this article studies the linguistic scale ranking consistency issue in LMADM under seven classical and commonly used decision rules: weighted averaging, ordered weighted averaging, weighted geometric averaging, ordered weighted geometric averaging, preference ranking organization method for enrichment evaluation, technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution, and elimination et choice translating reality. We first define the concept of the linguistic scale ranking consistency in LMADM. Afterward, several consistency conditions are presented analytically for the selected decision rules to guarantee the linguistic scale ranking consistency. Finally, we present the detailed theoretical and simulation-based comparisons. The theoretical comparisons show the roles of decision rules and granularity in the consistency conditions, and the simulation-based comparisons demonstrate the performance of the selected decision rules in defending against the ranking inconsistency in LMADM.},

Moreover, a more general time-dependent AETC protocol is proposed compared to the existing related results.

However, when the input is practical complex data with external disturbance, the existing FNN cannot extract effective input features sufficiently, leading to unsatisfactory performances in learning speed and accuracy. It also fails to achieve a better generalization capability because of its fixed structure size (the number of rule neurons). In this article, an efficient self-organizing FNN (SOFNN) with incremental deep pretraining (IDPT), called IDPT-SOFNN, is developed to overcome these shortcomings. First, IDPT is designed to extract effective features and consider them as the input of the SOFNN. Different from the existing pretraining, the self-growing structure of IDPT improves pretraining efficiency with a more compact structure. Second, the SOFNN can dynamically add and delete neurons according to the current error and error-reduction rate. In this case, it can obtain better modeling performance with a more compact structure as well. Third, as a novel hybrid model with the cascade dual-self-organizing algorithm, the IDPT-SOFNN combines the advantage of IDPT and SOFNN. Moreover, the convergence and stability are analyzed. Finally, simulation studies and comparisons demonstrate that the proposed IDPT-SOFNN has better performances than its peers in learning speed, accuracy, and generalization capability.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we propose a general framework for the unsupervised fuzzy rule-based dimensionality reduction primarily for data visualization. This framework has the following important characteristics relevant to the dimensionality reduction for visualization: preserves neighborhood relationships; effectively handles data on nonlinear manifolds; capable of projecting out-of-sample test points; can reject test points, when it is appropriate; and interpretable to a reasonable extent. We use the first-order Takagi–Sugeno model. Typically, fuzzy rules are either provided by experts or extracted using an input–output training set. Here, neither the output data nor experts are available. This makes the problem challenging. We estimate the rule parameters minimizing a suitable objective function that preserves the interpoint geodesic distances (distances over the manifold) as Euclidean distances on the projected space. In this context, we propose a new variant of the geodesic $c$ -means clustering algorithm. The proposed method is tested on several synthetic and real-world datasets and compared with the results of six state-of-the-art data visualization methods. The proposed method is the only method that performs equally well on all the datasets tried. Our method is found to be robust to the initial conditions. The predictability of the method is validated by suitable experiments. We also assess the ability of our method to reject test points when it should. The scalability issue of the scheme is also discussed. Due to the general nature of the framework, we can use different objective functions to obtain projections satisfying different goals. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to manifold learning using unsupervised fuzzy rule-based modeling.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates the heterogeneous impulsive synchronization for T-S fuzzy probabilistic coupled delayed neural networks (CDNNs) with mode-dependent parameters and piecewise membership functions. To begin with, a novel CDNNs model with adjustable coupling strength and probabilistic coupling delays is designed to ensure the accuracy of the CDNNs model. Meanwhile, the generalized isolated node with four types of mismatched parameters, named heterogeneous isolated delayed neural network, is first considered to extend the synchronization problem. Then, the mode-dependent fuzzy rules are introduced to design the novel model, which implies that switching signals and fuzzy processes are interdependent and can share information to communicate. To improve the hybrid controller’s reliability, the mode-dependent impulses are also developed here, in which the impulsive effects with different properties can occur at any moment in the switching interval. The exponential synchronization conditions are derived by means of the method of auxiliary state variables, Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional, average switching dwell period, and mode-dependent average impulsive dwell period. Moreover, the improved mode-dependent piecewise approximated membership functions are proposed to reduce the main results’ conservatism. Finally, a numerical example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the main results.},

  abstract     = {Singularly perturbed systems have found widespread applications in practice. The existing results on singularly perturbed systems mainly focused on the Lyapunov asymptotic stability, which are unable to deal with the cases that the system states cannot exceed a given threshold during a fixed time interval. This article addresses the finite-time fuzzy control issue for discrete-time nonlinear singularly perturbed systems with input constraints. The aim is to guarantee the boundedness of the states of singularly perturbed systems during a finite-time interval. Based on the matrix inequality technique, some conditions are established to guarantee the finite-time boundedness of the fuzzy singularly perturbed systems, where the singularly perturbed parameter is independent so as to avoid the ill-conditioned problem caused by the small singularly perturbed parameter. The gains of the finite-time fuzzy controller can be obtained by solving some singularly perturbed parameter independent linear matrix inequalities. Finally, the proposed finite-time fuzzy controller design approach for nonlinear singularly perturbed systems is illustrated via the Van der Pol circuit.},

The polynomials, positivity, and optimal $L_1$ performance make some existing convex methods for general systems inapplicable. To overcome this problem, first, an augmented system of the PPFMB control system is constructed; then, by introducing some constraint conditions and mathematical techniques, nonconvex stability and positivity conditions are skillfully transformed into convex ones simultaneously. In addition, to control the systems flexibly and lower the implementation cost, the imperfect premise matching concept is taken into account for controller design. Besides, the high-degree-polynomial approximation method is adopted to conduct stability and positivity analysis by incorporating the information of membership functions and the boundary information of the state variables. On the basis of the Lyapunov stability theory, the relaxed stability and positivity conditions in terms of the SOS form are obtained.

Based on this, AFC chooses these data samples that represent local models of data distribution as cluster medoids for initial partition. It then continues to optimize the cluster medoids iteratively to obtain a locally optimal partition as the algorithm output. Moreover, an online extension is introduced to AFC enabling the algorithm to cluster streaming data chunk-by-chunk in a “one pass” manner.

In the majority of existing mining methods, neighboring is determined by a single distance threshold and does not take the neighboring degree into consideration causing many neighbor relationships to be lost and they also cannot objectively describe the correlation between spatial features. In addition, existing methods ignore the instance-sharing problem of spatial neighbor relationships when calculating the prevalence of colocation patterns. In order to overcome these weaknesses, this article introduces the fuzzy theory into the spatial colocation pattern discovery. Through the fuzziness of spatial neighbor relationships between spatial instances, we develop a reasonable fuzzy proximity metric, which takes the instance-sharing problem into account and which measures the similarity between different spatial features. Three effective fuzzy clustering methods are proposed, which ensure that colocation patterns can be extracted accurately and quickly. Finally, extensive experiments on five synthetic datasets and five real-world datasets prove the practicability and efficiency of the proposed methods.},

Under such a model, during the active period of DoS attacks, periodic transmission attempt is made to ensure the control system can receive the control information at the earliest time; the ETM turns to be a conventional one when the DoS attack is in sleeping period. Meanwhile, the valid attack period is proposed to address the problem of the DoS attack ending within a sampling period, which is a challenging problem in modeling DoS attacks. Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) fuzzy model is used to characterize the uncertainties of sprung and unsprung mass of SVSSs. By converting the cloud-aided active SVSS into a fuzzy-based switched time-delay system, and using the method of piecewise Lyapunov function, sufficient conditions are derived to ensure the performances of active SVSSs subject to DoS attacks.

The impact of the social trust relationships on assessments-modifications in the consensus reaching in the SNGDM is seldom considered. This study aims at addressing this issue. The main starting point is the assumption that a decision maker will not be willing to accept the assessments-modifications suggestions that significantly differ from his/her trusted decision makers’ assessments in a social trust network. Thus, this study proposes a social trust driven minimum adjustments consensus model (STDMACM) for SNGDM. Simultaneously, a social trust driven consensus maximum optimization model (STDCMOM) is proposed for maximizing the consensus level among decision makers under the above assumption. Based on both STDCMOM and STDMACM, an interactive consensus reaching process is presented, in which the assessments-modifications suggestions generated from the STDMACM are used, when the maximum consensus level obtained from STDCMOM is acceptable, as the references for guiding the consensus reaching; otherwise, assessments-modifications suggestions are generated from the designed STDCMOM. The validity of the social trust driven consensus reaching process with respect to its consensus convergence rate and consensus success ratio is verified with a simulation and comparison analysis.},

  abstract     = {Fuzzy preference relations (FPRs) have been widely used when ranking alternatives using pairwise comparison. However, when the FPRs have rank violations, the ranking results tend to contradict the decision makers’ (DMs) preferences. To date, no studies have examined the elimination of these FPR rank violations. Further, traditional consensus models utilizing distance measures between individual preferences are not suitable to manage classification-based consensus problems. To overcome these problems, this article develops several optimization models to address rank violations and h-rank consensus issues. First, the conditions that satisfy the FPRs’ preservation of order preferences (POPs) are analyzed and a system of constraints derived to ensure that the POPs are explicitly controlled by the optimization model, after which a mixed integer linear optimization model is developed to assist DMs to satisfy both the POP conditions and acceptable consistency. Finally, a linear model for the h-rank ( $h \geq 2$ ) consensus reaching process is designed to ensure that each individual FPR also satisfies the POP conditions and acceptable consistency. The feasibility of the proposed models is illustrated using numerical examples, with extensive comparisons further validating the usefulness of the proposed models for group decision-making problems.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates the prescribed finite-time control for the nonlinear system with uncertain nonlinearity and unknown control directions. Different from the existing finite/fixed-time control methods on the basis of the fractional-order state feedback, the proposed finite-time control in this article only employs regular state feedback. The key is that a novel prescribed finite-time performance function is introduced such that the controller design is under the standard Lyapunov stability theoretical framework. A lemma is developed as a tool for coping with the coexistence of multiple Nussbaum gains for the stochastic system with unknown control directions. Fuzzy logic systems are used to approximate the uncertain nonlinear functions. Applying the backstepping structure, an adaptive fuzzy control scheme is developed. The salient characteristic of the proposed control is that the finite convergence time and the accuracy of the tracking error are independent of the initial states and design parameters, and that can be assigned in a prior. Two examples are given to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.},

To obtain precise estimation results and attenuate disturbances and noise in the system simultaneously, we integrate robust observers based on the $ H_{\infty }$ technique and reachability analysis. Two novel observer gain computation methods are proposed for different purposes. The time-invariant method relaxes the original design conditions by transforming the parameterized linear matrix inequality (LMI) into a series of LMIs to increase computational speed, while the time-varying method employs the parameterized LMI directly and conducts calculation online. Furthermore, reachable set representations for error dynamics are formulated by making use of both time-invariant observer gain and time-varying observer gain. An inverted pendulum system simulation and a comparative numerical simulation are studied to illustrate the effectiveness and superiority of the developed methods.},

In order to circumvent this bottleneck issue, a fast training algorithm FTA is developed in this study by downsizing fuzzy rules with the proposed gradient guided learning for each subclassifier at each layer of DSA-FC on large-scale datasets. The core of FTA is to assure fast training of each subclassifier at each layer of DSA-FC, which first generates first-order smooth gradient guided information by means of the proposed top- k fuzzy rules selected from all fuzzy rules in each subclassifier, and then quickly updates the current inputs in terms of such information, which will be taken as the inputs of the subclassifier at the next layer. Our theoretical analysis reveals that the proposed gradient guided learning indeed enhances the generalization capability of a deep fuzzy classifier with or without adversarial attacks on outputs. Experimental results on large datasets demonstrate that FTA indeed trains the deep fuzzy classifier DSA-FC quickly with enhanced generalization capability.},

The relations to other generator generated implications are clarified, the intersections with $(S,N)$ -implications are discussed in detail and the intersections with $R$ -implications are proved to be conjugates of the Łukasiewicz implication. The t -norm solutions to the (LI) equation for $(\theta,t)$ -generated implications in several cases are characterized in terms of generated t-norms, and two special subclasses of $(\theta,t)$ -generated implications are characterized through (LI) and (FOP) on the other hand. A particularly interesting corollary shows that a binary operation on [0,1] enjoying (OP) satisfies (LI) with the Łukasiewicz t -norm if and only if it is the Łukasiewicz implication. These results will partially solve or enrich the related open problems pending for fuzzy implications. As applications of $(\theta,t)$ -generated implications, two fuzzy reasoning methods, called triple I method and parallel hierarchical triple I method, based on (LI) and (FOP) are proposed in order to set a logic foundation for Zadeh’s compositional rule of inference (CRI) and to remedy the dependency of Jayaram’s hierarchical CRI on the order of inputs, respectively.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we introduce the design of an artificial fuzzy Lyapunov-based model predictive integral sliding-mode control to achieve the stability of the closed-loop Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy-model-based nonlinear systems. First, to reach the proper performance against the model uncertainties, a fuzzy integral sliding-mode controller (FISMC) is designed. Then, the fuzzy model predictive control (MPC) is developed based on a fuzzy Lyapunov function by considering a contractive constraint and an ellipsoidal terminal constraint. A systematic method is developed to reach the recursive feasibility of the MPC optimization problem based on an ellipsoidal terminal set. Also, a contractive fuzzy Lyapunov condition is imposed on the fuzzy MPC problem to guarantee the stability of closed-loop systems, which is led to a linear matrix inequality-based generalized eigenvalue minimization problem. In the proposed approach, FISMC greatly improves the robustness property of the fuzzy Lyapunov-based model predictive control and the asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system is achieved in comparison with the tube-based MPC. In addition, the proposed robust MPC has a less computational burden and improves the equilibrium point attractivity compared with the max–min MPC and the equality terminal constraint-based MPC. To illustrate the superiority of the proposed strategy, the suggested robust MPC is applied to a truck–trailer system and a numerical example. The simulation results show the capabilities of the proposed robust MPC.},

In the fault-free case, the state space of the system is partitioned based on the presence or absence of inputs. Using the parallel distributed compensation technique, input-to-state stability is proved for the error dynamics. For input constraint satisfaction, a model predictive control based reference-management unit is proposed in the form of an online optimization module that solves a quadratic programming problem. In the faulty case, the fault-free system is used as a reference model that satisfies the input constraint. Then, the concept of virtual actuator is used to make the behavior of the faulty system similar to the behavior of the fault-free system by controlling the performance degradation. In this article, a full-order observer can be used for fault estimation. In order to keep the control input of the faulty system within the admissible range defined for the fault-free system, a constraint-change scenario is considered. After detecting the fault, the constraint on the input of the fault-free system is changed in a way to keep the control input of the faulty system in the specified range. All design criteria are formulated as a linear matrix inequality problem. In order to evaluate the proposed control approach, simulations are performed on two systems: a 3-DoF helicopter and a 2-D overhead crane.},

This ITL-assisted FNN (ITL-FNN) contains the following advantages. First, a knowledge filter algorithm is developed to reconstruct the knowledge in source scene by balancing the matching accuracy and diversity. Then, the knowledge from source scene can fit the instance of target scene with suitable accuracy. Second, a self-balancing mechanism is designed to balance the driven information between the source and target scenes. Then, the knowledge can be refitted to reduce the useless information. Third, a structural competition algorithm is proposed to adjust the knowledge of FNN. Then, the proposed ITL-FNN can achieve compact structure to improve the generalization performance.

Physical parametric uncertainties, external electrostatic disturbance, and measurement noise malfunction their operation and ruin the preciseness of the VRS output voltage. Our objective problem is the design of a controller to cope with the mentioned parametric uncertainties, noise, and disturbance. Our applied method is the design and employment of a proportional integral fuzzy adaptive sliding mode controller (FASMC). Both terms of matched and unmatched uncertainties as well as external disturbance and measurement noise are all addressed in this article to generate a stable VRS output for the first time. Not only does this article contribute to the employment of a FASMC to enhance robustness in the drive of the capacitor, but also it benefits the reduction of the chattering effect due to fuzzy regulation in the switching term of the control law. Moreover, the automatic fuzzy adjustment in the controller, which is used for estimation of the coefficients in the sliding surface error dynamical equation, facilitates the specification of those coefficients, which can be time consuming in simulation affairs. Clarifying the importance of the proposed fuzzy adaptive sliding mode controller, this article reviews some previous controllers for MEMS TC in comparison with the proposed fuzzy controller, demonstrating its enhancement in comparison with previous schemes.},

  abstract     = {Querying and reporting from large volumes of structured, semistructured, and unstructured data often requires some flexibility. This flexibility provided by fuzzy sets allows for categorization of the surrounding world in a flexible, human-mind-like manner. Apache Hive is a data warehousing framework working on top of the Hadoop platform for big data processing. Hive allows executing queries and aggregating and analyzing data stored in Hadoop distributed file system and other repositories. Hive responds to the current needs for efficient big data warehousing, which is impossible with traditional data warehouses due to their rigid nature. This article presents the FuzzyHive library that extends the Hive framework with fuzzy sets based techniques for querying, analyzing, and reporting on big data warehouses. We formalize the fuzzy techniques used while operating on Hive-based data warehouses (including fuzzy filtering on dimensional attributes, projection with fuzzy transformation, fuzzy grouping, and joining). We also show how we embedded these operations in Hive query language, which was not studied so far. Such extensions make big data warehousing more flexible and contribute to the portfolio of tools used by the community of people working with fuzzy sets and data analysis. The FuzzyHive library complements the spectrum of available solutions for fuzzy data processing and querying in large datasets. We investigate Hive fuzzy querying performance, effectiveness, and scalability for various data storage formats (text, Avro, and Parquet). Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed extensions introduce more elasticity and are also efficient for big data warehousing, which is the first such kind of solution for this environment.},

With the help of fuzzy logical systems in identifying the unknown nonlinear functions, and by considering the sampling strategy, a novel sampled-data nonlinear state observer has been designed to approximate the immeasurable state variables, which only contains the output sampling information of the system to be controlled. Furthermore, to avoid the problem of “explosion of complexity” caused by the frequently using the derivative of the virtual controller, the nonlinear filter has been considered under the strategy of the sampled data. Based on Lyapunov theory, a sampled-data adaptive fuzzy decentralized output feedback backstepping control strategy was proposed under the framework of recursive design and sampled-data strategy. The designed sampled-data controller is able to guarantee that all closed-loop signals are semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded. Two simulation examples are eventually provided to validate the effectiveness of the theoretical findings.},

First, based on the path tracking kinematic model, this article innovatively formulates the vehicle path tracking task as a constraint-following problem. Second, we put forward a deterministic adaptive robust control law with a tunable parameter to ensure the uniform boundedness and ultimate uniform boundedness of the closed-loop system. Third, an optimal scheme for the tunable parameter is proposed based on the fuzzy uncertainty. The resulting optimal robust control (ORC) minimizes a comprehensive fuzzy performance index that involves the fuzzy system performance and the control cost.

A novel switched-observer-based event-triggered adaptive fuzzy funnel control approach for solving the problem is proposed by exploiting the average dwell time method and backstepping. To estimate unmeasurable system states, a switched fuzzy observer and switched update laws for individual subsystems are designed. Compared with the existing funnel controllers designed in the framework of continuous-time feedback control, the proposed approach constructs event-triggered funnel controllers of subsystems and a switching event-triggered mechanism (ETM), which greatly alleviates the unnecessary waste of communication and computation resources, and, without any known limitation on maximum asynchronous time, handles the issue of asynchronous switching between the candidate controllers of subsystems and subsystems. Also, a strictly positive lower bound on interevent time is ensured by introducing a piecewise constant variable into the ETM, which overcomes the difficulty of switched measurement error being discontinuous. It is guaranteed that the tracking error evolves within a prespecified performance funnel. Finally, two examples including a mass-spring-damper system are presented for illustrating the validity of the developed approach.},

By introducing a novel multitime-delay-dependent switched Lyapunov functional to explore the dynamic characteristics of the controlled system, and by means of the famous Jensen’s inequality with reciprocally convex approach, Wirtinger’s inequality, the criterion of the system’s mean square stabilization is established based on the LMI technique, which quantitatively reveals the relationship between the control period, the control length, and the upper bound of the control sampling interval.

In this article, we approach the problem by fuzzy-model-based control techniques and overcome some challenges including transforming the nonconvexity conditions when both positive and stability conditions exist into convexity conditions that can be solved by the convex programming techniques. This article focuses on the static output-feedback tracking control issue of positive polynomial fuzzy-model-based systems. The purpose of the tracking control is to design an appropriate static output feedback polynomial fuzzy controller which can drive the system states of the nonlinear plant to follow those of a stable reference model subject to an $H_\infty$ performance. The concept of imperfectly matched premises is employed to enhance the design and implementation flexibility. To circumvent the problem of nonconvex stability conditions, an approach is employed to transform the nonconvex stability conditions into convex ones by introducing a novel scalar implantation transformation technique. Besides, the partition approximation of membership functions with local information of membership functions is used to promote stability analysis and synthesis of controllers. The positive and relaxed stability conditions for static output-feedback tracking control with $H_\infty$ performance being taken into account are obtained in terms of sum-of-squares.

A fractional-order term is incorporated into the sliding surface that could add an extra degree of freedom and combine the advantages of fractional calculus and SMC. A new four-layer fuzzy neural network (FNN) is studied, which has two feedback loops (internal feedback loop and external feedback loop) to capture the weights and output signal calculated in the previous step and use it as a feedback signal for the next step. On the one hand, the proposed DLRFNN structure combines a fuzzy system to process uncertain information with a neural network to learn from the process. On the other hand, both the internal state information and the output signal are acquired and stored so that better approximation performance is obtained compared with a regular FNN system. Furthermore, the adaptive laws of DLRFNN parameters are derived, which can automatically update free parameters with a bound. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive fractional SMC using the DLRFNN strategy is identified by the simulations’ analysis with different fractional orders, whereby tracking errors are uniformly ultimately bounded. The proposed adaptive fractional SMC using the DLRFNN strategy can achieve remarkably superior tracking performance in terms of high precision and fast response by comprehensive comparisons.},

Thus, the reference comparisons are represented as intuitionistic fuzzy values (IFVs), the Best-to-Others vector and the Others-to-Worst vector are IF vectors. According to the multiplicative consistency of intuitionistic fuzzy preference relation, this article gives the consistency equations and views them as IF equations. The derivation of optimal IF weights of criteria is formulated as an IF decision-making problem. Thereby, a mathematical programming model is constructed to assure that the derived optimal IF weights of criteria is a normalized IF weight vector. Depending on the risk preference of DM, four linear programming models are presented to obtain the optimal IF weights based on the constructed mathematical programming model for the optimistic DM, the pessimistic DM, and the neutral DM, respectively. Furthermore, this article investigates the process of improving the consistency. Several examples are demonstrated to show the application and effectiveness of the proposed IFBWM.},

Motivated by these two issues, we investigate incremental feature selection approaches using a new conditional entropy with robustness for dynamic ordered data in this study. First, we propose a new rough set model, i.e., fuzzy dominance neighborhood rough sets (FDNRS). Second, a conditional entropy with robustness is defined based on FDNRS model, which is used as evaluation metric for features and combined with a heuristic feature selection algorithm. Finally, two incremental feature selection algorithms are designed on the basis of the above researches. Experiments are performed on ten public datasets to evaluate the robustness of the proposed metric and the performance of the incremental algorithms. Experimental results verify that the proposed metric is robust and our incremental algorithms are effective and efficient for updating reducts in dynamic ordered data.},

  abstract     = {Pythagorean fuzzy set (PFS) is a significant soft computing tool for tackling embedded fuzziness in decision-making. Many computing methods have been studied to facilitate the application of PFS in modeling practical problems, among which the concept of correlation coefficient is very important. This article proposes some novel methods of computing correlation between PFSs via the three characteristic parameters of PFS by incorporating the ideas of Pythagorean fuzzy deviation, variance, and covariance. These novel methods evaluate the magnitude of relationship, show the potency of correlation between the PFSs, and also indicate whether the PFSs are related in either negative or positive sense. The proposed techniques are substantiated together with some theoretical results and numerically validated to be superior in terms of reliability and accuracy compared to some similar existing techniques. Decision-making processes involving pattern recognition and career placement problems are determined using the proposed techniques.},

Moreover, stochastic factors are taken into account to make the model more general. Different from traditional time-triggered control, we introduce event-triggered control strategy into intermittent control and then intermittent dynamic event-triggered control (IDE-TC) is developed, which can reduce updates of the controller and save resources. Besides, we eliminate Zeno phenomena, which is independent of mathematical expectation. Furthermore, the minimum interexecution time by the IDE-TC can be obtained directly for T-SFSs under the stochastic case. In addition, in order to illustrate the theoretical results, an application about double-link robot arm model is given. Meanwhile, we exhibit some numerical simulations.},

  abstract     = {Aiming at the problem that existing robust fuzzy clustering algorithms are still sensitive to high noise, a total Bregman divergence-driven possibilistic fuzzy clustering with multiple information constraints and kernel metric (TSKFLICM) is proposed in this article. First, we introduce total Bregman divergence (TBD) to overcome the shortcoming that Bregman divergence is variant with rotation. Second, polynomial kernel function is used to kernelize TBD, and kernelized TBD is embedded with neighborhood information of pixels to further enhance its ability to suppress noise. Finally, kernelized TBD with spatial information constraints is combined with possibilistic typicality to construct the novel objective function of possibilistic fuzzy clustering, and a TBD-driven kernel possibilistic fuzzy clustering with multiple information constraints is obtained through optimization theory. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for noisy image segmentation is explained by means of sample weighted clustering method. Experimental results show that compared with other algorithms, the Jaccard score, segmentation accuracy, and peak signal-to-noise ratio of the proposed algorithm are improved by 0.017–0.481, 1.327\%–41.260\%, and 2.416–11.765, respectively. Therefore, the TSKFLICM algorithm has better segmentation performance and stronger antinoise ability than the existing state-of-the-art fuzzy clustering algorithm.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates the design and stability analysis of the interval type-2 (IT2) sampled-data (SD) fuzzy-model-based (FMB) control system with the optimal guaranteed cost performance. An IT2 Takagi–Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model is applied to describe the dynamics of the nonlinear systems where the parameter uncertainties are captured by the lower and upper membership functions. To conduct the stability analysis for the SD FMB control system, a looped-functional approach taking the advantage of the information about the sampling periods is employed. Because of the SD control strategy, the state will be sampled at each sampling instant and the control signal generated by the IT2SD fuzzy controller will be kept by the zero-order holder during the sampling period, which will result in mismatched membership grades between IT2 T-S fuzzy model and IT2SD fuzzy controller that leads to the complexity in carrying out stability analysis. Thanks to the imperfect premise matching concept, which allows the difference on the number of rules and the premise membership functions between model and controller, the design of the IT2SD fuzzy controller can be more flexible. To further relax the stability conditions and minimize the upper bound of the guaranteed cost index, the membership-function-dependent stability analysis approach which can make use of the features of the IT2 membership functions is adopted. The performance of the control system can also be adjusted through the choice of the weighting matrices in the cost function. The stability conditions building on the Lyapunov stability theory and the performance conditions building on the concept of the guaranteed cost control in the shape of linear matrix inequalities are established to assure the system stability and acquire the optimal guaranteed cost performance. The proposed IT2SDFMB control design is tested on the inverted pendulum system and the simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {The existing long-term time-series forecasting methods based on the neural networks suffer from multiple limitations, such as accumulated errors and diminishing temporal correlation, which compromise the prediction quality. To overcome these shortcomings, in this article, we build trend fuzzy granulation-based long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks to carry out long-term forecasting, where data points with consistent trend characteristics, including trend change, fluctuation range, and trend persistence, are predicted in unison rather than individually. Noticing that these trend characteristics are more urgently needed than just magnitude information, a question on how to granulate a time series into a granular time series consists of meaningful granules containing trend information that comes to be a crucial step. Only if the established granules fit the varying patterns of time series at utmost, such a granulation can make sense for the improvement of the forecasting accuracy; thus, an optimization method of trend-oriented fuzzy granulation is proposed to meliorate the granulation results. With the built trend fuzzy granulation-based LSTM networks, the successive iterations of one-step forecasting are prevented, and the prediction errors of data within a granule will not further increase. This is the first attempt to build trend fuzzy granule-based LSTM to predict the trend characteristics. Experiments on publicly available time series show good performance of the proposed model.},

Hierarchical clustering methods are used in order to generate a new reduced criteria set that can be handled by the experts. Fuzzy ontologies are used as an aid system that stores how much each alternative fulfills each criterion. The presented method makes it possible for the experts to carry out the group decision-making process by focusing on ranking the reduced set of criterion values. As a result, a comfortable decision environment is generated, in which the experts can make decisions by managing a fair amount of information.

First, the fuzzy ZMP controller, which regulates the feedback gains online based on the CoM height change and CoM tracking errors, is proposed. Second, we propose a fuzzy regulation law for variable stiffness, which is applied for uncertain contact situations and inspired by the pattern of human muscle stiffness.

Explicitly modeling the relationship between coordinated muscle activations from surface electromyography (sEMG) and human limb movements provides a new path of sEMG-based human–machine interface. Instead of the numeric features from individual channels, we propose a muscle synergy-driven adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) approach to predict continuous knee joint movements, in which muscle synergy reflects the motor control information to coordinate muscle activations for performing movements. Four human subjects participated in the experiment while walking at five types of speed: 2.0 km/h, 2.5 km/h, 3.0 km/h, 3.5 km/h, and 4.0 km/h. The study finds that the acquired muscle synergies associate the muscle activations with human joint movements in a low-dimensional space and have been further utilized for predicting knee joint angles. The proposed approach outperformed commonly used numeric features from individual sEMG channels with an average correlation coefficient of 0.92 $ \pm $ 0.05. Results suggest that the correlation between muscle activations and knee joint movements is captured by the muscle synergy-driven ANFIS model and can be utilized for the estimation of continuous joint angles.},

This article proposes a novel point set registration approach where the additional features (i.e., the normal vectors) extracted from the point sets are utilized and the convergence of the algorithm is guaranteed from the theoretical perspective.

The proposed algorithm is more accurate and robust to noise and outliers, and the theoretical convergence of the proposed approach is guaranteed. Our contributions of this article are summarized as follows. 1) The PSR problem with normal vectors is formally formulated through generalizing the BCPD approach. 2) The formulas for updating the parameters during the algorithm’s iterations are given in closed forms. 3) Extensive experiments have been done to verify the proposed approach and specifically its significant improvements over the BCPD has been validated.},

  abstract     = {Different from previous work on single skill learning from human demonstrations, an incremental motor skill learning, generalization and control method based on dynamic movement primitives (DMP) and broad learning system (BLS) is proposed for extracting both ordinary skills and instant reactive skills from demonstrations, the latter of which is usually generated to avoid a sudden danger (e.g., touching a hot cup). The method is completed in three steps. First, the ordinary skills are basically learned from demonstrations in normal cases by using DMP. Then, the incremental learning idea of BLS is combined with DMP to achieve multistylistic reactive skill learning such that the forcing function of the ordinary skills will be reasonably extended into multiple stylistic functions by adding enhancement terms and updating weights of the radial basis function kernels. Finally, electromyography signals are collected from human muscles and processed to achieve stiffness factors. By using fuzzy logic system, the two kinds of skills learned are integrated and generalized in new cases such that not only start, end and scaling factors but also the environmental conditions, robot reactive strategies and impedance control factors will be generalized to lead to various reactions. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, an obstacle avoidance experiment that enables robots to approach destinations flexibly in various situations with barriers will be undertaken.},

  abstract     = {Multitask modeling methods for Takagi–Sugeno–Kang (TSK) fuzzy systems exhibit better generalization ability attributed to the utilization of the knowledge of intertask correlation. However, existing methods usually ignore the balance between the sharing of the common knowledge across multiple tasks and the preservation of the task-specific characteristics of each rule. To this end, we propose a novel manifold-regularized multitask modeling method for TSK fuzzy system by introducing low-rank and sparse structures into consequent parameters across multiple tasks. Specifically, we decompose the consequent parameters into two components—a task–shared component that represents similar structure across multiple tasks, and a task-specific component that encodes the sparse characteristics of the individual tasks. This can be implemented by imposing low-rank constraints on the task-shared component and applying the sparse constraints on the task-specific component. A new manifold regularization is further devised to reflect the feature-feature relation, which provides prior knowledge in multitask learning. An efficient augmented Lagrange multiplier is developed to solve the optimization problem. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms the existing methods.},

Some fundamental aspects of PLTSs, such as order relations and basic operations, are not built in a solid way. The lack of required properties makes their applications be not sufficiently reliable. In this study, a PLTS is mapped to a stochastic variable. A partial order of PLTSs is defined based on the idea of stochastic order. The concept of total order is then provided by refining the partial order. Moreover, aggregation functions of PLTSs are proposed by defining an aggregation function in a set of linguistic terms. Operations and aggregation operators of PLTSs are further carried out based on the aggregation functions. The above theoretical developments own some merits such as the partial order is reasonable because the ranking results coincide with rational decision-makers who consider increasing utility functions, the operations preserve desirable properties that are satisfied by the linguistic aggregation functions, and the operations and aggregation operators of PLTSs could be specified according to practical applications based on the proposed theoretical frame work.},

An offline table stores a series of structures that include nested robust positive invariant sets with the corresponding nominal feedback controller gains, ancillary controller gains, and observer gains. According to bounds of real-time estimation error sets, the time-varying structures in the offlined table are searched.

An SLPFC design is given such that, for all possible random packet losses, the closed-loop delayed DPS is mean square exponentially stable. Delay-dependent conditions are obtained and then two procedures are given for designing the spatially local piecewise fuzzy controller: one casts the controller design into an iterative linear matrix inequality (LMI) algorithm and the other casts the controller design into a parameter-dependent LMI problem.

In addition, two distributed privacy-aware fuzzy range query processing algorithms are devised.

The mathematical methods are employed to discuss the properties WECSs in a theoretical manner, which are proven to be cost effective. It can be seen that the considered model contains the nonlinearities in terms of currents and rotational speed of the shaft that results in nonlinearities. The Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy approach is considered to be an effective tool to approximate the nonlinear model into local linear submodels without compromising the system characteristics. In general, WECSs are networked to each other, the event-triggered-based control (ETC) is considered to be an appropriate control regarding the reduction of packet loss and the ability to ensure the stable performance of the WECSs in an effective manner. The main advantage of utilizing the ETC is that it will activate the controllers with a user-designed event-triggering condition that helps to restrict the unnecessary network transmissions and reduce the leakages. By the virtue of the fuzzy Lyapunov function, intensive attention is focused on deriving the theoretical-based sufficient conditions in terms of solvable linear matrix inequalities, which ensure the global stability of the closed-loop model based on the Lyapunov stability theory. Detailed numerical simulations are performed with an experimental range of system parameters that illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed ETC scheme.},

In this work, two algorithms named jointly fuzzy C-Means and vaguely quantified nearest neighbor (VQNN) imputation (JFCM-VQNNI) and jointly fuzzy C-Means and fitted VQNN imputation (JFCM-FVQNNI) have been proposed by considering clustering conception and sufficient extraction of uncertain information. In the proposed JFCM-VQNNI and JFCM-FVQNNI algorithm, the missing value is regarded as a decision feature, and then, the prediction is generated for the objects that contain at least one missing value. Specially, as for JFCM-VQNNI algorithm, indistinguishable matrixes, tolerance relations, and fuzzy membership relations are adopted to identify the potential closest filled values based on corresponding similar objects and related clusters. On the basis of JFCM-VQNNI algorithm, JFCM-FVQNNI algorithm synthetic analyzes the fuzzy membership of the dependent features for instances with each cluster. In order to fill the missing values more accurately, JFCM-FVQNNI algorithm performs fuzzy decision membership adjustment in each object with respect to the related clusters by considering highly relevant decision attributes. The experiments have been carried out on five datasets. Based on the analysis of root-mean-square error, mean absolute error, comparison of imputation values with actual values, and classification accuracy results analysis, we can draw the conclusion that the proposed JFCM-FVQNNI and JFCM-VQNNI algorithms yields sufficient and reasonable imputation performance results by comparing with fuzzy C-Means parameter-based imputation algorithm and fuzzy C-Means rough parameter-based imputation algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Ranking of fuzzy numbers (FNs) is a key stage within fuzzy multicriteria decision analysis (FMCDA). However, the influence of FNs dependence on their ranking, including ranking alternatives within FMCDA, has not been studied yet. In this article, for studying such an influence, the widely used defuzzification-based fuzzy ranking methods, centroid index, and integral of means, along with their modifications, which are pairwise comparison defuzzification ranking methods, are explored. The authors argue that classical defuzzification ranking methods are intended to deal with independent FNs, whereas their modifications may be used for ranking of dependent FNs. It is provided a proof in which, pairwise comparison Yuan’s and defuzzification integral of means ranking methods, are equivalent when ordering independent and can differ when ordering dependent FNs; at the same time, Yuan’s and modified integral of means ranking methods are equivalent when ordering both independent and dependent FNs. Intransitivity of the two modified ranking methods when ordering dependent FNs as well as intransitivity of alternatives in FMCDA for fuzzy multiattribute value theory (FMAVT) as an example is proved. The distinctions in ranking of dependent FNs by all ranking methods under consideration are explored through ordering alternatives within FMAVT. For this, a real-life case study is considered, and the distinctions in ordering alternatives by classical and modified ranking methods are demonstrated. Statistical analysis of distinctions in ordering alternatives by FMAVT with different ranking methods is implemented with the use of Monte–Carlo simulation. The significance of distinctions for the choice and ranking multicriteria problems, as well as for justification of utilizing ranking methods under consideration in FMCDA, is discussed.},

  abstract     = {Since social media, virtual communities and networks rapidly grow, multiview data become more popular. In general, multiview data always contain different feature components in different views. Although these data are extracted in different ways (views) from diverse settings and domains, they are used to describe the same samples, which make them highly related. Hence, applying (single-view) clustering methods for multiview data poses difficulty in achieving desirable clustering results. Thus, multiview clustering methods should be developed that will utilize available multiview information. Most of multiview clustering techniques currently use k-means due to its conceptual simplicity, and use fuzzy c-means (FCM) that the datapoints can belong to more than one cluster based on their membership degrees from 0 to 1. However, the use of k-means or FCM may degrade its performance due to the presence of noise and outliers, especially on large or high-dimensional datasets. The constraint imposed on the membership degrees of k-means and FCM tends to assign a corresponding high membership value to an outlier or a noisy data point. To address these drawbacks, possibilistic c-means (PCM) relaxes the membership constraint of k-means and FCM so that outliers and noisy datapoints can be properly identified. On the other hand, there are various extensions of k-means and FCM for multiview data, but no extension of PCM for multiview data was made in the literature. Thus, we use PCM in our proposed multiview clustering model. In this article, we propose novel weighted multiview PCM algorithms designed for clustering multiview data as well as view and feature weights on PCM approaches, called W-MV-PCM and W-MV-PCM with L2 regularization (W-MV-PCM-L2). In multiview clustering, different views may vary with respect to its importance and each view may contain some irrelevant features. In the proposed algorithms, a learning scheme is constructed to compute for the view weights, and feature weights within each view. This scheme will be able to identify the importance of each view and, at the same time, it will also identify and select relevant features in each view. Comparisons of W-MV-PCM-L2 with existing multiview clustering algorithms are made on both synthetic and real datasets. The experimental results are evaluated using accuracy rate (AR) and external validity indexes, such as Rand index (RI) and normalized mutual information (NMI). The proposed W-MV-PCM-L2 algorithm with comparisons of existing algorithms under criteria of AR, RI, and NMI shows that it is a feasible and effective multiview clustering algorithm.},

  abstract     = {The law of importation, given by the equality $(x\wedge y) \longrightarrow z\equiv (x\longrightarrow (y\longrightarrow z))$ , is a tautology in classical logic and has been proved to be widely used in approximate reasoning and image processing. Some open problems of fuzzy implication dealing with the law of importation were suggested on 8th International Conference on Fuzzy Set Theory and Applications (FSTA 2006). In this article, we partially solve one open problem associated with this property. Specifically, we mainly devote ourselves to solving the general form of the law of importation $I(U(x,y),z)=I(x,I(y,z))$ , where $I$ is a fuzzy implication and $U$ is a conjunctive uninorm with a continuous underlying t-norm and a continuous underlying t-conorm. Along this study, given a fixed uninorm with continuous underlying operators, all fuzzy implications that satisfy the law of importation with respect to this uninorm, and having an $\alpha$ -section that is a continuous negation, are characterized.},

  abstract     = {As one of the most relevant data preprocessing techniques, discretization has played an important role in data mining, which is widely applied in industrial control. It can transform continuous features to discrete ones, thus improving the efficiency of data processing and adapting to learning algorithms that require discrete data as inputs. However, traditional discretization methods have shortcomings, such as highly complex programs, excessive numbers of intervals obtained, and significant loss of necessary information in the preprocessing of high-resolution remote sensing big data. Moreover, the large number of mixed pixels in the image is a primary reason for the uncertainty of remote sensing information systems, and current discretization methods are based on the assumption that one pixel only corresponds to the spectral information of a single object, without considering the influence of the uncertainty caused by a mixed spectrum, which causes the classification accuracy to drop after discretization. We propose a discretization method for high-resolution remote sensing big data. We determine the membership degree of each pixel in training samples through linear decomposition and establish the individual fitness function based on a fuzzy rough model. An adaptive genetic algorithm selects discrete breakpoints, and a MapReduce framework calculates the individual fitness of the population in parallel to obtain the optimal discretization scheme in the minimum time. Our method is compared to the best state-of-the-art discretization algorithms on the authentic remote sensing datasets. Experiments verified the effectiveness of the proposed method, which provides strong support for the subsequent processing of images.},

  abstract     = {Dempster–Shafer (D-S) evidence theory is an effective methodology to handle unknown and imprecise information because it can assign probability into the power set. However, the process of obtaining information is a complex task, which can consider the rational, conscious, objective evaluation of utility with behavioral effects. Besides, in most cases, information can be obtained from different angles at the same time. The quantum model of mass function (QM) uses amplitude and phase angle to easily express those properties of information that can extend D-S evidence theory to the unit circle in a complex plane. Moreover, everything in nature will have its opposite, which is a kind of universality. The Bayes theorem is essentially the process of negation. However, in most cases, decisions can be made by only fully considering the known information without considering the other side of the information. Hence, considering the negation of information is a question to be investigated deeply, which can analyze information from the other point. This article proposes negation of QM by using the subtraction of vectors in the unit circle, which can degenerate into negation proposed by Yager in standard probability theory and negation proposed by Yin et al. in D-S evidence theory. Negation can provide us more information to consider the problem from both positive and negative aspects. In this article, negation can be understood information, which does not belong to event $A$ , that is to say, negation can be regarded as nonmembership by using the fuzzy terms. Based on the above discussion, this article proposes the quantum pythagorean fuzzy evidence theory (QPFET), which is the novel work to consider QPFET from the point of negation. Besides, there are some numerical examples to explain the proposed method. In order to explore the applications of QPFET, this article discusses the possibility of the VI $\check{s}$ ekriterijumsko Kompromisno Rangiranje method under QPFET to handle multicriteria decision-making that enables us to capture 2-D data, considering not only amplitude but also phase angle.},

The novelty of the approach resides in its ability to implement the ACT continuously, which allows the covering of all possible consensus states of the group from its minimum to maximum consensus degrees. Therefore, it can be flexibly applied to GDM problems with different consistency requirements. A sensitivity analysis method with visual simulation is proposed to support the checking of the numbers of experts involved in the feedback process and the minimum adjustment cost associated with the different ACT intervals. Experimental results show that an increase in the ACT value will lead to an increase in the number of experts and adjustment cost involved in the feedback process. Eventually, a numerical example is included to simulate the feedback process under various decision making scenarios with different ACT intervals.},

Most of the existing methods for SaM estimation are restricted to a single object by constraining the camera and object motions. In this study, SaM estimation is extended for the case of multiple (or simply two) objects, and the restrictions on the camera and objects motions and the necessity for the information related to the camera velocity are relaxed by using the relative information of the two objects. The relative motion dynamics of partially measurable states of multiple objects are first introduced based on which the ranges (i.e., depths) of the two objects with respect to the camera, relative velocity between the objects, relative velocity between each object and the camera, and velocities of both the camera and objects are then estimated by using the proposed fuzzy integral sliding mode observer. The following cases for the camera and objects—that have static (stationary), dynamic (moving), or general (i.e., either static or dynamic) motions—are studied: 1) Two objects are at the same range with respect to the camera and 2) two objects are at different ranges with respect to the camera. Several situations—in which the ranges of the two objects with respect to the monocular camera, relative velocity between the two objects, and velocities of the camera and objects can be estimated—are described in detail. Simulations and experimental results demonstrate the validity of the proposed method.},

In this article, we first propose three new interval type-2 fuzzy similarity measures (IT-2 FSMs) as a dual concept of some semimetric distances between intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs). We also prove that the extended IT-2 FSMs satisfy many common properties (i.e., reflexivity, transivity, symmetry, and overlapping). Experiments are carried out on a variety of datasets including UCI learning machine and real data. Comparative studies between the proposed IT-2 FSMs and the other well-known existing similarity measures (Gorzalczany, Bustince, Mitchell, Zeng, and Li as well as VSM and Jaccard) are performed. Obviously, the best results are obtained with the IT-2 FSMs being resilient to the high levels of uncertainty noise. We also prove that our IT-2 FSMs can overcome the drawbacks of some existing similarity measures based on the accuracy rate measure. In addition, the proposed IT-2 FSMs are joined with fuzzy C-means algorithm as a clustering method and the proposed system is compared against the existing clustering algorithms (type-1 fuzzy k-means, type-1, and type-2 fuzzy C-means, cluster forest, bagged clustering, evidence accumulation, and random projection). Relying on the clustering quality parameters R and C (equivalent to the standard classification accuracy), the advanced IT-2FSMs show higher classification accuracy of about 86\% which outperforms nearly the other classifiers.},

A complete and monotone fuzzy rule-base is essential for devising a monotone zero-order Takagi–Sugeno–Kang (TSK) fuzzy inference system (FIS) model. However, such a complete and monotone fuzzy rule-base is not always available in practice. In this article, we develop an MFRI modeling scheme for generating a monotone zero-order TSK FIS from a monotone and incomplete fuzzy rule-base. In our proposal, a monotone-ordered fuzzy rule-base that consists of the available fuzzy rules from a monotone and incomplete fuzzy rule-base and those derived from the MFRI reasoning is formed. We outline three important properties that the MFRI&#39;s deduced fuzzy rules should satisfy to ensure a monotone-ordered fuzzy rule-base. A Lagrangian function for the MFRI scheme, together with its Karush–Kuhn–Tucker optimality conditions, is formulated and analyzed. The key idea is to impose constraints that guide the MFRI inference outcomes. An iterative MFRI algorithm that adopts an augmented Lagrangian function is devised. The proposed MFRI algorithm aims to achieve an ${\boldsymbol{\varepsilon }}$ -optimality condition and to produce an ${\boldsymbol{\varepsilon }}$ -optimal solution, which is geared for practical applications. We apply the MFRI algorithm to a failure mode and effect analysis case study and a tanker ship heading regulation problem. The results indicate the effectiveness of MFRI for generating monotone TSK FRI models in tackling practical problems.},

Our contribution includes a step forward beyond usual FTC results to exhibit that the system output of nonsquare and square MIMO systems is uniformly bounded against actuator faults by a novel FTC methodology without the fault detection unit, as well as stay in the preselected constraints. To obtain new results, an equivalent unconstrained system is established by employing an error transformation technique. Furthermore, a learning-based switching function scheme is proposed to automatically activate different groups of actuators without human intervention for attenuating the influence of faulty actuators. By this means, no explicit fault detection and isolation units are needed to result in reducing the risk of false alarm or missed detections and expediting the responsiveness of the controller. Moreover, the obstacle caused by unknown control directions is circumvented by a novel technique combining the matrix decomposition technique and Nussbaum-type function. It is proved that the desired tracking performance with prescribed output bounds and the boundedness of all the signals in the closed-loop system can be guaranteed via an improved average dwell time approach. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the merits of the proposed controller.},

Interestingly, the $L$ -topologies defined by open sets and complements of closed sets coincide for any pointwise pseudometric.

  abstract     = {Recently, multilabel classification has generated considerable research interest. However, the high dimensionality of multilabel data incurs high costs; moreover, in many real applications, a number of labels of training samples are randomly missed. Thus, multilabel classification can have great complexity and ambiguity, which means some feature selection methods exhibit poor robustness and yield low prediction accuracy. To solve these issues, this article presents a novel feature selection method based on multilabel fuzzy neighborhood rough sets (MFNRS) and maximum relevance minimum redundancy (MRMR) that can be used on multilabel data with missing labels. First, to handle multilabel data with missing labels, a relation coefficient of samples, label complement matrix, and label-specific feature matrix are constructed and implemented in a linear regression model to recover missing labels. Second, the margin-based fuzzy neighborhood radius, fuzzy neighborhood similarity relationship, and fuzzy neighborhood information granule are developed. The MFNRS model is built based on multilabel neighborhood rough sets combined with fuzzy neighborhood rough sets. Based on algebra and information views, certain fuzzy neighborhood entropy-based uncertainty measures are proposed for MFNRS. The fuzzy neighborhood mutual information-based MRMR model with label correlation is improved to evaluate the performance of candidate features. Finally, a feature selection algorithm is designed to improve the performance for multilabel data with missing labels. Experiments on 20 datasets verify that our method is effective not only for recovering missing labels but also for selecting significant features with better classification performance.},

  abstract     = {A fault isolation, estimation, and fault-tolerant control (FTC) scheme for nonlinear time-varying delay stochastic distribution control systems was presented in this article. The Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy model was adopted to represent the nonlinear dynamics of time-varying delay systems. According to the output equivalence principle and Laplace transformation, an augmented state vector was given to solve the time-varying delay problem. When multiple actuator faults and interference occur simultaneously, fault detection, isolation, and fault estimation were designed to obtain the fault information. To decouple faults and obtain the size and location information of the fault, the system was separated into two parts through the designed multiple conversion matrices, in which one subsystem was only affected by one actuator fault. This has simplified the design of fault isolation and estimation. An adaptive observer for fault estimation was given. Then, the fault information such as the time, location, and size was determined. The observer gain matrices were calculated using linear matrix inequality. When a fault was detected and diagnosed, an FTC algorithm was devised using the proportional–integral control scheme to compensate the fault as much as possible. It has been shown that even if multiple faults actuator occurred simultaneously, the FTC controller still ensured that the output probability density function of the system traces the desired probability density function. Finally, the expected results were obtained through simulation example, which confirms the effectiveness of the method.},

  abstract     = {The consideration of social influence in solving group decision-making (GDM) problems has caused widespread concern in recent years. In most cases, the interaction of experts and the association efforts of alternatives are often not to be ignored in the actual decision-making environment, especially for those situations with incomplete information in the process of opinion changes. In this study, a novel measure-based GDM model is proposed to more comprehensively consider such a factor. Also, a positive cooperation-first principle is proposed as a guide for situations with incomplete information. One of the main advantages of the proposed model is that the estimation of missing fuzzy preference relations is completed according to the modeling results of peer interactions, which makes the preference evolution results more reliable. With the utilization of the fuzzy measure framework, the Shapley function and interaction indicator, originated from the cooperative game theory, are also introduced to extract the interaction features. After several iterations, the global opinion can be eventually obtained via the social influence network technique. Furthermore, it is also demonstrated that the evolution of individual opinions converges to the ultimate collective opinion. A case study of supplier selection with the proposed model is implemented to illustrate its practicality and effectiveness. Related comparisons and discussion regarding related methods are also mentioned.},

It is known that time-varying output constraint, time-varying error constraints, and input saturations are commonly seen issues in many practical engineering systems due to inherent physical limitations and performance requirements. To deal with these problems and improve the convergence rate of the control system, a novel fixed-time convergent adaptive fuzzy control scheme is proposed for the considered uncertain nonlinear systems via the time-varying barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) technique. First, to deal with the unknown nonlinearities and uncertainties in the system dynamic model, fuzzy logic systems are utilized to approximate the unknown functions of the considered model. Then, the problem of asymmetric input amplitude and rate saturations is handled by constructing a unified smooth characterizing function and an innovative auxiliary design signal system. Subsequently, considering physical limitations and performance requirements, a novel time-varying BLF-based adaptive fuzzy backstepping control scheme is designed for the uncertain nonstrict-feedback nonlinear systems to realize superior tracking performances and keep the states staying in predefined time-varying compact regions during operations. Further, rigorous theoretical analyses have been conducted to show that the proposed control scheme achieves fixed-time convergence of all signals in the closed-loop control system. Finally, representative simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.},

  abstract     = {Pythagorean fuzzy set (PFS) is an extension of the intuitionistic fuzzy set. It has a wider space of membership degrees. Thus, it is more capable in expressing and handling the fuzzy information in engineering practice and scientific research. However, PFSs lack a mathematical tool to express stochastic or probability information, rendering it unsuitable for application in many scenarios. In this article, an ordered number pair is used to describe fuzzy information and stochastic information under uncertain environments, namely constrained Pythagorean fuzzy set (CPFS). The CPFS has two components, $\text{CPFS}=(A,P)$ , where $A$ is the classical PFS, while $P$ is a measurement of reliability for $A$ . For PFS, CPFS is the first unified description of fuzzy information and probabilistic information, which is a more flexible way to describe knowledge or thinking. Furthermore, the similarity measure of CPFSs is presented, which meets the similarity measure theorems and can better indicate the flexibility of CPFSs. Numerical examples are used to demonstrate that the CPFSs similarity measure is reasonable and effective. The method of similarity measure can be degenerated to the similarity measure of PFSs under specific case and can avoid generating counter-intuitive results. In addition, similarity measure of CPFSs is applied to medical diagnosis and target classification of Iris. These experimental results have proven the practicability and effectiveness of our model.},

  abstract     = {Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a prevailing method of modal infant brain tissue analysis that precisely segments brain tissue and is vitally important for diagnosis, remediation, and analysis of early brain development. To achieve such segmentation is challenging, particularly for the brain of a six-month-old, owing to several factors: poor image quality; isointense contrast between white and gray matter and the simple incomplete volume consequence of a tiny brain size; and discrepancies in brain tissues, illumination settings, and the vagarious region. This article addresses these challenges with a fuzzy-informed deep learning segmentation network that takes T1- and T2-weighted MRIs as inputs. First, a fuzzy logic layer encodes input to the fuzzy domain. Second, a volumetric fuzzy pooling (VFP) layer models the local fuzziness of the volumetric convolutional maps by applying fuzzification, accumulation, and defuzzification on the adjacency feature map neighborhoods. Third, the VFP layer is employed to design the fuzzy-enabled multiscale feature learning module to enable the extraction of brain features in different receptive fields. Finally, we redesign the Project &amp; Excite module using the VPF layer to enable modeling uncertainty during feature recalibration, and a comprehensive training paradigm is used to learn the ideal parameters of every building block. Extensive experimental comparative studies substantiate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed model in terms of different evaluation metrics to solve multimodal infant brain segmentation problems on the iSeg-2017 dataset.},

  abstract     = {Fuzzy clustering techniques, especially fuzzy C-means (FCM) and its weighted variants, are typical partitive clustering models that are widely used for revealing possible hidden structures in data. Although they can quantitatively depict the overlapping areas with a partition matrix, their performances deteriorate when dealing with high-dimensional data because the distance computations may be negatively impacted by the irrelevant features, and then the concentration effect may arise. Moreover, they are sensitive to noisy environments. To tackle these obstacles, a robust jointly sparse fuzzy clustering method (RJSFC) is proposed in this study. The representative prototypes, sparse membership grades, and an orthogonal projection matrix are simultaneously learnt when optimizing RJSFC. The obtained low-dimensional embeddings can preserve the local neighborhood structure, and the clustering is conducted in the transformed lower dimensional space rather than the original space, which improves the capability of fuzzy clustering for dealing with high-dimensional scenarios. Furthermore, ${L_{2,1}}$ -norm is exploited as the basic metric for both loss and regularization parts in RJSFC, the robustness of the model and the interpretability of the extracted features are enhanced. The notions of fuzzy clustering, neighborhood structure preservation, and feature extraction are seamlessly integrated into a unified model. The limitation of the previous two-stage clustering framework when dealing with high-dimensional data entailing dimensionality reduction and clustering procedures separately can be effectively addressed. Extensive experimental results on various well-known datasets demonstrate the usefulness of RJSFC when comparing with some state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Overlap functions are a type of aggregation functions that are not required to be associative, generally used to indicate the overlapping degree between two values. They have been successfully used as a conjunction operator in several practical problems, such as fuzzy-rule-based classification systems (FRBCSs) and image processing. Some extensions of overlap functions were recently proposed, such as general overlap functions and, in the interval-valued context, n -dimensional interval-valued overlap functions. The latter allow them to be applied in n -dimensional problems with interval-valued inputs, such as interval-valued classification problems, where one can apply interval-valued FRBCSs (IV-FRBCSs). In this case, the choice of an appropriate total order for intervals, such as an admissible order, can play an important role. However, neither the relationship between the interval order and the n -dimensional interval-valued overlap function (which may or may not be increasing for that order) nor the impact of this relationship in the classification process have been studied in the literature. Moreover, there is not a clear preferred n -dimensional interval-valued overlap function to be applied in an IV-FRBCS. Hence, in this article, we: first, present some new results on admissible orders, which allow us to introduce the concept of n -dimensional admissibly ordered interval-valued overlap functions, that is, n -dimensional interval-valued overlap functions that are increasing with respect to an admissible order; second, develop a width-preserving construction method for this kind of function, derived from an admissible order and an n -dimensional overlap function, discussing some of its features; finally, analyze the behavior of several combinations of admissible orders and n -dimensional (admissibly ordered) interval-valued overlap functions when applied in IV-FRBCSs. All in all, the contribution of this article resides in pointing out the effect of admissible orders and n -dimensional admissibly ordered interval-valued overlap functions, both from a theoretical and applied points of view, the latter when considering classification problems.},

  abstract     = {Time-series analysis has been an active area of research for years, with important applications in forecasting or discovery of hidden information such as patterns or anomalies in observed data. In recent years, the use of time-series analysis techniques for the generation of descriptions and summaries in natural language of any variable, such as temperature, heart rate, or CO 2 emission has received increasing attention. Natural language has been recognized as more effective than traditional graphical representations of numerical data in many cases, in particular, in situations where a large amount of data needs to be inspected or when the user lacks the necessary background and skills to interpret it. In this article, we describe a novel mechanism to generate linguistic descriptions of time series using natural language and fuzzy logic techniques. The proposed method generates quality summaries capturing the time-series features that are relevant for a user in a particular application, and can be easily customized for different domains.

Different from the previous work, both the logarithmic quantizer and the static output feedback controller are dependent on the operation system; by means of hidden Markov models, their modes run asynchronously with that of FMSSPSs. Additionally, the deception attacks are guided by a Bernoulli variable, and nonlinear characteristics are modeled by the Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy model. By resorting to a mode-dependent Lyapunov functional, several criteria are acquired and strictly $(\mathscr {Q},\mathscr {S},\mathscr {R})\text{--}\gamma$ -dissipative of FMSSPSs can be ensured. Finally, a dc motor model is expressed to illustrate the effectiveness of the asynchronous control scheme.},

Meanwhile, without requiring any assumptions, time delays can be handled by appropriately incorporating the delayed nonlinear functions into the Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional. Then, a dynamic event-triggered control mechanism is designed to dynamically adjust the threshold parameter.

  abstract     = {To simultaneously monitor some electrical or mechanical faults of an in-wheel motor and intelligently evaluate the operation safety, in this article, a fuzzy system of operation safety assessment (OSA) is proposed in this article. This method first uses many symptom parameters (SPs), such as root mean square, crest factor, temperature rise, and current covariance to express the features of the electrical and mechanical faults from different perspectives, such as vibration, noise, temperature, current, and voltage; possibility theory is employed to translate the probability density function of each SP into the possibility function, and sample data are gradually updated to optimize the possibility function for obtaining the SPs’ membership functions that are evaluation models. Second, the probabilities of the current operation state, that is safety, attention, or danger, are obtained from each evaluation model in a stage. Picture fuzzy set (PFS) is used to define a basic picture fuzzy number (PFN); thus, many PFNs from multiple models and multiple stages are used to establish an OSA&#39;s decision matrix. Third, Mahalanobis distance is reintegrated into PFS&#39;s theory for objectively judging the real-time evaluation information, and the best–worst method is used to estimate subjectively the initial evaluation experience; thus, the multimodel linkage mechanism is designed. Finally, TODIM is modified to define the relative safety ratio, and prospect theory is employed to structure the global index for formulating the multistage collaboration approach; thus, a fuzzy OSA&#39;s system is established. The effectiveness of the proposed method was verified by the experimental analysis for the operation safety of in-wheel motor with electrical and mechanical faults.},

In this article, an improvement of the enhanced opposite direction searching (IEODS) algorithm is presented to obtain the type reduced set more efficiently. The IEODS algorithm improves the iterative process of the original EODS algorithm through the width of the upper and lower member functions of the IT2 FS. In this way, the IEODS algorithm uses a single-sided iteration process. It has a better initial point to greatly reduce the number of iterations. Quantitative analysis and simulation based experiments show that the IEODS algorithm can save more than 90\% of the iterations required in the EODS algorithm. It makes the IEODS algorithm more suitable for practical applications, especially to various development platforms with an explanatory programming language as a tool, greatly expanding the application range of the IT2 FLS.},

Particularly, the acquisition of the less conservative fixed time benefits from the new controllers which not only contains the common feedback gains but also can be comprised of the general coefficients and the fuzzy gains.

  abstract     = {Functional data analysis (FDA) in which each data sample is a function rather than a vector or a matrix has attracted a lot of attention in the statistics community in recent years. However, most of the existing functional data regression works focus on linear models; and there is a lack of research on general nonlinear functional regression models that can fit nonlinear relationships between functional data, especially when the input and output of the models are both functions. Furthermore, in the fuzzy system research domain, there is no fuzzy system approach to FDA so far as we are aware of. To fill in these dual gaps, this article develops the first fuzzy system approach to FDA by proposing a functional fuzzy regression model known as functional fuzzy system (FFS) and its learning method from data. FFS is a general nonlinear functional regression model, which has inputs and outputs are functions in infinite dimensional spaces. Furthermore, constructed with a collection of the “If-Then” fuzzy rules, on the one hand, FFS has a flexible structure, and can model the functional data without model structure assumptions; On the other hand, the fuzzy rule base enables FFS to be an interpretable model. An identification method for FFS is proposed for minimizing the mean squared prediction errors. The proposed FFS is compared with many existing state-of-the-art functional regression models upon benchmark examples using both artificial and real datasets, and shows that FFS is an effective model and can obtain preferable results.},

Each agent is considered in a nonaffine nonstrict-feedback form under input saturation and output constraint which contains unknown dynamics and external disturbances. Fuzzy logic systems (FLSs) are exploited as an effective online approximation tool to tackle system uncertainties. By employing the unique property of FLS, the algebraic loop problem is overcome and by designing novel adaptive laws of the FLS weights, the computation burden is decreased significantly. The threshold of the event-triggered condition is improved compared to the conventional relative-threshold mechanism. A modified performance function called finite-time performance function is introduced to constrain the synchronization errors within the prescribed performance bounds in finite time. The dynamic surface control technique is then developed to avoid the issue of the “explosion of complexity.” Moreover, by developing a new decomposition for the controller gain function resulting from the mean-value theorem and introducing an auxiliary system, the input saturation nonlinearity that affects the nonaffine form stability is handled. Through the Lyapunov stability analyses, it is shown that the developed control algorithm ensures the closed-loop NMAS trajectory to be cooperatively semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded. Additionally, the tracking errors are driven to a predefined region around zero in finite time. Finally, the efficiency of the established theoretical results is validated by the simulation studies.},

The IT2 polynomial fuzzy model is an effective and powerful approach to analyze and synthesize uncertain nonlinear systems. This is the first attempt to design both the full-order and reduced-order IT2 polynomial fuzzy filter to ensure that the filtering error system is asymptotically stable under the dissipativity constraint. The design of filtering is based on the imperfect premise matching scheme where the number of fuzzy rules and shapes of membership functions of the designed fuzzy filter can differ from those of the IT2 polynomial fuzzy model, to provide greater design flexibility and lower implementation burden. By utilizing the Lyapunov–Krasovskii-functional-based approach, the information of membership functions, time delay, and system states is taken into account in the design process to develop the relaxed membership-function-dependent and delay-dependent filtering existence criteria.

  abstract     = {An adaptive-network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) offers a popular and powerful fuzzy inference mechanism. As with many other advanced data-driven techniques, developing an effective ANFIS typically requires sufficient training data. However, in many real-world applications, it is not always straightforward to obtain a large amount of representative data that cover the entire problem space to accomplish the required training, seriously restricting the performance of a learned ANFIS. This article introduces a new ANFIS learning approach through an evolutionary process, which is able to generate an ANFIS with only a small amount of training data in a certain problem region, by interpolating well-trained ANFISs in the neighboring regions. Such a process works by first producing an initial population of candidate fuzzy rules in the region of data shortage, through interpolating a rule dictionary constructed from trained ANFISs in the neighborhood regions. The crossover and mutation operations over these candidate rules are then executed in an effort to attain candidates of improved performance. When this genetic learning process terminates, the chromosomes in the final population either collectively form or each individually represents a learned ANFIS, depending on whether a single fuzzy rule or a set of fuzzy rules representing an entire ANFIS is implemented with a chromosome within the evolving population. Comparative experimental evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets are carried out, demonstrating that in spite of data shortage, the proposed interpolation approach is able to produce ANFIS models that significantly outperform those trained using existing learning mechanisms.},

  abstract     = {Opacity is an important security notion for discrete event systems (DESs) to measure the secret behaviors leaked to an intruder. The intruder is usually modeled as a malicious observer who always attempts to infer secret behaviors based on his dynamical observations of the system. In our earlier research, we proposed several opacity measures for DESs from the perspective of fuzzy logic, in which the intruder is assumed to only infer the current secret behaviors. Considering that modern computers usually have a powerful computation ability and rich memory resources, this article presents a new opacity measure of DESs, called as fuzzy infinite-step opacity (FIO) measure, where the intruder is assumed to have the ability of inferring all the secret behaviors that occurred in the past. In addition, the properties and the calculation of the FIO measure are also investigated. The FIO measure can be used to assess the secret-leakage situations of fuzzy DESs attacked by powerful intruders. For the purpose of illustration, we present a practical application of the FIO measure in evaluating the privacy protection mechanisms in location-based services.},

  abstract     = {The plethora of ways of data representation and their applications to system modeling is inherently associated with dimensionality reduction. In a nutshell, the result of dimensionality reduction should support efficient ways of constructing ensuing models (classifiers and predictors) as well as an interpretation of the data themselves. Furthermore, there should be a suitable measure quantifying the quality of data positioned in the reduced space. We advocate that what makes the reduced data interpretable goes hand in hand with revealing a logic fabric of the data, suppressing redundancy, and finally arriving at a logic description of data. The anticipation is that the reduced data can be described in the form of logic expressions formed over the original highly dimensional data. Evidently, having these above-stated points in mind, the aim of this article is twofold: 1) to develop a logic-oriented data representation with the aid of autoencoders; and 2) to quantify the quality of results of this dimensionality reduction by incorporating a facet of information granularity. In other words, we argue that the result of dimensionality reduction gives rise to information granules whose level of granularity associates with the quality of processing completed by the autoencoder. In light of the recent surge of architectures of deep learning, the study is focused on the construction and analysis of logic-oriented autoencoders. We propose a two-level architecture composed of the logic-oriented processing units organized in two layers of logic processing units. As data representation provided by the autoencoder is not ideal, we augment the original architecture by granular parameters, which give rise to granular logic-oriented autoencoders. A suite of experiments is also reported.},

Then, such estimator is embedded in the feedback loops, which results in a static delayed output-feedback sliding surface. On this basis, the sliding mode control law depending on consecutive measurements is used to stabilize the fuzzy system subject to estimation biases and measurement noises. Different from the existing publications, the estimator and controller parameters are codesigned by genetic algorithm to make a tradeoff among multiple objectives: the closed-loop stability, noise attenuation, and estimation accuracy.

  abstract     = {The evolving fuzzy technique is a recent development in the soft-computing field that has shown some promising results in applications such as control, classification, and short-term prediction. However, evolving fuzzy techniques still have challenges in terms of high-speed processing of cluster/rule generation, especially in long-term prediction applications due to the broader distribution of the input space. These factors can lead to problems such as overfitting in optimization and high computational costs, which could limit their applications in real-time monitoring. In this article, an adaptive evolving fuzzy (AEF) technique consisting of two novel aspects is developed to tackle these problems. First, an error-assessment method is suggested to monitor the trend of the cumulative training errors and to control the fuzzy cluster evolving process. Second, an adaptive particle filter algorithm is proposed to optimize the fuzzy clusters in order to enhance incremental learning and improve modeling efficiency. The effectiveness of the proposed AEF predictor is verified by simulation tests; it is also implemented for battery remaining useful life forecasting. Test results have shown that the proposed AEF technique can effectively capture the system&#39;s dynamic characteristics with fewer rules and can provide more flexibility in fuzzy modeling.},

Among different classification paradigms, those based on fuzzy rules are suitable solutions to stress the interpretability of the global systems. However, in case of addressing Big Data analytics, they may comprise an excessive number of rules and/or linguistic labels that not only may cause losing the system performance but also may affect the system semantic as well as the system interpretability. In this article, we propose IFC-BD, an interpretable fuzzy classifier for Big Data, aiming at boosting the horizons of explainability by learning a compact yet accurate fuzzy model. IFC-BD is developed in a cell-based distributed framework through the three working stages of initial rule learning, rule generalization, and heuristic rule selection. This whole procedure allows reaching from a high number of specific rules to less number of more general and confident rules. Additionally, in order to resolve possible rules conflict, a new estimated rule weight is proposed specifically for big data problems. IFC-BD was evaluated in comparison to the state-of-the-art approaches of the fuzzy classification paradigm, considering interpretability, accuracy, and running time. The findings of the experiments revealed that the proposed algorithm was able to improve the explainability of fuzzy rule-based classifiers as well as their predictive performance.},

However, the scheme involves a class of high-order smooth functions and their time derivatives, which can make the controller structure become sophisticated especially when the relative degree of system is quite large. To overcome this problem, in the article, we propose a new direct adaptive fuzzy control scheme based on a class of reduced-order smooth functions. With the scheme, no partial-derivative term is involved in controller and virtual controllers, only one adaptive law is used regardless of the increase of fuzzy rules, and also the time derivative of Lyapunov function can be ensured negative semidefinite. It is proved that all closed-loop signals are bounded, and the output tracking error converges to a prescribed interval asymptotically. The transient tracking performance and robustness of the proposed control scheme are also considered. The effectiveness of the obtained results is illustrated by two practical control systems.},

The search for images consists of establishing a correspondence between the available images and those sought by the user, by measuring the similarity between the images. In fact, image search per content is generally based on the similarity between the visual characteristics of the images. The distance function used to evaluate the similarity between images depends not only on the criteria of the search but also on the representation of the characteristics of the image. This is the main idea of a content-based image retrieval system. In this article, we first constructed type-2 beta fuzzy membership of descriptor vectors to help manage inaccuracy and uncertainty of the characteristics extracted from the feature of images. Subsequently, the retrieved images are ranked according to the novel similarity measure, which is noted type-2 fuzzy nearness measure (IT2FNM). By analogy to type-2 fuzzy logic, and motivated by a near sets theory, we advanced a new fuzzy similarity measure (FSM) noted as IT2FNM. Then, we propose three new IT2FSMs and provide mathematical justification to demonstrate that the proposed FSMs satisfy proximity properties (i.e., reflexivity, transitivity, symmetry, and overlapping). The experimental results generated using three image databases show consistent and significant results.},

  abstract     = {This article is concerned with a problem of relational factorization which engages fuzzy relational calculus. It forms an interesting alternative to the method of nonnegative matrix factorization that has been commonly discussed and found in numerous applications. The relational factorization takes original n -dimensional data located in the unit hypercube and factorizes it into data of lower dimensionality and some fuzzy relations. Owing to the logic nature of processing delivered by relational calculus, the dimensionality reduction exhibits transparency as the reduction mechanism itself is described in terms of logic expressions. Two types of factorizations mechanisms are investigated by using s–t and t–s composition operators where t and s are triangular norms and conorms, respectively. A two-level process of factorization is designed. A gradient-based learning scheme is developed. The quantification of the performance of the factorization process is realized by bringing a concept of information granularity: The obtained fuzzy relations are formed based on granular constructs and the quality of the produced factorization is assessed in terms of the coverage and specificity of the obtained granular results. A collection of experiments is included to present the performance of factorization and its parametric analysis. In addition, the proposed algorithm comes with sound interpretability in terms of both the structure of the model and an intuitive meaning of the fuzzy relations being the result of factorization.},

Then Fds rules and dynamic pinning control (DPC) method are adopted to design the CMNNs, which can effectively promote the information exchange between the switching signals and the fuzzy processes and can improve the utilization of the communication bandwidth between the nodes of CMNNs. Meanwhile, the method of constructing auxiliary state variables is adopted here to deal with the presented model, so that the coupled and isolated systems with different dimensions can realize information exchange and data sharing. This method also provides a solution for researchers by using low-dimensional systems to estimate or synchronize high-dimensional systems. Moreover, by means of Lyapunov&amp;#x2013;Krasovskii functional, auxiliary orthogonal matrix, and some inequality processing techniques, the conditions of modified function projective synchronization for Fds CMNNs are derived via the DPC on time scales.

Therefore, the following clustering is realized based on the GARCH model parameters, which can help reduce the dimensionality of the original time series at the same time. Then, to produce semantically sound clustering results, we granulate the parameters based on the axiomatic fuzzy set (AFS) theory and structure them into a collection of meaningful and semantically sound entities, i.e., AFS information granules. Furthermore, the hierarchical structure of AFS information granules is built to realize time series clustering under the framework of granular computing. In the proposed approach, the characteristics of financial time series is fully considered to proceed dimensionality reduction, and the semantic clustering results obtained for different numbers of clusters are guaranteed to be the most informative. In the experiments, an application for clustering the time series coming from Chinese Yuan exchange rates against international currencies is presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed clustering method. The results of clustering of the proposed method are the same as those of the fuzzy C-means algorithm and the hierarchical clustering with ward linkage, where the clustering results produced by the AFS hierarchical clustering exhibit well-articulated semantics at each level of the hierarchy.},

  abstract     = {This article studies the integrated fault-tolerant control (FTC) and fault estimation (FE) problem using polynomial fuzzy model (PFM) based on the sum of squares (SOS) approach. The integrated approach not only considers the bidirectional interaction between fault diagnosis and control units but also ensures an optimal response. The transient management in the fault occurrence situation and the alleviation of bidirectional interaction between FE and FTC are the motivational challenges. However, the integrated approach increases the complexity and problem&amp;#x0027;s dimension. In this situation, PFM can reduce the problem&amp;#x0027;s dimensions and increase modeling accuracy. The additive actuator faults, input disturbance, and structured uncertainty are considered to bring the problem closer to practical applications. A polynomial fuzzy observer with unknown input is designed to estimate the time-varying faults that is used to remove the effects of faults on the control input. Thus, the proposed approach benefits from PFM in FE and FTC synthesis to reduce the design dimensions, have a more precise model, and make the synthesis less conservative. Moreover, the PFM is more robust against intense model uncertainties and faults. To evaluate the proposed approach, the FTC of an inverted-pendulum system is simulated. The fault-tolerant and fault estimation performances of the proposed approach are compared with those of the linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach. The simulated results show that the proposed SOS approach outperforms the LMI approach.},

A generalized parameter-dependent reciprocally convex inequality (GPDRCI) is presented to handle the derivative of triple integral terms, which is more general than some existing ones. By choosing suitable flexible polynomials with tunable parameters, novel flexible polynomial-based functions (FPFs) are proposed in delay-product types, which overcome the incompletely slack matrices, higher-order time delay and insufficient parameters in the existing functions. Benefitting from completely slack matrices and lower-order time delay, coupling relationship among system states and time delay is fully linked. Based on the GPDRCI and FPFs, a stability condition is derived for T&amp;#x2013;S fuzzy systems. Based on the stability criterion, considering both the time-varying delay and its bounds, a generalized memory controller is designed for T&amp;#x2013;S fuzzy systems, which covers the memoryless and traditional memory ones as its special cases. In addition, the constraints on introduced slack matrices in some existing works are avoided with the help of a matrix inequality decoupling technique. These provide extra free dimensions in the solution space. Some examples are employed to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.},

For capturing the correlation among features and reflecting the data structure, an improved version of a T-GrM is offered by incorporating the principal component analysis. The proposed granulation models are evaluated on synthetic datasets, where the obtained experimental results offer some insights into the feasibility of the designed models and describe the effect of parameter values on the constructed information granules. The improved version of the T-GrM has the advantage of being transparent by generating information granules on several principal components, and thereby, the description of information granules is simpler and descriptive.

  abstract     = {Segmentationof MRI imagesin the presence of artifacts such as noise and bias field effect (BFE) is challenging. In this article, to handle both artifacts, we have formulated an intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS) theory based bias-corrected intuitionistic fuzzy c-means with spatial neighborhood information (SNI) method for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) image segmentation. We represent the image in terms of IFSs using two well-known intuitionistic fuzzy generation functions, namely Sugeno’s negation function (SNF) and Yager’s negation function (YNF). In this way, the proposed approach takes advantage of the IFS theory to address the uncertainty and vagueness present in data. The SNI term helps to retain the fine image details in the segmentation process, which is usually lost when smoothing is used. The BFE is modeled as a slow varying intensity field additive in nature with mean zero in IFS framework. The proposed approach estimates the bias field and produces a segmented image simultaneously. The segmentation performance of the proposed method is evaluated in terms of the Dice score, average segmentation accuracy (ASA), and index of variation. Further, the comparison of the proposed method with other similar state-of-the-art methods on two well-known publicly available Brain MRI datasets shows the significant improvements in segmentation performance in terms of ASA, Dice score, and index of variation. The proposed approach achieves 93\% ASA in the presence of severe bias field and noise artifacts on BrainWeb simulated dataset, which outperformed the state-of-the-art methods.},

We first discuss some basic operation laws of probabilistic hesitant fuzzy numbers, based on which the concepts of continuous PHFSs and continuous probabilistic hesitant fuzzy functions (c-PHFFs) are defined. They are the main objects of our research. We further explore definite integrals of the c-PHFFs and their related properties. They have direct and powerful applications in continuous probabilistic hesitant fuzzy environments, and lay the foundation for subsequent theoretical analysis. Based on the weight density function, we finally get the weighted-integral operator of continuous probabilistic hesitant fuzzy information. Then, some important properties of this integration operator are studied, including normalization, monotonicity, boundedness, etc. We are also devoted to revealing the inner connection between the continuous probabilistic hesitant fuzzy weighted-integral operator and the probabilistic hesitant fuzzy weighted averaging operator, the latter is usually used when dealing with discrete information. At last, we state why it is necessary to introduce a novel aggregation method based on continuous probabilistic hesitant fuzzy definite integrals, and in turn provide an application of the proposed method to prove its validity and rationality.},

The evolving fuzzy granules correspond to radial inclusion Weibull functions. They are interpreted by the extreme value theory as the limiting distribution of the relative proximity among the rules of the learning model. Regarding the parameters of the Takagi–Sugeno term at the consequent of the rules, the algorithm enhances the already demonstrated benefits of multitask learning by replacing a binary version with a fuzzy structural relationship among the rules. The pairwise similarity among the rules is automatically provided by the current interaction of the evolving fuzzy granules at the antecedent and at the consequent parts of their corresponding rules. Several computational experiments, using artificial and real-world time series, attest to the dominating prediction performance of EVeP when compared to the state-of-the-art evolving algorithms.},

This new concept conciliates the social choice—where well-known impossibility results as the Arrovian ones are encountered—and the decision-making approaches—where the necessity of fusing rankings is unavoidable. Moreover, it gives rise to a reasonable definition of the concept of a ranking fusion function that does indeed satisfy the axioms of a general mean. Then, we will introduce some methods to build ranking fusion functions, paying a special attention to the use of score functions, and pointing out the equivalence between ranking and scoring. To conclude, we prove that any ranking fusion function introduces a partial order on rankings implemented on a finite set of alternatives. Therefore, this allows us to compare rankings and different methods of aggregation, so that in practice, one should look for the maximal elements with respect to such orders defined on rankings.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, several clustering algorithms have been proposed with the aim of mining knowledge from streams of data generated at a high speed by a variety of hardware platforms and software applications. Among these algorithms, density-based approaches have proved to be particularly attractive, thanks to their capability of handling outliers and capturing clusters with arbitrary shapes. The streaming setting poses additional challenges that need to be addressed as well: data streams are potentially unbounded and affected by concept drift, i.e., a modification over time in the underlying data generation process. In this article, we propose temporal streaming fuzzy density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (TSF-DBSCAN), a novel fuzzy clustering algorithm for streaming data. TSF-DBSCAN is an extension of the well-known DBSCAN algorithm, one of the most popular density-based clustering approaches. Fuzziness is introduced in TSF-DBSCAN to model the uncertainty about the distance threshold that defines the neighborhood of an object. As a consequence, TSF-DBSCAN identifies clusters with fuzzy overlapping borders. A fading model, which makes objects less relevant as they become more remote in time, endows TSF-DBSCAN with the capability of adapting to evolving data streams. The integration of the model in a two-stage approach ensures computational and memory efficiency: during the online stage, continuously arriving objects are organized in proper data structures that are later exploited in the offline stage to determine a fine-grained partition. An extensive experimental analysis on synthetic and real-world datasets shows that TSF-DBSCAN yields competitive performance when compared to other clustering algorithms recently proposed for streaming data.},

By constructing new one-sided Lipschitz conditions, the regularization and impulse-free conditions are proposed for the error system. With the help of the tunable parameter in the observer, we design an output feedback controller for the nonlinear singular systems to ensure that all states of the closed-loop system are bounded and the tracking observer errors remain in a neighborhood of the origin.

A fundamental issue in the process of constructing shadowed sets is the interpretation and determination of the threshold pair $({\alpha, \beta } )$ , and the uncertainty consistency, that is, the consistency of fuzzy entropy. However, there may be a large fuzzy entropy loss between a fuzzy set and its corresponding game theoretic shadowed sets (GTSS), and the GTSS model is also accompanied by a large time cost when the precision of $({\alpha, \beta } )$ is improved. Therefore, the fuzzy-entropy-based GTSS (FeGTSS) is proposed in this article from the perspective of fuzzy entropy loss. First, based on the compromise principle of game theory, the fuzzy entropy loss of shadowed sets is analyzed in this article. Second, in the process of calculating $({\alpha, \beta } )$ , the optimal game strategy is searched based on the dichotomy algorithm. Third, the FeGTSS model is extended and discussed based on the analysis of different data distribution types.

A Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy model with norm-bounded uncertainties is used to represent the nonlinear plant. Meanwhile, the fuzzy filter to be designed is assumed to have gain variations. A useful matrix inequality decoupling approach is proposed to separate the product terms with different types of uncertainties. Then, the resulting design condition of the resilient $\mathcal H_\infty$ filter is described by strict linear matrix inequalities. Compared with the existing fuzzy resilient filtering results, the proposed design method shows a strong advantage of reducing design conservatism. Finally, a simulation example is provided to demonstrate the feasibility and the advantage of the proposed design method.},

In particular, an optimal FD scheme for fuzzy systems is proposed first aiming at enhancing the sensitivity to the faults and simultaneously increasing robustness against unknown inputs, which gives the extension of the socalled unified solution to fuzzy systems. To further provide the fault information, a least squares fault estimation scheme is developed. It is noteworthy that, the observers for the proposed FD and estimation schemes are updated online recursively. A case study on the laboratory three-tank system is then given to demonstrate the proposed FD and estimation approaches.},

To this end, we first set up a more general fixed-time stability criterion. By using the proposed stability criterion, a backstepping design procedure is presented to construct the fixed-time fuzzy adaptive controller. The suggested fuzzy adaptive control protocol guarantees that 1) for each agent, its closed-loop signals keep bounded; 2) the consensus tracking error tends to a small region around origin in fixed time. In addition, the virtual control signals are constructed to be the piecewise functions to prevent the singularity of their derivatives. Curve fitting method is used such that the designed virtual control signals are derivable at the point of partition. Finally, numerical simulation further checks the validity of the suggested control strategy.},

The observer-based controller design conditions are given as linear matrix inequalities. The approach we propose significantly improves results in the literature by providing less restrictive design conditions.

As distinct from some reported works, to abate the effect of missing packets in unreliable communication network, a novel dropout compensation strategy is constructed, where the packet arriving rate is assumed to be uncertain. Meanwhile, to describe the asynchronizations of the dropout compensation strategy and the controller, the hidden Markov models are absorbed. By resorting to the fuzzy-rule-dependent and the parameter-dependent Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional, novel sufficient conditions of $\mathcal {H}_{\infty }$ performance are formulated and the fuzzy-based asynchronous controller gains are realized.

In this article, we propose a composite adaptive type-2 fuzzy controller based on a high-gain observer and a disturbance observer for oxygen excess ratio (OER) of PEMFC air supply systems. First, the derivatives of system output, which are unavailable due to limited sensors, are estimated via the high-gain observer. Then, interval type-2 fuzzy logic systems (IT2 FLSs) are adopted to approximate the unknown system dynamics and the disturbance observer is designed to estimate compound disturbance including unknown external disturbance and fuzzy approximation error. Finally, in order to improve the tracking performance, two composite adaptive updating laws are constructed by utilizing the estimated tracking error and the modeling error. Theoretical analysis shows that the system tracking error is uniformly ultimately bounded by Lyapunov stability theory. Numerical simulations and hardware-in-loop experiments are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed controller.},

  abstract     = {The traditional collaborative fuzzy clustering can effectively perform data clustering in distributed peer-to-peer networks, which is an impossible task to complete for the centralized clustering methods due to privacy and security requirements or network transmission technology constraints. But it will increase the number of clustering iterations and lead to lower efficiency of the clustering. Moreover, the collaborative mechanism hidden in the iterative process of clustering cannot be well revealed and explained. In this article, a novel series of transfer collaborative fuzzy clustering algorithms are proposed to solve these issues. In the first basic algorithm, the transfer learning among neighbor nodes vividly expresses the collaborative mechanism and enhances the information collaboration to accelerate the convergence of fuzzy clustering. Meanwhile, neighbor nodes can learn the knowledge from each other to further promote their respective clustering performance. Then, an improved version, with the learning-rate-adjustable strategy instead of fixed values, is designed to highlight the different influence between neighbor nodes, and the appropriate learning rates between neighbor nodes are achieved to ensure the stable clustering accuracy. Finally, two extended versions with the attribute-weight-entropy regularization technique are presented for the clustering of high dimensional sparse data and the extraction of important subspace features. Experiments show the efficiency of the proposed algorithms compared with the related prototype-based clustering methods.},

Meanwhile, the migrativity as a vital, and particularly, interesting property for binary aggregation functions, has been studied in the literature since it was proposed. This article continues to consider this research topic and mainly focuses on the $\alpha$ -cross-migrativity for overlap functions. First, we introduce the concept of the $\alpha$ -cross-migrativity for overlap functions and show some vital properties of $\alpha$ -cross-migrative overlap functions. Second, we study the overlap functions that are $\alpha$ -cross-migrative with respect to the minimum overlap function $O_M$ and obtain an equivalent characterization of them by the ordinal sum of overlap functions. Third, we prove that an overlap function is $\alpha$ -cross-migrative with respect to the $p$ -product overlap function $O_p$ only if $p$ is equal to 1 and give an equivalent characterization of the overlap functions that satisfy the $\alpha$ -cross-migrativity with respect to the 1-product overlap function $O_1$ also by the ordinal sum of overlap functions. Finally, we extend the $\alpha$ -cross-migrativity of overlap functions to the 0-overlap functions status and get two equivalent characterizations of the 0-overlap functions that are $\alpha$ -cross-migrative with respect to $O_M$ and an equivalent characterization of the 0-overlap functions that satisfy the $\alpha$ -cross-migrativity with respect to $O_1$ , respectively.},

  abstract     = {Many biomedical systems and some engineering systems can be modeled as fuzzy discrete event systems. In this article, fuzzy discrete event systems with constraints (FDESwC) are introduced and detectabilities of FDESwC are investigated. While detectabilities of conventional crisp discrete event systems (DES) have been investigated before, detectabilities of FDESwC are much more complex because the state space of FDESwC is infinite, unlike that of crisp DES. To overcome this difficulty, trajectories of FDESwC bounded by $N$ observations are considered and $N$ -detectabilities are introduced. $N$ -detectabilities of crisp DES are first defined and proved to be equivalent to detectabilities if $N$ is sufficiently large. Fuzzy $N$ -detectabilities of FDESwC are then defined. An algorithm is derived to check fuzzy $N$ -detectabilities. While fuzzy detectabilities require to determine which state the system is in, this requirement can be relaxed in some applications. To do so, fuzzy $D$ -detectabilities are introduced and investigated, where the requirement is to distinguish certain pairs of states.},

  abstract     = {As a type of evolving-fuzzy system, the evolving-fuzzy-neuro (EFN) system uses the structure inspired by neural networks to determine its parameters (fuzzy sets and fuzzy rules), so EFN system can inherit the advantages of neural networks. However, for streaming data regression, EFN systems still have several drawbacks: determining fuzzy sets is not robust to data sequence; determining fuzzy rules is complex as subspaces that can approximate to a Takagi–Sugeno–Kang (TSK) rule need to be obtained, and many parameters need to be optimized; and it is difficult to detect and adapt to changes in the data distribution, i.e., concept drift, if the output is a continuous variable. Hence, in this article, a novel evolving-fuzzy-neuro system, called the topology learning-based fuzzy random neural network (TLFRNN), is proposed. In TLFRNN, an online topology learning algorithm is designed to self-organize each layer of TLFRNN. Different from current EFN systems, TLFRNN learns multiple fuzzy sets to reduce the impact of noises on each fuzzy set, and a randomness layer is designed, which assigning the probability of each fuzzy set. Also, TLFRNN does not utilize TSK rules; instead uses a simple inference that considers fuzzy and random information of data simultaneously. More importantly, in TLFRNN, concept drift can be detected and adapted easily and rapidly. The experiments demonstrate that TLFRNN achieves superior performance compared to other EFSs.},

To facilitate analysis and design, the interval type-2 (IT2) polynomial fuzzy model is used to represent the nonlinear plant and capture uncertainties. Combining with the IT2 polynomial fuzzy controller, the discrete-time positive IT2 polynomial fuzzy-model-based (PIT2PFMB) control system is formed to facilitate analysis. To enlarge the estimation of DOA of the discrete-time PIT2PFMB system, polyhedron is used to characterize the DOA with the help of linear copositive Lyapunov function (LCLF). Referring to the nonconvex conditions derived by LCLF, an effective convexification method is proposed in this article. For comparison purposes, the saturation-dependent-Lyapunov-function-based method is extended to the PIT2PFMB control system by adding the corresponding positivity conditions. In addition, this article attempts to enlarge the estimation of the DOA by improving the IT2 membership-function-dependent (IT2MFD) method and extending it to all conditions, including the stability conditions and the DOA estimation conditions. Finally, an example with simulation results is given to verify the effectiveness of all the methods proposed in this article for expanding the estimation of the DOA.},

  abstract     = {This article proposes a new network approach toward the implementation of Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) fuzzy models referred to as disjunctive fuzzy neural networks (DJFNNs). The proposed DJFNN involves a novel network architecture and a greedy learning algorithm. Being different from the existing grid-based and clustering-based network architectures, the proposed architecture adds an OR neural layer positioned between the fuzzification layer and the rule layer. In this way, the implied constraint between the number of rules and the number of fuzzy labels is excluded so that a curse of dimensionality can be overcome and more interpretable models are formed. Furthermore, inspired by the core algorithm for building a decision tree, a top–down, nonbacktracking, and greedy algorithm is proposed to learn the unknown parameters of the networks. The input space splits into smaller and smaller subspace along the predefined fuzzy grids in a supervised manner meanwhile the associated conditions of the T–S fuzzy model are identified. The greedy algorithm is applicable to high-dimensional problems since there is no exponential growth in time or space as the dimensionality increases. The new network architecture and greedy learning algorithm make the proposed DJFNN a regression model of high interpretability and good prediction capability, particularly suitable for solving the high-dimensional problems. The DJFNN was experimented with using a synthetic dataset and 28 real-world datasets and compared with classical and state-of-the-art methods through nonparametric statistical tests. The results confirmed the effectiveness of the DJFNN in terms of accuracy, interpretability, and computational cost.},

We apply the proposed approaches on a real application to demonstrate their working and effectiveness.

This article proposes a radically new type of extension to the TP model transformation. While earlier variants of the TP model transformation focused on how the antecedent—consequent fuzzy set system of a given T–S fuzzy model could be varied, this article, in contrast, focuses on how the number of inputs to a given T–S fuzzy model can be manipulated. The proposed extension is capable of changing the number of inputs or transforming the nonlinearity between the fuzzy rules and the input dimensions. These new features considerably increase the modeling power of the TP model transformation, allowing for further complexity reduction and more powerful control optimization to be achieved. This article provides two examples to show how the proposed extension can be used in a routine-like fashion.},

The fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering algorithm is widely used in image segmentation. However, traditional FCM is sensitive to noise and unable to obtain desirable segmentation results for infrared ship images. In this article, a novel probability induced intuitionistic FCM clustering algorithm is proposed to address the problem. First, the target probability information is incorporated into intuitionistic FCM to induce and refine membership which is affected by interferences. Second, by making use of neighborhood information in the form of a regularization term, the proposed method could suppress intensity inhomogeneity as well as maintain image details. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method could achieve better results than 12 other comparing algorithms for infrared ship segmentation.},

To achieve better tracking performance in distributed control strategy, a compensating fractional-order adaptation law associated with consensus tracking error is introduced when agents cannot obtain the information of reference trajectory directly. Under the fractional-order stability theory, a novel distributed adaptive event-triggered controller with fuzzy observers is constructed, which ensures the boundedness of tracking errors.

  abstract     = {Optimal performance is extremely important for hypersonic flight control. Different from most existing methodologies, which only consider basic control performance including stability, robustness, and transient performance, this article deals with the design of nearly optimal tracking controllers for hypersonic flight vehicles (HFVs). First, main controllers are developed for the velocity subsystem and the altitude subsystem of HFVs via concise fuzzy approximations. Then, optimal controllers are nearly implemented utilizing single-network adaptive critic design. Moreover, the stability of closed-loop systems and the convergence of optimal controllers are theoretically proved. Finally, compared simulation results are given to verify the superiority. The special contribution is the application of a low-complex control structure owing to the critic-only network and advanced learning laws developed for fuzzy approximations, which is expected to guarantee satisfied real-time performance.},

In this article, a local linear neuro-fuzzy networks based approach is proposed for the first time to tackle this issue. The basic idea is to utilize the superior approximation capability of the fuzzy neural networks to expand the unknown time-varying parameters so that various nonlinear and discontinuous processes can be captured. In addition, the local linear model tree optimization algorithm is incorporated in our approach to optimize the network architecture. On one hand, the least number of neurons corresponding to the time-varying parameters can be automatically determined, thus avoiding the superfluous bases and the troublesome overfitting problem; on the other hand, the optimized distribution of the neurons could significantly increase the interpretability of the results, thus contributing to locating the domains where the parameters exhibit strong nonlinearity or change sharply. Moreover, we demonstrate that our approach could simultaneously extract the parsimonious model structure while identifying the time-varying parameters, without adding additional procedures or increasing computation burden. Considering the generality and the unique merits, our proposed approach could significantly advance the applications of artificial neural network techniques in system identification.},

Second, an asymmetric barrier Lyapunov function with time-varying constraint is presented to deal with both the transient and the steady-state constraints on the output synchronization error. To avoid the “explosion of complexity,” the dynamic surface control technique is employed to filter the virtual control signal for each follower. To deal with the actuator saturation, a distributed auxiliary dynamical system is designed for each follower.

To address this problem, in this article, we construct a regret-based three-way decision model under interval type-2 fuzzy environment. Basically, regret theory and interval type-2 fuzzy set are utilized to improve three-way decision in coping with the risk and uncertainty. Two core issues focus on the determination of decision rules and estimation of conditional probabilities for different decision-makers under interval type-2 fuzzy environment. The maximum-utility decision rules are derived based on regret theory. An interval type-2 fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution method is utilized to estimate the conditional probability. The results of the illustrative example show that the proposed model can effectively solve uncertain decision problems. The comparative analysis and experimental evaluations are utilized to elaborate on the performance of the regret-based three-way decision model.},

The fuzzy logic system is employed to approximate the uncertain dynamic of the nonlinear MAS. A new nonlinear transformation function (NTF) is proposed, which serves as a unified tool for coping with the systems subjected to state constraints and no constraint. By combing the variable transformation with the proposed NTF, the original systems with state constraints are converted into the equivalent free-constrained systems. Moreover, as long as the boundedness of the states in transformed systems is guaranteed, the states of the original MAS do not transgress the preassigned boundaries. Based on the finite-time stability theory, the adaptive fuzzy control scheme is constructed for the transformed systems. It is proved that the outputs of all the followers are driven to converge to the convex hull spanned by the leaders in a finite time, and all the signals in the closed-loop systems are bounded in sense of mean square. The full state constraints for the followers are not violated all the time. Especially, the control structure does not need to change even there is no constraint imposes on the state.

The FDDQN not only allows the humanoid robot to correct the gait pattern instantly but also improves its stability. The proposed scheme is designed and implemented in a toddler-sized humanoid robot called Louis. First, four pressure sensors are installed on the bottom of the sole and one inertial measurement unit is set up on the trunk of the robot. A wireless communication chip is employed to transfer the data to a computer to determine the required parameters for the robot. Next, a control system based on the Linux operating system is developed. The values of the center of pressure and acceleration obtained with the ANFIS are adopted to train the DDQN. The proposed neural network comprises four layers, and the model is cautiously selected to avoid overfitting. The proposed scheme is verified using a robot simulator and then real-time-tested on Louis. The experimental results indicate that the FDDQN can provide the robot timely feedback during walking as well as helps it in adjusting the gait pattern independently. The balancing of the robot through effective dynamic feedback is similar to the balancing ability of an infant learning to walk.},

Then, the internal system state variables are expressed in terms of the I/O data and a fuzzy cost function is proposed to approximate the performance index. On this basis, the temporal difference error induced by the Bellman equation is adopted as the process evaluation indicator, whose threshold is determined through the randomized algorithm.

  abstract     = {This article presents a fuzzy finite-time command filtering output feedback control method for a class of nonlinear systems. A fast convergent output feedback control algorithm based on backstepping finite-time command filtering is developed. Fuzzy logic system is used to estimate uncertain functions in nonlinear systems. A fuzzy state observer is designed to measure the unknown state. The developed finite-time command filtering feedback control method overcomes well the computational complexity problem due to the calculation of the derivatives of virtual control signals. A compensation mechanism is also introduced to compensate for the error caused by the filter. The proposed method ensures not only that all signals in the closed-loop system are finite-time bound, but also that the tracking error converges to a small neighborhood around the origin. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated in the simulation results.},

It is assumed that the nonlinear functions in the controlled plant are unknown, in which fuzzy logic systems (FLSs) are utilized due to the approximation ability of any unknown continuous functions with arbitrary approximation errors. Based on the FLSs and backstepping design technique, a novel adaptive fuzzy tracking control strategy is proposed to guarantee that the closed-loop nonlinear system is semiglobally finite-time stable in probability via Lyapunov stability theory and It $\hat{o}$ formula. Compared with existing results, the transformed error signal was regarded as a stochastic variable. In addition, the expressions of the first and second-order partial derivatives of the transformed error signals are given in this article. Finally, a simulation example with different covariance values is given to show the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.},

  abstract     = {This article concentrates on the study of the decentralized fuzzy control method for a class of fractional-order interconnected systems with unknown control directions. To overcome the difficulties caused by the multiple unknown control directions in fractional-order systems, a novel fractional-order Nussbaum function technique is proposed. This technique is much more general than those of existing works since it not only handles single/multiple unknown control directions but is also suitable for fractional-/integer-order single/interconnected systems. Based on this technique, a new decentralized adaptive fuzzy control method is proposed for fractional-order interconnected systems with unknown strong interconnections among subsystems. Furthermore, fuzzy logic systems are utilized to approximate unknown nonlinearities. It is proven that the designed controller can guarantee the boundedness of all signals in interconnected systems and the convergence of tracking errors. Two examples are given to show the validity of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {This article is concerned with the efficient model-predictive control (EMPC) problem for interval type-2 Takagi–Sugeno (IT2 T-S) fuzzy systems with hard constraints. By applying the round-robin (RR) protocol, all controller nodes are activated in a pregiven order such that the occurrence of network congestion or data collisions can be effectively reduced. The aim of the proposed problem is to design a fuzzy controller in the framework of EMPC so as to obtain a good balance among the computation burden, the initial feasible region, and the control performance. With respect to the RR protocol and IT2 T-S fuzzy nonlinearities, a unified representation is modeled for the underlying system, and then, an augmentation state comprising of the system state, the token-dependent perturbation, and the previous input under the RR protocol is put forward; correspondingly, objective functions are constructed for the controller design. Subsequently, by using the min–max strategy, some token-dependent optimizations are established to facilitate the formation of the EMPC algorithm, where the feedback gain is designed offline, and the perturbation is calculated by solving an online optimization dependent of the token. Moreover, with the help of the matrix partition technique, the feasibility of the proposed EMPC algorithm and the stability of the underlying IT2 T-S fuzzy system are rigidly guaranteed. Finally, two numerical examples are utilized to illustrate the validity of the proposed EMPC strategy.},

  abstract     = {In this article, the problem of event-triggered $\mathcal {H}_{\infty }$ control design is investigated for a class of continuous-time switched Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) fuzzy systems. Specifically, the nonweighted $\mathcal {H}_{\infty }$ performance is guaranteed for the system with mode-dependent average dwell-time (MDADT) switching, which is more general than the weighted one in most existing results. Meanwhile, the existence of asynchronous phenomenon between event-triggered instants is taken into account, which is more practical and complicated in the system under consideration. It is compulsive in most existing results that the candidate controllers are synchronous with the subsystems, while this constraint is released to deal with the case that the system switches more than once between two adjacent event-trigger instants. First of all, by verifying the existence of the minimal inter-execution time, it is demonstrated that the adopted event-triggered mechanism can exclude the Zeno behavior. Next, an improved criterion on stability and $\mathcal {H}_{\infty }$ performance is derived for switched T–S fuzzy systems with MDADT switching. On this basis, the mode-dependent event-triggered mechanism and controllers are co-designed. Finally, two simulations are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the developed event-triggered control scheme.},

Compared with the classical hard-labeled methodologies, our approach gives soft results via the fuzzy membership function, and moreover, the use of total variation provides additional information that can enhance the superpixel regularity, which in turn improves the segmentation performance. To efficiently minimize the energy functional of the proposed model, we adopt an alternating direction method of multipliers with the modified Chambolle’s fast duality projection algorithm. Our algorithm can generate regular and compact superpixels with high segmentation accuracy, satisfactory boundary adherence, and low computational cost. Comparative experimental results with the current state-of-the-art approaches reveal the superior performance of the proposed method.},

For solving the maximum amplitude and maximum-amplitude solution, we construct a relevant optimization problem and then convert it into several subproblems. Some auxiliary functions and index sets are introduced to deal with these subproblems. Algorithm I is developed to find their optimal solutions. Based on the optimal solutions of the subproblems, we further propose Algorithm II for obtaining the maximum amplitude and maximum-amplitude solution of an addition-min fuzzy relation inequalities system.
