  abstract     = {We consider the classical Neymann–Pearson hypothesis testing problem of signal detection, where under the null hypothesis ( ${\mathcal{ H}}_{0}$ ), the received signal is white Gaussian noise, and under the alternative hypothesis ( ${\mathcal{ H}}_{1}$ ), the received signal includes also an additional non–Gaussian random signal, which in turn can be viewed as a deterministic waveform plus zero–mean, non-Gaussian noise. However, instead of the classical likelihood ratio test detector, which might be difficult to implement, in general, we impose a (mismatched) correlation detector, which is relatively easy to implement, and we characterize the optimal correlator weights in the sense of the best trade-off between the false-alarm error exponent and the missed-detection error exponent. Those optimal correlator weights depend (non-linearly, in general) on the underlying deterministic waveform under ${\mathcal{ H}}_{1}$ . We then assume that the deterministic waveform may also be free to be optimized (subject to a power constraint), jointly with the correlator, and show that both the optimal waveform and the optimal correlator weights may take on values in a small finite set of typically no more than two to four levels, depending on the distribution of the non-Gaussian noise component. Finally, we outline an extension of the scope to a wider class of detectors that are based on linear combinations of the correlation and the energy of the received signal.},

  abstract     = {In its most elementary form, compressed sensing studies the design of decoding algorithms to recover a sufficiently sparse vector or code from a lower dimensional linear measurement vector. Typically it is assumed that the decoder has access to the encoder matrix, which in the combinatorial case is sparse and binary. In this paper we consider the problem of designing a decoder to recover a set of sparse codes from their linear measurements alone, that is without access to encoder matrix. To this end we study the matrix factorisation task of recovering both the encoder and sparse coding matrices from the associated linear measurement matrix. The contribution of this paper is a computationally efficient decoding algorithm, Decoder-Expander Based Factorisation, with strong performance guarantees. Under mild assumptions on the sparse coding matrix and by deploying a novel random encoder matrix, we prove that Decoder-Expander Based Factorisation recovers both the encoder and sparse coding matrix at the optimal measurement rate with high probability and from a near optimal number of measurement vectors. In addition, our experiments demonstrate the efficacy and computational efficiency of our algorithm in practice. Beyond compressed sensing, our results may be of interest for researchers working in areas as diverse as linear sketching, coding theory, matrix compression and dictionary learning.},

Assuming that the spectrum samples of the PSFs lie in low dimensional subspace (let $s$ denote the dimension), we can formulate it as a matrix recovery problem, followed by location estimation. By exploiting the low rank structure of the vectorized Hankel matrix associated with the target matrix, a convex approach called Vectorized Hankel Lift is proposed for the matrix recovery. It is shown that $n\gtrsim rs\log ^{4} n$ samples are sufficient for Vectorized Hankel Lift to achieve the exact recovery. For the location retrieval from the matrix, applying the single snapshot MUSIC method within the vectorized Hankel lift framework corresponds to the spatial smoothing technique proposed to improve the performance of the MMV MUSIC for the direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation.},

  abstract     = {In 2016, Chang et al. proposed a Format Preserving Encryption (FPE) scheme over a finite field and used an MDS matrix in the diffusion layer of the scheme for optimal diffusion. Later that year, Gupta et al. defined an algebraic structure named Format Preserving Set (FPS) is the diffusion layer of an FPE scheme. In 2018, Barua et al. showed that it is not possible to construct an FPS over a finite field in the diffusion layer of an FPE scheme if the cardinality of the set is not a power of prime. They extended the search of FPS over a finite commutative ring $\mathcal {R}$ and showed that if an FPS $S \subseteq \mathcal {R}$ is closed under addition then it gets module structure over some subring of $\mathcal {R}$ . Moreover, in this case, the only possible cardinalities of FPS are some power of the cardinalities of subrings when the module is free. The purpose of this article is twofold. Firstly, we show that it is possible to construct format preserving sets over a finite commutative ring which are not closed under addition. Secondly, we search for format preserving sets and MDS matrices over torsion modules. We provide examples of format preserving sets of cardinalities 26 and 52 over torsion modules and rings. These cardinalities are interesting because they correspond to the set of English alphabets, without and with capitalization. By considering a finite Abelian group as a torsion module over a PID, we show that a matrix $M$ with entries from the PID is MDS if and only if $M$ is MDS under the projection map on the same Abelian group.},

If $f$ is a nonzero sequence, then its autocorrelation demerit factor, $\text {ADF}(f)$ , is the sum of the squared magnitudes of the aperiodic autocorrelation values over all nonzero shifts for the sequence obtained by normalizing $f$ to have unit Euclidean norm. If $(f,g)$ is a pair of nonzero sequences, then their crosscorrelation demerit factor, $\text {CDF}(f,g)$ , is the sum of the squared magnitudes of the aperiodic crosscorrelation values over all shifts for the sequences obtained by normalizing both $f$ and $g$ to have unit Euclidean norm. Pursley and Sarwate showed that for binary sequences, the sum of $\text {CDF}(f,g)$ and the geometric mean of $\text {ADF}(f)$ and $\text {ADF}{(g)}$ must be at least 1. For randomly selected pairs of long binary sequences, this quantity is typically around 2. In this paper, we show that Pursley and Sarwate’s bound is met for binary sequences precisely when $(f,g)$ is a Golay complementary pair. We also prove a generalization of this result for sequences whose terms are arbitrary complex numbers. We investigate constructions that produce infinite families of Golay complementary pairs, and compute the asymptotic values of autocorrelation and crosscorrelation demerit factors for such families.},

Since there does not exist any explicit efficient construction of AG codes over prime fields with constant field size, we consider constructions over prime fields with the help of concatenation method and constructions of codes over field extensions. Extending the Fourier analysis done by Benhamouda et al., one can show that concatenated algebraic geometric codes over prime fields do produce some nice leakage-resilient secret sharing schemes. One natural and curious question is whether AG codes over extension fields produce better leakage-resilient secret sharing schemes than the construction based on concatenated AG codes. Such construction provides several advantage compared to the construction over prime fields using concatenation method. It is clear that AG codes over extension fields give secret sharing schemes with a smaller reconstruction threshold for a fixed privacy parameter $t$ . In this work, it is also confirmed that indeed AG codes over extension fields have stronger leakage-resilience under some reasonable assumptions. Furthermore, we also show that AG codes over extension fields may provide strong multiplicative property which may be used in its application to the study of multiparty computation. In contrast, the same cannot be said for constructions based on concatenated AG codes, even when we are considering multiplication friendly embeddings. These advantages strongly motivate the study of secret sharing schemes from AG codes over extension fields. The current paper has two main contributions: (i) we obtain leakage-resilient secret sharing schemes with constant share sizes and unbounded numbers of players. Some of the schemes constructed without the use of concatenation also possesses strong multiplicative property (ii) via Fourier Analysis, we analyze the leakage-resilience of secret sharing schemes from codes over extension fields. This is of its own theoretical interest independent of its application to secret sharing schemes from algebraic geometric codes over extension fields.},

  abstract     = {We show that the most common flavors of noisy leakage can be simulated in the information-theoretic setting using a single query of bounded leakage, up to a small statistical simulation error and a slight loss in the leakage parameter. The latter holds true in particular for one of the most used noisy-leakage models, where the noisiness is measured using the conditional average min-entropy (Naor and Segev, CRYPTO’09 and SICOMP’12). Our reductions between noisy and bounded leakage are achieved in two steps. First, we put forward a new leakage model (dubbed the dense leakage model) and prove that dense leakage can be simulated in the information-theoretic setting using a single query of bounded leakage, up to small statistical distance. Second, we show that the most common noisy-leakage models fall within the class of dense leakage, with good parameters. Third, we prove lower bounds on the amount of bounded leakage required for simulation with sub-constant error, showing that our reductions are nearly optimal. In particular, our results imply that useful general simulation of noisy leakage based on statistical distance and mutual information is impossible. We also provide a complete picture of the relationships between different noisy-leakage models. Our result finds applications to leakage-resilient cryptography, where we are often able to lift security in the presence of bounded leakage to security in the presence of noisy leakage, both in the information-theoretic and in the computational setting. Remarkably, this lifting procedure makes only black-box use of the underlying schemes. Additionally, we show how to use lower bounds in communication complexity to prove that bounded-collusion protocols (Kumar, Meka, and Sahai, FOCS’19) for certain functions do not only require long transcripts, but also necessarily need to reveal enough information about the inputs.},

  abstract     = {Offline reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms seek to learn an optimal policy from a fixed dataset without active data collection. Based on the composition of the offline dataset, two main methods are used: imitation learning which is suitable for expert datasets, and vanilla offline RL which often requires uniform coverage datasets. From a practical standpoint, datasets often deviate from these two extremes and the exact data composition is usually unknown. To bridge this gap, we present a new offline RL framework, called single-policy concentrability, that smoothly interpolates between the two extremes of data composition, hence unifying imitation learning and vanilla offline RL. Under this new framework, we ask: can one develop an algorithm that achieves a minimax optimal rate adaptive to unknown data composition? To address this question, we consider a lower confidence bound (LCB) algorithm developed based on pessimism in the face of uncertainty in offline RL. We study finite-sample properties of LCB as well as information-theoretic limits in multi-armed bandits, contextual bandits, and Markov decision processes (MDPs). Our analysis reveals surprising facts about optimality rates. In particular, in both contextual bandits and RL, LCB achieves a fast convergence rate for nearly-expert datasets, analogous to the one achieved by imitation learning, contrary to the slow rate achieved in offline RL. In contextual bandits, we prove that LCB is adaptively optimal for the entire data composition range, achieving a smooth transition from imitation learning to offline RL. We further show that LCB is almost adaptively optimal in MDPs.},

In particular, we derive a finite dimensional closed-form p.d.f. for $Z_{1}^{(n)}$ which is amenable to asymptotic analysis as $m,n$ diverges with $m-n$ fixed. It turns out that, in this asymptotic regime, the scaled random variable $nZ_{1}^{(n)}$ converges in distribution to $\chi ^{2}_{2}/2(1+\theta)$ , where $\chi _{2}^{2}$ denotes a chi-squared random variable with two degrees of freedom. This reveals that u1 can be used to infer information about the spike. On the other hand, the finite dimensional p.d.f. of $Z_{n}^{(n)}$ is expressed as a double integral in which the integrand contains a determinant of a square matrix of dimension $(n-2)$ . Although a simple solution to this double integral seems intractable, for special configurations of $n=2,3$ , and 4, we obtain closed-form expressions.},

  abstract     = {We address the problem of federated learning (FL) where users are distributed and partitioned into clusters. This setup captures settings where different groups of users have their own objectives (learning tasks) but by aggregating their data with others in the same cluster (same learning task), they can leverage the strength in numbers in order to perform more efficient federated learning. For this new framework of clustered federated learning, we propose the Iterative Federated Clustering Algorithm (IFCA), which alternately estimates the cluster identities of the users and optimizes model parameters for the user clusters via gradient descent. We analyze the convergence rate of this algorithm first in a linear model with squared loss and then for generic strongly convex and smooth loss functions. We show that in both settings, with good initialization, IFCA is guaranteed to converge, and discuss the optimality of the statistical error rate. In particular, for the linear model with two clusters, we can guarantee that our algorithm converges as long as the initialization is slightly better than random. When the clustering structure is ambiguous, we propose to train the models by combining IFCA with the weight sharing technique in multi-task learning. In the experiments, we show that our algorithm can succeed even if we relax the requirements on initialization with random initialization and multiple restarts. We also present experimental results showing that our algorithm is efficient in non-convex problems such as neural networks. We demonstrate the benefits of IFCA over the baselines on several clustered FL benchmarks.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study the estimation of a rank-one spiked tensor in the presence of heavy tailed noise. Our results highlight some of the fundamental similarities and differences in the tradeoff between statistical and computational efficiencies under heavy tailed and Gaussian noise. In particular, we show that, for $p$ th order tensors, the tradeoff manifests in an identical fashion as the Gaussian case when the noise has finite $4(p-1)$ th moment. The difference in signal strength requirements, with or without computational constraints, for us to estimate the singular vectors at the optimal rate, interestingly, narrows for noise with heavier tails and vanishes when the noise only has finite fourth moment. Moreover, if the noise has less than fourth moment, tensor SVD, perhaps the most natural approach, is suboptimal even though it is computationally intractable. Our analysis exploits a close connection between estimating the rank-one spikes and the spectral norm of a random tensor with iid entries. In particular, we show that the order of the spectral norm of a random tensor can be precisely characterized by the moment of its entries, generalizing classical results for random matrices. In addition to the theoretical guarantees, we propose estimation procedures for the heavy tailed regime, which are easy to implement and efficient to run. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate their practical merits.},

The pre-change observations are assumed to be stationary, while the post-change observations are allowed to be non-stationary. The case where the pre-change distribution is known is studied first, and then the extension where only the mean and variance of the pre-change distribution are known. No knowledge of the post-change distributions is assumed other than that the means of the observations are above some pre-specified threshold larger than the pre-change mean. For the case where the pre-change distribution is known, a test is derived that asymptotically minimizes the worst-case detection delay over all possible post-change distributions, as the false alarm rate goes to zero. Towards deriving this asymptotically optimal test, some new results are provided for the general problem of asymptotic minimax robust quickest change detection in non-stationary settings. Then, the limiting form of the optimal test is studied as the gap between the pre- and post-change means goes to zero, called the Mean-Change Test (MCT). It is shown that the MCT can be designed with only knowledge of the mean and variance of the pre-change distribution. The performance of the MCT is also characterized when the mean gap is moderate, under the additional assumption that the distributions of the observations have bounded support. The analysis is validated through numerical results for detecting a change in the mean of a beta distribution. The use of the MCT in monitoring pandemics is also demonstrated.},

  abstract     = {Approximate message passing (AMP) is a low-cost iterative parameter-estimation technique for certain high-dimensional linear systems with non-Gaussian distributions. AMP only applies to independent identically distributed (IID) transform matrices, but may become unreliable (e.g., perform poorly or even diverge) for other matrix ensembles, especially for ill-conditioned ones. To solve this issue, orthogonal/vector AMP (OAMP/VAMP) was proposed for general right-unitarily-invariant matrices. However, the Bayes-optimal OAMP/VAMP (BO-OAMP/VAMP) requires a high-complexity linear minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimator. This prevents OAMP/VAMP from being used in large-scale systems. To address the drawbacks of AMP and BO-OAMP/VAMP, this paper offers a memory AMP (MAMP) framework based on the orthogonality principle, which ensures that estimation errors in MAMP are asymptotically IID Gaussian. To realize the required orthogonality for MAMP, we provide an orthogonalization procedure for the local memory estimators. In addition, we propose a Bayes-optimal MAMP (BO-MAMP), in which a long-memory matched filter is used for interference suppression. The complexity of BO-MAMP is comparable to AMP. To asymptotically characterize the performance of BO-MAMP, a state evolution is derived. The relaxation parameters and damping vector in BO-MAMP are optimized based on state evolution. Most crucially, the state evolution of the optimized BO-MAMP converges to the same fixed point as that of the high-complexity BO-OAMP/VAMP for all right-unitarily-invariant matrices, and achieves the Bayes optimal MSE predicted by the replica method if its state evolution has a unique fixed point. Finally, simulations are provided to verify the theoretical results’ validity and accuracy.},

A critical issue with selecting a single subset of features is that they may not represent the feature space in which individual class labels can be separated exclusively. Existing methods fail to provide a way to select the feature space specific to the individual class label. To this end, we propose a novel feature selection method called class-label specific mutual information (CSMI) that selects a specific set of features for each class label. The proposed method maximizes the information shared among the selected features and target class label but minimizes the same with all classes. We also consider the dynamic change of information between selected features and the target class label when a candidate feature is added. Finally, we provide a general framework for the CSMI to make it classifier-independent. We perform experiments on sixteen benchmark data sets using four classifiers and found that the CSMI outperforms five traditional, two state-of-the-art ITFS (multi-class classification), and one multi-label classification methods.},

We show that if the support set is known, then the kNN density estimator is minimax optimal under $\ell _{\alpha} $ with both $\alpha \in \big[1,\infty\big)$ and $\alpha =\infty $ . If the support is unknown, the kNN density estimator is still minimax optimal under $\ell _{1}$ , but is suboptimal under $\ell _{\alpha} $ for $\alpha &amp;gt;1$ , and not consistent under $\ell _\infty $ . In the second case, the support is unbounded and the probability density function is smooth everywhere. Moreover, the Hessian is assumed to decay with the density values. For this case, our result shows that the $\ell _\infty $ error of kNN density estimation is nearly minimax optimal. The $\ell _{\alpha} $ error for the original kNN density estimator is not consistent. To address this issue, we design a new adaptive kNN estimator, which can select different $k$ for different samples. Using this adaptive estimator, the $\ell _{\alpha} $ bound is minimax optimal.

  abstract     = {We analyze the best achievable performance of Bayesian learning under generative models by defining and upper-bounding the minimum excess risk (MER): the gap between the minimum expected loss attainable by learning from data and the minimum expected loss that could be achieved if the model realization were known. The definition of MER provides a principled way to define different notions of uncertainties in Bayesian learning, including the aleatoric uncertainty and the minimum epistemic uncertainty. Two methods for deriving upper bounds for the MER are presented. The first method, generally suitable for Bayesian learning with a parametric generative model, upper-bounds the MER by the conditional mutual information between the model parameters and the quantity being predicted given the observed data. It allows us to quantify the rate at which the MER decays to zero as more data becomes available. Under realizable models, this method also relates the MER to the richness of the generative function class, notably the VC dimension in binary classification. The second method, particularly suitable for Bayesian learning with a parametric predictive model, relates the MER to the minimum estimation error of the model parameters from data via various continuity arguments. We also extend the definition and analysis of MER to the setting with multiple model families and the setting with nonparametric models. Along the discussions we draw some comparisons between the MER in Bayesian learning and the excess risk in frequentist learning.},

We first propose a coding scheme based on asymptotically good algebraic structured codes, in particular, nested coset codes, and provide a set of sufficient conditions for the reconstruction of the function of the sources over a CQ-MAC. The proposed technique enables the decoder to recover the desired function without recovering the sources themselves. We further improve this by employing a coding scheme based on a classical superposition of algebraic structured codes and unstructured codes. This coding scheme allows exploiting the symmetric structure common amongst the sources and also leverage the asymmetries. We derive a new set of sufficient conditions that strictly enlarges the largest known set of sources whose function can be reconstructed over any given CQ-MAC, and identify examples demonstrating the same.

It turns out that the new scheme gives better performance than various variants of the optimal PBT protocol used for the same task. All the results are presented in group-theoretic manner depending on such quantities like dimensions and multiplicities of irreducible representations in the Schur-Weyl duality. The presented analysis was possible by considering the algebra of permutation operators acting on $n$ systems distorted by the action of partial transposition acting on more than one subsystem. Considering its action on the $n-$ fold tensor product of the Hilbert space with finite dimension, we present construction of the respective irreducible matrix representations, which are in fact matrix irreducible representations of the Walled Brauer Algebra.

  abstract     = {The original coded caching scenario assumes a content library that is of interest to all receiving users. In a realistic scenario though, the users may have diverging interests which may intersect to various degrees. What happens for example if each file is of potential interest to, say, 40\% of the users and each user has potential interest in 40\% of the library? In this work, we investigate the so- called symmetrically selfish coded caching scenario, where each user only makes requests from a subset of the library that defines its own file demand set (FDS), each user caches selfishly only contents from its own FDS, and where the different FDSs symmetrically overlap to some extent. In the context of various traditional prefetching scenarios (prior to the emergence of coded caching), selfish approaches were known to be potentially very effective. On the other hand — with the exception of some notable works — little is known about selfish coded caching. We here present a new information-theoretic converse that proves, in a general setting of symmetric FDS structures, that selfish coded caching, despite enjoying a much larger local caching gain and a much smaller set of possible demands, introduces an unbounded load increase compared to the unselfish case. In particular, in the $K$ -user broadcast channel where each user stores a fraction $\gamma $ of the library, where each file (class) is of interest to $\alpha $ users, and where any one specific file is of interest to a fraction $\delta $ of users, the optimal coding gain of symmetrically selfish caching is at least $(K - \alpha)\gamma + 1$ times smaller than in the unselfish scenario. This allows us to draw the powerful conclusion that the optimal selfish coding gain is upper bounded by $1/(1 - \delta)$ , and thus does not scale with $K$ . These derived limits are shown to be exact for different types of demands. In the end, this work provides, in a unified manner, the strong conclusion that selfish caching can cause unbounded performance deterioration in coded caching systems.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers a caching system of a single server and multiple users. We aim to characterize the memory-rate tradeoff for caching with uncoded cache placement, under nonuniform file popularity. Focusing on the modified coded caching scheme (MCCS) recently proposed by Yu, etal. , we formulate the cache placement optimization problem for the MCCS to minimize the average delivery rate under nonuniform file popularity, restricting to a class of popularity-first placements. We then present two information-theoretic lower bounds on the average rate for caching with uncoded placement, one for general cache placements and the other restricted to the popularity-first placements. By comparing the average rate of the optimized MCCS with the lower bounds, we prove that the optimized MCCS attains the general lower bound for the two-user case, providing the exact memory-rate tradeoff. Furthermore, it attains the popularity-first-based lower bound for the case of general $K$ users with distinct file requests. In these two cases, our results also reveal that the popularity-first placement is optimal for the MCCS, and zero-padding used in coded delivery incurs no loss of optimality. For the case of $K$ users with redundant file requests, our analysis shows that there may exist a gap between the optimized MCCS and the lower bounds due to zero-padding. We next fully characterize the optimal popularity-first cache placement for the MCCS, which is shown to possess a simple file-grouping structure and can be computed via an efficient algorithm using closed-form expressions. Finally, we extend our study to accommodate nonuniformity in both file popularity and size, where we show that the optimized MCCS attains the lower bound for the two-user case, providing the exact memory-rate tradeoff. Numerical results show that, for general settings, the gap between the optimized MCCS and the lower bound only exists in limited cases and is very small.},

A collection of such assignments is called a storage code of length $|V|$ on $G$ . The storage code problem can be equivalently formulated as maximizing the probability of success in a guessing game on graphs, or constructing index codes of small rate. If $G$ contains many cliques, it is easy to construct codes of rate close to 1, so a natural problem is to construct high-rate codes on triangle-free graphs, where constructing codes of rate $&amp;gt; 1/2$ is a nontrivial task, with few known results. In this work we construct infinite families of linear storage codes with high rate relying on coset graphs of binary linear codes. We also derive necessary conditions for such codes to have high rate, and even rate potentially close to one. We also address correction of multiple erasures in the codeword, deriving recovery guarantees based on expansion properties of the graph. Finally, we point out connections between linear storage codes and quantum CSS codes, a link to bootstrap percolation and contagion spread in graphs, and formulate a number of open problems.},

Random spherical codes achieve constant list sizes, and the goal of the present paper is to obtain a better understanding of the smallest achievable list size as a function of the gap to capacity. We show a reduction from arbitrary codes to spherical codes, and derive a lower bound on the list size of typical random spherical codes. We also give an upper bound on the list size achievable using nested Construction-A lattices and infinite Construction-A lattices. We then define and study a class of infinite constellations that generalize Construction-A lattices and prove upper and lower bounds for the same. Other goodness properties such as packing goodness and AWGN goodness of infinite constellations are proved along the way. Finally, we consider random lattices sampled from the Haar distribution and show that if a certain conjecture that originates in analytic number theory is true, then the list size grows as a polynomial function of the gap-to-capacity.},

The Binary Chirps (BCs) are Complex Grassmannian Lines in $N = 2^{m}$ dimensions used in deterministic compressed sensing and random/unsourced multiple access in wireless networks. Their entries are fourth roots of unity and can be described in terms of second order Reed-Muller codes. The Binary Subspace Chirps (BSSCs) are a unique collection of BCs of ranks ranging from $r=0$ to $r = m$ , embedded in $N$ dimensions according to an on-off pattern determined by a rank $r$ binary subspace. This yields a codebook that is asymptotically 2.38 times larger than the codebook of BCs, has the same minimum chordal distance as the codebook of BCs, and the alphabet is minimally extended from ${\pm 1,\pm i}$ to ${\pm 1,\pm i, 0}$ . Equivalently, we show that BSSCs are stabilizer states, and we characterize them as columns of a well-controlled collection of Clifford matrices. By construction, the BSSCs inherit all the properties of BCs, which in turn makes them good candidates for a variety of applications. For applications in wireless communication, we use the rich algebraic structure of BSSCs to construct a low complexity decoding algorithm that is reliable against Gaussian noise. In simulations, BSSCs exhibit an error probability comparable or slightly lower than BCs, both for single-user and multi-user transmissions.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider the problem of guessing a sequence subject to a distortion constraint. Specifically, we assume the following game between Alice and Bob: Alice has a sequence ${x}$ of length $n$ . Bob wishes to guess ${x}$ , yet he is satisfied with finding any sequence $\hat {x}$ which is within a given distortion $D$ from $x$ . Thus, he successively submits queries to Alice, until receiving an affirmative answer, stating that his guess was within the required distortion. Finding guessing strategies which minimize the number of guesses (the guesswork), and analyzing its properties (e.g., its $\rho $ –th moment) has several applications in information security, source and channel coding. Guessing subject to a distortion constraint is especially useful when considering contemporary biometrically–secured systems, where the “password” which protects the data is not a single, fixed vector but rather a ball of feature vectors centered at some ${x}$ , and any feature vector within the ball results in acceptance. We formally define the guessing problem under distortion in four different setups: memoryless sources, guessing through a noisy channel, sources with memory and individual sequences. We suggest a randomized guessing strategy which is asymptotically optimal for all setups and is five–fold universal, as it is independent of the source statistics, the channel, the moment to be optimized, the distortion measure and the distortion level.},

Conversely, utilizing a family of lower bounds originally derived for broadcast channels with power constraints, the minimum required energy is lower bounded for any profile. As examples, linear, exponential, square-law, and staircase profiles are studied. It is shown that for the linear profile, as well as for any concave profile, uncoded transmission is optimal.

In this paper, we define a family of entropy functionals, which we show are subadditive. We then establish that Gaussians are extremal for these functionals by adapting a proof technique from Geng and Nair (2014). As a consequence, we obtain a new entropy inequality that generalizes both the BLI and EPI.

We focus on the asymptotic regime where the number of unknown parameters grows in proportion to the number of observations. Our asymptotic characterization enables us to derive the fundamental limits of SLOPE in both estimation and variable selection settings. We also provide a computationally feasible way to optimally design the regularizing sequences to reach the aforementioned fundamental limits. In both settings, we show that the optimal design problem can be formulated as certain infinite-dimensional convex optimization problems that have efficient and accurate finite-dimensional approximations. Numerical simulations verify all our asymptotic predictions. They demonstrate the superiority of our optimal regularizing sequences over other designs used in the existing literature.},

  abstract     = {Conventional sparse phase retrieval schemes can recover sparse signals from the magnitude of linear measurements only up to a global phase ambiguity. This work proposes a novel approach that instead utilizes the magnitude of affine measurements to achieve ambiguity-free signal reconstruction. The proposed method relies on two-stage approach that consists of support identification followed by the exact recovery of nonzero signal entries. In the noise-free case, perfect support identification using a simple counting rule is guaranteed subject to a mild condition on the signal sparsity, and subsequent exact recovery of the nonzero signal entries can be obtained in closed-form. The proposed approach is then extended to two noisy scenarios, namely, sparse noise (or outliers) and non-sparse bounded noise. For both cases, perfect support identification is still ensured under mild conditions on the noise model, namely, the support size for sparse outliers and the power of the bounded noise. Under perfect support identification, exact signal recovery can be achieved using a simple majority rule for the sparse noise scenario, and reconstruction up to a bounded error can be achieved using linear least-squares (LS) estimation for the non-sparse bounded noise scenario. The obtained analytic performance guarantee for the latter case also sheds light on the construction of the sensing matrix and bias vector. In fact, we show that a near optimal performance can be achieved with high probability by the random generation of the nonzero entries of the sparse sensing matrix and bias vector according to the uniform distribution over a circle. Computer simulations using both synthetic and real-world data sets are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

  abstract     = {We study the problem of simulating a two-user multiple-access channel (MAC) over a multiple access network of noiseless links. Two encoders observe independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) copies of a source random variable each, while a decoder observes i.i.d. copies of a side-information random variable. There are rate-limited noiseless communication links between each encoder and the decoder, and there is independent pairwise shared randomness between all the three possible pairs of nodes. The decoder has to output approximately i.i.d. copies of another random variable jointly distributed with the two sources and the side information. We are interested in the rate tuples which permit this simulation. This setting can be thought of as a multi-terminal generalization of the point-to-point channel simulation problem studied by Bennett et al. (2002) and Cuff (2013). When the pairwise shared randomness between the encoders is absent, the setting reduces to a special case of MAC simulation using another MAC studied by Haddadpour et al. (2013). We establish that the presence of encoder shared randomness can strictly improve the communication rate requirements. We first show that the inner bound derived from Haddadpour et al. (2013) is tight when the sources at the encoders are conditionally independent given the side-information at the decoder. This result recovers the existing results on point-to-point channel simulation and function computation over such multi-terminal networks. We then explicitly compute the communication rate regions for an example both with and without the encoder shared randomness and demonstrate that its presence strictly reduces the communication rates. Inner and outer bounds for the general case are also obtained.},

For these algorithms, it is known that if the sensing matrix $\mathbf {A}$ is generated by sub-sampling $n$ columns of a uniformly random (i.e., Haar distributed) orthogonal matrix, in the high dimensional asymptotic regime ( $m,n \rightarrow \infty, n/m \rightarrow \kappa $ ), the dynamics of the algorithm are given by a deterministic recursion known as the state evolution. For a special class of linearized message-passing algorithms, we show that the state evolution is universal: it continues to hold even when $\mathbf {A}$ is generated by randomly sub-sampling columns of the Hadamard-Walsh matrix, if the signal is drawn from a Gaussian prior.},

Moreover, we extend existing convergence results for block randomized Kaczmarz to allow for a more general choice of blocks, rank-deficient systems, and provide a tighter convergence rate guarantee. Previous results for block randomized Kaczmarz assumed blocks formed a paving of the systems; our analysis, contrary to the title of our paper, generalizes to a broader class of blocks that we call coverings.

Motivated by reducing the computation load of each server, a flexible solution is proposed to fully utilize the computation capability of available servers. The computing task for each server is separated into several subtasks, constructed based on Entangled Polynomial codes by Yu et al. The final results can be obtained from either a larger number of servers with a smaller amount of computation completed per server or a smaller number of servers with a larger amount of computation completed per server. The required finite field size of the proposed solution is less than $2N$ . Moreover, the optimal design parameters such as the partitioning of the input matrices are discussed.

The identity of the dropped users is not known a priori and the server needs to securely recover the sum of the remaining surviving users. We consider the following minimal two-round model of secure aggregation. Over the first round, any set of no fewer than $U$ users out of $K$ users respond to the server and the server wants to learn the sum of the inputs of all responding users. The remaining users are viewed as dropped. Over the second round, any set of no fewer than $U$ users of the surviving users respond (i.e., dropouts are still possible over the second round) and from the information obtained from the surviving users over the two rounds, the server can decode the desired sum. The security constraint is that even if the server colludes with any $T$ users and the messages from the dropped users are received by the server (e.g., delayed packets), the server is not able to infer any additional information beyond the sum in the information theoretic sense. For this information theoretic secure aggregation problem, we characterize the optimal communication cost. When $U \leq T$ , secure aggregation is not feasible, and when $U &amp;gt; T$ , to securely compute one symbol of the sum, the minimum number of symbols sent from each user to the server is 1 over the first round, and $1/(U-T)$ over the second round.},

  abstract     = {Large pools of synthetic DNA molecules have been recently used to reliably store significant volumes of digital data. While DNA as a storage medium has enormous potential because of its high storage density, its practical use is currently severely limited because of the high cost and low throughput of available DNA synthesis technologies. We study the role of batch optimization in reducing the cost of large scale DNA synthesis, which translates to the following algorithmic task. Given a large pool $\mathcal {S}$ of random quaternary strings of fixed length, partition $\mathcal {S}$ into batches in a way that minimizes the sum of the lengths of the shortest common supersequences across batches. We introduce two ideas for batch optimization that both improve (in different ways) upon a naive baseline: (1) using both $(ACGT)^{\ast}$ and its reverse $(TGCA)^{\ast}$ as reference strands, and batching appropriately, and (2) batching via the quantiles of an appropriate ordering of the strands. We also prove asymptotically matching lower bounds on the cost of DNA synthesis, showing that one cannot improve upon these two ideas. Our results uncover a surprising separation between two cases that naturally arise in the context of DNA data storage: the asymptotic cost savings of batch optimization are significantly greater in the case where strings in $\mathcal {S}$ do not contain repeats of the same character (homopolymers), as compared to the case where strings in $\mathcal {S}$ are unconstrained.},

The test is data-driven and does not require prior knowledge about the distribution of the signal or the noise. When the noise is Gaussian, the proposed test is optimal in the sense that its error matches that of the likelihood ratio test, which minimizes the sum of the Type-I and Type-II errors.

In Eldan’s theorem, the ‘number of components’ is characterized by the entropy of the mixture, and ‘closeness to product’ is characterized by the covariance matrix of each component.

While gradient descent has achieved good empirical performance, its theoretical behavior is not well understood. We introduce the use of stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) for compressed sensing with a generative prior. Under mild assumptions on the generative model, we prove the convergence of SGLD to the true signal. We also demonstrate competitive empirical performance to standard gradient descent.},

  abstract     = {Consider the compressed sensing setup where the support $\mathbf {s}^{\ast}$ of an $m$ -sparse $d$ -dimensional signal $\mathbf {x}$ is to be recovered from $n$ linear measurements with a given algorithm. Suppose that the measurements are such that the algorithm does not guarantee perfect support recovery and that true features may be missed. Can they efficiently be retrieved? We address this question through a simple error-correction module referred to as LiRE. LiRE takes as input an estimate $\mathbf {s}_{\text {in}}$ of the true support $\mathbf {s}^{\ast}$ , and outputs a refined support estimate $\mathbf {s}_{\text {out}}$ . We establish sufficient conditions under which LiRE is guaranteed to recover the entire support, that is $\mathbf {s}_{\text {out}}\supseteq \mathbf {s}^{\ast} $ . These conditions imply, for instance, that in high dimension LiRE can correct a sublinear in $m$ number of errors made by Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP). The computational complexity of LiRE is ${\mathcal{O}}(m n d)$ . Experimental results with random Gaussian design matrices show that LiRE substantially reduces the number of measurements needed for perfect support recovery via Compressive Sampling Matching Pursuit, Basis Pursuit (BP), and OMP. Interestingly, adding LiRE to OMP yields a support recovery procedure that is more accurate and significantly faster than BP. This observation carries over in the noisy measurement setup where the combination of LiRE and OMP is faster and more accurate than LASSO. Finally, as a standalone support recovery algorithm with a random initialization, experiments show that LiRE’s support recovery performance lies between OMP and BP. These results show that LiRE can be used generically, on top of any suboptimal baseline support recovery algorithm, to improve support recovery or to operate with a smaller number of measurements, at the cost of a relatively small computational overhead. Alternatively, LiRE may be used as a standalone support recovery algorithm that is competitive with respect to OMP.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we provide non-asymptotic, probabilistic guarantees for successful recovery of the common nonzero support of jointly sparse Gaussian sources in the multiple measurement vector (MMV) problem. The support recovery problem is formulated as the marginalized maximum likelihood (or type-II ML) estimation of the variance hyperparameters of a joint sparsity inducing Gaussian prior on the source signals. We derive conditions under which the resulting nonconvex constrained optimization perfectly recovers the nonzero support of a joint-sparse Gaussian source ensemble with arbitrarily high probability. The support error probability decays exponentially with the number of MMVs at a rate that depends on the smallest restricted singular value and the nonnegative null space property of the self Khatri-Rao product of the sensing matrix. Our analysis confirms that nonzero supports of size as high as $O(m^{2})$ are recoverable from $m$ measurements per sparse vector. Our derived sufficient conditions for support consistency of the proposed constrained type-II ML solution also guarantee the support consistency of any global solution of the multiple sparse Bayesian learning (M-SBL) optimization whose nonzero coefficients lie inside a bounded interval. For the case of noiseless measurements, we further show that a single MMV is sufficient for perfect recovery of the $k$ -sparse support by M-SBL, provided all subsets of $k + 1$ columns of the sensing matrix are linearly independent.},

  abstract     = {Optimal rates for achieving an information processing task are often characterized in terms of regularized information measures. In many cases of quantum tasks, we do not know how to compute such quantities. Here, we exploit the symmetries in the recently introduced $\mathrm {D}^{\#}$ in order to obtain a hierarchy of semidefinite programming bounds on various regularized quantities. As applications, we give a general procedure to give efficient bounds on the regularized Umegaki channel divergence as well as the classical capacity and two-way assisted quantum capacity of quantum channels. In particular, we obtain slight improvements for the capacity of the amplitude damping channel. We also prove that for fixed input and output dimensions, the regularized sandwiched Rényi divergence between any two quantum channels can be approximated up to an $\epsilon $ accuracy in time that is polynomial in $1/\epsilon $ .},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we establish an interesting duality between two different quantum information-processing tasks, namely, classical source coding with quantum side information, and channel coding over classical-quantum channels. The duality relates the optimal error exponents of these two tasks, generalizing the classical results of Ahlswede and Dueck [ IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory , 28(3):430–443, 1982]. We establish duality both at the operational level and at the level of the entropic quantities characterizing these exponents. For the latter, the duality is given by an exact relation, whereas for the former, duality manifests itself in the following sense: an optimal coding strategy for one task can be used to construct an optimal coding strategy for the other task. Along the way, we derive a bound on the error exponent for classical-quantum channel coding with constant composition codes which might be of independent interest. Finally, we consider the task of variable-length classical compression with quantum side information, and a duality relation between this task and classical-quantum channel coding can also be established correspondingly. Furthermore, we study the strong converse of this task, and show that the strong converse property does not hold even in the i.i.d. scenario.},

  abstract     = {We consider the joint constellation design problem for the noncoherent multiple-input multiple-output multiple-access channel (MAC). By analyzing the noncoherent maximum-likelihood detection error, we propose novel design criteria so as to minimize the error probability. As a baseline approach, we adapt several existing design criteria for the point-to-point channel to the MAC. Furthermore, we propose new design criteria. Our first proposed design metric is the dominating term in nonasymptotic lower and upper bounds on the pairwise error probability exponent. We give a geometric interpretation of the bound using Riemannian distance in the manifold of Hermitian positive definite matrices. From an analysis of this metric at high signal-to-noise ratio, we obtain further simplified metrics. For any given set of constellation sizes, the proposed metrics can be optimized over the set of constellation symbols. Motivated by the simplified metric, we propose a simple constellation construction consisting in partitioning a single-user constellation. We also provide a generalization of our previously proposed construction based on precoding individual constellations of lower dimensions. For a fixed joint constellation, the design metrics can be further optimized over the per-user transmit power, especially when the users transmit at different rates. Considering unitary space-time modulation, we investigate the option of building each individual constellation as a set of truncated unitary matrices scaled by the respective transmit power. Numerical results show that our proposed metrics are meaningful, and can be used as objectives to generate constellations through numerical optimization that perform better, for the same transmission rate and power constraint, than a common pilot-based scheme and the constellations optimized with existing metrics.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies distributed algorithms for (strongly convex) composite optimization problems over mesh networks, subject to quantized communications. Instead of focusing on a specific algorithmic design, a black-box model is proposed, casting linearly convergent distributed algorithms in the form of fixed-point iterates. The algorithmic model is equipped with a novel random or deterministic Biased Compression (BC) rule on the quantizer design, and a new Adaptive encoding Non-uniform Quantizer (ANQ) coupled with a communication-efficient encoding scheme, which implements the BC-rule using a finite number of bits (below machine precision). This fills a gap existing in most state-of-the-art quantization schemes, such as those based on the popular compression rule, which rely on communication of some scalar signals with negligible quantization error (in practice quantized at the machine precision). A unified communication complexity analysis is developed for the black-box model, determining the average number of bits required to reach a solution of the optimization problem within a target accuracy. It is shown that the proposed BC-rule preserves linear convergence of the unquantized algorithms, and a trade-off between convergence rate and communication cost under ANQ-based quantization is characterized. Numerical results validate our theoretical findings and show that distributed algorithms equipped with the proposed ANQ have more favorable communication cost than algorithms using state-of-the-art quantization rules.},

In particular, each transmitted message must be decodable at its intended receiver and remain confidential at the remaining $(K-1)$ receivers. Our main contribution is to present a comprehensive set of results for the TIM-CM problem by studying the symmetric secure degrees of freedom (SDoF). To this end, we first characterize necessary and sufficient conditions for feasibility of positive symmetric SDoF for any arbitrary topology. We next present two achievable schemes for the TIM-CM problem: For the first scheme, we use the concept of secure partition and, for the second one, we use the concept of secure independent sets. We also present outer bounds on symmetric SDoF for any arbitrary network topology. Using these bounds, we characterize the optimal symmetric SDoF of all $K=2$ -user and $K=3$ -user network topologies.},

Each local group satisfies ‘ $a$ ’ local parity checks to recover from ‘ $a$ ’ erasures in that local group and there are further $h$ global parity checks to provide fault tolerance from more global erasure patterns. Such an LRC is Maximally Recoverable (MR), if it offers the best blend of locality and global erasure resilience—namely it can correct all erasure patterns whose recovery is information-theoretically feasible given the locality structure (these are precisely patterns with up to ‘ $a$ ’ erasures in each local group and an additional $h$ erasures anywhere in the codeword). Random constructions can easily show the existence of MR LRCs over very large fields, but a major algebraic challenge is to construct MR LRCs, or even show their existence, over smaller fields, as well as understand inherent lower bounds on their field size. We give an explicit construction of $(n,r,h,a,q)$ -MR LRCs with field size $q$ bounded by $\left ({O\left ({\max {r,n/r}}\right)}\right)^{\min {h,r-a}}$ . This significantly improves upon known constructions in many practically relevant parameter ranges. Moreover, it matches the lower bound from Gopi et al. (2020) in an interesting range of parameters where $r=\Theta (\sqrt {n})$ , $r-a=\Theta (\sqrt {n})$ and $h$ is a fixed constant with $h \leqslant a+2$ , achieving the optimal field size of $\Theta _{h}(n^{h/2})$ . Our construction is based on the theory of skew polynomials. We believe skew polynomials should have further applications in coding and complexity theory; as a small illustration we show how to capture algebraic results underlying list decoding folded Reed-Solomon and multiplicity codes in a unified way within this theory.},

  abstract     = {The sequence reconstruction problem, introduced by Levenshtein in 2001, considers a communication scenario where the sender transmits a codeword from some codebook and the receiver obtains multiple noisy reads of the codeword. Motivated by modern storage devices, we introduced a variant of the problem where the number of noisy reads $N$ is fixed. Of significance, for the single-deletion channel, using $\log _{2}\log _{2} n +O(1)$ redundant bits, we designed a reconstruction code of length $n$ that reconstructs codewords from two distinct noisy reads (Cai et al. , 2021). In this work, we show that $\log _{2}\log _{2} n -O(1)$ redundant bits are necessary for such reconstruction codes, thereby, demonstrating the optimality of the construction. Furthermore, we show that these reconstruction codes can be used in $t$ -deletion channels (with $t \geqslant 2$ ) to uniquely reconstruct codewords from ${n^{t-1}}/{(t-1)!}+O\left ({n^{t-2}}\right)$ distinct noisy reads.

  abstract     = {An $(m,n,a,b)$ -tensor code consists of $m\times n$ matrices whose columns satisfy ‘ $a$ ’ parity checks and rows satisfy ‘ $b$ ’ parity checks (i.e., a tensor code is the tensor product of a column code and row code). Tensor codes are useful in distributed storage because a single erasure can be corrected quickly either by reading its row or column. Maximally Recoverable (MR) Tensor Codes, introduced by Gopalan et al., are tensor codes which can correct every erasure pattern that is information theoretically possible to correct. The main questions about MR Tensor Codes are characterizing which erasure patterns are correctable and obtaining explicit constructions over small fields. In this paper, we study the important special case when $a=1$ , i.e., the columns satisfy a single parity check equation. We introduce the notion of higher order MDS codes ( $\mathrm {MDS}(\ell)$ codes) which is an interesting generalization of the well-known MDS codes, where $\ell $ captures the order of genericity of points in a low-dimensional space. We then prove that a tensor code with $a=1$ is MR if the row code is an $\mathrm {MDS}(m)$ code. We then show that $\mathrm {MDS}(m)$ codes satisfy some weak duality. Using this characterization and duality, we prove that $(m,n,a=1,b)$ -MR tensor codes require fields of size $q=\Omega _{m,b}(n^{\min {b,m}-1})$ . Our lower bound also extends to the setting of $a&amp;gt;1$ . We also give a deterministic polynomial time algorithm to check if a given erasure pattern is correctable by the MR tensor code (when $a=1$ ).},

Which subset is chosen determines the dimension, the minimum distance and the weight distribution of the BCH code. We construct possible BCH codes and determine their coderate, true minimum distance and the non-equivalent codes. A particular choice of cyclotomic cosets gives BCH codes which are, extended by one bit, equivalent to Reed-Muller codes, which is a known result from the sixties. We show that BCH codes have possibly better parameters than Reed-Muller codes, which are related in recent publications to polar codes. We study the decoding performance of these different BCH codes using information set decoding based on minimal weight codewords of the dual code. We show that information set decoding is possible even in case of a channel without reliability information since the decoding algorithm inherently calculates reliability information. Different BCH codes of the same rate are compared and different decoding performances and complexity are observed. Some examples of hard decision decoding of BCH codes have the same decoding performance as maximum likelihood decoding. All presented decoding methods can possibly be extended to include reliability information of a Gaussian channel for soft decision decoding. We show simulation results for soft decision list information set decoding and compare the performance to other methods.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies low-latency streaming codes for the multi-hop network. The source transmits a sequence of messages to a destination through a chain of relays, and requires the destination to reconstruct each message by its deadline. We assume that each communication link is subjected to a certain maximum number of packet erasures. The case of a single relay (a three-node network) was considered in Fong et al. (2020). A coding scheme known as symbol-wise decode and forward was proposed. In the present work, we propose an alternative scheme that is different from Fong et al. (2020) and still achieves the same rate as in Fong et al. (2020) for the one hop case as the field-size goes to infinity. Furthermore, our proposed scheme naturally generalizes to the case of multiple-relay nodes yielding new achievable rates for this setting. The main difference with Fong et al. (2020) is that our proposed scheme exploits the ability of the relay nodes to adapt the transmission based on the erasures on the previous link. Hence, we refer to our scheme as “state-dependent” and contrast it with the scheme in Fong et al. (2020) that is state-independent. Our scheme requires the relay nodes to append a header to the transmitted packets, and we show that the size of the header does not depend on the field-size of the code. We also derive an upper bound on the maximal streaming rate achievable over a network with an arbitrary number of relays. We show that this upper bound matches our achievable rate in the special case when the maximal number of erasures on the first link is greater than or equal to the maximal number of erasures on each of the following links, and the field size goes to infinity.},

While recent results have relaxed some of these assumptions, deeper understanding of the full heterogeneity setting is still much needed since traditional caching schemes place little assumptions on file/cache sizes and almost always allow each user to have his/her own file preference through individualized file request prediction. Taking a microscopic approach, this paper characterizes the exact capacity of the smallest 2-user/2-file ( $N=K=2$ ) problem but under the most general setting that simultaneously allows for (i) heterogeneous files sizes, (ii) heterogeneous cache sizes, (iii) user-dependent file popularity, and (iv) average-rate analysis.

For symmetric binary-input channels, the deterministic variable-length feedback (VLF) code constructed with the SED coding scheme asymptotically achieves both capacity and Burnashev’s optimal error exponent. Building on the work of Naghshvar et al., this paper extends the SED coding scheme to the BAC and develops a non-asymptotic VLF achievability bound that is shown to achieve both capacity and the optimal error exponent. For the specific case of the BSC, we develop an additional non-asymptotic VLF achievability bound using a two-phase analysis that leverages both a submartingale synthesis and a Markov chain time of first passage analysis. Numerical evaluations show that both new VLF achievability bounds outperform Polyanskiy’s achievability bound for variable-length stop-feedback codes.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the secret key-authenticated-capacity region, where information-theoretic authentication is defined by the ability of the decoder to accept and decode messages originating from a valid encoder while rejecting messages from other invalid sources. The model considered here consists of a valid encoder-decoder pairing that can communicate through a channel controlled by an adversary who is also able to eavesdrop on the encoder’s transmissions. Prior to the encoder’s transmission, the adversary decides whether or not to replace the decoder’s observation with an arbitrary one of the adversary’s choosing, with the adversary’s objective being to have the decoder accept and decode their observation to a valid message (different from that of the encoder). To combat the adversary, the encoder and decoder share a secret key. The secret key-authenticated-capacity region is defined as the region of jointly achievable message rate, authentication rate (a to be defined per symbol measure that will generally represent the likelihood that an adversary can fool the decoder), and the key-consumption rate (how many bits of secret key are needed per symbol sent). This is the second of a two-part study, with the parts differing in their measure of the authentication rate. For this second study, the probability of false authentication is considered as a function of the system state, where the system state is defined by the message being transmitted, the value of the secret key, the adversary’s channel observations, and the adversary’s (possibly stochastic) choice for the decoder’s observation. Termed the typical-authentication rate, the authentication measure considered here corresponds to an upper bound on the probability of false authentication for the majority of system states. For this measure, we derive matching inner and outer bounds for the secret key-enabled authenticated capacity region in terms of traditional information-theoretic measures. In doing so, it is shown that the typical-authentication rate and the message rate exhibit a one-to-one trade-off in the capacity region.},

  abstract     = {Speckle or multiplicative noise is a critical issue in coherence-based imaging systems, such as synthetic aperture radar and optical coherence tomography. Existence of speckle noise considerably limits the applicability of such systems by degrading their performance. On the other hand, the sophistications that arise in the study of multiplicative noise have so far impeded theoretical analysis of such imaging systems. As a result, the current acquisition technology relies on heuristic solutions, such as oversampling the signal and converting the problem into a denoising problem with multiplicative noise. This paper attempts to bridge the gap between theory and practice by providing the first theoretical analysis of such systems. To achieve this goal the log-likelihood function corresponding to measurement systems with speckle noise is characterized. Then employing compression codes to model the source structure, for the case of under-sampled measurements, a compression-based maximum likelihood recovery method is proposed. The mean squared error (MSE) performance of the proposed method is characterized and is shown to scale as $O\left({\sqrt {\frac{k \log n }{ m}}}\right)$ , where $k$ , $m$ and $n$ denote the intrinsic dimension of the signal class according to the compression code, the number of observations, and the ambient dimension of the signal, respectively. This result, while in contrast to imaging systems with additive noise in which MSE scales as $O\left({{\frac{k \log n }{ m}}}\right)$ , suggests that if the signal class is structured (i.e., $k \ll n$ ), accurate recovery of a signal from under-determined measurements is still feasible, even in the presence of speckle noise. Simulation results are presented that suggest image recovery under multiplicative noise is inherently more challenging than additive noise, and that the derived theoretical results are sharp.},

Compared with traditional compression methods, data deduplication schemes are more computationally efficient and are thus widely used in large scale storage systems. In this paper, we provide an information-theoretic analysis of the performance of deduplication algorithms on data streams in which repeats are not exact. We introduce a source model in which probabilistic substitutions are considered. More precisely, each symbol in a repeated string is substituted with a given edit probability. Deduplication algorithms in both the fixed-length scheme and the variable-length scheme are studied. The fixed-length deduplication algorithm is shown to be unsuitable for the proposed source model as it does not take into account the edit probability. Two modifications are proposed and shown to have performances within a constant factor of optimal for a specific class of source models with the knowledge of model parameters. We also study the conventional variable-length deduplication algorithm and show that as source entropy becomes smaller, the size of the compressed string vanishes relative to the length of the uncompressed string, leading to high compression ratios.},

  abstract     = {It is well known that independent (separate) encoding of $K$ correlated sources may incur some rate loss compared to joint encoding, even if the decoding is done jointly. This loss is particularly evident in the multiple descriptions problem, where it is the same source that is encoded in each description. We observe that under mild conditions about the source and distortion measure, the sum-rate of $K$ separately encoded individually good descriptions tends to the rate-distortion function of the joint decoder in the limit of vanishing small coding rates of the descriptions. Moreover, we then propose to successively encode the source into $K$ independent descriptions in each round in order to achieve a final distortion $D$ after $M$ rounds. We provide two examples – a Gaussian source with mean-squared error and an exponential source with one-sided error – for which the excess rate vanishes in the limit as the number of rounds $M$ goes to infinity, for any fixed $D$ and $K$ . This result has an interesting interpretation for a multi-round variant of the multiple descriptions problem, where after each round the encoder gets a (block) feedback regarding which of the descriptions arrived: In the limit as the number of rounds $M$ goes to infinity (i.e., many incremental rounds), the total rate of received descriptions approaches the rate-distortion function. We provide theoretical and experimental evidence showing that this phenomenon is in fact more general than in the two examples above.},

  abstract     = {All-or-nothing transforms (AONTs) were proposed by Rivest as a message preprocessing technique for encrypting data to protect against brute-force attacks, and have numerous applications in cryptography and information security. Later the unconditionally secure AONTs and their combinatorial characterization were introduced by Stinson. Informally, a combinatorial AONT is an array with the unbiased requirements and its security properties in general depend on the prior probability distribution on the inputs $s$ -tuples. Recently, it was shown by Esfahani and Stinson that a combinatorial AONT has perfect security provided that all the inputs $s$ -tuples are equiprobable, and has weak security provided that all the inputs $s$ -tuples are with non-zero probability. This paper aims to explore on the gap between perfect security and weak security for combinatorial $(t,s,v)$ -AONTs. Concretely, we consider the typical scenario that all the $s$ inputs take values independently (but not necessarily identically) and quantify the amount of information $H(\mathcal {X}|\mathcal {Y})$ about any $t$ inputs $\mathcal {X}$ that is not revealed by any $s-t$ outputs $\mathcal {Y}$ . In particular, we establish the general lower and upper bounds on $H(\mathcal {X}|\mathcal {Y})$ for combinatorial AONTs using information-theoretic techniques, and also show that the derived bounds can be attained in certain cases. Furthermore, the discussions are extended for the security properties of combinatorial asymmetric AONTs.},

In particular, it gives rise to a large family of bent functions obtained in the same manner as spread bent functions. We show that the first non-spread construction of bent partitions introduced by Pirsic and the third author ( $p=2$ ), respectively, the first and the third author ( $p$ odd), gives rise to a large variety of different bent partitions. Especially, we show that the sets of bent functions obtained with any two such bent partitions do not intersect. We then show that every union of sets from one of these bent partitions always forms a partial difference set. This generalizes some known results on partial difference sets from spreads. Some general results on partial difference sets from bent partitions of $\mathbb {V}_{2m}^{(2)}$ are given in the last section.},

In the stochastic setting, we show that a simple index policy is near-optimal for minimizing the average AoI in two different mobility scenarios.

The distributed function computation is subject to constraints, including not only reliability and storage but also secrecy and privacy. Specifically, 1) the function computed should remain secret from an eavesdropper observing the public communication and correlated observations, measured in terms of the information leaked about the arguments of the function, to ensure secrecy regardless of the exact function used; 2) the remote source should remain private from the eavesdropper and the fusion center, measured in terms of the information leaked about the remote source itself. We derive the exact rate regions for lossless and lossy single-function computation and illustrate the lossy single-function computation rate region for an information bottleneck example, in which the optimal auxiliary random variables are characterized for binary-input symmetric-output channels. We extend the approach to lossless and lossy asynchronous multiple-function computations with joint secrecy and privacy constraints, in which case inner and outer bounds for the rate regions that differ only in the Markov chain conditions imposed are characterized.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the secret-key-authenticated-capacity region, where information-theoretic authentication is defined by the ability of the decoder to accept and decode messages originating from a valid encoder while rejecting messages from other invalid sources. The model considered here consists of a valid encoder-decoder pairing that can communicate through a channel controlled by an adversary who is also able to eavesdrop on the encoder’s transmissions. Over multiple rounds of communication, the adversary first decides whether or not to replace the decoder’s observation with an arbitrary one of the adversary’s choosing, with the goal of the adversary being to have the decoder accept and decode their observation as a valid message (different from that of the encoder). To combat the adversary, the encoder and decoder share a secret key. The secret-key-authenticated-capacity region here is then defined as the region of jointly achievable message rate, authentication rate (a to be defined per symbol measure that will generally represent the likelihood that an adversary can fool the decoder), and the key-consumption rate (how many bits of secret key are needed per symbol sent). This is the first of a two-part study, with the parts differing in their measure of the authentication rate. In this first study, the authentication rate is the exponent of blocklength-normalized exponent of the expected probability of false authentication. For this metric, we provide an inner bound which improves on those existing in the literature. This is achieved by adopting and merging different classical techniques in novel ways. Within these classical secret-key-based authentication techniques, one technique derives authentication capability from secure channel coding to send the secret key with the message, and the other technique derives its authentication capability directly from obscuring the source.},

The information-theoretic limit of the number of traces needed to recover a string of length $n$ is still unknown. This limit is essentially the same as the number of traces needed to determine, given strings $\mathbf {x}$ and $\mathbf {y}$ and traces of one of them, which string is the source. The most-studied class of algorithms for the worst-case version of the problem are “mean-based” algorithms. These are a restricted class of distinguishers that only use the mean value of each coordinate on the given samples. In this work we study limitations of mean-based algorithms on strings at small Hamming or edit distance. We show that, on the one hand, distinguishing strings that are nearby in Hamming distance is “easy” for such distinguishers. On the other hand, we show that distinguishing strings that are nearby in edit distance is “hard” for mean-based algorithms. Along the way, we also describe a connection to the famous Prouhet-Tarry-Escott (PTE) problem, which shows a barrier to finding explicit hard-to-distinguish strings: namely such strings would imply explicit short solutions to the PTE problem, a well-known difficult problem in number theory. Furthermore, we show that the converse is also true, thus, finding explicit solutions to the PTE problem is equivalent to the problem of finding explicit strings that are hard-to-distinguish by mean-based algorithms. Our techniques rely on complex analysis arguments that involve careful trigonometric estimates, and algebraic techniques that include applications of Descartes’ rule of signs for polynomials over the reals.},

  abstract     = {The problem of completing a large matrix with lots of missing entries has received widespread attention in the last couple of decades. Two popular approaches to the matrix completion problem are based on singular value thresholding and nuclear norm minimization. Most of the past works on this subject assume that there is a single number $p$ such that each entry of the matrix is available independently with probability $p$ and missing otherwise. This assumption may not be realistic for many applications. In this work, we replace it with the assumption that the probability that an entry is available is an unknown function $f$ of the entry itself. For example, if the entry is the rating given to a movie by a viewer, then it seems plausible that high value entries have greater probability of being available than low value entries. We propose two new estimators, based on singular value thresholding and nuclear norm minimization, to recover the matrix under this assumption. The estimators involve no tuning parameters, and are shown to be consistent under a low rank assumption. We also provide a consistent estimator of the unknown function $f$ .},

  abstract     = {Let $\mathbf {X}\in \mathbb {C}^{n\times m}$ ( $m\geq n$ ) be a random matrix with independent columns each distributed as complex multivariate Gaussian with zero mean and single-spiked covariance matrix $\mathbf {I}_{n}+ \eta \mathbf {u}\mathbf {u}^{*}$ , where $\mathbf {I}_{n}$ is the $n\times n$ identity matrix, $\mathbf {u}\in \mathbb {C}^{n\times 1}$ is an arbitrary vector with unit Euclidean norm, $\eta \geq 0$ is a non-random parameter, and $(\cdot)^{*}$ represents the conjugate-transpose. This paper investigates the distribution of the random quantity $\kappa _{\text {SC}}^{2}(\mathbf {X})=\sum _{k=1}^{n} \lambda _{k}/\lambda _{1}$ , where $0\le \lambda _{1}\le \lambda _{2}\le \ldots \leq \lambda _{n} &amp;lt; \infty $ are the ordered eigenvalues of $\mathbf {X}\mathbf {X}^{*}$ (i.e., single-spiked Wishart matrix). This random quantity is intimately related to the so called scaled condition number or the Demmel condition number (i.e., $\kappa _{\text {SC}}(\mathbf {X})$ ) and the minimum eigenvalue of the fixed trace Wishart-Laguerre ensemble (i.e., $\kappa _{\text {SC}}^{-2}(\mathbf {X})$ ). In particular, we use an orthogonal polynomial approach to derive an exact expression for the probability density function of $\kappa _{\text {SC}}^{2}(\mathbf {X})$ which is amenable to asymptotic analysis as matrix dimensions grow large. Our asymptotic results reveal that, as $m,n\to \infty $ such that $m-n$ is fixed and when $\eta $ scales on the order of $1/n$ , $\kappa _{\text {SC}}^{2}(\mathbf {X})$ scales on the order of $n^{3}$ . In this respect we establish simple closed-form expressions for the limiting distributions. It turns out that, as $m,n\to \infty $ such that $n/m\to c\in (0,1)$ , properly centered $\kappa _{\text {SC}}^{2}(\mathbf {X})$ fluctuates on the scale $m^{\frac {1}{3}}$ .},

  abstract     = {Detection of the number of signals corrupted by high-dimensional noise is a fundamental problem in signal processing and statistics. This paper focuses on a general setting where the high-dimensional noise has an unknown complicated heterogeneous variance structure. We propose a sequential test which utilizes the edge singular values (i.e., the largest few singular values) of the data matrix. It also naturally leads to a consistent sequential testing estimate of the number of signals. We describe the asymptotic distribution of the test statistic in terms of the Tracy-Widom distribution. The test is shown to be accurate and have full power against the alternative, both theoretically and numerically. The theoretical analysis relies on establishing the Tracy-Widom law for a large class of Gram type random matrices with non-zero means and completely arbitrary variance profiles, which can be of independent interest.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we analyze the generalization performance of the Iterative Hard Thresholding (IHT) algorithm widely used for sparse recovery problems. The parameter estimation and sparsity recovery consistency of IHT has long been known in compressed sensing. From the perspective of statistical learning, another fundamental question is how well the IHT estimation would predict on unseen data. This paper makes progress towards answering this open question by introducing a novel sparse generalization theory for IHT under the notion of algorithmic stability. Our theory reveals that: 1) under natural conditions on the empirical risk function over $n$ samples of dimension $p$ , IHT with sparsity level $k$ enjoys an $\tilde {\mathcal {O}}(n^{-1/2}\sqrt {k\log (n)\log (p)})$ rate of convergence in sparse excess risk; 2) a tighter $\tilde {\mathcal {O}}(n^{-1/2}\sqrt {\log (n)})$ bound can be established by imposing an additional iteration stability condition on a hypothetical IHT procedure invoked to the population risk; and 3) a fast rate of order $\tilde {\mathcal {O}}\left ({n^{-1}k(\log ^{3}(n)+\log (p))}\right)$ can be derived for strongly convex risk function under proper strong-signal conditions. The results have been substantialized to sparse linear regression and sparse logistic regression models to demonstrate the applicability of our theory. Preliminary numerical evidence is provided to support our theoretical predictions.},

Network-based methods have the computational advantage that the algorithm scales to large datasets. This paper considers using the classification logit function, which is provided by a trained classification neural network and evaluated on the testing set split of the two datasets, to compute a two-sample statistic. To analyze the approximation and estimation error of the logit function to differentiate near-manifold densities, we introduce a new result of near-manifold integral approximation by neural networks. We then show that the logit function provably differentiates two sub-exponential densities given that the network is sufficiently parametrized, and for on or near manifold densities, the needed network complexity is reduced to only scale with the intrinsic dimensionality. In experiments, the network logit test demonstrates better performance than previous network-based tests using classification accuracy, and also compares favorably to certain kernel maximum mean discrepancy tests on synthetic datasets and hand-written digit datasets.},

  abstract     = {Faced with massive data, subsampling is a commonly used technique to improve computational efficiency, and using nonuniform subsampling probabilities is an effective approach to improve estimation efficiency. For computational efficiency, subsampling is often implemented with replacement or through Poisson subsampling. However, no rigorous investigation has been performed to study the difference between the two subsampling procedures such as their estimation efficiency and computational convenience. This paper performs a comparative study on these two different sampling procedures. In the context of maximizing a general target function, we first derive asymptotic distributions for estimators obtained from the two sampling procedures. The results show that the Poisson subsampling may have a higher estimation efficiency. Based on the asymptotic distributions for both subsampling with replacement and Poisson subsampling, we derive optimal subsampling probabilities that minimize the variance functions of the subsampling estimators. These subsampling probabilities further reveal the similarities and differences between subsampling with replacement and Poisson subsampling. The theoretical characterizations and comparisons on the two subsampling procedures provide guidance to select a more appropriate subsampling approach in practice. Furthermore, practically implementable algorithms are proposed based on the optimal structural results, which are evaluated through both theoretical and empirical analyses.},

The tracial Haemers bound is incomparable with the Lovász theta function, another well-known upper bound on the Shannon capacity. We show that separating the tracial and fractional Haemers bounds would refute Connes’ embedding conjecture. Along the way, we prove that the tracial rank and tracial Haemers bound are elements of the (commuting quantum) asymptotic spectrum of graphs (Zuiddam, Combinatorica, 2019). We also show that the inertia bound (an upper bound on the quantum independence number) upper bounds the commuting quantum independence number.},

  abstract     = {The design of decoding algorithms is a significant technological component in the development of fault-tolerant quantum computers. Often design of quantum decoders is inspired by classical decoding algorithms, but there are no general principles for building quantum decoders from classical decoders. Given any pair of classical codes, we can build a quantum code using the hypergraph product, yielding a hypergraph product code. Here we show we can also lift the decoders for these classical codes. That is, given oracle access to a minimum weight decoder for the relevant classical codes, the corresponding $[[n,k,d]]$ quantum code can be efficiently decoded for any error of weight smaller than $(d-1)/2$ . The quantum decoder requires only $O(k)$ oracle calls to the classical decoder and $O(n^{2})$ classical resources. The lift and the correctness proof of the decoder have a purely algebraic nature that draws on the discovery of some novel homological invariants of the hypergraph product codespace. While the decoder works perfectly for adversarial errors, that is errors of weight up to half the code distance, it is not suitable for more realistic stochastic noise models and therefore can not be used to establish an error correcting threshold.},

  abstract     = {In applications of remote sensing, estimation, and control, timely communication is critical but not always ensured by high-rate communication. This work proposes decentralized age-efficient transmission policies for random access channels with $M$ transmitters. We propose the notion of age-gain of a packet to quantify how much the packet will reduce the instantaneous age of information at the receiver side upon successful delivery. We then utilize this notion to propose a transmission policy in which transmitters act in a decentralized manner based on the age-gain of their available packets. In particular, each transmitter sends its latest packet only if its corresponding age-gain is beyond a certain threshold which could be computed adaptively using the collision feedback or found as a fixed value analytically in advance. Both methods improve age of information significantly compared to the state of the art. In the limit of large $M$ , we prove that when the arrival rate is small (below $\frac {1}{eM}$ ), slotted ALOHA-type algorithms are order optimal. As the arrival rate increases beyond $\frac {1}{eM}$ , while age increases under slotted ALOHA, it decreases significantly under the proposed age-based policies. For arrival rates $\theta $ , $\theta =\frac {1}{o(M)}$ , the proposed algorithms provide a multiplicative gain of at least two compared to the minimum age under slotted ALOHA (minimum over all arrival rates). We conclude that it is beneficial to increase the sampling rate (and hence the arrival rate) and transmit packets selectively based on their age-gain. This is surprising and contrary to common practice where the arrival rate is optimized to attain the minimum AoI. We further extend our results to other random access technologies such as Carrier-sense multiple access (CSMA).},

Under nonuniform file popularity, we thoroughly characterize the optimal uncoded cache placement structure for the coded caching scheme (CCS). Formulating the cache placement as an optimization problem to minimize the average delivery rate, we identify the file group structure in the optimal solution. We show that, regardless of the file popularity distribution, there are at most three file groups in the optimal cache placement, where files within a group have the same cache placement. We further characterize the complete structure of the optimal cache placement and obtain the closed-form solution in each of the three file group structures. A simple algorithm is developed to obtain the final optimal cache placement by comparing a set of candidate closed-form solutions computed in parallel. We provide insight into the file groups formed by the optimal cache placement. The optimal placement solution also indicates that coding between file groups may be explored during delivery, in contrast to the existing suboptimal file grouping schemes. Using the file group structure in the optimal cache placement for the CCS, we propose a new information-theoretic converse bound for coded caching that is tighter than the existing best one. Moreover, we characterize the file subpacketization in the CCS with the optimal cache placement solution and show that the maximum subpacketization level in the worst case scales as ${\mathcal{ O}}(2^{K}/\sqrt {K})$ for $K$ users.},

  abstract     = {A functional $k$ -batch code of dimension $s$ consists of $n$ servers storing linear combinations of $s$ linearly independent information bits. Any multiset request of size $k$ of linear combinations (or requests) of the information bits can be recovered by $k$ disjoint subsets of the servers. The goal under this paradigm is to find the minimum number of servers for given values of $s$ and $k$ . A recent conjecture states that for any $k=2^{s-1}$ requests the optimal solution requires $2^{s}-1$ servers. This conjecture is verified for $s \leqslant 5$ but previous work could only show that codes with $n=2^{s}-1$ servers can support a solution for $k=2^{s-2} + 2^{s-4} + \left \lfloor{ \frac { 2^{s/2}}{\sqrt {24}} }\right \rfloor $ requests. This paper reduces this gap and shows the existence of codes for $k=\lfloor \frac {5}{6}2^{s-1} \rfloor - s$ requests with the same number of servers. Another construction in the paper provides a code with $n=2^{s+1}-2$ servers and $k=2^{s}$ requests, which is an optimal result. These constructions are mainly based on extended Simplex codes and equivalently provide constructions for parallel Random I/O (RIO) codes.},

The construction can be viewed as a generalization of Smagloy et al .’s construction (ISIT 2020), and for the special case of $s=1$ , our construction is a slight improvement in redundancy of the existing works. Further, we modify the syndrome compression technique by combining a precoding process and construct a family of systematic $t$ -deletion $s$ -substitution correcting codes with polynomial time encoding/decoding algorithms for both binary and nonbinary alphabets, where $t\geq 1$ and $s\geq 1$ . Specifically, our binary $t$ -deletion $s$ -substitution correcting codes of length $n$ have redundancy $(4t+3s)\log _{2}n+o(\log _{2}n)$ , whereas, for $q$ being a prime power, the redundancy of $q$ -ary $t$ -deletion $s$ -substitution codes is asymptotically $\left({4t+4s-1-\lfloor \frac {2s-1}{q}\rfloor }\right)\vphantom {{\lfloor \frac {2s-1}{q}\rfloor }_{j}}\log _{q} n + o(\log _{q}n)$ as $n\to \infty $ .

The latter, in turn, converges to a Gumbel distribution at integer points when $\frac {k}{n}$ converges to a fixed number in (0, 1). Our result confirms in a strong sense that apart from identification of the weights of proportional codewords, the probabilistic dependencies introduced by the linear structure of the random code, produce a negligible effect on the minimum code weight.

  abstract     = {Streaming codes take a string of source symbols as input and output a string of coded symbols in real time, which eliminate the queueing delay of traditional block codes and are thus especially appealing for delay sensitive applications. Existing works on streaming code performance either focused on the asymptotic error-exponent analyses, or on the optimal code construction under deterministic adversarial channel models . In contrast, this work analyzes the exact error probability of random linear streaming codes (RLSCs) in the large field size regime over the stochastic i.i.d. symbol erasure channel model. A closed-form expression of the error probability of large-field-size RLSCs is derived under, simultaneously, the finite memory length and decoding deadline constraints. The result is then used to examine the intricate tradeoff between memory length (complexity), decoding deadline (delay), code rate (throughput), and error probability (reliability). Numerical evaluation shows that under the same code rate and error probability requirements, the end-to-end delay of RLSCs is 40–48\% of that of the optimal block codes (i.e., MDS codes). This implies that switching from block codes to streaming codes not only eliminates the queueing delay completely (which accounts for the initial 50\% of the delay reduction) but also improves the reliability (which accounts for the additional 2–10\% delay reduction).},

  abstract     = {This article studies the zero-error feedback capacity of causal discrete channels with memory. First, by extending the classical zero-error feedback capacity concept, a new notion of uniform zero-error feedback capacity $C_{0f} $ for such channels is introduced. Using this notion a tight condition for bounded stabilization of unstable noisy linear systems via causal channels is obtained, assuming no channel state information at either end of the channel. Furthermore, the zero-error feedback capacity of a class of additive noise channels is investigated. It is known that for a discrete channel with correlated additive noise, the ordinary capacity with or without feedback is equal $\log q-\mathcal {H}_{ch} $ , where $\mathcal {H}_{ch} $ is the entropy rate of the noise process and $q $ is the input alphabet size. In this paper, for a class of finite-state additive noise channels (FSANCs), it is shown that the zero-error feedback capacity is either zero or $C_{0f} =\log q -h_{ch} $ , where $h_{ch} $ is the topological entropy of the noise process. A condition is given to determine when the zero-error capacity with or without feedback is zero. This, in conjunction with the stabilization result, leads to a “Small-Entropy Theorem”, stating that stabilization over FSANCs can be achieved if the sum of the topological entropies of the linear system and the channel is smaller than $\log q$ .},

  abstract     = {We study an important specialization of the general problem of broadcasting on directed acyclic graphs, namely, that of broadcasting on two-dimensional (2D) regular grids. Consider an infinite directed acyclic graph with the form of a 2D regular grid, which has a single source vertex $X$ at layer 0, and $k + 1$ vertices at layer $k \geq 1$ , which are at a distance of $k$ from $X$ . Every vertex of the 2D regular grid has outdegree 2, the vertices at the boundary have indegree 1, and all other non-source vertices have indegree 2. At time 0, $X$ is given a uniform random bit. At time $k \geq 1$ , each vertex in layer $k$ receives transmitted bits from its parents in layer $k-1$ , where the bits pass through independent binary symmetric channels with common crossover probability $\delta \in \left({0,\frac {1}{2}}\right)$ during the process of transmission. Then, each vertex at layer $k$ with indegree 2 combines its two input bits using a common deterministic Boolean processing function to produce a single output bit at the vertex. The objective is to recover $X$ with probability of error better than $\frac {1}{2}$ from all vertices at layer $k$ as $k \rightarrow \infty $ . Besides their natural interpretation in the context of communication networks, such broadcasting processes can be construed as one-dimensional (1D) probabilistic cellular automata, or discrete-time statistical mechanical spin-flip systems on 1D lattices, with boundary conditions that limit the number of sites at each time $k$ to $k+1$ . Inspired by the literature surrounding the “positive rates conjecture” for 1D probabilistic cellular automata, we conjecture that it is impossible to propagate information in a 2D regular grid regardless of the noise level $\delta $ and the choice of common Boolean processing function. In this paper, we make considerable progress towards establishing this conjecture, and prove using ideas from percolation and coding theory that recovery of $X$ is impossible for any $\delta \in \left({0,\frac {1}{2}}\right)$ provided that all vertices with indegree 2 use either AND or XOR for their processing functions. Furthermore, we propose a detailed and general martingale-based approach that establishes the impossibility of recovering $X$ for any $\delta \in \left({0,\frac {1}{2}}\right)$ when all NAND processing functions are used if certain structured supermartingales can be rigorously constructed. We also provide strong numerical evidence for the existence of these supermartingales by computing several explicit examples for different values of $\delta $ via linear programming.},

  abstract     = {The notion of compressibility of a random measure is a rather general concept which find applications in many contexts from data compression, to signal quantization, and parameter estimation. While compressibility for discrete and continuous measures is generally well understood, the case of discrete-continuous measures is quite subtle. In this paper, we focus on a class of multi-dimensional random measures that have singularities on affine lower-dimensional subsets. We refer to this class of random variables as affinely singular . Affinely singular random vectors naturally arises when considering linear transformation of component-wise independent discrete-continuous random variables. To measure the compressibility of such distributions, we introduce the new notion of dimensional-rate bias (DRB) which is closely related to the entropy and differential entropy in discrete and continuous cases, respectively. Similar to entropy and differential entropy, DRB is useful in evaluating the mutual information between distributions of the aforementioned type. Besides the DRB, we also evaluate the the RID of these distributions. We further provide an upper-bound for the RID of multi-dimensional random measures that are obtained by Lipschitz functions of component-wise independent discrete-continuous random variables (X). The upper-bound is shown to be achievable when the Lipschitz function is $A \mathrm {X}$ , where $A$ satisfies ${\mathrm{ SPARK}}({A_{m\times n}}) = m+1$ (e.g., Vandermonde matrices). When considering discrete-domain moving-average processes with non-Gaussian excitation noise, the above results allow us to evaluate the block-average RID and DRB, as well as to determine a relationship between these parameters and other existing compressibility measures.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we introduce Ouroboros, a new family of Key Exchange protocols based on coding theory. The protocols propose a middle ground between the cryptosystems based on $\mathsf {QC}$ - $\mathsf {MDPC}$ codes, which feature small parameter sizes, but have a security reduction to two problems: the syndrome decoding problem and the indistinguishability of the code, and the HQC protocol, which features bigger parameters but has a security reduction to the syndrome decoding problem only. Ouroboros features a reduction to the syndrome decoding problem with only a small overhead compared to the $\mathsf {QC}$ - $\mathsf {MDPC}$ based cryptosystems. The approach is based on an ideal structure and also works for the rank metric. This yields a simple, secure and efficient approach for key exchange, the Ouroboros family of protocols. For the Hamming metric we obtain the same type of parameters (and almost the same simple decoding) as for $\mathsf {MDPC}$ based cryptosystems, but with a security reduction to decoding random quasi-cyclic codes in the Random Oracle Model. This represents a reduction of up to 38\% on the public key size compared to HQC, for the most secure parameters. For the rank metric, we obtain better parameters than for RQC, saving up to 31\% on the public key for the most secure set of parameters, using non homogeneous errors in Ouroboros. In this full version, the protocol and decoding algorithm have been slightly improved, additional details are given in the security proof, and the protocol is fully described for the rank metric.},

  abstract     = {In ICISC-05, and in the ePrint 2010/287, Patarin claimed a lower bound on the number of $2 q$ tuples of $n$ -bit strings $(P_{1}, \ldots, P_{2q}) \in ({{0,1}}^{n})^{2q}$ satisfying $P_{2i - 1} \oplus P_{2i} = \lambda _{i}$ for $1 \leq i \leq q$ such that $P_{1}, P_{2}, \ldots $ , $P_{2q}$ are distinct and $\lambda _{i} \in {{0,1}} ^{n} \setminus {0^{n}}$ . This result is known as Mirror theory and widely used in cryptography. It stands as a powerful tool to provide a high-security guarantee for many block cipher-(or even ideal permutation-) based designs. In particular, Mirror theory has a direct application in the security of XOR of block ciphers. Unfortunately, the proof of Mirror theory contains some unverifiable gaps and several mistakes. This paper provides a simple and verifiable proof of Mirror theory.},

  abstract     = {Extended Affine (EA) equivalence is the equivalence relation between two vectorial Boolean functions $F$ and $G$ such that there exist two affine permutations $A$ , $B$ , and an affine function $C$ satisfying $G = A \circ F \circ B + C$ . While the problem has a simple formulation, it is very difficult in practice to test whether two functions are EA-equivalent. This problem has two variants: EA-partitioning deals with partitioning a set of functions into disjoint EA-equivalence classes, and EA-recovery is about recovering the tuple $(A,B,C)$ if it exists. In this paper, we present a new algorithm that efficiently solves the EA-recovery problem for quadratic functions. Although its worst-case complexity occurs when dealing with APN functions, it supersedes, in terms of performance, all previously known algorithms for solving this problem for all quadratic functions and in any dimension, even in the case of APN functions. This approach is based on the Jacobian matrix of the functions, a tool whose study in this context can be of independent interest. The best approach for EA-partitioning in practice mainly relies on class invariants. We provide an overview of the known invariants along with a new one based on the ortho-derivative . This new invariant is applicable to quadratic APN functions, a specific type of functions that is of great interest, and of which tens of thousands need to be sorted into distinct EA-classes. Our ortho-derivative-based invariant is very fast to compute, and it practically always distinguishes between EA-inequivalent quadratic APN functions.},

The first nontrivial example is given in univariate form as $x^{2^{r}} {\rm Tr^{n}_{m}}(x), 1\le r &amp;lt; m$ (Pott et al. 2018), a few more examples of similar shape are given by Mesnager et al. 2019, and finally it has been shown that the quadratic function $F(x) = x^{2^{r}} {\rm Tr^{n}_{m}}(\Lambda (x))$ , has $2^{n}-2^{m}$ bent components if and only if $\Lambda $ is a linearized permutation polynomial of $\mathbb {F}_{2^{m}}[x]$ (Anbar et al. 2021). In the first part of this article, an upper bound for the nonlinearity of plateaued functions with $2^{n}-2^{m}$ bent components is shown, which is attained by the example $x^{2^{r}} {\rm Tr^{n}_{m}}(x)$ . We then analyse in detail nonlinearity and differential spectrum of the class of functions $F(x) = x^{2^{r}} {\rm Tr^{n}_{m}}(\Lambda (x))$ , which, as will be seen, requires the study of the functions $x^{2^{r}}\Lambda (x)$ . In the last part we demonstrate that this class belongs to a larger class of functions with $2^{n}-2^{m}$ Maiorana-McFarland bent components, which also contains nonquadratic and non-plateaued functions.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes using the uncertainty of information (UoI), measured by Shannon’s entropy, as a metric for information freshness. We consider a system in which a central monitor observes M binary Markov processes through m communication channels (m&lt;M). The UoI of a Markov process corresponds to the monitor’s uncertainty about its state. At each time step, only m Markov processes can be selected to update its state to the monitor; hence there is a tradeoff among the UoIs of the processes that depend on the scheduling policy used to select the processes to be updated. The age of information (AoI) of a process corresponds to the time since its last update. In general, the associated UoI can be a non-increasing function, or even an oscillating function, of its AoI, making the scheduling problem particularly challenging. This paper investigates scheduling policies that aim to minimize the average sum-UoI of the processes over the infinite time horizon. We formulate the problem as a restless multi-armed bandit (RMAB) problem, and develop a Whittle index policy that is near-optimal for the RMAB after proving its indexability. We further provide an iterative algorithm to compute the Whittle index for the practical deployment of the policy. Although this paper focuses on UoI scheduling, our results apply to a general class of RMABs for which the UoI scheduling problem is a special case. Specifically, this paper’s Whittle index policy is valid for any RMAB in which the bandits are binary Markov processes and the penalty is a concave function of the belief state of the Markov process. Numerical results demonstrate the excellent performance of the Whittle index policy for this class of RMABs.},

  abstract     = {ChaCha has been one of the most prominent ARX designs of the last few years because of its use in several systems. The cryptanalysis of ChaCha involves a differential attack that exploits the idea of Probabilistic Neutral Bits (PNBs). For a long period, the single-bit distinguisher in this differential attack was found up to 3rd round. At Crypto 2020, Beierle et al. introduced for the first time the single bit distinguishers for 3.5th round, which contributed significantly to regaining the flow of the research work in this direction. This discovery became the primary factor behind the huge improvement in the key recovery attack complexity in that work. This was followed by another work at Eurocrypt 2021, where a single bit distinguisher at 3.5th round helped to produce a 7th round distinguisher of ChaCha and a further improvement in the key recovery. In this paper, first, we provide the theoretical framework for the distinguisher given by Beierle et al. We mathematically derive the observed differential correlation for the particular position where the output difference is observed at 3.5th round. Also, Beierle et al. mentioned the issue of the availability of proper IVs to produce such distinguishers, and pointed out that not all keys have such IVs available. Here we provide a theoretical insight of this issue. Next, we revisit the work of Coutinho et al. (Eurocrypt 2021). Using Differential-Linear attacks against ChaCha, they claimed the distinguisher and the key recovery with complexities 2 218 and $2^{228.51}$ respectively. We show that the differential correlation for the 3.5th round is much smaller than the claim of Coutinho et al. This makes the attack complexities much higher than their claim.},

We analyze these conflicting objectives in a game theoretic framework with quadratic costs where depending on the commitment conditions (of the sender), we consider Nash or Stackelberg (Bayesian persuasion) equilibria. We show that a payoff dominant Nash equilibrium among all admissible policies is attained by a set of explicitly characterized linear policies. We also show that a payoff dominant Nash equilibrium coincides with a Stackelberg equilibrium. We formulate the information bottleneck problem within our Stackelberg framework under the mean squared error distortion criterion where the information bottleneck setup has a further restriction that only one of the random variables is observed at the sender. We show that this MMSE Gaussian Information Bottleneck Problem admits a linear solution which is explicitly characterized in the paper.

  abstract     = {Consider the following distributed optimization scenario. A worker has access to training data that it uses to compute the gradients while a server decides when to stop iterative computation based on its target accuracy or delay constraints. The server receives all its information about the problem instance from the worker via a rate-limited noiseless communication channel. We introduce the principle we call differential quantization (DQ) that prescribes compensating the past quantization errors to direct the descent trajectory of a quantized algorithm towards that of its unquantized counterpart. Assuming that the objective function is smooth and strongly convex, we prove that differentially quantized gradient descent (DQ-GD) attains a linear contraction factor of $\max {\sigma _{\mathrm {GD}}, \rho _{n} 2^{-R}}$ , where $\sigma _{\mathrm {GD}}$ is the contraction factor of unquantized gradient descent (GD), $\rho _{n} \geq 1$ is the covering efficiency of the quantizer, and $R$ is the bitrate per problem dimension $n$ . Thus at any $R\geq \log _{2} \rho _{n} /\sigma _{\mathrm {GD}}$ bits, the contraction factor of DQ-GD is the same as that of unquantized GD, i.e., there is no loss due to quantization. We show a converse demonstrating that no algorithm within a certain class can converge faster than $\max {\sigma _{\mathrm {GD}}, 2^{-R}}$ . Since quantizers exist with $\rho _{n} \to 1$ as $n \to \infty $ (Rogers, 1963), this means that DQ-GD is asymptotically optimal. In contrast, naively quantized GD where the worker directly quantizes the gradient barely attains $\sigma _{\mathrm {GD}} + \rho _{n}2^{-R}$ . The principle of differential quantization continues to apply to gradient methods with momentum such as Nesterov’s accelerated gradient descent, and Polyak’s heavy ball method. For these algorithms as well, if the rate is above a certain threshold, there is no loss in contraction factor obtained by the differentially quantized algorithm compared to its unquantized counterpart, and furthermore, the differentially quantized heavy ball method attains the optimal contraction achievable among all (even unquantized) gradient methods. Experimental results on least-squares problems validate our theoretical analysis.},

  abstract     = {A fundamental challenge in learning is the presence of nonlinear redundancies and dependencies in the data. To address this, we propose a Fourier-based approach to characterize feature redundancies, in unsupervised learning, and feature-label dependencies, in the supervised variant of the problem. We first develop a novel Fourier expansion for functions (more generally stochastic mappings) of correlated binary random variables. This is a generalization of the standard Fourier expansion on the Boolean cube beyond product probability spaces. As an important application of this analysis, we investigate learning with feature subset selection. In the unsupervised variant of this problem, we characterize feature redundancies via the Shannon entropy and group the features into sufficiently informative and redundant. Then, we make a connection to the proposed Fourier expansion and derive an upper bound on the joint entropy. Based on that, we propose a measure to quantify feature redundancies and present an unsupervised learning algorithm. We test our method on various real-world and synthetic datasets and demonstrate improvements on conventional unsupervised feature selection techniques. Then, we investigate the supervised feature subset selection and reformulate it in the Fourier domain. Bridging the Bayesian error rate with the Fourier coefficients, we demonstrate that the Fourier expansion provides a powerful tool to characterize nonlinear feature-label dependencies. Further, we introduce a computationally efficient measure for selecting relevant features. Via a theoretical analysis, we show that our proposed measure finds provably asymptotically optimal feature subsets. Lastly, we present an algorithm based on this measure and via numerical experiments demonstrate its improvements on various supervised feature selection algorithms.},

  abstract     = {We introduce a tunable loss function called $\alpha $ -loss, parameterized by $\alpha \in (0,\infty]$ , which interpolates between the exponential loss ( $\alpha = 1/2$ ), the log-loss ( $\alpha = 1$ ), and the 0–1 loss ( $\alpha = \infty $ ), for the machine learning setting of classification. Theoretically, we illustrate a fundamental connection between $\alpha $ -loss and Arimoto conditional entropy, verify the classification-calibration of $\alpha $ -loss in order to demonstrate asymptotic optimality via Rademacher complexity generalization techniques, and build-upon a notion called strictly local quasi-convexity in order to quantitatively characterize the optimization landscape of $\alpha $ -loss. Practically, we perform class imbalance, robustness, and classification experiments on benchmark image datasets using convolutional-neural-networks. Our main practical conclusion is that certain tasks may benefit from tuning $\alpha $ -loss away from log-loss ( $\alpha = 1$ ), and to this end we provide simple heuristics for the practitioner. In particular, navigating the $\alpha $ hyperparameter can readily provide superior model robustness to label flips ( $\alpha &amp;gt; 1$ ) and sensitivity to imbalanced classes ( $\alpha &amp;lt; 1$ ).},

Using a recently developed integral operator approach and a classical covariance inequality for Banach-valued strong mixing sequences, we succeed in deriving optimal learning rates of DKRR. As a byproduct, we deduce a sufficient condition for the mixing property to guarantee the optimal learning rates for kernel ridge regression, which fills the gap of learning rates between i.i.d. samples and strong mixing sequences. A series of numerical experiments are conducted to verify our theoretical assertions via showing excellent learning performance of DKRR in learning both toy and real world time series data. All these results extend the applicable range of distributed learning from i.i.d. samples to non-i.i.d. sequences.},

  abstract     = {In a breakthrough, Hastings showed that there exist quantum channels whose classical Holevo capacity is superadditive i.e. more classical information can be transmitted by quantum encoding strategies entangled across multiple channel uses as compared to unentangled quantum encoding strategies. Hastings’ proof used Haar random unitaries to exhibit superadditivity. In this paper we show that a unitary chosen uniformly at random from an approximate $n^{2/3}$ -design gives rise to a quantum channel with superadditive classical Holevo capacity, where $n$ is the dimension of the unitary exhibiting the Stinespring dilation of the channel superoperator. We follow the geometric functional analytic approach of Aubrun, Szarek and Werner in order to prove our result. More precisely we prove a sharp Dvoretzky-like theorem stating that, with high probability under the choice of a unitary from an approximate $t$ -design, random subspaces of large dimension make a Lipschitz function take almost constant value. Such theorems were known earlier only for Haar random unitaries. We obtain our result by appealing to Low’s technique for proving concentration of measure for an approximate $t$ -design, combined with a stratified analysis of the variational behaviour of Lipschitz functions on the unit sphere in high dimension. The stratified analysis is the main technical advance of this work. Haar random unitaries require at least $\Omega (n^{2})$ random bits in order to describe them with good precision. In contrast, there exist exact $n^{2/3}$ -designs using only $O(n^{2/3} \log n)$ random bits. Thus, our work can be viewed as a partial derandomisation of Hastings’ result, and a step towards the quest of finding an explicit quantum channel with superadditive classical Holevo capacity. Finally we also show that for any $p &amp;gt; 1$ , approximate unitary $n^{1.7}$ -designs give rise to channels violating subadditivity of Rényi $p$ -entropy. In addition to stratified analysis, the proof of this result uses a new technique of approximating a monotonic differentiable function defined on a closed bounded interval and its derivative by moderate degree polynomials which should be of independent interest.},

We first analyze the case where the source alphabet and the channel-input alphabet have the same size. We show that a trivial coding strategy is optimal and a closed form expression for the age can be derived. We then analyze the case where the alphabets have different sizes.

The relay is assumed to derive the output signal by applying a Relay Transform Matrix (RTM) applied to the input signal. Assuming perfect channel state information about the channel at the relay and iid transmitted symbols, the RTM is optimized according to two different criteria: i) MIMO information rate; ii) information rate based on Orthogonal Space–Time Block Codes. The two assumptions have been addressed in part in the literature. The optimization problem is reduced to a manageable convex form, whose KKT equations are explicitly solved. Then, a parametric solution is given, which yields the power constraint and the information rate achieved with uncorrelated transmitted symbols as functions of a positive indeterminate. The solution for a given average power constraint at the relay is amenable to a water-filling-like algorithm, and extends earlier literature results addressing the case without the direct link. The duty cycle of the two-hop relaying process is also addressed in the general form of the achievable rate. Simulation results are reported, which are relevant to a Rayleigh fading MIMO relay channel and the role of the direct link SNR is precisely assessed. Duty cycle optimization is also considered by a numerical example.},

However, an exact characterization of the capacity-achieving input distribution for channels with multi-bit phase quantization has not been provided. In this paper, we consider four different channel models with multi-bit phase quantization at the output and identify the optimal input distribution for each channel model. We first consider a complex Gaussian channel with $b$ -bit phase-quantized output and prove that the capacity-achieving distribution is a rotated $2^{b}$ -phase shift keying (PSK). The analysis is then extended to multiple fading scenarios. We show that the optimality of rotated $2^{b}$ -PSK continues to hold under noncoherent fast fading Rician channels with $b$ -bit phase quantization when line-of-sight (LoS) is present. When channel state information (CSI) is available at the receiver, we identify $\frac {2\pi }{2^{b}}$ -symmetry and constant amplitude as the necessary and sufficient conditions for the ergodic capacity-achieving input distribution; which a $2^{b}$ -PSK satisfies. Finally, an optimum power control scheme is presented which achieves ergodic capacity when CSI is also available at the transmitter.},

Nearest neighbor decoding remains a convenient and yet mismatched solution for general channels, and the key message of this paper is that the performance of nearest neighbor decoding can be improved by generalizing its decoding metric to incorporate channel state dependent output processing and codeword scaling. Using generalized mutual information, which is a lower bound to the mismatched capacity under independent and identically distributed codebook ensemble, as the performance measure, this paper establishes the optimal generalized nearest neighbor decoding rule, under Gaussian channel input. Several restricted forms of the generalized nearest neighbor decoding rule are also derived and compared with existing solutions. The results are illustrated through several case studies for fading channels with imperfect receiver channel state information and for channels with quantization effects.},

  abstract     = {Live communication is ubiquitous, and frequently must contend with reliability issues due to packet loss during transmission. The effect of packet losses can be alleviated by using erasure codes, which aid in recovering lost packets. Streaming codes are a class of codes designed for the live communication setting, which encode a stream of message packets arriving sequentially for transmission over a packet-loss channel. The existing study of streaming codes considers settings where the sizes of the message packets to be transmitted are all fixed. However, message packets occur with unpredictable and variable sizes in many applications, such as videoconferencing. In this paper, we present a generalized model for streaming codes that incorporates message packets of variable sizes. We show that the variability in the sizes of message packets induces a new trade-off between the rate and the decoding delay under lossless transmission. Moreover, the variability in the sizes of message packets impacts the optimal rate of transmission. To address this, we introduce algorithms to compute upper and lower bounds on the optimal rate for any given sequence of sizes of message packets. We then design an explicit streaming code for the proposed model. We empirically evaluate the code construction over a live video trace for several representative parameter settings, and show that the rate of the construction is approximately 90\% of an upper bound and 5\%–48\% higher than naively using the existing streaming codes.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a unifying framework to construct low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes with associated Tanner graphs of desired girth. Towards this goal, we highlight the role that a certain square matrix that appears in the product of the parity-check matrix with its transpose has in the construction of codes with graphs of desired girth and further explore it in order to generate the set of necessary and sufficient conditions for a Tanner graph to have a given girth between 6 and 12. For each such girth, we present algorithms to construct codes of the desired girth and we show how to use them to compute the minimum necessary value of the lifting factor. For girth larger than 12, we show how to use multi-step graph lifting methods to deterministically modify codes in order to increase their girth. We also give a new perspective on LDPC protograph-based parity-check matrices by viewing them as rows of a parity-check matrix equal to the sum of certain permutation matrices and obtain an important connection between all protographs and those with variable nodes of degree 2. We also show that the results and methodology that we develop for the all-one protograph can be used and adapted to analyze the girth of the Tanner graph of any parity-check matrix and demonstrate how this can be done using a well-known irregular, multi-edge protograph specified by the NASA Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS). Throughout the paper, we exemplify our theoretical results with constructions of LDPC codes with Tanner graphs of any girth between 6 and 14 and give sufficient conditions for a multi-step lifted parity-check matrix to have girth between 14 and 22.},

  abstract     = {This work identifies information-theoretic quantities that are closely related to the required list size on average for successive cancellation list (SCL) decoding to implement maximum-likelihood decoding over general binary memoryless symmetric (BMS) channels. It also provides upper and lower bounds for these quantities that can be computed efficiently for very long codes. For the binary erasure channel (BEC), we provide a simple method to estimate the mean accurately via density evolution. The analysis shows how to modify, e.g., Reed-Muller codes, to improve the performance when practical list sizes, e.g., $L\in {[{8, 1024}]}$ , are adopted. Exemplary constructions with block lengths $N\in {128,512}$ outperform polar codes of 5G over the binary-input additive white Gaussian noise channel. It is further shown that there is a concentration around the mean of the logarithm of the required list size for sufficiently large block lengths, over discrete-output BMS channels. We provide the probability mass functions (p.m.f.s) of this logarithm, over the BEC, for a sequence of the modified RM codes with an increasing block length via simulations, which illustrate that the p.m.f.s concentrate around the estimated mean.},

  abstract     = {Constrained codes are used to prevent errors from occurring in various data storage and data transmission systems. They can help in increasing the storage density of magnetic storage devices, in managing the lifetime of solid-state storage devices, and in increasing the reliability of data transmission over wires. Over the years, designing practical (complexity-wise) capacity-achieving constrained codes has been an area of research gaining significant interest. We recently designed various constrained codes based on lexicographic indexing. We introduced binary symmetric lexicographically-ordered constrained (S-LOCO) codes, $q$ -ary asymmetric LOCO (QA-LOCO) codes, and a class of two-dimensional LOCO (TD-LOCO) codes. These families of codes achieve capacity with simple encoding and decoding, and they are easy to reconfigure. We demonstrated that these codes can contribute to notable density and lifetime gains in magnetic recording (MR) and Flash systems, and they find application in other systems too. In this paper, we generalize our work on LOCO codes by presenting a systematic method that guides the code designer to build any constrained code based on lexicographic indexing once the finite set of data patterns to forbid is known. In particular, we connect the set of forbidden patterns directly to the cardinality of the LOCO code and most importantly to the rule that uncovers the index associated with a LOCO codeword. By doing that, we reveal the secret arithmetic of patterns, and make the design of such constrained codes significantly easier. We give examples illustrating the method via codes based on lexicographic indexing from the literature. We then design optimal (rate-wise) constrained codes for the new two-dimensional magnetic recording (TDMR) technology. Over a practical TDMR model, we show notable performance gains as a result of solely applying the new codes. Moreover, we show how near-optimal constrained codes for TDMR can be designed and used to further reduce complexity and error propagation. All the newly introduced LOCO codes are designed using the proposed general method, and they inherit all the desirable properties in our previously designed LOCO codes.},

  abstract     = {In the coded caching problem, as originally formulated by Maddah-Ali and Niesen, a server communicates via a noiseless shared broadcast link to multiple users that have local storage capability. In order for a user to decode its demanded file from the coded multicast transmission, the demands of all the users must be globally known, which may violate the privacy of the users. To overcome this privacy problem, Wan and Caire recently proposed several schemes that attain coded multicasting gain while simultaneously guarantee information theoretic privacy of the users’ demands. In Device-to-Device (D2D) networks, the demand privacy problem is further exacerbated by the fact that each user is also a transmitter, which appears to be needing the knowledge of the files demanded by the remaining users in order to form its coded multicast transmission. This paper shows how to solve this seemingly infeasible problem. The main contribution of this paper is the development of new achievable and converse bounds for D2D coded caching that are to within a constant factor of one another when privacy of the users’ demands must be guaranteed even in the presence of colluding users (i.e., when some users share cached contents and demanded file indices). First, a D2D private caching scheme is proposed, whose key feature is the addition of virtual users in the system in order to “hide” the demands of the real users. By comparing the achievable D2D private load with an existing converse bound for the shared-link model without demand privacy constraint, the proposed scheme is shown to be order optimal, except for the very low memory size regime with more files than users. Second, in order to shed light into the open parameter regime, a new achievable scheme and a new converse bound under the constraint of uncoded cache placement (i.e., when each user stores directly a subset of the bits of the library) are developed for the case of two users, and shown to be to within a constant factor of one another for all system parameters. Finally, the two-user converse bound is extended to any number of users by a cut-set type argument. With this new converse bound, the virtual users scheme is shown to be order optimal in all parameter regimes under the constraint of uncoded cache placement and user collusion.},

For a constant coverage depth $M/N$ and molecule length scaling $\Theta (\log M)$ , lower (achievability) and upper (converse) bounds on the capacity of the channel, as well as a lower (achievability) bound on the reliability function of the channel are provided. Both the lower and upper bounds on the capacity generalize a bound which was previously known to hold only for the binary symmetric sequencing channel, and only under certain restrictions on the molecule length scaling and the crossover probability parameters. When specified to binary symmetric sequencing channel, these restrictions are completely removed for the lower bound and are significantly relaxed for the upper bound in the high-noise regime. The lower bound on the reliability function is achieved under a universal decoder, and reveals that the dominant error event is that of outage – the event in which the capacity of the channel induced by the DNA molecule sampling operation does not support the target rate.},

  abstract     = {We propose a new method to compute the feedback capacity of unifilar finite state channels (FSCs) with memory using reinforcement learning (RL). The feedback capacity was previously estimated using its formulation as a Markov decision process (MDP) with dynamic programming (DP) algorithms. However, their computational complexity grows exponentially with the channel alphabet size. Therefore, we use RL, and specifically, its ability to parameterize value functions and policies with neural networks, to evaluate numerically the feedback capacity of channels with a large alphabet size. The outcome of the RL algorithm is a numerical lower bound on the feedback capacity, which is used to reveal the structure of the optimal solution. The structure is modeled by a graph-based auxiliary random variable that is utilized to derive an analytic upper bound on the feedback capacity with the duality bound. The capacity computation is concluded by verifying the tightness of the upper bound by testing whether it is Bahl-Cocke-Jelinek-Raviv (BCJR) invariant. We demonstrate this method on the Ising channel with an arbitrary alphabet size. For an alphabet size smaller than or equal to 8, we derive the analytic solution of the capacity. Next, the structure of the numerical solution is used to deduce a simple coding scheme that achieves the feedback capacity and serves as a lower bound for larger alphabets. For an alphabet size greater than 8, we present an upper bound on the feedback capacity. For an asymptotically large alphabet size, we present an asymptotic optimal coding scheme.},

Concretely, we assume that the parameter space is a smooth manifold, and by using tools of Riemannian geometry, we derive a sharper expression than the standard one given by the stochastic complexity, where the scalar curvature of the Fisher information metric plays a dominant role. Furthermore, we compute a sharper approximation to the capacity for exponential families and apply our results to derive optimal dimensional reduction in the context of principal component analysis.},

Measurements of such sensor systems are characterized by multivariate binary distributions and assessing sensitivity via the Cramér-Rao lower bound turns out to be intractable. In this context, the Fisher matrix of the exponential family and a lower bound for arbitrary probabilistic models are discussed. The conservative approximation for Fisher’s information matrix rests on a surrogate exponential family distribution connected to the actual data-generating system by two compact equivalences. Without characterizing the likelihood and its support, this probabilistic notion enables designing estimators that consistently achieve the sensitivity level defined by the inverse of the conservative information matrix. For hard-limited multivariate Gaussian signal models, a quadratic exponential surrogate distribution tames statistical complexity such that a quantitative and conservative assessment of Fisher information becomes possible. This result is exploited for the Fisherian quantization loss analysis of an array with low-complexity binary sensors in comparison to an ideal system featuring infinite amplitude resolution. Additionally, data-driven assessment by estimating a conservative approximation for the Fisher matrix under recursive binary sampling as implemented in ΣΔ-modulating analog-to-digital converters is demonstrated.},

The focus is on the correspondence between the non-rigorous replica analysis of statistical mechanics and the performance assessment of VAMP in the model-mismatched setting. The correspondence of this kind is well-known when the measurement matrix has independent and identically distributed entries. However, when the measurement matrix follows a general rotation-invariant matrix ensemble, the correspondence has been validated only under limited cases, such as the Bayes optimal inference or the convex empirical risk minimization. The result presented in this paper is to extend the scope of such correspondence. Herein, we heuristically derive the explicit formula of state-evolution equations, which macroscopically describe VAMP dynamics for the current model-mismatched case, and show that their fixed point is generally consistent with the replica symmetric solution obtained by the replica method of statistical mechanics. We also show that the fixed point of VAMP can exhibit a microscopic instability, which indicates that message variables continue to move by VAMP while their macroscopically summarized quantities converge to fixed values. The critical condition the for microscopic instability agrees with that for breaking the replica symmetry that is derived within the non-rigorous replica analysis.

An important example is the calculation of the first derivative of continuously differentiable functions. This paper precisely classifies the non-computability of the first derivative, and of the maximum-norm of the first derivative in the Zheng-Weihrauch hierarchy. Based on this classification, the paper investigates whether it is possible that a Turing machine detects this non-computability of the first derivative by observing the data of the problem, and whether it is possible to detect upper bounds for the peak value of the first derivative of continuously differentiable functions. So from a practical point of view, the question is whether it is possible to implement an exit-flag functionality for observing non-computability of the first derivative. This paper even studies two different types of exit-flag functionality. A strong one, where the Turing machine always has to stop, and a weak one, where the Turing machine stops if and only if the input lies within the corresponding set of interest. It will be shown that non-computability of the first derivative is not detectable by a Turing machine for two concrete examples, namely for the problem of computing the input–output behavior of simple analog circuits and for solutions of the three-dimensional wave equation. In addition, it is shown that it is even impossible to detect an upper bound for the maximum norm of the first derivative. In particular, it is shown that all three problems are not even semidecidable. Finally, we briefly discuss implications of these results for analog and quantum computing.},

This paper continues to study the linear complexity over $\mathbb {F}_{M}$ of $M$ -ary Sidelnikov sequence of period $q-1$ using Hasse derivative, which implies $q=p^{m}$ , $m\geq 1$ and $M|(q-1)$ . The $t$ th Hasse derivative formulas are presented in terms of cyclotomic numbers, and some upper bounds on the linear complexity for $M=2$ and 3 are obtained only with some additional restrictions on $q$ . Furthermore, concrete illustrations for several families of these sequences, such as $q\equiv 1\pmod {2}$ and $q\equiv 1\pmod {3}$ , show these upper bounds are tight and reachable; especially for $q=2\times 3^{\lambda }+1 (1\leq \lambda \leq 20)$ , the exact linear complexities over $\mathbb {F}_{3}$ of the ternary Sidelnikov sequences are determined; and it turns out that all the linear complexities of the sequences considered are very close to their periods.},

While mathematically tractable, a network based on the regulation Poisson point process model offers challenges vis-a-vis network efficiency. Strongly correlated alternatives, such as networks based on random matrix spectra (the Ginibre network), on the other hand offer formidable challenges in terms of tractability and robustness issues. In this work, we demonstrate that network models based on random perturbations of Euclidean lattices interpolate between Poisson and rigidly structured networks, and allow us to achieve the best of both worlds : significantly improve upon the Poisson model in terms of network efficacy measured by the Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (abbrv. SINR) and the related concept of coverage probabilities , at the same time retaining a considerable measure of mathematical and computational simplicity and robustness to erasure and noise. We investigate the optimal choice of the base lattice in this model, connecting it to the celebrated problem optimality of Euclidean lattices with respect to the Epstein Zeta function, which is in turn related to notions of lattice energy. This leads us to the choice of the triangular lattice in 2D and face centered cubic lattice in 3D, whose Gaussian perturbations we consider. We provide theoretical analysis and empirical investigations to demonstrate that the coverage probability decreases with increasing strength of perturbation, eventually converging to that of the Poisson network. In the regime of low disorder, our studies suggest an approximate statistical behaviour of the coverage function near a base station as a log-normal distribution with parameters depending on the Epstein Zeta function of the lattice, and related approximate dependencies for a power-law constant that governs the network coverage probability at large thresholds. In 2D, we determine the disorder strength at which the perturbed triangular lattice (abbrv. PTL) and the Ginibre networks are the closest measured by comparing their network topologies via a comparison of their Persistence Diagrams in the total variation as well as the symmetrized nearest neighbour distances. We demonstrate that, at this very same disorder, the PTL and the Ginibre networks exhibit very similar coverage probability distributions, with the PTL performing at least as well as the Ginibre. Thus, the PTL network at this disorder strength can be taken to be an effective substitute for the Ginibre network model, while at the same time offering the advantages of greater tractability both from theoretical and empirical perspectives.},

  abstract     = {Distributed computing has become one of the most important frameworks in dealing with large computation tasks. In this paper, we propose a systematic construction of coded computing schemes for MapReduce-type distributed systems. The construction builds upon placement delivery arrays (PDA), originally proposed by Yan et al. for coded caching schemes. The main contributions of our work are three-fold. First, we identify a class of PDAs, called Comp-PDAs , and show how to obtain a coded computing scheme from any Comp-PDA. We also characterize the normalized number of stored files ( storage load ), computed intermediate values ( computation load ), and communicated bits ( communication load ), of the obtained schemes in terms of the Comp-PDA parameters. Then, we show that the performance achieved by Comp-PDAs describing Maddah-Ali and Niesen’s coded caching schemes matches a new information-theoretic converse, thus establishing the fundamental region of all achievable performance triples. In particular, we characterize all the Comp-PDAs achieving the pareto-optimal storage, computation, and communication (SCC) loads of the fundamental region. Finally, we investigate the file complexity of the proposed schemes, i.e., the smallest number of files required for implementation. In particular, we describe Comp-PDAs that achieve pareto-optimal SCC triples with significantly lower file complexity than the originally proposed Comp-PDAs.},

  abstract     = {We extend the classical problem of privacy amplification to a setting where the active adversary, Eve, is also allowed to fully corrupt the internal memory (which includes the shared randomness, and local randomness tape) of one of the honest parties, Alice and Bob, before the execution of the protocol. We require that either one of Alice or Bob detects tampering, or they agree on a shared key that is indistinguishable from the uniform distribution to Eve. We obtain the following results: 1) we give a privacy amplification protocol via low-error non-malleable two-source extractors with one source having low min-entropy. In particular, this implies the existence of such (non-efficient) protocols; 2) we show that even slight improvements to the state-of-the-art explicit non-malleable two-source extractors would lead to explicit low-error, low min-entropy two-source extractors, thereby resolving a long-standing open question. This suggests that obtaining (information-theoretically secure) explicit non-malleable two-source extractors for (1) might be hard; 3) we present explicit constructions of low-error, low min-entropy non-malleable two-source extractors in the CRS model of (Garg, Kalai, Khurana, Eurocrypt 2020), assuming either the quasi-polynomial hardness of DDH or the existence of nearly-optimal collision-resistant hash functions; 4) we instantiate our privacy amplification protocol with the above mentioned non-malleable two-source extractors in the CRS model, leading to explicit, computationally-secure protocols. This is not immediate from (1) because in the computational setting we need to make sure that, in particular, all randomness sources remain samplable throughout the proof. This requires upgrading the assumption of quasi-polynomial hardness of DDH to sub-exponential hardness of DDH.We emphasize that each of the first three results can be read independently.},

  abstract     = {We consider the problem of covert communication over a state-dependent channel when the Channel State Information (CSI) is available either non-causally, causally, or strictly causally, either at the transmitter alone, or at both transmitter and receiver. Covert communication with respect to an adversary, called “warden,” is one in which, despite communication over the channel, the warden’s observation remains indistinguishable from an output induced by innocent channel-input symbols. Covert communication involves fooling an adversary in part by a proliferation of codebooks; for reliable decoding at the legitimate receiver, the codebook uncertainty is typically removed via a shared secret key that is unavailable to the warden. In contrast to previous work, we do not assume the availability of a large shared key at the transmitter and legitimate receiver. Instead, we only require a secret key with negligible rate to bootstrap the communication and our scheme extracts shared randomness from the CSI in a manner that keeps it secret from the warden, despite the influence of the CSI on the warden’s output. When CSI is available at the transmitter and receiver, we derive the covert capacity region. When CSI is only available at the transmitter, we derive inner and outer bounds on the covert capacity. We also provide examples for which the covert capacity is positive with knowledge of CSI but is zero without it.},

  abstract     = {Motivated by recent interest in federated submodel learning, this work explores the fundamental problem of privately reading from and writing to a database comprised of $K$ files (submodels) that are stored across $N$ distributed servers according to an $X$ -secure threshold secret sharing scheme. One after another, various users wish to retrieve their desired file, locally process the information and then update the file in the distributed database while keeping the identity of their desired file private from any set of up to $T$ colluding servers. The availability of servers changes over time, so elastic dropout resilience is required. The main contribution of this work is an adaptive scheme, called ACSA-RW, that takes advantage of all currently available servers to reduce its communication costs, fully updates the database after each write operation even though the database is only partially accessible due to server dropouts, and ensures a memoryless operation of the network in the sense that the storage structure is preserved and future users may remain oblivious of the past history of server dropouts. The ACSA-RW construction builds upon cross-subspace alignment (CSA) codes that were originally introduced for $X$ -secure $T$ -private information retrieval and have been shown to be natural solutions for secure distributed batch matrix multiplication problems. ACSA-RW achieves the desired private read and write functionality with elastic dropout resilience, matches the best results for private-read from PIR literature, improves significantly upon available baselines for private-write, reveals a striking symmetry between upload and download costs, and exploits storage redundancy to accommodate arbitrary read and write dropout servers up to certain threshold values. It also answers in the affirmative an open question by Kairouz et al. for the case of partially colluding servers (i.e., tolerating collusion up to a threshold) by exploiting synergistic gains from the joint design of private read and write operations.},

We focus on the Gaussian model where the two graphs are complete graphs with correlated Gaussian weights and the Erdős-Rényi model where the two graphs are subsampled from a common parent Erdős-Rényi graph ${\mathcal {G}}(n,p)$ . For dense Erdős-Rényi graphs with $p=n^{-o(1)}$ , we prove that there exists a sharp threshold, above which one can correctly match all but a vanishing fraction of vertices and below which correctly matching any positive fraction is impossible, a phenomenon known as the “all-or-nothing” phase transition. Even more strikingly, in the Gaussian setting, above the threshold all vertices can be exactly matched with high probability. In contrast, for sparse Erdős-Rényi graphs with $p=n^{-\Theta (1)}$ , we show that the all-or-nothing phenomenon no longer holds and we determine the thresholds up to a constant factor. Along the way, we also derive the sharp threshold for exact recovery, sharpening the existing results in Erdős-Rényi graphs. The proof of the negative results builds upon a tight characterization of the mutual information based on the truncated second-moment computation and an “area theorem” that relates the mutual information to the integral of the reconstruction error. The positive results follows from a tight analysis of the maximum likelihood estimator that takes into account the cycle structure of the induced permutation on the edges.},

This result matches the minimax lower bound of the problem, and even the leading constant is sharp. The analysis of the SDP is based on an equivalent non-convex programming whose solution can be characterized as a fixed point of the generalized power iteration lifted to a higher dimensional space. This viewpoint unifies the proofs of the statistical optimality of three different methods: MLE, SDP, and generalized power method. The technique is also applied to the analysis of the SDP for $\mathbb {Z}_{2}$ synchronization, and we achieve the minimax optimal error $\exp \left ({-(1-o(1))\frac {np}{2\sigma ^{2}}}\right)$ with a sharp constant in the exponent.},

In previous information-geometric studies, the $q$ -exponential family was analyzed using classical convex duality and Bregman divergence. In this paper, we show that a generalized $\lambda $ -duality, where $\lambda = 1 - q$ is to be interpreted as the constant information-geometric curvature, leads to a generalized exponential family which is essentially equivalent to the $q$ -exponential family and has deep connections with Rényi entropy and optimal transport. Using this generalized convex duality and its associated logarithmic divergence, we show that our $\lambda $ -exponential family satisfies properties that parallel and generalize those of the exponential family. Under our framework, the Rényi entropy and divergence arise naturally, and we give a new proof of the Tsallis/Rényi entropy maximizing property of the $q$ -exponential family. We also introduce a $\lambda $ -mixture family which may be regarded as the dual of the $\lambda $ -exponential family, and connect it with other mixture-type families. Finally, we discuss a duality between the $\lambda $ -exponential family and the $\lambda $ -logarithmic divergence, and study its statistical consequences.},

It was shown that such systems behave like convex systems under various restricted settings, such as for two-layer neural networks, and when learning is only restricted locally in the so-called neural tangent kernel space around specialized initializations. However, there is a lack of powerful theoretical techniques that can analyze fully trained deep neural networks under general conditions. This paper considers this fundamental problem by investigating such overparameterized deep neural networks when fully trained. Specifically, we characterize a deep neural network by its features’ distributions and propose a metric to intuitively measure the usefulness of feature representations. Under certain regularizers that bounds the metric, we show deep neural networks can be reformulated as a convex optimization and the system can guarantee effective feature representations in terms of the metric. Our new analysis is more consistent with empirical observations that deep neural networks are capable of learning efficient feature representations. Empirical studies confirm that predictions of our theory are consistent with results observed in practice.},

First, when the behavior policy is known, we show that the Switch estimator, a method that alternates between the plug-in and importance sampling estimators, is minimax rate-optimal for all sample sizes. Second, when the behavior policy is unknown, we analyze performance in terms of the competitive ratio, thereby revealing a fundamental gap between the settings of known and unknown behavior policies. When the behavior policy is unknown, any estimator must have mean-squared error larger—relative to the oracle estimator equipped with the knowledge of the behavior policy— by a multiplicative factor proportional to the support size of the target policy. Moreover, we demonstrate that the plug-in approach achieves this worst-case competitive ratio up to a logarithmic factor. Third, we initiate the study of the partial knowledge setting in which it is assumed that the minimum probability taken by the behavior policy is known. We show that the plug-in estimator is optimal for relatively large values of the minimum probability, but is sub-optimal when the minimum probability is low. In order to remedy this gap, we propose a new estimator based on approximation by Chebyshev polynomials that provably achieves the optimal estimation error.

This approach is then applied to study both hinge-like losses and proper scoring rules. In the first case, we derive new hinge-like convex losses, which are tighter extensions outside the probability simplex than related hinge-like losses and geometrically simpler with fewer non-differentiable edges. We also establish a classification regret bound in general for all losses with the same generalized entropy as the zero-one loss, thereby substantially extending and improving existing results. In the second case, we identify new sets of multi-class proper scoring rules through different types of dissimilarity functions and reveal interesting relationships between various composite losses currently in use. We also establish new classification regret bounds in general for multi-class proper scoring rules and, as applications, provide simple meaningful regret bounds for two specific sets of proper scoring rules.

  abstract     = {In high-dimensional sparse regression, would increasing the signal-to-noise ratio while fixing the sparsity level always lead to better model selection? For high-dimensional sparse regression problems, surprisingly, in this paper we answer this question in the negative in the regime of linear sparsity for the Lasso method, relying on a new concept we term effect size heterogeneity . Roughly speaking, a regression coefficient vector has high effect size heterogeneity if its nonzero entries have significantly different magnitudes. From the viewpoint of this new measure, we prove that the false and true positive rates achieve the optimal trade-off uniformly along the Lasso path when this measure is maximal in a certain sense, and the worst trade-off is achieved when it is minimal in the sense that all nonzero effect sizes are roughly equal. Moreover, we demonstrate that the first false selection occurs much earlier when effect size heterogeneity is minimal than when it is maximal. The underlying cause of these two phenomena is, metaphorically speaking, the “competition” among variables with effect sizes of the same magnitude in entering the model. Taken together, our findings suggest that effect size heterogeneity shall serve as an important complementary measure to the sparsity of regression coefficients in the analysis of high-dimensional regression problems. Our proofs use techniques from approximate message passing theory as well as a novel technique for estimating the rank of the first false variable.},

  abstract     = {Traditional multi-armed bandit (MAB) formulations usually make certain assumptions about the underlying arms’ distributions, such as bounds on the support or their tail behaviour. Moreover, such parametric information is usually ‘baked’ into the algorithms. In this paper, we show that specialized algorithms that exploit such parametric information are prone to inconsistent learning performance when the parameter is misspecified. Our key contributions are twofold: (i) We establish fundamental performance limits of statistically robust MAB algorithms under the fixed-budget pure exploration setting, and (ii) We propose two classes of algorithms that are asymptotically near-optimal. Additionally, we consider a risk-aware criterion for best arm identification, where the objective associated with each arm is a linear combination of the mean and the conditional value at risk (CVaR). Throughout, we make a very mild ‘bounded moment’ assumption, which lets us work with both light-tailed and heavy-tailed distributions within a unified framework.},

  abstract     = {While quantum weight enumerators establish some of the best upper bounds on the minimum distance of quantum error-correcting codes, these bounds are not optimized to quantify the performance of quantum codes under the effect of arbitrary quantum channels that describe bespoke noise models. Herein, for any Kraus decomposition of any given quantum channel, we introduce corresponding quantum weight enumerators that naturally generalize the Shor-Laflamme quantum weight enumerators. We establish an indirect linear relationship between these generalized quantum weight enumerators by introducing an auxiliary exact weight enumerator that completely quantifies the quantum code’s projector, and is independent of the underlying noise process. By additionally working within the framework of approximate quantum error correction, we establish a general framework for constructing a linear program that is infeasible whenever approximate quantum error correcting codes with corresponding parameters do not exist. Our linear programming framework allows us to establish the non-existence of certain quantum codes that approximately correct amplitude damping errors, and obtain non-trivial upper bounds on the maximum dimension of a broad family of permutation-invariant quantum codes.},

To fill this knowledge gap, here we devise an efficient quantum differentially private (QDP) Lasso estimator to solve sparse regression tasks. Concretely, given $N~d$ -dimensional data points with $N\ll d$ , we first prove that the optimal classical and quantum non-private Lasso requires $\Omega (N+d)$ and $\Omega (\sqrt {N}+\sqrt {d})$ runtime, respectively. We next prove that the runtime cost of QDP Lasso is dimension independent , i.e., $O(N^{5/2})$ , which implies that the QDP Lasso can be faster than both the optimal classical and quantum non-private Lasso. Last, we exhibit that the QDP Lasso attains a near-optimal utility bound $\tilde {O}(N^{-2/3})$ with privacy guarantees and discuss the chance to realize it on near-term quantum chips with advantages.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a general framework is formalised to characterise the value of information (VoI) in hidden Markov models. Specifically, the VoI is defined as the mutual information between the current, unobserved status at the source and a sequence of observed measurements at the receiver, which can be interpreted as the reduction in the uncertainty of the current status given that we have noisy past observations of a hidden Markov process. We explore the VoI in the context of the noisy Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and derive its closed-form expressions. Moreover, we investigate the effect of different sampling policies on VoI, deriving simplified expressions in different noise regimes and analysing statistical properties of the VoI in the worst case. We also study the optimal sampling policy to maximise the average information value under the sampling rate constraint. In simulations, the validity of theoretical results is verified, and the performance of VoI in Markov and hidden Markov models is also analysed. Numerical results further illustrate that the proposed VoI framework can support timely transmission in status update systems, and it can also capture the correlation properties of the underlying random process and the noise in the transmission environment.},

We assume that perfect channel state information (CSI) is available at the transmitter before each transmission, and the transmitter is able to utilize the CSI to precode the updates. Our object is to design optimal precoding schemes to minimize the summed average age of information (AoI) at the recipients. Under various assumptions on the size of each update $B$ , the number of transmit antennas $M$ , and the number of receive antennas $N$ at each user, this paper identifies the corresponding age-optimal precoding and transmission scheduling strategies. Specifically, for the case when $N=1$ , a round-robin based updating scheme is shown to be optimal. For the two-user systems with $N&amp;gt;B$ or $M\notin [N:2N]$ , framed updating schemes are proven to be optimal. For other cases in the two-user systems, a framed alternating updating scheme is proven to be 2-optimal.},

  abstract     = {The problem of repairing linear codes and, in particular, Reed Solomon (RS) codes has attracted a lot of attention in recent years due to their extreme importance to distributed storage systems. In this problem, a failed code symbol (node) needs to be repaired by downloading as little information as possible from a subset of the remaining nodes. By now, there are examples of RS codes that have efficient repair schemes, and some even attain the cut-set bound. However, these schemes fall short in several aspects; they require a considerable field extension degree. They do not provide any nontrivial repair scheme over prime fields. Lastly, they are all linear repairs, i.e., the computed functions are linear over the base field. Motivated by these and by a question raised by Guruswami and Wootters, 2017, on the power of nonlinear repair schemes, we study the problem of nonlinear repair schemes of RS codes. Our main results are the first nonlinear repair scheme of RS codes with asymptotically optimal repair bandwidth (asymptotically matching the cut-set bound). This is the first example of a nonlinear repair scheme of any code and also the first example that a nonlinear repair scheme can outperform all linear ones. Lastly, we show that the cut-set bound for RS codes is not tight over prime fields by proving a tighter bound, using additive combinatorics ideas.},

In this paper, we investigate a generic method to generalize binary codes to $q$ -ary ones for $q &amp;gt; 2$ , and analyze this generalization on the two constructions given by Levenshtein (also by Gilbert; Chee, Kiah, Purkayastha, and Wang) and Bilotta, respectively. The generalization on the former construction gives large non-expandable fixed-length non-overlapping codes whose size can be explicitly determined; the generalization on the latter construction is the first attempt to generate $q$ -ary variable-length non-overlapping codes. More importantly, this generic method allows us to utilize the generating function approach to analyze the cardinality of the underlying $q$ -ary non-overlapping codes. The generating function approach not only enables us to derive new results, e.g., recurrence relations on their cardinalities, new combinatorial interpretations for the constructions, and the superior limit of their cardinalities for some special cases, but also greatly simplifies the arguments for these results. Furthermore, we give an exact formula for the number of fixed-length words that do not contain the codewords in a variable-length non-overlapping code as subwords. This thereby solves an open problem by Bilotta and induces a recursive upper bound on the maximum size of variable-length non-overlapping codes.},

The multiple layer approach allows for a hierarchical scheme where each layer of the code provides for a different locality.

Properties of the multiple layer EII codes, like their minimum distance and dimension, as well as their erasure decoding algorithms, parity-check matrices and performance analysis, are provided and illustrated with examples.

  abstract     = {We consider finite-state channels (FSCs) where the channel state is stochastically dependent on the previous channel output. We refer to these as Noisy Output is the STate (NOST) channels. We derive the feedback capacity of NOST channels in two scenarios: with and without causal state information (CSI) available at the encoder. If CSI is unavailable, the feedback capacity is $C_{\text {FB}}= \max _{P(x|y&#39;)} I(X;Y|Y&#39;)$ , while if it is available at the encoder, the feedback capacity is $C_{\text {FB-CSI}}= \max _{P(u|y&#39;),x(u,s&#39;)} I(U;Y|Y&#39;)$ , where $U$ is an auxiliary RV with finite cardinality. In both formulas, the output process is a Markov process with stationary distribution. The derived formulas generalize special known instances from the literature, such as where the state is i.i.d. and where it is a deterministic function of the output. $C_{\text {FB}}$ and $C_{\text {FB-CSI}}$ are also shown to be computable via convex optimization problem formulations. Finally, we present an example of an interesting NOST channel for which CSI available at the encoder does not increase the feedback capacity.},

This upper bound is proved using traditional weak converse techniques involving mutual information inequalities and Gallager-type explicit identification of auxiliary random variables. We show that the new upper bound is strictly tighter than all previous bounds for the Gaussian relay channel with non-zero channel gains. When specialized to the relay channel with orthogonal receiver components, the bound resolves a conjecture by Kim on a class of deterministic relay channels. When further specialized to the class of product-form relay channels with orthogonal receiver components, the bound resolves a generalized version of Cover’s relay channel problem, recovers the recent upper bound for the Gaussian case by Wu et al. , and improves upon the recent bounds for the binary symmetric case by Wu et al. and Barnes et al. , which were obtained using non-traditional geometric proof techniques. For the special class of a relay channel with orthogonal receiver components, we develop another upper bound on the capacity which utilizes an auxiliary receiver and show that it is strictly tighter than the bound by Tandon and Ulukus. Finally, we show through the Gaussian relay channel with i.i.d. relay output sequence that the bound with the auxiliary receiver can be strictly tighter than our main bound.},

Bounding $A(b,k,n)$ is a problem of relevant interest in information theory and computer science, relating to the zero-error capacity with list decoding and to the study of $(b, k)$ -hash families of functions. It is known that, for fixed $b$ and $k$ , $A(b,k,n)$ grows exponentially in $n$ . In this paper, we determine new exponential upper bounds for different values of $b$ and $k$ . A first bound on $A(b,k,n)$ for general $b$ and $k$ was derived by Fredman and Komlós in the ’80s and improved for certain $b\neq k$ by Körner and Marton and by Arikan. Only very recently better bounds were derived for general $b$ and $k$ by Guruswami and Riazanov, while stronger results for small values of $b=k$ were obtained by Arikan, by Dalai, Guruswami and Radhakrishnan, and by Costa and Dalai. In this paper, we strengthen the bounds for some specific values of $b$ and $k$ . Our contribution is a new computational method for obtaining upper bounds on the values of a quadratic form defined over discrete probability distributions in arbitrary dimensions, which emerged as a central ingredient in recent works. The proposed method reduces an infinite-dimensional problem to a finite one, which we manage to further simplify by means of a series of optimality conditions.},

The performance criterion that we consider is the achievable resolution, which is defined as the maximal $L_\infty $ norm between the location vector and its estimated version where the maximization is over all target location vectors. The fundamental resolution limit is defined as the minimal achievable resolution of any non-adaptive query procedure, where each query has binary yes/no answers. We drive non-asymptotic and second-order asymptotic bounds on the minimal achievable resolution, using tools from finite blocklength information theory. Specifically, in the achievability part, we relate the 20 questions problem to data transmission over a multiple access channel, use the information spectrum method by Han and borrow results from finite blocklength analysis for random access channel coding. In the converse part, we relate the 20 questions problem to data transmission over a point-to-point channel and adapt finite blocklength converse results for channel coding. Our results extend the purely first-order asymptotic analyses of Kaspi et al. (ISIT 2015) for the one-dimensional case: we consider channels beyond the binary symmetric channel and derive non-asymptotic and second-order asymptotic bounds on the performance of optimal non-adaptive query procedures.},

Inspired by the recent paper of Ghourchian, Amini, and Gohari, we characterize their compressibility by studying the entropy of their double discretization (both in time and amplitude) in the regime of vanishing discretization steps. For a Lévy process with absolutely continuous marginals, this reduces to understanding the asymptotics of the differential entropy of its marginals at small times, for which we obtain a new local central limit theorem. We generalize known results for stable processes to the non-stable case, with a special focus on Lévy processes that are locally self-similar, and conceptualize a new compressibility hierarchy of Lévy processes, captured by their Blumenthal–Getoor index.},

For a certain range of the noise-to-signal ratios (NSRs) of the transmitter and the jammer, we are able to characterize the capacity of this channel under deterministic encoding or stochastic encoding, i.e., with no common randomness between the encoder/decoder pair. For the remaining NSR regimes, we determine the capacity under the assumption of a small amount of common randomness (at most $2\log (n)$ bits in one sub-regime, and at most $\Omega ({n})$ bits in the other sub-regime) available to the encoder-decoder pair. Our proof techniques involve a novel myopic list-decoding result for achievability, and a Plotkin-type push attack for the converse in a subregion of the NSRs, both of which may be of independent interest. We also give bounds on the strong secrecy capacity of this channel assuming that the jammer is simultaneously eavesdropping.},

The solution is based on a novel and non-asymptotic goodness-of-fit metric, referred to as invariant-signal-subspace matching (ISSM). This metric is aimed at matching pairs of signal-subspaces, created by exploiting the shift-invariance property of the Hankel data-matrix. A pair of such subspaces, together with their corresponding projection matrices, is created for every hypothesized number of exponentials, and the number of exponentials is then determined as that for which the distance between the pair of projection matrices is minimized. We prove the consistency of this criterion for the high signal-to-noise-ratio limit and also prove it for the large-sample limit, conditioned on the noise being white. We also extend this criterion to include multiple pairs of invariant subspace, readily created from the Hankel data-matrix, thus enabling to improve its performance at a slight increase in its computational load.

  abstract     = {Thomson’s multitaper method estimates the power spectrum of a signal from $N$ equally spaced samples by averaging $K$ tapered periodograms. Discrete prolate spheroidal sequences (DPSS) are used as tapers since they provide excellent protection against spectral leakage. Thomson’s multitaper method is widely used in applications, but most of the existing theory is qualitative or asymptotic. Furthermore, many practitioners use a DPSS bandwidth $W$ and number of tapers that are smaller than what the theory suggests is optimal because the computational requirements increase with the number of tapers. We revisit Thomson’s multitaper method from a linear algebra perspective involving subspace projections. This provides additional insight and helps us establish nonasymptotic bounds on some statistical properties of the multitaper spectral estimate, which are similar to existing asymptotic results. We show using $K=2NW-O(\log (NW))$ tapers instead of the traditional $2NW-O(1)$ tapers better protects against spectral leakage, especially when the power spectrum has a high dynamic range. Our perspective also allows us to derive an $\epsilon $ -approximation to the multitaper spectral estimate which can be evaluated on a grid of frequencies using $O\left({\log (NW)\log \tfrac {1}{ \epsilon }}\right)$ FFTs instead of $K=O(NW)$ FFTs. This is useful in problems where many samples are taken, and thus, using many tapers is desirable.},

Sharp phase transitions have been numerically observed in practice when different convex programming procedures are used to solve this problem. This paper is devoted to presenting theoretical explanations for these phenomena by employing some basic tools from Gaussian process theory. Specifically, we identify the precise locations of the phase transitions for both constrained and penalized recovery procedures. Our theoretical results show that these phase transitions are determined by some geometric measures of structure, e.g., the spherical Gaussian width of a tangent cone and the Gaussian (squared) distance to a scaled subdifferential. By utilizing the established phase transition theory, we further investigate the relationship between these two kinds of recovery procedures, which also reveals an optimal strategy (in the sense of Lagrange theory) for choosing the tradeoff parameter in the penalized recovery procedure. Numerical experiments are provided to verify our theoretical results.},

VAMP provides high per-iteration improvement, can utilize powerful denoisers like BM3D, has rigorously defined dynamics and is able to recover signals measured by highly undersampled and ill-conditioned linear operators. Yet, its applicability is limited to relatively small problem sizes due to the necessity to compute the expensive LMMSE estimator at each iteration. In this work we consider the problem of upscaling VAMP by utilizing Conjugate Gradient (CG) to approximate the intractable LMMSE estimator. We propose a rigorous method for correcting and tuning CG withing CG-VAMP to achieve a stable and efficient reconstruction. To further improve the performance of CG-VAMP, we design a warm-starting scheme for CG and develop theoretical models for the Onsager correction and the State Evolution of Warm-Started CG-VAMP (WS-CG-VAMP). Additionally, we develop robust and accurate methods for implementing the WS-CG-VAMP algorithm. The numerical experiments on large-scale image reconstruction problems demonstrate that WS-CG-VAMP requires much fewer CG iterations compared to CG-VAMP to achieve the same or superior level of reconstruction.},

  abstract     = {We consider a multi-hypothesis testing problem involving a $K$ -armed bandit. Each arm’s signal follows a distribution from a vector exponential family. The actual parameters of the arms are unknown to the decision maker. The decision maker incurs a delay cost for delay until a decision and a switching cost whenever he switches from one arm to another. His goal is to minimise the overall cost until a decision is reached on the true hypothesis. Of interest are policies that satisfy a given constraint on the probability of false detection. This is a sequential decision making problem where the decision maker gets only a limited view of the true state of nature at each stage, but can control his view by choosing the arm to observe at each stage. An information-theoretic lower bound on the total cost (expected time for a reliable decision plus total switching cost) is first identified, and a variation on a sequential policy based on the generalised likelihood ratio statistic is then studied. Due to the vector exponential family assumption, the signal processing at each stage is simple; the associated conjugate prior distribution on the unknown model parameters enables easy updates of the posterior distribution. The proposed policy, with a suitable threshold for stopping, is shown to satisfy the given constraint on the probability of false detection. Under a continuous selection assumption, the policy is also shown to be asymptotically optimal in terms of the total cost among all policies that satisfy the constraint on the probability of false detection.},

  abstract     = {This paper describes new, simple, recursive methods of construction for orientable sequences , i.e. periodic binary sequences in which any $n$ -tuple occurs at most once in a period in either direction. As has been previously described, such sequences have potential applications in automatic position-location systems, where the sequence is encoded onto a surface and a reader needs only examine $n$ consecutive encoded bits to determine its location and orientation on the surface. The only previously described method of construction (due to Dai et al. ) is somewhat complex, whereas the new techniques are simple to both describe and implement. The methods of construction cover both the standard ‘infinite periodic’ case, and also the aperiodic, finite sequence, case. Both the new methods build on the Lempel homomorphism, first introduced as a means of recursively generating de Bruijn sequences.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study the duals of generalized bent functions $f: V_{n}\rightarrow \mathbb {Z}_{p^{k}}$ , where $V_{n}$ is an $n$ -dimensional vector space over $\mathbb {F}_{p}$ and $p$ is an odd prime, $k$ is a positive integer. It is known that weakly regular generalized bent functions always appear in pairs since the dual of a weakly regular generalized bent function is also a weakly regular generalized bent function. The duals of non-weakly regular generalized bent functions can be generalized bent or not generalized bent. By generalizing the construction of Çeşmelioğlu et al. , 2016, we provide an explicit construction of generalized bent functions whose duals can be generalized bent or not generalized bent. We show that the well-known direct sum construction and the generalized indirect sum construction given in Wang and Fu, 2021. can provide secondary constructions of generalized bent functions whose duals can be generalized bent or not generalized bent. By using the knowledge on ideal decomposition in cyclotomic fields, we prove that $f^{**}(x)=f(-x)$ if $f$ is a generalized bent function and its dual $f^{*}$ is also a generalized bent function. For any non-weakly regular generalized bent function $f$ which satisfies that $f(x)=f(-x)$ and its dual $f^{*}$ is generalized bent, we give a property and as a consequence, we prove that there is no self-dual generalized bent function $f: V_{n}\rightarrow \mathbb {Z}_{p^{k}}$ if $p\equiv 3 ~(mod ~4)$ and $n$ is odd. When $p \equiv 1 ~(mod ~4)$ or $p\equiv 3 ~(mod ~4)$ and $n$ is even, we give a secondary construction of self-dual generalized bent functions. In the end, by the decomposition of generalized bent functions, we characterize the relations between the generalized bentness of the dual of a generalized bent function $f$ and the bentness of the duals of bent functions associated with the generalized bent function $f$ , as well as the relations of self-duality between a generalized bent function $f$ and bent functions associated with the generalized bent function $f$ .},

The ultimate goal is to develop efficient coding schemes that tolerate a high level of noise while increasing the communication by only a constant factor (i.e., constant rate). In this work (the second part) we provide computationally efficient, constant rate schemes that conduct any computation on arbitrary networks, and succeed with high probability in the presence of adversarial noise that can insert, delete, or alter communicated messages. Our schemes are non-fully-utilized and incur a polynomial (in the size of the network) blowup in the round complexity. Our first scheme resists an oblivious adversary that corrupts at most a fraction $\frac { \varepsilon }{m}$ of the total communication, where $m$ is the number of links in the network and $\varepsilon $ is a small constant. In contrast to the first part of this work, the scheme in this part does not assume that the parties pre-share a long random string. Our second scheme resists an arbitrary (non-oblivious) adversary that corrupts at most a fraction $\frac { \varepsilon }{m\log m}$ of the communication. We further improve the resilience to $\vphantom {\sum ^{R}}\frac { \varepsilon }{m\log \log m}$ by assuming the parties pre-share a long common random $\vphantom {\sum ^{R}}$ string.},

  abstract     = {The strong secrecy transmission problem of the arbitrarily varying wiretap channel (AVWC) with input and state constraints is investigated in this paper. First, a stochastic-encoder code lower bound of the strong secrecy capacity is established by applying the type argument and Csiszár’s almost independent coloring lemma. Then, a superposition stochastic-encoder code lower bound of the secrecy capacity is provided. The superposition stochastic-encoder code lower bound can be larger than the ordinary stochastic-encoder code lower bound. Random code lower and upper bounds of the secrecy capacity of the AVWC with constraints are further provided. Based on these results, we further consider a special case of the model, namely severely less noisy AVWC, and give the stochastic-encoder code and random code capacities. It is proved that the stochastic-encoder code capacity of the AVWC with constraints is either equal to or strictly smaller than the corresponding random code capacity, which is consistent with the property of the ordinary AVC. Finally, some numerical examples are presented to better illustrate our capacity results. Compared to the soft covering lemma that requires the codewords to be generated i.i.d., our method has more relaxed requirements regarding codebooks. It is proved that the good codebooks for secure transmission can be generated by choosing codewords randomly from a given type set, which is critical when considering the AVWC with constraints.},

We are interested in the maximum message rate, i.e., the maximum number of bits of $W$ that can be securely groupcast to the legitimate receivers per key block and the minimum broadcast bandwidth, i.e., the minimum number of bits of the broadcast information required to securely groupcast the message bits. We focus on the setting of combinatorial keys, where every subset of the $K$ receivers share an independent key of arbitrary size. Under this combinatorial key setting, the maximum message rate is characterized for the following scenarios - 1) $N=1$ or $N=K-1$ , i.e., secure unicast to 1 receiver with $K-1$ eavesdroppers or secure groupcast to $K-1$ receivers with 1 eavesdropper, 2) $N=2, K=4$ , i.e., secure groupcast to 2 out of 4 receivers, and 3) the symmetric setting where the key size for any subset of the same cardinality is equal for any $N,K$ .

  abstract     = {We consider the problem of secure distributed matrix computation (SDMC), where a user queries a function of data matrices generated at distributed source nodes. We assume the availability of $N$ honest but curious computation servers, which are connected to the sources, the user, and each other through orthogonal and reliable communication links. Our goal is to minimize the amount of data that must be transmitted from the sources to the servers, called the upload cost , while guaranteeing that no $T$ colluding servers can learn any information about the source matrices, and the user cannot learn any information beyond the computation result. We first focus on secure distributed matrix multiplication (SDMM), considering two matrices, and propose a novel polynomial coding scheme using the properties of finite field discrete Fourier transform, which achieves an upload cost significantly lower than the existing results in the literature. We then generalize the proposed scheme to include straggler mitigation, and to the multiplication of multiple matrices while keeping the input matrices, the intermediate computation results, as well as the final result secure against any $T$ colluding servers. We also consider a special case, called computation with own data, where the data matrices used for computation belong to the user. In this case, we drop the security requirement against the user, and show that the proposed scheme achieves the minimal upload cost. We then propose methods for performing other common matrix computations securely on distributed servers, including changing the parameters of secret sharing, matrix transpose, matrix exponentiation, solving a linear system, and matrix inversion, which are then used to show how arbitrary matrix polynomials can be computed securely on distributed servers using the proposed procedure.},

These results are illustrated in numerical simulations. Unlike previous results of this type, which rely on assumptions of Gaussianity or independence between the entries of the additive noise, handling the dependence between entries in the proofs of these results requires careful leave-one-out analysis and conditioning arguments.

While the classical methods are based on the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE), it is well known its lack of robustness to small deviations from the assumed conditions. In this paper, and based on the Rényi’s pseudodistance (RP), we introduce a new family of estimators in case our information about the unknown parameter is given for i.n.i.d.o.. This family of estimators, let us say minimum RP estimators (as they are obtained by minimizing the RP between the assumed distribution and the empirical distribution of the data), contains the MLE as a particular case and can be applied, among others, to the MLRM with non-random covariates. Based on these estimators, we introduce Wald-type tests for testing simple and composite null hypotheses, as an extension of the classical MLE-based Wald test. Influence functions for the estimators and Wald-type tests are also obtained and analysed. Finally, a simulation study is developed in order to asses the performance of the proposed methods and some real-life data are analysed for illustrative purpose.},

In particular, we consider a randomized scheme based on the convex hull of a point set, that returns an unbiased estimator of a $d$ -dimensional gradient vector with almost surely bounded norm. We provide multiple efficient instances of our scheme, that are near optimal, and require $o(d)$ bits of communication at the expense of tolerable increase in error. The instances of our quantization scheme are obtained using well-known families of binary error-correcting codes and provide a smooth tradeoff between the communication and the estimation error of quantization.

Recently, they have gained popularity in machine learning as a tractable and scalable approach for training probabilistic models and for statistically differentiating between data distributions. Their advantages include: 1) They can be estimated from data as statistical averages. 2) Such representations can leverage the ability of neural networks to efficiently approximate optimal solutions in function spaces. However, a systematic and practical approach to improving the tightness of such variational formulas, and accordingly accelerate statistical learning and estimation from data, is currently lacking. Here we develop such a methodology for building new, tighter variational representations of divergences. Our approach relies on improved objective functionals constructed via an auxiliary optimization problem. Furthermore, the calculation of the functional Hessian of objective functionals unveils the local curvature differences around the common optimal variational solution; this quantifies and orders the tightness gains between different variational representations. Finally, numerical simulations utilizing neural network optimization demonstrate that tighter representations can result in significantly faster learning and more accurate estimation of divergences in both synthetic and real datasets (of more than 1000 dimensions), often accelerated by nearly an order of magnitude.},

  abstract     = {Quantum readout provides a general framework for formulating statistical discrimination of quantum channels. Several paths have been taken for such this problem. However, there is much to be done in the avenue of optimizing channel discrimination using classical codes. At least two open questions can be pointed out: how to construct low complexity encoding schemes that are interesting for channel discrimination and, more importantly, how to develop capacity-achieving protocols. This paper aims at presenting a solution to these questions using polar codes. Firstly, we characterize the information rate and reliability parameter of the channels under polar encoding. We also show that the error probability of the scheme proposed decays exponentially with the square root of the code length. Secondly, an analysis of the optimal quantum states to be used as probes is given.},

More precisely, we consider a general class of communication scenarios characterised by encoding operations that commute with a unique resource destroying map and leave free states invariant. Our motivating example is given by encoding information into coherences of a quantum system with respect to a fixed basis (with unitaries diagonal in that basis as encodings and the decoherence channel as a resource destroying map), but the generality of the framework allows us to explore applications ranging from super-dense coding to thermodynamics. For any state, we find that the number of messages that can be encoded into it using such operations in a one-shot scenario is upper bounded in terms of the information spectrum relative entropy between the given state and its version with erased resources. Furthermore, if the resource destroying map is the twirling channel over some unitary group, we find matching one-shot lower bounds as well. In the asymptotic setting where we encode into many copies of the resource state, our bounds yield an operational interpretation of resource monotones such as the relative entropy of coherence and its corresponding relative entropy variance.},

  abstract     = {Lattices are a popular field of study in mathematical research, but also in more practical areas like cryptology or multiple-input/multiple-output (MIMO) transmission. In mathematical theory, most often lattices over real numbers are considered. However, in communications, complex-valued processing is usually of interest. Besides, by the use of dual-polarized transmission as well as by the combination of two time slots or frequencies, four-dimensional (quaternion-valued) approaches become more and more important. Hence, to account for this fact, well-known lattice algorithms and related concepts are generalized in this work. To this end, a brief review of complex arithmetic, including the sets of Gaussian and Eisenstein integers, and an introduction to quaternion-valued numbers, including the sets of Lipschitz and Hurwitz integers, are given. On that basis, generalized variants of two important algorithms are derived: first, of the polynomial-time LLL algorithm, resulting in a reduced basis of a lattice by performing a special variant of the Euclidean algorithm defined for matrices, and second, of an algorithm to calculate the successive minima—the norms of the shortest independent vectors of a lattice—and its related lattice points. Generalized bounds for the quality of the particular results are established and the asymptotic complexities of the algorithms are assessed. These findings are extensively compared to conventional real-valued processing. It is shown that the generalized approaches outperform their real-valued counterparts in complexity and/or quality aspects. Moreover, the application of the generalized algorithms to MIMO communications is studied, particularly in the field of lattice-reduction-aided and integer-forcing equalization.},

  abstract     = {Aligned-Images Sum-set Inequalities are used in this work to study the Generalized Degrees of Freedom (GDoF) of the symmetric layered multi-hop interference channel under the robust assumption that the channel state information at the transmitters (CSIT) is limited to finite precision. First, the sum-GDoF value is characterized for the $2\times 2\times 2$ setting that is comprised of 2 sources, 2 relays, and 2 destinations. It is shown that the sum-GDoF does not improve even if perfect CSIT is allowed in the first hop, as long as the CSIT in the second hop is limited to finite precision. The sum GDoF characterization is then generalized to the $2\times 2\times \cdots \times 2$ setting that is comprised of $L$ hops. Remarkably, for large $L$ , the sum-GDoF value approaches that of the one-hop broadcast channel that is obtained by full cooperation among the two transmitters of the last hop, with finite precision CSIT. Previous studies of multi-hop interference networks either identified sophisticated GDoF optimal schemes under perfect CSIT, such as aligned interference neutralization and network diagonalization, that are powerful in theory but too fragile to be practical, or studied robust achievable schemes like classical amplify/decode/compress-and-forward without claims of information-theoretic optimality. In contrast, under finite precision CSIT, we show that the benefits of fragile schemes are lost, while a combination of classical random coding schemes that are simpler and much more robust, namely a rate-splitting between decode-and-forward and amplify-and-forward, is shown to be GDoF optimal. As such, this work represents another step towards bridging the gap between theory (optimality) and practice (robustness) with the aid of Aligned-Images Sum-set Inequalities.},

This conjecture is verified only for a handful of networks and network classes. Moreover, only two explicit upper bounds on information capacity are known for general undirected networks: the sparsest cut bound and the linear programming bound. In this paper, we present an information-theoretic upper bound, called the partition bound , on the capacity of general undirected multiple-unicast networks. We show that a decision version problem of computing the bound is NP-complete. We present two classes of undirected multiple-unicast networks such that the partition bound is achievable by routing. Thus, the conjecture is proved for these classes of networks. Recently, the conjecture was proved for a new class of networks defined by properties relating to cut-set and source-sink paths. We show the existence of a network outside of this new class of networks such that the partition bound is achievable by routing.},

Motivated by these facts, we define additive complementary dual codes (ACD for short) over a finite abelian group in terms of an arbitrary duality on the ambient space and examine their properties. We show that the best minimum weight of ACD codes is always greater than or equal to the best minimum weight of LCD codes of the same size and that this inequality is often strict. We give some matrix constructions for quaternary ACD codes from a given quaternary ACD code and also from a given binary self-orthogonal code. Moreover, we construct an algorithm to determine if a given quaternary additive code is an ACD code with respect to all possible symmetric dualities. We also determine the largest minimum distance of quaternary ACD codes for lengths $n \leq 10$ . The obtained codes are either optimal or near optimal according to Bierbrauer et al +. (2009).},

  abstract     = {Erasure codes are essential for providing efficient resilience against node failures in distributed storage. Typically, an $[n, k]$ erasure code encodes $k$ symbols into $n$ symbols which are then stored in different nodes. Recent work by Kadekodi et al. shows that the failure rates of storage nodes vary significantly over time, and that changing the rate of the code (via a change in $n$ and $k$ ) in response to such variations provides substantial storage space savings. However, the resource overhead of re-encoding the already encoded data is prohibitively high. We present a new theoretical framework formalizing code conversion —the process of converting data encoded with an $[n^{ I}, k^{ I}]$ code into data encoded with an $[{n^{ F}}, {k^{ F}}]$ code while maintaining desired decodability properties. We then introduce convertible codes , a new class of codes that allow for code conversions in a resource-efficient manner. This paper begins the study on convertible codes by focusing on linear MDS codes and the access cost of conversion. We derive a lower bound on the access cost of conversion and present an explicit optimal construction matching this bound for an important subclass of conversions. Additionally, we propose constructions with low field-size requirement for a broad subset of parameters. Our results show that it is possible to achieve code conversions with significantly less resources than the default approach of re-encoding for a wide range of parameters.},

Recently, some near MDS codes were employed to construct $t$ -designs by Ding and Tang, which settles the question as to whether there exists an infinite family of near MDS codes holding an infinite family of $t$ -designs for $t \geq 2$ . This paper is devoted to the construction of infinite families of 3-designs and 2-designs from special equations over finite fields. First, we present an infinite family of almost MDS codes over ${\mathrm{ GF}}(p^{m})$ holding an infinite family of 3-designs. We then provide an infinite family of almost MDS codes over ${\mathrm{ GF}}(p^{m})$ holding an infinite family of 2-designs for any field ${\mathrm{ GF}}(q)$ . In particular, some of these almost MDS codes are near MDS. Second, we present an infinite family of near MDS codes over ${\mathrm{ GF}}(2^{m})$ holding an infinite family of 3-designs by considering the number of roots of a special linearized polynomial. Compared to previous constructions of 3-designs or 2-designs from linear codes, the parameters of some of our designs are new and flexible.},

The Euclidean hull of a linear code has been applied to the so-called entanglement-assisted quantum error-correcting codes (EAQECCs) via classical error-correcting codes. In this paper, we firstly consider linear codes with one-dimensional Euclidean hull from algebraic geometry codes, and then present a general method to construct linear codes with arbitrary dimensional Euclidean hull.

  abstract     = {A block code is called a locally recoverable code (LRC for short) with $(r,\delta)$ -locality, if subject to any $\delta -1$ erasure failures, every symbol in the encoding can still be recovered by accessing at most $r$ other symbols. Recently, it was discovered by several authors that a $q$ -ary optimal $(r,\delta)$ -LRC, i.e., an LRC achieving the generalized Singleton-type bound, can have length much bigger than $q+1$ . This is quite different from the classical $q$ -ary MDS codes where it is conjectured that the code length is upper bounded by $q+1$ (or $q+2$ for some special cases). In this paper, we further investigate constructions of optimal $(r,\delta)$ -LRCs along the line of using parity-check matrices. Inspired by classical Reed-Solomon codes and the work in Jin (2019), we equip parity-check matrices with the Vandermonde structure. It turns out that a parity-check matrix with the Vandermonde structure that produces an optimal LRC must obey certain disjoint property for subsets of $\mathbb {F}_{q}$ . We manage to show the existence of these disjoint subsets. Thus, this yields an optimal $(r,\delta)$ -LRC with code length $\Omega \left({q^{\frac {\delta }{2}\left({1+\frac {1}{\lfloor \frac {d-1}{\delta }\rfloor -1}}\right)}}\right)\vphantom {\bigg)_{j}}$ , where $d$ is the minimum distance. In particular, to our surprise, for $\delta =2$ this disjoint condition is equivalent to a well-studied problem in extremal graph theory. With the help of extremal graph theory, we succeed to improve all of the best known results in Guruswami et al. (2018) for $d\geq 7$ . In addition, for $d=6$ , we are able to remove the constraint required in Jin (2019) that $q$ is even.},

The seminal work on coded caching for single file retrieval by Maddah-Ali and Niesen (MAN) showed the existence of a global caching gain that scales with the total memory in the system, in addition to the known local caching gain in uncoded systems. This paper formulates a novel cache-aided matrix multiplication retrieval problem, relevant for data analytics and machine learning applications. In the considered problem, each cache-aided user requests the product of two matrices from the library. A structure-agnostic solution is to treat each possible matrix product as an independent file and use the MAN coded caching scheme for single file retrieval. This paper proposes two structure-aware schemes, which partition each matrix in the library by either rows or columns and let a subset of users cache some sub-matrices, that improve on the structure-agnostic scheme. For the case where the library matrices are “fat” matrices, the structure-aware row-partition scheme is shown to be order optimal under some constraint.},

Given a graph $G = (V, E)$ representing a communication network, a subset $S \subseteq V$ of sources, each of which initially holds a set of information messages, and a set $T \subseteq V$ of terminals; we consider the problem in which one wishes to design a communication scheme that eventually allows all terminals to obtain all the messages held by the sources. In this study we assume that communication is performed in rounds, where in each round each network node may transmit a single (possibly encoded) information packet on any of its outgoing edges. The objective is to minimize the communication latency, i.e., number of communication rounds needed until all terminals have all the messages of the source nodes. For sufficiently large alphabet sizes (i.e., large block length, packet sizes), it is known that traditional linear multicast network coding techniques (such as random linear network coding) minimize latency. In this work we seek to study the task of minimizing latency in the setting of limited alphabet sizes (i.e., finite block length), and alternatively, the task of minimizing the alphabet size in the setting of bounded latency. We focus on the establishing the computation complexity of the problem and present several intractability results. In particular, through reductive arguments, we prove that it is NP-hard to (i) approximate (and in particular to determine) the minimum alphabet size given a latency constraint; (ii) approximate (and in particular to determine) the minimum latency of communication schemes in the setting of limited alphabet sizes.},

It is known that $\exp (\Theta (n^{1/3}))$ traces are necessary and sufficient for mean-based worst-case trace reconstruction over the deletion channel, and this result was also extended to certain channels combining deletions and geometric insertions of uniformly random bits. In this work, we use a simple extension of the original complex-analytic approach to show that these results are examples of a much more general phenomenon. We introduce oblivious synchronization channels , which map each input bit to an arbitrarily distributed sequence of replications and insertions of random bits. This general class captures all previously considered synchronization channels. We show that for any oblivious synchronization channel whose output length follows a sub-exponential distribution either mean-based trace reconstruction is impossible or $\exp (O(n^{1/3}))$ traces suffice for this task.},

A random variable $X$ is called informationally infinitely divisible if, for any $n\ge 1$ , there exists an i.i.d. sequence of random variables $Z_{1},\ldots,Z_{n}$ that contains the same information as $X$ , i.e., there exists an injective function $f$ such that $X=f(Z_{1},\ldots,Z_{n})$ . While there does not exist such informationally infinitely divisible discrete random variable, we show that any discrete random variable $X$ can be divided into arbitrarily many identical pieces with a multiplicative penalty to the entropy, that is, if we remove the injectivity requirement on $f$ , then there exists i.i.d. $Z_{1},\ldots,Z_{n}$ and $f$ satisfying $X=f(Z_{1},\ldots,Z_{n})$ , and the entropy satisfies $H(X)/n\le H(Z_{1})\le 1.59H(X)/n+2.43$ bits. Furthermore, we study the case where $X=(Y_{1},\ldots,Y_{m})$ is itself an i.i.d. sequence, $m\ge 2$ , for which the multiplicative gap 1.59 can be replaced by $1+5\sqrt {(\log m)/m}$ . This means that as $m$ increases, $(Y_{1},\ldots,Y_{m})$ becomes closer to being spectral infinitely divisible in a uniform manner. This can be regarded as an information analogue of Kolmogorov’s uniform theorem. Applications of our result include independent component analysis and distributed storage with a secrecy constraint.},

Each of the two users transmits a message through the network, and the sink(s) of the network can decode both messages with zero error. A graph is used to represent the distinguishability of the inputs of the channel, and a graph set is used to represent the distinguishability of the inputs of the network. We show that for two networks represented by the same graph set, their zero-error capacity regions are the same. We list all the possible graph sets for the two networks and determine the zero-error capacity regions for some of these graph sets. Based on this result, we explore a relation between graph theory and set theory, and then redefine the cancellative pair of families of subsets . We further extend the problem formulation to a general network called the parallel network , which may consist of more than one channel with multiple inputs and multiple outputs.},

In a white noise model, we derive rate-optimal and adaptive estimators of signals in modulation spaces, which measure smoothness in terms of decay properties of the short-time Fourier transform. The estimators are based on series expansions by means of Gabor frames and on thresholding the coefficients. The minimax rates have interesting new features, and the derivation of the lower bounds requires the use of test functions which approximately localize both in time and in frequency. Simulations and applications to audio recordings illustrate the practical relevance of our methods. We also discuss the best $N$ -term approximation and the approximation of variational problems in modulation spaces by Gabor frame expansions.},

  abstract     = {Distributed matrix computations over large clusters can suffer from the problem of slow or failed worker nodes (called stragglers) which can dominate the overall job execution time. Coded computation utilizes concepts from erasure coding to mitigate the effect of stragglers by running “coded” copies of tasks comprising a job; stragglers are typically treated as erasures. While this is useful, there are issues with applying, e.g., MDS codes in a straightforward manner. Several practical matrix computation scenarios involve sparse matrices. MDS codes typically require dense linear combinations of submatrices of the original matrices which destroy their inherent sparsity. This is problematic as it results in significantly higher worker computation times. Moreover, treating slow nodes as erasures ignores the potentially useful partial computations performed by them. Furthermore, some MDS techniques also suffer from significant numerical stability issues. In this work we present schemes that allow us to leverage partial computation by stragglers while imposing constraints on the level of coding that is required in generating the encoded submatrices. This significantly reduces the worker computation time as compared to previous approaches and results in improved numerical stability in the decoding process. Exhaustive numerical experiments on Amazon Web Services (AWS) clusters support our findings.},

At each server, we are interested in determining the set of fragments to be stored, and the sequence in which fragments should be accessed, such that the mean file download time for a request is minimized. We model the fragment download time as an exponential random variable independent and identically distributed for all fragments across all servers, and show that the mean file download time can be lower bounded in terms of the expected number of useful servers summed over all distinct fragment downloads. We present deterministic storage schemes that attempt to maximize the number of useful servers. We show that finding the optimal sequence of accessing the fragments is a Markov decision problem, whose complexity grows exponentially with the number of fragments. We propose heuristic algorithms that determine the sequence of access to the fragments which are empirically shown to perform well.},

We first show that a demand-private scheme for $N$ files and $K$ users can be obtained from a non-private scheme that serves only a subset of the demands for the $N$ files and $NK$ users problem. We further use this fact to construct a demand-private scheme for $N$ files and $K$ users from a particular known non-private scheme for $N$ files and $NK-K+1$ users. It is then demonstrated that, the memory-rate pair $(M,\min {N,K}(1-M/N))$ , which is achievable for non-private schemes with uncoded transmissions, is also achievable under demand privacy. We further propose a scheme that improves on these ideas by removing some redundant transmissions. The memory-rate trade-off achieved using our schemes is shown to be within a multiplicative factor of 3 from the optimal when $K &amp;lt; N$ and of 8 when $N \leq K$ . Finally, we give the exact memory-rate trade-off for demand-private coded caching problems with $N\geq K=2$ .},

A straightforward solution of erasing (masking) the chosen genotypes does not ensure privacy, because the correlation between nearby positions can leak the masked genotypes. We introduce an erasure-based privacy mechanism with perfect information-theoretic privacy, whereby the released sequence is statistically independent of the sensitive genotypes. Our mechanism can be interpreted as a locally-optimal greedy algorithm for a given processing order of sequence positions, where utility is measured by the number of positions released without erasure. We show that finding an optimal order is NP-hard in general and provide an upper bound on the optimal utility. For sequences from hidden Markov models, a standard modeling approach in genetics, we propose an efficient algorithmic implementation of our mechanism with complexity polynomial in sequence length. Moreover, we illustrate the robustness of the mechanism by bounding the privacy leakage from erroneous prior distributions. Our work is a step towards more rigorous control of privacy in genomic data sharing.},

A necessary requirement for such identification is that $\mathbb H({\mathrm {m}})$ have full column rank; conversely, identification is possible if apart from each row there exist two disjoint sets of rows of m, each of whose extension has full column rank. It is necessary therefore to understand when $\mathbb H({\mathrm {m}})$ has full column rank; we provide two results in this direction. The first is that if $\mathbb H({\mathrm {m}})$ has full column rank then there exists a set of at most $k-1$ rows of m, whose extension already has full column rank. The second is a Hall-type condition on the values in the rows of m, that suffices to ensure full column rank of $\mathbb H({\mathrm {m}})$ .},

Here $d$ is the degree of the spline, $d_{0}$ is the order of differentiability at each inner knot, and $k$ is the maximal number of pieces. We show that, given any integer $d\geq 0$ and $d_{0}\in {-1,0,\ldots,d-1}$ , the minimax rate of estimation over $\Theta _{n}(d,d_{0},k)$ exhibits the following phase transition: $\begin{aligned} \inf _{ \widetilde {\theta }}\sup _{\theta \in \Theta _{n}(d,d_{0}, k)} \mathbb {E}_\theta \lVert \widetilde {\theta } - \theta \rVert _{}^{2} \asymp _{d} \begin{cases} k\log \log (16n/k), &amp;amp; 2\leq k\leq k_{0},\\ k\log (en/k), &amp;amp; k \geq k_{0}+1. \end{cases} \end{aligned}$ The transition boundary $k_{0}$ , which takes the form $\left \lfloor{ (d+1)/(d-d_{0}) }\right \rfloor + 1$ , demonstrates the critical role of the regularity parameter $d_{0}$ in the separation between a faster $\log \log (16n)$ and a slower $\log (en)$ rate. We further show that, once encouraging an additional ‘ $d$ -monotonicity’ shape constraint (including monotonicity for $d = 0$ and convexity for $d=1$ ), the above phase transition is removed and the faster $k\log \log (16n/k)$ rate can be achieved for all $k$ . These results provide theoretical support for developing $\ell _{0}$ -penalized (shape-constrained) spline regression procedures as useful alternatives to $\ell _{1}$ - and $\ell _{2}$ -penalized ones.},

To describe for which tasks DNNs perform well and when they fail, it is a key challenge to understand their performance. The aim of this paper is to contribute to the current statistical theory of DNNs. We apply DNNs on high dimensional data and we show that the least squares regression estimates using DNNs are able to achieve dimensionality reduction in case that the regression function has locally low dimensionality. Consequently, the rate of convergence of the estimate does not depend on its input dimension $d$ , but on its local dimension $d^{*}$ and the DNNs are able to circumvent the curse of dimensionality in case that $d^{*}$ is much smaller than $d$ . In our simulation study we provide numerical experiments to support our theoretical result and we compare our estimate with other conventional nonparametric regression estimates. The performance of our estimates is also validated in experiments with real data.},

Nevertheless these metrics and divergences may only be computed, in fact, are only defined, when the pair of probability measures are on spaces of the same dimension. How would one quantify, say, a KL-divergence between the uniform distribution on the interval [−1, 1] and a Gaussian distribution on $\mathbb {R}^{3}$ ? We show that these common notions of metrics and divergences give rise to natural distances between Borel probability measures defined on spaces of different dimensions, e.g., one on $\mathbb {R}^{m}$ and another on $\mathbb {R}^{n}$ where $m, n$ are distinct, so as to give a meaningful answer to the previous question.},

We develop the general upper bound on estimation error for TTOI with the support of several new representation lemmas on tensor matricizations. By developing a matching information-theoretic lower bound, we also prove that TTOI achieves the minimax optimality under the spiked tensor model.

Based on the no-cloning theorem, perfect cribbing is impossible. This leads to the introduction of a MAC model with noisy cribbing. In the causal and non-causal cribbing scenarios, Transmitter 2 performs the measurement before the input of Transmitter 1 is sent through the channel. Hence, Transmitter 2’s cribbing may inflict a “state collapse” for Transmitter 1. Achievable regions are derived for each setting. Furthermore, a regularized capacity characterization is established for robust cribbing, i.e. when the cribbing system contains all the information of the channel input. Building on the analogy between the noisy cribbing model and the relay channel, a partial decode-forward region is derived for a quantum MAC with non-robust cribbing. For the classical-quantum MAC with cribbing encoders, the capacity region is determined with perfect cribbing of the classical input, and a cutset region is derived for noisy cribbing. In the special case of a classical-quantum MAC with a deterministic cribbing channel, the inner and outer bounds coincide.},

If the unknown target is an $n$ -qubit Clifford circuit, we devise an efficient algorithm to reconstruct its circuit representation by using $O(n^{2})$ queries to it. For decades, it has been unknown how to handle circuits beyond the Clifford group since the stabilizer formalism cannot be applied in this case. Herein, we study quantum circuits of $T$ -depth one on the computational basis. We show that the output state of a $T$ -depth one circuit can be represented by a stabilizer pseudomixture with a specific algebraic structure. Using Pauli and Bell measurements on copies of the output states, we can generate a hypothesis circuit that is equivalent to the unknown target circuit on computational basis states as input. If the number of $T$ gates of the target is of the order $O({\log n})$ , our algorithm requires $O(n^{2})$ queries to it and produces its equivalent circuit representation on the computational basis in time $O(n^{3})$ . Using further additional $O(4^{3n})$ classical computations, we can derive an exact description of the target for arbitrary input states.

  abstract     = {We show that a relatively simple reasoning using von Neumann entropy inequalities yields a robust proof of the quantum Singleton bound for quantum error-correcting codes (QECC). For entanglement-assisted quantum error-correcting codes (EAQECC) and catalytic codes (CQECC), a type of generalized quantum Singleton bound [Brun et al. , IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 60(6):3073–3089 (2014)] was believed to hold for many years until recently one of us found a counterexample [MG, Phys. Rev. A 103, 020601 (2021)]. Here, we rectify this state of affairs by proving the correct generalized quantum Singleton bound, extending the above-mentioned proof method for QECC; we also prove information-theoretically tight bounds on the entanglement-communication tradeoff for EAQECC. All of the bounds relate block length $n$ and code length $k$ for given minimum distance $d$ and we show that they are robust, in the sense that they hold with small perturbations for codes which only correct most of the erasure errors of less than $d$ letters. In contrast to the classical case, the bounds take on qualitatively different forms depending on whether the minimum distance is smaller or larger than half the block length. We also provide a propagation rule: any pure QECC yields an EAQECC with the same distance and dimension, but of shorter block length.},

We first consider the MISO equal-cost constrained OIC (EC-OIC), where, apart from the peak-intensity constraint, average intensities of inputs are equal to arbitrarily preassigned constants. The second model of our interest is the MISO bounded-cost constrained OIC (BC-OIC), where, as compared with the EC-OIC, average intensities of inputs are no larger than arbitrarily preassigned constants. By leveraging tools from quantile functions, stop-loss transform and convex ordering of nonnegative random variables, we prove two decomposition theorems for bounded and nonnegative random variables, based on which we equivalently transform both the EC-OIC and the BC-OIC into respective single-input single-output channels under a peak-intensity and several stop-loss mean constraints. Capacity lower and upper bounds for both channels are established, based on which the asymptotic capacity at high and low signal-to-noise-ratio are determined.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers a real-time status update system in which an energy harvesting (EH)-powered transmitter node observes some physical process, and sends its sensed measurements in the form of status updates to a destination node. The status update and harvested energy packets are assumed to arrive at the transmitter according to independent Poisson processes, and the service time of each status update is assumed to be exponentially distributed. We quantify the freshness of status updates when they reach the destination using the concept of Age of Information (AoI) . Unlike most of the existing analyses of AoI focusing on the evaluation of its average value when the transmitter is not subject to energy constraints, our analysis is focused on understanding the distributional properties of AoI through the characterization of its moment generating function (MGF). In particular, we use the stochastic hybrid systems (SHS) framework to derive closed-form expressions of the MGF of AoI under several queueing disciplines at the transmitter, including non-preemptive and preemptive in service/waiting strategies. Using these MGF results, we further obtain closed-form expressions for the first and second moments of AoI in each queueing discipline. We demonstrate the generality of this analysis by recovering several existing results for the corresponding system with no energy constraints as special cases of the new results. Our numerical results verify the analytical findings, and demonstrate the necessity of incorporating the higher moments of AoI in the implementation/optimization of real-time status update systems rather than just relying on its average value.},

  abstract     = {When the users in a MIMO broadcast channel experience different spatial transmit correlation matrices, a class of gains is produced that is denoted transmit correlation diversity. This idea was conceived for channels in which transmit correlation matrices have mutually exclusive eigenspaces, allowing non-interfering training and transmission. This paper broadens the scope of transmit correlation diversity to the case of partially and fully overlapping eigenspaces and introduces techniques to harvest these generalized gains. For the two-user MIMO broadcast channel, we derive achievable degrees of freedom (DoF) and achievable rate regions with/without channel state information at the receiver (CSIR). When CSIR is available, the proposed achievable DoF region is tight in some configurations of the number of receive antennas and the channel correlation ranks. We then extend the DoF results to the $K$ -user case by analyzing the interference graph that characterizes the overlapping structure of the eigenspaces. Our achievability results employ a combination of product superposition in the common part of the eigenspaces, and pre-beamforming (rate splitting) to create multiple data streams in non-overlapping parts of the eigenspaces. Massive MIMO is a natural example in which spatially correlated link gains are likely to occur. We study the achievable downlink sum rate for a frequency-division duplex massive MIMO system under transmit correlation diversity.},

In this work, we design a mechanism for asymmetric key consensus from noise (AKCN), referred to as AKCN-E8, for error correction and key consensus. As a direct application, we present a practical key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) from the ideal lattice based on the ring learning with errors (RLWE) problem. Compared with NewHope-KEM that was the second round candidate of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) post-quantum cryptography (PQC) standardization, our AKCN-E8 KEM scheme overcomes some limitations and shortcomings of NewHope-KEM. Compared with some other dominating KEM schemes based on the variants of LWE, specifically Kyber and Saber, AKCN-E8 has a comparable performance but enjoys much flexible shared-key sizes. Specifically, the key encapsulated by AKCN-E8-512 (resp., 768, 1024) has the size of 256 (resp., 384, 512) bits. Flexible key size renders us stronger security against quantum attacks, more powerful and economic ability of key transportation, and better matches the demand in interactive protocols like TLS where parties need to negotiate the security parameters including the shared key length.},

In this work, we focus on the case where the list-decoding radius is of the form $r=1-\varepsilon $ for $\varepsilon $ tending to zero. Our main result states that there exist Reed–Solomon codes with rate $\Omega (\varepsilon)$ which are $(1-\varepsilon, O(1/\varepsilon))$ -list-decodable, meaning that any Hamming ball of radius $1-\varepsilon $ contains at most $O(1/\varepsilon)$ codewords. This trade-off between rate and list-decoding radius is best-possible for any code with list size less than exponential in the block length. By achieving this trade-off between rate and list-decoding radius we improve a recent result of Guo, Li, Shangguan, Tamo, and Wootters, and resolve the main motivating question of their work. Moreover, while their result requires the field to be exponentially large in the block length, we only need the field size to be polynomially large (and in fact, almost-linear suffices). We deduce our main result from a more general theorem, in which we prove good list-decodability properties of random puncturings of any given code with very large distance.},

  abstract     = {We consider the concatenation of a convolutional code (CC) with an optimized cyclic redundancy check (CRC) code as a promising paradigm for good short blocklength codes. The resulting CRC-aided convolutional code naturally permits the use of serial list Viterbi decoding (SLVD) to achieve maximum-likelihood decoding. The convolutional encoder of interest is of rate- $1/\omega $ and the convolutional code is either zero-terminated (ZT) or tail-biting (TB). The resulting CRC-aided convolutional code is called a CRC-ZTCC or a CRC-TBCC. To design a good CRC-aided convolutional code, we propose the distance-spectrum optimal (DSO) CRC polynomial. A DSO CRC search algorithm for the TBCC is provided. Our analysis reveals that the complexity of SLVD is governed by the expected list rank which converges to 1 at high SNR. This allows a good performance to be achieved with a small increase in complexity. In this paper, we focus on transmitting 64 information bits with a rate-1/2 convolutional encoder. For a target error probability $10^{-4}$ , simulations show that the best CRC-ZTCC approaches the random-coding union (RCU) bound within 0.4 dB. Several CRC-TBCCs outperform the RCU bound at moderate SNR values.},

  abstract     = {Previous algorithms for decoding AG codes up to the designed distance all assumed existence of an extra rational place on the base algebraic curve. The place is used to solve the decoding problem by linear algebra over the base field of the curve. The rationality of the place is essential, and therefore AG codes supported by all rational places on the curve are excluded from the domain of applicability of the decoding algorithms. This paper presents a decoding algorithm for those AG codes using an extra place of higher degree. Hence finally all AG codes, as Goppa defined 40 years ago, are equipped with a fast decoding algorithm.},

Without feedback, it is known that the rate of optimal asymmetric-error-correcting codes for the error fraction $\tau \ge 1/4$ vanishes as the blocklength grows. In this paper, we give an efficient feedback encoding scheme with $n$ transmissions that achieves a positive rate for any fraction of errors $\tau &amp;lt; 1$ and $n\to \infty $ . Additionally, we state an upper bound on the rate of asymptotically long feedback asymmetric error-correcting codes.},

  abstract     = {A common method for reading information stored in DNA molecules is shotgun sequencing. This method outputs a histogram of the frequencies of all the molecules’ substrings of a given length $\ell $ . To protect against noisy readings, the rank-modulation scheme encodes the information in the relative ranking of the substring frequencies, instead of their absolute values. However, the best rank-modulation codes for shotgun sequencing have low rates which are asymptotically vanishing. In this paper we propose new constructions of rank-modulation codes for shotgun sequencing. The first code construction is systematic, allowing the user to arbitrarily set the frequencies of a large subset of the substrings, which the encoder then completes to a permutation that may be realized by a DNA molecule. The construction is then improved by allowing the user to set the frequencies of additional substrings, at the cost of imposing constraints on the frequencies. The resulting codes have higher, non-vanishing rates, compared with previously known codes. As an example, for histograms of substrings of length $\ell =2$ , and an alphabet of size 4 (as in DNA molecules), we are able to construct a code with rate $\approx 0.909$ , whereas previously, the best construction resulted in a code with rate $\approx 0.654$ . Additionally, the encoded information in our construction may be written to shorter DNA molecules than possible before. We also prove that the systematic codes constructed in this paper are the largest possible among all systematic codes.},

Sub-block access is realized by a semi-global decoder that decodes a chosen target sub-block by only accessing the target, plus a prescribed number of helper sub-blocks adjacent in the code chain. This paper develops a theoretical methodology for analyzing the semi-global decoding performance of spatially coupled LDPC codes constructed from protographs. The main result shows that semi-global decoding thresholds can be derived from certain thresholds we define for the single-sub-block graph. These characterizing thresholds are also used for deriving lower bounds on the decoder’s performance over channels with variability across sub-blocks, which are motivated by applications in data storage.},

We address the problem of finding the maximum growth rate of the set, which we term capacity, as well as constructions of explicit families that approach the optimal rate. The techniques that we employ rely on the connection of this problem with constrained systems. In the second part of the paper we consider a modification of the problem wherein the entries in the sequence are viewed as random variables over a finite alphabet that follow some joint distribution, and the recovery condition requires that the Shannon entropy of the $k$ -tuple conditioned on its $l$ -neighborhood be bounded above by some $\epsilon &amp;gt;0$ . We study properties of measures on infinite sequences that maximize the metric entropy under the recoverability condition. Drawing on tools from ergodic theory, we prove some properties of entropy-maximizing measures. We also suggest a procedure of constructing an $\epsilon $ -recoverable measure from a corresponding deterministic system.},

  abstract     = {In order to accommodate the ever-growing data from various, possibly independent, sources and the dynamic nature of data usage rates in practical applications, modern cloud data storage systems are required to be scalable, flexible, and heterogeneous. The recent rise of the blockchain technology is also moving various information systems towards decentralization to achieve high privacy at low costs. While codes with hierarchical locality have been intensively studied in the context of centralized cloud storage due to their effectiveness in reducing the average reading time, those for decentralized storage networks (DSNs) have not yet been discussed. In this paper, we propose a joint coding scheme where each node receives extra protection through the cooperation with nodes in its neighborhood in a heterogeneous DSN with any given topology. This work extends and subsumes our prior work on coding for centralized cloud storage. In particular, our proposed construction not only preserves desirable properties such as scalability and flexibility, which are critical in dynamic networks, but also adapts to arbitrary topologies, a property that is essential in DSNs but has been overlooked in existing works.},

The key idea for obtaining very good subfield codes over small fields is to choose very good linear codes over an extension field with small dimension. This paper first presents a general construction of $[q+1, 2, q]$ MDS codes over ${\mathrm {GF}}(q)$ , and then studies the subfield codes over ${\mathrm {GF}}(p)$ of some of the $[q+1, 2,q]$ MDS codes over ${\mathrm {GF}}(q)$ . Two families of dimension-optimal codes over ${\mathrm {GF}}(p)$ are obtained, and several families of nearly optimal codes over ${\mathrm {GF}}(p)$ are produced.

While the conventional list decoding requires that the list contains the transmitted message, secure list decoding requires the following additional security conditions to work as a modification of bit-string commitment. The first additional security condition is the receiver’s uncertainty for the transmitted message, which is stronger than the impossibility of the correct decoding, even though the transmitted message is contained in the list. The other additional security condition is the impossibility for the sender to estimate another element of the decoded list except for the transmitted message. The first condition is evaluated by the equivocation rate. The asymptotic property is evaluated by three parameters, the rates of the message and list sizes, and the equivocation rate. We derive the capacity region of this problem. We show that the combination of hash function and secure list decoding yields the conventional bit-string commitment. Our results hold even when the input and output systems are general probability spaces including continuous systems. When the input system is a general probability space, we formulate the abilities of the honest sender and the dishonest sender in a different way.},

In outlier hypothesis testing, one is given multiple observed sequences, where most sequences are generated i.i.d. from a nominal distribution. The task is to discern the set of outlying sequences that are generated from anomalous distributions. The nominal and anomalous distributions are unknown . We study the tradeoff among the probabilities of misclassification error, false alarm and false reject for tests that satisfy weak conditions on the rate of decrease of these error probabilities as a function of sequence length. Specifically, we propose a threshold-based test that ensures exponential decay of misclassification error and false alarm probabilities. We study two constraints on the false reject probability, with one constraint being that it is a non-vanishing constant and the other being that it has an exponential decay rate. For both cases, we characterize bounds on the false reject probability, as a function of the threshold, for each pair of nominal and anomalous distributions and demonstrate the optimality of our test under the generalized Neyman-Pearson criterion. We first consider the case of at most one outlying sequence and then generalize our results to the case of multiple outlying sequences where the number of outlying sequences is unknown and each outlying sequence can follow a different anomalous distribution.},

The principal tool behind this converse proof is a new measure of dependence between two random variables called wringing dependence, as it is inspired by Ahlswede’s wringing technique. The $O(1/\sqrt {n})$ gap is shown to hold for any channel satisfying certain regularity conditions, which includes all discrete-memoryless channels and the Gaussian multiple-access channel. Exact upper bounds as a function of the probability of error are proved for the coefficient in the $O(1/\sqrt {n})$ term, although for most channels they do not match existing achievable bounds.},

  abstract     = {We study the dihedral multi-reference alignment problem of estimating the orbit of a signal from multiple noisy observations of the signal, acted on by random elements of the dihedral group. We show that if the group elements are drawn from a generic distribution, the orbit of a generic signal is uniquely determined from the second moment of the observations. This implies that the optimal estimation rate in the high noise regime is proportional to the square of the variance of the noise. This is the first result of this type for multi-reference alignment over a non-abelian group with a non-uniform distribution of group elements. Based on tools from invariant theory and algebraic geometry, we also delineate conditions for unique orbit recovery for multi-reference alignment models over finite groups (namely, when the dihedral group is replaced by a general finite group) when the group elements are drawn from a generic distribution. Finally, we design and study numerically three computational frameworks for estimating the signal based on group synchronization, expectation-maximization, and the method of moments.},

The structure and existence of deterministic and stationary coding policies that are optimal for the infinite horizon average cost (distortion) problem are established. Prior results studying the optimality of zero-delay codes for Markov sources for infinite horizons either considered finite alphabet sources or, for the $\mathbb {R}^{d}$ -valued case, only showed the existence of deterministic and non-stationary Markov coding policies or those which are randomized. In addition to existence results, for finite blocklength (horizon) $T$ the performance of an optimal coding policy is shown to approach the infinite time horizon optimum at a rate $O\left({\frac {1}{T}}\right)$ . This gives an explicit rate of convergence that quantifies the near-optimality of finite window (finite-memory) codes among all optimal zero-delay codes.},

  abstract     = {Sequences with low aperiodic autocorrelation and crosscorrelation are used in communications and remote sensing. Golay and Shapiro independently devised a recursive construction that produces families of complementary pairs of binary sequences. In the simplest case, the construction produces the Rudin–Shapiro sequences, and in general it produces what we call Golay–Rudin–Shapiro sequences. Calculations by Littlewood show that the Rudin–Shapiro sequences have low mean square autocorrelation. A sequence’s peak sidelobe level is its largest magnitude of autocorrelation over all nonzero shifts. Høholdt, Jensen, and Justesen showed that there is some undetermined positive constant $A$ such that the peak sidelobe level of a Rudin–Shapiro sequence of length $2^{n}$ is bounded above by $A(1.842626\ldots)^{n}$ , where $1.842626\ldots $ is the positive real root of $X^{4}-3 X-6$ . We show that the peak sidelobe level is bounded above by $5(1.658967\ldots)^{n-4}$ , where $1.658967\ldots $ is the real root of $X^{3}+X^{2}-2 X-4$ . Any exponential bound with lower base will fail to be true for almost all $n$ , and any bound with the same base but a lower constant prefactor will fail to be true for at least one $n$ . We provide a similar bound on the peak crosscorrelation (largest magnitude of crosscorrelation over all shifts) between the sequences in each Rudin–Shapiro pair. The methods that we use generalize to all families of complementary pairs produced by the Golay–Rudin–Shapiro recursion, for which we obtain bounds on the peak sidelobe level and peak crosscorrelation with the same exponential growth rate as we obtain for the original Rudin–Shapiro sequences.},

  abstract     = {Due to wide applications of binary sequences with a low correlation to communications, various constructions of such sequences have been proposed in the literature. Many efforts have been made to construct good binary sequences with various lengths. However, most of the known constructions make use of the multiplicative cyclic group structure of finite field $\mathbb {F}_{2^{n}}$ for a positive integer $n$ . It is often overlooked in this community that all $2^{n}+1$ rational places (including “the place at infinity”) of the rational function field over $\mathbb {F}_{2^{n}}$ form a cyclic structure under an automorphism of order $2^{n}+1$ . In this paper, we make use of this cyclic structure to provide an explicit construction of binary sequences with a low correlation of length $2^{n}+1$ via cyclotomic function fields over $\mathbb {F}_{2^{n}}$ . Each family of our sequences has size $2^{n}-1$ and its correlation is upper bounded by $\lfloor 2^{(n+2)/2}\rfloor $ . To the best of our knowledge, this is the first construction of binary sequences with a low correlation of length $2^{n}+1$ . Moreover, our sequences can be constructed explicitly and have competitive parameters. In particular, compared with the Gold sequences of length $2^{n}-1$ for even $n$ , our sequences have a smaller correlation and a larger length although the family size of our sequences is slightly smaller.},

This includes the celebrated LLL algorithm (Lenstra, Lenstra, Lovasz, 1982), as well as adaptations of associated algorithms such as the Nearest Plane Algorithm of Babai (1986). Interestingly, the adaptation of LLL to binary codes can be interpreted as an algorithmic version of the bound of Griesmer (1960) on the minimal distance of a code. Using these algorithms, we demonstrate—both with a heuristic analysis and in practice—a small polynomial speed-up over the Information-Set Decoding algorithm of Lee and Brickell (1988) for random binary codes. This appears to be the first such speed-up that is not based on a time-memory trade-off. The above speed-up should be read as a very preliminary example of the potential of a reduction theory for codes, for example in cryptanalysis.},

  abstract     = {The six infinite families of power APN functions are among the oldest known instances of APN functions, and it has been conjectured in 2000 that they exhaust all possible power APN functions. Another long-standing open problem is that of the Walsh spectrum of the Dobbertin power family, which is still unknown. Those of Kasami, Niho and Welch functions are known, but not the precise values of their Walsh transform, with rare exceptions. One promising approach that could lead to the resolution of these problems is to consider alternative representations of the functions in questions. We derive alternative representations for the infinite APN monomial families. We show how the Niho, Welch, and Dobbertin functions can be represented as the composition $x^{i} \circ x^{1/j}$ of two power functions, and prove that our representations are optimal, i.e. no two power functions of lesser algebraic degree can be used to represent the functions in this way. We investigate compositions $x^{i} \circ L \circ x^{1/j}$ for a linear polynomial $L$ , show how the Kasami functions in odd dimension can be expressed in this way with $i=j$ being a Gold exponent and compute all APN functions of this form for $n \le 9$ and for $L$ with binary coefficients, thereby showing that our theoretical constructions exhaust all possible cases. We present observations and data on power functions with exponent $\sum _{i = 1}^{k-1} 2^{2ni} - 1$ which generalize the inverse and Dobbertin families. We present data on the Walsh spectrum of the Dobbertin function for $n \le 35$ , and conjecture its exact form. As an application of our results, we determine the exact values of the Walsh transform of the Kasami function at all points of a special form. Computations performed for $n\leq 21$ show that these points cover about 2/3 of the field.},

This connection allows us to derive two types of sequences with good correlation properties. The first type consists of sequences having optimal correlation with respect to the Sarwate bound. Our constructions are based on perfect polyphase sequences. The number of perfect sequences with optimal correlation depends on the existence of circular Florentine arrays, which improves the previous known results. The second type is about multiple ZCZ sequence sets with low inter-set cross-correlation. Each generated ZCZ sequence set is optimal with respect to the Tang-Fan-Matsufuji bound, and each sequence in each set is perfect. In addition, any two sequences from distinct ZCZ sequence sets possess optimal inter-set cross-correlation with respect to the Sarwate bound. Compared with the previous results, the number of ZCZ sequence sets with optimal inter-set cross-correlation property is improved, because of the existence of circular Florentine arrays.},

  abstract     = {Recently, Liu and Zhang studied the rather challenging problem of time series forecasting from the perspective of compressed sensing. They proposed a no-learning method, named Convolution Nuclear Norm Minimization (CNNM), and proved that CNNM can exactly recover the future part of a series from its observed part, provided that the series is convolutionally low-rank. While impressive, the convolutional low-rankness condition may not be satisfied whenever the series is far from being seasonal, and is in fact brittle to the presence of trends and dynamics. This paper tries to approach the issues by integrating a learnable, orthonormal transformation into CNNM, with the purpose for converting the series of involute structures into regular signals of convolutionally low-rank. We prove that the resultant model, termed Learning-Based CNNM (LbCNNM), strictly succeeds in identifying the future part of a series, as long as the transform of the series is convolutionally low-rank. To learn proper transformations that may meet the required success conditions, we devise an interpretable method based on Principal Component Pursuit (PCP). Equipped with this learning method and some elaborate data argumentation skills, LbCNNM not only can handle well the major components of time series (including trends, seasonality and dynamics), but also can make use of the forecasts provided by some other forecasting methods; this means LbCNNM can be used as a general tool for model combination. Extensive experiments on 100,452 real-world time series from Time Series Data Library (TSDL) and M4 Competition (M4) demonstrate the superior performance of LbCNNM.},

This improves upon the well-known $O\left({n^{-\frac {1}{2}}}\right)$ convergence rate of the orthogonal greedy algorithm in many cases, most notably for dictionaries corresponding to shallow neural networks. These results hold under no additional assumptions on the dictionary beyond the decay rate of the entropy of its convex hull. In addition, they are robust to noise in the target function and can be extended to convergence rates on the interpolation spaces of the variation norm. We show empirically that the predicted rates are obtained for the dictionary corresponding to shallow neural networks with Heaviside activation function in two dimensions. Finally, we show that these improved rates are sharp and prove a negative result showing that the iterates generated by the orthogonal greedy algorithm cannot in general be bounded in the variation norm of $\mathbb {D}$ .},

One of the defining features of group testing is whether the tests are adaptive (i.e., a given test can be chosen based on all previous outcomes) or non-adaptive (i.e., all tests must be chosen in advance). In this paper, building on the success of binary splitting techniques in noiseless group testing (Hwang, 1972), we introduce noisy group testing algorithms that apply noisy binary search as a subroutine. We provide three variations of this approach with increasing complexity, culminating in an algorithm that succeeds using a number of tests that matches the best known previously (Scarlett, 2019), while overcoming fundamental practical limitations of the existing approach, and more precisely capturing the dependence of the number of tests on the error probability. We provide numerical experiments demonstrating that adaptive group testing strategies based on noisy binary search can be highly effective in practice, using significantly fewer tests compared to state-of-the-art non-adaptive strategies.},

Considering an arbitrary function, a basic achievable lower bound for distribution privacy is provided that does not depend on $n$ and corresponds to worst-case privacy. Worst-case privacy equals the logsum cardinalities of inverse atoms under the given function, with the number of summands decreasing as the querier recovers the function with improving accuracy. Next, upper (converse) and lower (achievability) bounds for distribution privacy, dependent on $n$ , are developed. The former improves upon worst-case privacy and the latter does so under suitable assumptions; both converge to it as $n$ grows.

However, in a simple Gaussian setting, both the CMI and the CIMI bounds are order-wise worse than that by Bu et al. This observation motivated us to propose the bound, which overcomes this issue by reducing the conditioning terms in the conditional mutual information. In the process of establishing this bound, a conditional decoupling lemma is established, which also leads to a meaningful dichotomy and comparison among these information-theoretic bounds. As an application of the proposed bound, we analyze the noisy and iterative stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics and provide an upper bound on its generalization error.},

  abstract     = {We propose novel randomized optimization methods for high-dimensional convex problems based on restrictions of variables to random subspaces. We consider oblivious and data-adaptive subspaces and study their approximation properties via convex duality and Fenchel conjugates. A suitable adaptive subspace can be generated by sampling a correlated random matrix whose second order statistics mirror the input data. We illustrate that the adaptive strategy can significantly outperform the standard oblivious sampling method, which is widely used in the recent literature. We show that the relative error of the randomized approximations can be tightly characterized in terms of the spectrum of the data matrix and Gaussian width of the dual tangent cone at optimum. We develop lower bounds for both optimization and statistical error measures based on concentration of measure and Fano’s inequality. We then present the consequences of our theory with data matrices of varying spectral decay profiles. Experimental results show that the proposed approach enables significant speed ups in a wide variety of machine learning and optimization problems including logistic regression, kernel classification with random convolution layers and shallow neural networks with rectified linear units.},

  abstract     = {Recent advances in noiseless non-adaptive group testing have led to a precise asymptotic characterization of the number of tests required for high-probability recovery in the sublinear regime $k = n^{\theta }$ (with $\theta \in (0,1)$ ), with $n$ individuals among which $k$ are infected. However, the required number of tests may increase substantially under real-world practical constraints, notably including bounds on the maximum number $\Delta $ of tests an individual can be placed in, or the maximum number $\Gamma $ of individuals in a given test. While previous works have given recovery guarantees for these settings, significant gaps remain between the achievability and converse bounds. In this paper, we substantially or completely close several of the most prominent gaps. In the case of $\Delta $ -divisible items, we show that the definite defectives (DD) algorithm coupled with a random regular design is asymptotically optimal in dense scaling regimes, and optimal to within a factor of e more generally; we establish this by strengthening both the best known achievability and converse bounds. In the case of $\Gamma $ -sized tests, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the regime $\Gamma = \Theta (1)$ , and again establish a precise threshold proving the asymptotic optimality of SCOMP (a slight refinement of DD) equipped with a tailored pooling scheme. Finally, for each of these two settings, we provide near-optimal adaptive algorithms based on sequential splitting, and provably demonstrate gaps between the performance of optimal adaptive and non-adaptive algorithms.},

  abstract     = {We propose a novel stochastic network model, called Fractal Gaussian Network (FGN), that embodies well-defined and analytically tractable fractal structures. Such fractal structures have been empirically observed in diverse applications. FGNs interpolate continuously between the popular purely random geometric graphs (a.k.a. the Poisson Boolean network), and random graphs with increasingly fractal behavior. In fact, they form a parametric family of sparse random geometric graphs that are parametrized by a fractality parameter $\nu $ which governs the strength of the fractal structure. FGNs are driven by the latent spatial geometry of Gaussian Multiplicative Chaos (GMC), a canonical model of fractality in its own right. We asymptotically characterize the expected number of edges, triangles, cliques and hub-and-spoke motifs in FGNs, unveiling a distinct pattern in their scaling with the size parameter of the network. We then examine the natural question of detecting the presence of fractality and the problem of parameter estimation based on observed network data, in addition to fundamental properties of the FGN as a random graph model. We also explore fractality in community structures by unveiling a natural stochastic block model in the setting of FGNs. Finally, we substantiate our results with phenomenological analysis of the FGN in the context of available scientific literature for fractality in networks, including applications to real-world massive network data.},

To elucidate their capabilities and limitations for graph classification, we investigate their power to generate well-separated embedding vectors for graphs sampled from different random graph models, which correspond to different class-conditional distributions in a classification problem. It has been recognized that metric properties of learned representations are important for reduction of complexity of classifiers trained on them. Additionally, we show that inability to generate well-separated embedding vectors for two different graph models implies information-theoretic indistinguishability of these models based on noise-perturbed embedding vectors of sample graphs. We consider graph models arising from graphons, which parametrize all infinite exchangeable graph models. We precisely characterize, in terms of degree profile closeness, the set of graphon pairs that are indistinguishable (in metric and information-theoretic senses) by a GCN with depth at least logarithmic in sample graph size. Outside this set, a very simple architecture suffices for distinguishability. We then exhibit a concrete, infinite set of graphon pairs that are well-separated in cut distance and are indistinguishable by a GCN. These results theoretically match empirical observations of several prior works. Finally, we give empirical results on synthetic and real graph classification datasets, giving some indication that degree profile closeness gives rise to indistinguishability of graph distributions in real datasets, even beyond our theoretical framework.},

To prove this result, we introduce a notion of covering radius which measures the spread of an error from its syndrome. We believe this notion could find application beyond the decoding problem. We also perform numerical simulations, which show that our Union-Find decoder outperforms the belief propagation decoder in the low error rate regime in the case of a quantum LDPC code with length 3600.},

Despite extensive research on these schemes, there has been very little study on optimizing the quantum communication cost during recovery. Recently, we initiated the study of communication efficient quantum threshold secret sharing (CE-QTS) schemes. These schemes reduce the communication complexity in QTS schemes by accessing $d&amp;gt;k$ parties for recovery; here $d$ is fixed ahead of encoding the secret. In contrast to the standard QTS schemes which require $k$ qudits for recovering each qudit in the secret, these schemes have a lower communication cost of $\frac {d}{d-k+1}$ . In this paper, we further develop the theory of communication efficient quantum threshold schemes. Here, we propose universal CE-QTS schemes which reduce the communication cost for all $d&amp;gt;k$ simultaneously. We provide a framework based on ramp quantum secret sharing to construct CE-QTS and universal CE-QTS schemes. We give another construction for universal CE-QTS schemes based on Staircase codes. We derived a lower bound on communication complexity and show that our constructions are optimal. Finally, an information theoretic model is developed to analyse CE-QTS schemes and the lower bound on communication complexity is proved again using this model.},

  abstract     = {The Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (BCH) codes are a well-studied subclass of cyclic codes that have found numerous applications in error correction and notably in quantum information processing. They are widely used in data storage and communication systems. A subclass of attractive BCH codes is the narrow-sense BCH codes over the Galois field ${\mathrm {GF}}(q)$ with length $q+1$ , which are closely related to the action of the projective general linear group of degree two on the projective line. Despite its interest, not much is known about this class of BCH codes. This paper aims to study some of the codes within this class and specifically narrow-sense antiprimitive BCH codes (these codes are also linear complementary duals (LCD) codes that have interesting practical recent applications in cryptography, among other benefits). We shall use tools and combine arguments from algebraic coding theory, combinatorial designs, and group theory (group actions, representation theory of finite groups, etc.) to investigate narrow-sense antiprimitive BCH Codes and extend results from the recent literature. Notably, the dimension, the minimum distance of some $q$ -ary BCH codes with length $q+1$ , and their duals are determined in this paper. The dual codes of the narrow-sense antiprimitive BCH codes derived in this paper include almost MDS codes. Furthermore, the classification of ${\mathrm {PGL}}(2, p^{m})$ -invariant codes over ${\mathrm {GF}}(p^{h})$ is completed. As an application of this result, the $p$ -ranks of all incidence structures invariant under the projective general linear group ${\mathrm {PGL}}(2, p^{m})$ are determined. Furthermore, infinite families of narrow-sense BCH codes admitting a 3-transitive automorphism group are obtained. Via these BCH codes, a coding-theory approach to constructing the Witt spherical geometry designs is presented. The BCH codes proposed in this paper are good candidates for permutation decoding, as they have a relatively large group of automorphisms.},

  abstract     = {We study the problem of erasure correction (node repair) for regenerating codes defined on graphs wherein the cost of transmitting the information to the failed node depends on the graphical distance from this node to the helper vertices of the graph. The information passed to the failed node from the helpers traverses several vertices of the graph, and savings in communication complexity can be attained if the intermediate vertices process the information rather than simply relaying it toward the failed node. We derive simple information-theoretic bounds on the amount of information communicated between the nodes in the course of the repair. Next we show that Minimum Storage Regenerating (MSR) codes can be modified to perform the intermediate processing, thereby attaining the lower bound on the information exchange on the graph. We also consider node repair when the underlying graph is random, deriving conditions on the parameters that support recovery of the failed node with communication complexity smaller than required by the simple relaying.},

  abstract     = {For the recently developed quasi-reversible BCH codes with long lengths and high error-correcting capability, this paper is aimed at proposing a new and faster decoding procedure. It consists of four steps: 1) compute the consecutive syndromes; 2) calculate the syndrome functions by the forward and backward recursions; 3) solve a linear subsystem together with one matrix multiplication in order to find an error-locator polynomial; 4) determine the errors from the obtained polynomial by using the root-finding algorithm. This procedure, especially in Steps 2 and 3, differs greatly from the conventional procedures, which determine an error-locator polynomial directly from solving a linear system with the aid of the consecutive syndromes. The key idea behind this decoding technique is that the computational complexity of such a small subsystem instead of an originally large linear system can be significantly reduced, although there are additional forward and backward syndrome calculations with low complexity increasing. Finally, the illustrative examples and numerical simulations can be helpful to demonstrate the accuracy and efficacy of the presented decoding technique at different error-correcting capabilities.},

  abstract     = {Insertion–deletion codes (insdel codes for short) play an important role in synchronization error correction. The higher the minimum insdel distance, the more insdel errors the code can correct. Haeupler and Shahrasbi established the Singleton bound for insdel codes: the minimum insdel distance of any $[n,k]$ linear code over $\mathbb {F}_{q}$ satisfies $d\leq 2n-2k+2$ . There have been some constructions of insdel codes through Reed-Solomon codes with high capabilities, but none has come close to this bound. Recently, Do Duc et al. showed that the minimum insdel distance of any $[n,k]$ Reed-Solomon code is no more than $2n-2k$ if $q$ is large enough compared to the code length $n$ ; optimal codes that meet the new bound were also constructed explicitly. The contribution of this paper is twofold. We first show that the minimum insdel distance of any $[n,k]$ linear code over $\mathbb {F}_{q}$ satisfies $d\leq 2n-2k$ if $n &amp;gt; k &amp;gt; 1$ . This result improves and generalizes the previously known results in the literature. We then give a sufficient condition under which the minimum insdel distance of a 2-D Reed-Solomon code of length $n$ over $\mathbb {F}_{q}$ is exactly equal to $2n-4$ . As a consequence, we show that the sufficient condition is not hard to achieve; we explicitly construct an infinite family of optimal 2-D Reed-Somolom codes meeting the bound.},

  abstract     = {Linear codes with few weights have applications in consumer electronics, communications, data storage systems, secret sharing, authentication codes, and association schemes. As a special class of linear codes, minimal linear codes have important applications in secret sharing and secure computation of data between two parties. The construction of minimal linear codes with new and desirable parameters is an interesting research topic in coding theory and cryptography. Recently, Mesnager et.al. stated that “constructing linear codes with good parameters from non-weakly regular bent functions is an interesting problem.” The goal of this paper is to construct linear codes with two or three weights from non-weakly regular bent functions over finite fields and analyze the minimality of the constructed linear codes. In doing so, we draw inspiration from a paper by Mesnager in which she constructed linear codes with small weights from weakly regular bent functions based on a generic construction method. First, we recall the definitions of the subsets $B_{+}(f)$ and $B_{-}(f)$ associated with a non-weakly regular bent function $f$ . Next, we construct two- or three-weight linear $p$ -ary codes on these sets using duals of the non-weakly regular bent functions that are also bent. We note that the constructed linear codes are minimal in almost all cases. Moreover, when $f$ is a non-weakly regular bent function in a certain subclass of Generalized Maiorana-McFarland bent functions, we determine the weight distributions of the corresponding linear codes. As far as we know, the construction of linear codes from non-weakly regular bent functions over finite fields is first studied in the literature by the second author in his dissertation.},

Such codes correspond to lattices in $M_{n}(\mathbb {C})$ with dimension smaller than $2n^{2}$ . Currently, very little is known about their DMT, except in the case $m=1$ , corresponding to the multiple input single output (MISO) channel. Further, apart from the MISO case, no DMT optimal asymmetric codes are known. We first discuss previous criteria used to analyze the DMT of space-time codes and comment on why these methods fail when applied to asymmetric codes. We then consider two special classes of asymmetric codes where the code-words are restricted to either real or quaternion matrices. We prove two separate diversity-multiplexing gain trade-off (DMT) upper bounds for such codes and provide a criterion for a lattice code to achieve these upper bounds. We also show that lattice codes based on $\mathbb {Q}$ -central division algebras satisfy this optimality criterion. As a corollary this result provides a DMT classification for all $\mathbb {Q}$ -central division algebra codes that are based on standard embeddings. While the $\mathbb {Q}$ -central division algebra based codes achieve the largest possible DMT of a code restricted to either real or quaternion space, they still fall short of the optimal DMT apart from the MISO case.},

  abstract     = {Minimal linear codes have significant applications in secret sharing schemes and secure two-party computation. When they are defined over finite fields, those codes have been intensively studied, especially in recent years, but they have been firstly partially characterized by Ashikhmin and Barg since 1998. Next, they were completely characterized in 2018 by Ding, Heng, and Zhou in terms of the minimum and maximum nonzero weights in the corresponding codes. Since then, many construction methods for minimal linear codes over finite fields throughout algebraic and geometric approaches have been proposed in the literature. In particular, the algebraic approach gives rise to minimal codes from (cryptographic) functions. Linear codes over finite fields have been expanded into the collection of acceptable alphabets for codes and study codes over finite commutative rings. A natural way to extend the known results available in the literature is to consider minimal linear codes over commutative rings with unity. In extending coding theory to codes over rings, several essential principles must be considered. Particularly extending the minimality property from finite fields to rings and creating such codes is not simple. Such an extension offers more flexibility in the construction of minimal codes. The present article investigates one-dimensional minimal linear codes over the rings $\mathbb {Z}_{p^{n}}$ (where $p$ is a prime) and $\mathbb {Z}_{p^{m}q^{n}}$ (where $p &amp;lt; q$ are distinct primes and $m\leq n$ ). Our ultimate objective is to characterize such codes’ minimality and design minimal linear codes over the considered rings. Given our objective, we first introduced the notion of minimal codes over (commutative) rings and succeeded in deriving simple characterization of one-dimensional minimal linear codes over the underlying rings mentioned above. Our new algebraic approach allows designing new minimal linear codes. Almost minimal codes over rings are also presented. To the best of our knowledge, the present paper offers a wide variety of minimal codes over (commutative) rings for the first time. Novel perspectives and developments in this direction are expected in the future.},

The notion of Voronoi-reduced basis is introduced to restrict the space of solutions to a binary set. On the one hand, this problem is shown to be equivalent to computing a continuous piecewise linear (CPWL) function restricted to the fundamental parallelotope. On the other hand, it is known that any function computed by a ReLU feed-forward neural network is CPWL. As a result, we count the number of affine pieces in the CPWL decoding function to characterize the complexity of the decoding problem. It is exponential in the space dimension $n$ , which induces shallow neural networks of exponential size. For structured lattices we show that folding, a technique equivalent to using a deep neural network, enables to reduce this complexity from exponential in $n$ to polynomial in $n$ . Regarding unstructured MIMO lattices, in contrary to dense lattices many pieces in the CPWL decoding function can be neglected for quasi-optimal decoding on the Gaussian channel. This makes the decoding problem easier and it explains why shallow neural networks of reasonable size are more efficient with this category of lattices (in low to moderate dimensions).},

  abstract     = {Let $W$ be a binary-input memoryless symmetric (BMS) channel with Shannon capacity $I(W)$ and fix any $\alpha &amp;gt; 0$ . We construct, for any sufficiently small $\delta &amp;gt; 0$ , binary linear codes of block length $O(1/\delta ^{2+\alpha })$ and rate $I(W)-\delta $ that enable reliable communication on $W$ with quasi-linear time encoding and decoding. Shannon’s noisy coding theorem established the existence of such codes (without efficient constructions or decoding) with block length $O(1/\delta ^{2})$ . This quadratic dependence on the gap $\delta $ to capacity is known to be best possible. Our result thus yields a constructive version of Shannon’s theorem with near-optimal convergence to capacity as a function of the block length. This resolves a central theoretical challenge associated with the attainment of Shannon capacity. Previously such a result was only known for the erasure channel. Our codes are a variant of Arıkan’s polar codes based on multiple carefully constructed local kernels, one for each intermediate channel that arises in the decoding. A crucial ingredient in the analysis is a strong converse of the noisy coding theorem when communicating using random linear codes on arbitrary BMS channels. Our converse theorem shows extreme unpredictability of even a single message bit for random coding at rates slightly above capacity.},

  abstract     = {The mutual information (MI) of Gaussian multi-input multi-output (MIMO) channels has been evaluated by utilizing random matrix theory (RMT) and shown to asymptotically follow Gaussian distribution, where the ergodic mutual information (EMI) converges to a deterministic quantity. However, with non-Gaussian channels, there is a bias between the EMI and its deterministic equivalent (DE), whose evaluation is not available in the literature. This bias of the EMI is related to the bias for the trace of the resolvent in large RMT. In this paper, we first derive the bias for the trace of the resolvent, which is further extended to compute the bias for the linear spectral statistics (LSS). Then, we apply the above results on non-Gaussian MIMO channels to determine the bias for the EMI. It is also proved that the bias for the EMI is −0.5 times of that for the variance of the MI. Finally, the derived bias is utilized to modify the central limit theory (CLT) and calculate the outage probability. Numerical results show that the modified CLT significantly outperforms previous methods in approximating the distribution of the MI and improves the accuracy for the outage probability evaluation.},

Over 15 years before, in an unpublished work, he also established a well-known inequality for the entropy of an integer-valued random variable of given variance. In this paper, we establish a link between the two works by Massey in the more general framework of the relationship between discrete (absolute) entropy and continuous (differential) entropy. Two approaches are given in which the discrete entropy (or Rényi entropy) of an integer-valued variable can be upper bounded using the differential (Rényi) entropy of some suitably chosen continuous random variable. As an application, lower bounds on guessing entropy and guessing moments are derived in terms of entropy or Rényi entropy (without side information) and conditional entropy or Arimoto conditional entropy (when side information is available).},

Our bound is obtained by considering a multicast transmission over a two-user broadcast channel with decoding metrics $q$ and $\rho $ at the receivers, referred to as $(q,\rho)$ -surely degraded. This channel has the property that the intersection event of correct $q$ -decoding of receiver 1 and erroneous $\rho $ -decoding of receiver 2 has zero probability for any fixed-composition codebook of a certain composition $P$ . Our bound holds in the strong converse sense of an exponential decay of the probability of correct decoding at rates above the bound. Further, we refine the proof and present a bound that is tighter than that of any choice of $\rho $ . Several examples that demonstrate the strict improvement of our bound compared to previous results are analyzed. Finally, we detect equivalence classes of isomorphic channel-metric pairs $(W,q)$ that share the same mismatch capacity. We prove that if the class contains a matched pair, then our bound is tight and the mismatch capacity of the entire class is fully characterized and is equal to the LM rate, which is achievable by random coding, and may be strictly lower that the matched capacity.},

  abstract     = {The problem of variable length and fixed-distortion universal source coding (or D-semifaithful source coding) for stationary and memoryless sources on countably infinite alphabets ( $\infty $ -alphabets) is addressed in this paper. The main results of this work offer a set of sufficient conditions (from weaker to stronger) to obtain weak minimax universality, strong minimax universality, and corresponding achievable rates of convergences for the worst-case redundancy for the family of stationary memoryless sources whose densities are dominated by an envelope function (or the envelope family) on $\infty $ -alphabets. An important implication of these results is that universal D-semifaithful source coding is not feasible for the complete family of stationary and memoryless sources on $\infty $ -alphabets. To demonstrate this infeasibility, a sufficient condition for the impossibility is presented for the envelope family. Interestingly, it matches the well-known impossibility condition in the context of lossless (variable-length) universal source coding. More generally, this work offers a simple description of what is needed to achieve universal D-semifaithful coding for a family of distributions $\Lambda $ . This reduces to finding a collection of quantizations of the product space at different block-lengths — reflecting the fixed distortion restriction — that satisfy two asymptotic requirements: the first is a universal quantization condition with respect to $\Lambda $ , and the second is a vanishing information radius (I-radius) condition for $\Lambda $ reminiscent of the condition known for lossless universal source coding.},

We show that this sequence is monotonically non-decreasing and is constant if and only if the process is white. Furthermore, while the entropy rate is associated with one-sided prediction errors (present from past), the new measure is associated with two-sided prediction errors (present from past and future). Minimizing this measure is then used as an alternative to Burg’s maximum-entropy principle for spectral estimation. We also propose a counterpart for non-stationary processes, by looking at the average trace–inverse of subsets.},

More precisely, we provide lower and upper bounds for the mean squared error of greedy approximation of compound Poisson processes. We are then able to deduce that the greedy approximation error has a sub-exponential and super-polynomial asymptotic behavior.

  abstract     = {The problem of $X$ -secure $T$ -colluding symmetric Private Polynomial Computation (PPC) from coded storage system with $B$ Byzantine and $U$ unresponsive servers is studied in this paper. Specifically, a dataset consisting of $M$ files is stored across $N$ distributed servers according to $(N,K+X)$ Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) codes such that any group of up to $X$ colluding servers can not learn anything about the data files. A user wishes to privately evaluate one out of a set of candidate polynomial functions over the $M$ files from the system, while guaranteeing that any $T$ colluding servers can not learn anything about the identity of the desired function and the user can not learn anything about the $M$ data files more than the desired polynomial function evaluations, in the presence of $B$ Byzantine servers that can send arbitrary responses maliciously to confuse the user and $U$ unresponsive servers that will not respond any information at all. A novel symmetric PPC scheme using Lagrange encoding is proposed. This scheme achieves a PPC rate of $1-\frac {G(K+X-1)+T+2B}{N-U}$ with secrecy rate $\frac {G(K+X-1)+T}{N-(G(K+X-1)+T+2B+U)}$ and finite field size $N+\max {K,N-(G(K+X-1)+T+2B+U)}$ , where $G$ is the maximum degree over all the candidate polynomial functions. Moreover, to further measure the efficiency of PPC schemes, upload cost, query complexity, server computation complexity and decoding complexity required to implement the scheme are analyzed. Remarkably, the PPC setup studied in this paper generalizes all the previous MDS coded PPC setups and the degraded schemes strictly outperform the best known schemes in terms of (asymptotical) PPC rate, which is the main concern of the PPC schemes.},

For a system with $n$ worker nodes where $s$ can be stragglers, these approaches allow for an optimal recovery threshold, whereby the intended result can be decoded as long as any $(n-s)$ worker nodes complete their tasks. However, they suffer from serious numerical issues owing to the condition number of the corresponding real Vandermonde-structured recovery matrices; this condition number grows exponentially in $n$ . We present a novel approach that leverages the properties of circulant permutation matrices and rotation matrices for coded matrix computation. In addition to having an optimal recovery threshold, we demonstrate an upper bound on the worst-case condition number of our recovery matrices which grows as $\approx O(n^{s+5.5})$ ; in the practical scenario where $s$ is a constant, this grows polynomially in $n$ . Our schemes leverage the well-behaved conditioning of complex Vandermonde matrices with parameters on the complex unit circle, while still working with computation over the reals. Exhaustive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method has condition numbers that are orders of magnitude lower than prior work.},

  abstract     = {We consider the problem of designing codes with flexible rate (referred to as rateless codes), for private distributed matrix-matrix multiplication. A master server owns two private matrices $\mathbf {A}$ and $\mathbf {B}$ and hires worker nodes to help computing their multiplication. The matrices should remain information-theoretically private from the workers. Codes with fixed rate require the master to assign tasks to the workers and then wait for a predetermined number of workers to finish their assigned tasks. The size of the tasks, hence the rate of the scheme, depends on the number of workers that the master waits for. We design a rateless private matrix-matrix multiplication scheme, called RPM3. In contrast to fixed-rate schemes, our scheme fixes the size of the tasks and allows the master to send multiple tasks to the workers. The master keeps sending tasks and receiving results until it can decode the multiplication; rendering the scheme flexible and adaptive to heterogeneous environments. Despite resulting in a smaller rate than known straggler-tolerant schemes, RPM3 provides a smaller mean waiting time of the master by leveraging the heterogeneity of the workers. The waiting time is studied under two different models for the workers’ service time. We provide upper and lower bounds for the mean waiting time under both models. In addition, we provide lower bounds on the mean waiting time under the worker-dependent fixed service time model.},

  abstract     = {We investigate the problem of semantic private information retrieval (semantic PIR). In semantic PIR, a user retrieves a message out of $K$ independent messages stored in $N$ replicated and non-colluding databases without revealing the identity of the desired message to any individual database. The messages come with different semantics , i.e., the messages are allowed to have non-uniform a priori probabilities denoted by $(p_{i}&amp;gt;0,\: i \in [K])$ , which are a proxy for their respective popularity of retrieval, and arbitrary message sizes $(L_{i},\: i \in [K])$ . This is a generalization of the classical private information retrieval (PIR) problem, where messages are assumed to have equal message sizes. We derive the semantic PIR capacity for general $K$ , $N$ . The results show that the semantic PIR capacity depends on the number of databases $N$ , the number of messages $K$ , the a priori probability distribution of messages $p_{i}$ , and the message sizes $L_{i}$ . We present two achievable semantic PIR schemes: The first one is a deterministic scheme which is based on message asymmetry. This scheme employs non-uniform subpacketization. The second scheme is probabilistic and is based on choosing one query set out of multiple options at random to retrieve the required message without the need for exponential subpacketization. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the semantic PIR capacity to exceed the classical PIR capacity with equal priors and sizes. Our results show that the semantic PIR capacity can be larger than the classical PIR capacity when longer messages have higher popularities. However, when messages are equal-length, the non-uniform priors cannot be exploited to improve the retrieval rate over the classical PIR capacity. We provide two extensions of the semantic PIR problem, namely, the semantic PIR from MDS-coded databases and the semantic PIR from colluding databases. For both extensions, we derive the exact PIR capacity in addition to providing a corresponding optimal scheme.},

In an idealized setting, a test is positive if and only if at least one infected individual is included and negative otherwise. Significant progress was made in recent years towards understanding the information-theoretic and algorithmic properties in this noiseless setting. In this paper, we consider a noisy variant of group testing where test results are flipped with certain probability, including the realistic scenario where sensitivity and specificity can take arbitrary values. Using a test design where each individual is assigned to a fixed number of tests, we derive explicit algorithmic bounds for two commonly considered inference algorithms and thereby naturally extend the results of Scarlett &amp; Cevher (2016) and Scarlett &amp; Johnson (2020). We provide improved performance guarantees for the efficient algorithms in these noisy group testing models – indeed, for a large set of parameter choices the bounds provided in the paper are the strongest currently proved.},

  abstract     = {Compressed sensing (CS) is a paradigm in which a structured high-dimensional signal may be recovered from random, under-determined, and corrupted linear measurements. Lasso programs are effective for solving CS problems due to their proven ability to leverage underlying signal structure. Three popular Lasso programs are equivalent in a sense and sometimes used interchangeably. Tuned by a governing parameter, each admit an optimal parameter choice. For sparse or low-rank signal structures, this choice yields minimax order-optimal error. While CS is well-studied, existing theory for Lasso programs typically concerns this optimally tuned setting. However, the optimal parameter value for a Lasso program depends on properties of the data, and is typically unknown in practical settings. Performance in empirical problems thus hinges on a program’s parameter sensitivity: it is desirable that small variation about the optimal parameter choice begets small variation about the optimal risk. We examine the risk for these three programs and demonstrate that their parameter sensitivity can differ for the same data. We prove a gauge-constrained Lasso program admits asymptotic cusp-like behaviour of its risk in the limiting low-noise regime. We prove that a residual-constrained Lasso program has asymptotically suboptimal risk for very sparse vectors. These results contrast observations about an unconstrained Lasso program, which is relatively less sensitive to its parameter choice. We support the asymptotic theory with numerical simulations, demonstrating that parameter sensitivity of Lasso programs is readily observed for even modest dimensional parameters. Importantly, these simulations demonstrate regimes in which a Lasso program exhibits sensitivity to its parameter choice, though the other two do not. We hope this work aids practitioners in selecting a Lasso program for their problem.},

Because of sparsity and nonnegativity, the underlying tensor is decomposed into the tensor-tensor product of one sparse nonnegative tensor and one nonnegative tensor. We propose to minimize the sum of the maximum likelihood estimation for the observations with nonnegativity constraints and the tensor $\ell _{0}$ norm for the sparse factor. We show that the error bounds of the estimator of the proposed model can be established under general noise observations. The detailed error bounds under specific noise distributions including additive Gaussian noise, additive Laplace noise, and Poisson observations can be derived. Moreover, the minimax lower bounds are shown to be matched with the established upper bounds up to a logarithmic factor of the sizes of the underlying tensor. These theoretical results for tensors are better than those obtained for matrices, and this illustrates the advantage of the use of nonnegative sparse tensor models for completion and denoising. Numerical experiments are provided to validate the superiority of the proposed tensor-based method compared with the matrix-based approach.},

  abstract     = {In “Unlabeled Sensing”, one observes a set of linear measurements of an underlying signal with incomplete or missing information about their ordering, which can be modeled in terms of an unknown permutation. Previous work on the case of a single noisy measurement vector has exposed two main challenges: 1) a high requirement concerning the signal-to-noise ratio ( $\mathsf {\mathbf {snr}}$ ), i.e., approximately of the order of $n^{5}$ , and 2) a massive computational burden in light of NP-hardness in general. In this paper, we study the case of multiple noisy measurement vectors (MMVs) resulting from a common permutation and investigate to what extent the number of MMVs $m$ facilitates permutation recovery by “borrowing strength”. The above two challenges have at least partially been resolved within our work. First, we show that a large stable rank of the signal significantly reduces the required snr which can drop from a polynomial in $n$ for $m = 1$ to a constant for $m = \Omega (\log n)$ , where $m$ denotes the number of MMVs and $n$ denotes the number of measurements per MV. This bound is shown to be sharp and is associated with a phase transition phenomenon. Second, we propose computational methods for recovering the unknown permutation. For the “oracle case” with known signal, the maximum likelihood (ML) estimator reduces to a linear assignment problem whose global optimum can be obtained efficiently. If both the signal and the permutation are unknown, the problem becomes a quadratic assignment problem; while such a problem is generally NP-hard and hence poses a significant challenge, we propose to tackle it via projected gradient descent with a non-convex constraint set, and establish a monotonic descent property of this scheme. Numerical experiments based on the proposed computational approach confirm the tightness of our theoretical analysis.},

  abstract     = {Consider $n$ random variables forming a Markov random field (MRF). The true model of the MRF is unknown, and it is assumed to belong to a binary set. The objective is to sequentially sample the random variables (one-at-a-time) such that the true MRF model can be detected with the fewest number of samples, while in parallel, the decision reliability is controlled. The core element of an optimal decision process is a rule for selecting and sampling the random variables over time. Such a process, at every time instant and adaptively to the collected data, selects the random variable that is expected to be most informative about the model, rendering an overall minimized number of samples required for reaching a reliable decision. The existing studies on detecting MRF structures generally sample the entire network at the same time and focus on designing optimal detection rules without regard to the data-acquisition process. This paper characterizes the sampling process for general MRFs, which is shown to be optimal in the asymptote of large $n$ . The critical insight in designing the sampling process is devising an information measure that captures the decisions’ inherent statistical dependence over time. Furthermore, when the MRFs can be modeled by acyclic probabilistic graphical models, the sampling rule is shown to take a computationally simple form. Performance analysis for the general case is provided, and the results are interpreted in several special cases: Gaussian MRFs, non-asymptotic regimes, Chernoff’s rule for controlled (active) sensing, and the problem of cluster detection.},

  abstract     = {The capacity of a discrete-time model of optical fiber described by the split-step Fourier method (SSFM) as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio SNR and the number of segments in distance $K$ is considered. It is shown that if $K\geq \text {SNR} ^{2/3}$ and $\text {SNR} \rightarrow \infty $ , the capacity of the resulting continuous-space lossless model is lower bounded by $\frac {1}{2}\log _{2}(1+ \text {SNR}) - \frac {1}{2}+ o(1)$ , where $o(1)$ tends to zero with SNR. As $K \rightarrow \infty $ , the inter-symbol interference (ISI) averages out to zero due to the law of large numbers and the SSFM model tends to a diagonal phase noise model. It follows that, in contrast to the discrete-space model where there is only one signal degree-of-freedom (DoF) at high powers, the number of DoFs in the continuous-space model is at least half of the input dimension $n$ . Intensity-modulation and direct detection achieves this rate. The pre-log in the lower bound when $K= \sqrt [\delta]{ \text {SNR}}$ is generally characterized in terms of $\delta $ . It is shown that if the nonlinearity parameter $\gamma \rightarrow \infty $ , the capacity of the continuous-space model is $\frac {1}{2}\log _{2}(1+ \text {SNR})+ o(1)$ . The SSFM model when the dispersion matrix does not depend on $K$ is considered. It is shown that the capacity of this model when $K= \sqrt [\delta]{ \text {SNR}}$ , $\delta &amp;gt;3$ , and $\text {SNR} \rightarrow \infty $ is $\frac {1}{2n}\log _{2}(1+ \text {SNR})+ O(1)$ . Thus, there is only one DoF in this model. Finally, it is found that the maximum achievable information rates (AIRs) of the SSFM model with back-propagation equalization obtained using numerical simulation follows a double-ascent curve. The AIR characteristically increases with SNR, reaching a peak at a certain optimal power, and then decreases as SNR is further increased. The peak is attributed to a balance between noise and stochastic ISI. However, if the power is further increased, the AIR will increase again, approaching the lower bound $\frac {1}{2}\log (1+ \text {SNR})- \frac {1}{2} + o(1)$ . The second ascent is because the ISI averages out to zero with $K \rightarrow \infty $ sufficiently fast.},

For this channel, it studies the maximum number of bits that can be transmitted reliably per unit-energy as a function of $\ell _{n}$ and $k_{n}$ . When all users are active with probability one, i.e., $\ell _{n} = k_{n}$ , it is demonstrated that, if $k_{n}$ is of an order strictly below $n/\log n$ , then each user can achieve the single-user capacity per unit-energy $(\log e)/N_{0}$ (where $N_{0}/ 2$ is the noise power) by using an orthogonal-access scheme. In contrast, if $k_{n}$ is of an order strictly above $n/\log n$ , then the users cannot achieve any positive rate per unit-energy. Consequently, there is a sharp transition between orders of growth where interference-free communication is feasible and orders of growth where reliable communication at a positive rate per unit-energy is infeasible. It is further demonstrated that orthogonal-access schemes in combination with orthogonal codebooks, which achieve the capacity per unit-energy when the number of users is bounded, can be strictly suboptimal. When the user activity is random, i.e., when $\ell _{n}$ and $k_{n}$ are different, it is demonstrated that, if $k_{n}\log \ell _{n}$ is sublinear in $n$ , then each user can achieve the single-user capacity per unit-energy $(\log e)/N_{0}$ . Conversely, if $k_{n}\log \ell _{n}$ is superlinear in $n$ , then the users cannot achieve any positive rate per unit-energy. Consequently, there is again a sharp transition between orders of growth where interference-free communication is feasible and orders of growth where reliable communication at a positive rate is infeasible that depends on the asymptotic behaviors of both $\ell _{n}$ and $k_{n}$ .

  abstract     = {Under the assumption of perfect channel state information at the transmitters (CSIT), it is known that structured codes offer significant advantages for secure communication in an interference network, e.g., structured jamming signals based on lattice codes may allow a receiver to decode the sum of the jamming signal and the signal being jammed, even though they cannot be separately resolved due to secrecy constraints, subtract the aggregate jammed signal, and then proceed to decode desired codewords at lower power levels. To what extent are such benefits of structured codes fundamentally limited by uncertainty in CSIT? To answer this question, we explore what is perhaps the simplest setting where the question presents itself — a $Z$ interference channel with secure communication. Using sum-set inequalities based on Aligned Images bounds we prove that the GDoF benefits of structured codes are lost completely under finite precision CSIT. The secure GDoF regions of the $Z$ interference channel and the $Z$ broadcast channel are obtained as a byproduct of the analysis.},

  abstract     = {Sparse regression codes with approximate message passing (AMP) decoding have gained much attention in recent times. The concepts underlying this coding scheme extend to unsourced random access with coded compressed sensing (CCS), as first demonstrated by Fengler, Jung, and Caire. Specifically, their approach employs a concatenated coding framework with an inner AMP decoder followed by an outer tree decoder. In their original implementation, these two components work independently of each other, with the tree decoder acting on the static output of the AMP decoder. This article introduces a novel framework where the inner AMP decoder and the outer decoder operate in tandem, dynamically passing information back and forth to take full advantage of the underlying CCS structure. This scheme necessitates the redesign of the outer code as to enable belief propagation in a computationally tractable manner. The enhanced architecture exhibits significant performance benefits over a range of system parameters. The error performance of the proposed scheme can be accurately predicted through a set of equations known as state evolution of AMP. These findings are supported both analytically and through numerical methods.},

  abstract     = {The problem of computing the modulo-sum of independent messages over a finite-field erasure multiple access channel is investigated. The focus is on the role of delayed state feedback for function computation over state dependent multiple access channels. For the two-user case, a set of new outer bounds on the non-feedback computation capacity region are developed, which strictly improve the state of the art by Khisti et al. , 2013. As a result, a previously unsettled question is answered in the affirmative: delayed state feedback strictly increases computation capacity for the two-user erasure multiple access channel universally. The proof leverages the subset entropy inequalities by Madiman and Tetali, 2010, Jiang et al. , 2014, and submodularity of conditional entropies. For the achievability part of the non-feedback case, an achievable computation rate region is derived by generalizing the proposed schemes in Khisti et al. , 2013. Beyond the two-user case, the $K$ -user case is also investigated, with emphasis on the large system regime, where $K$ is the number of users. For the non-feedback case, we propose a grouping scheme which has higher computation rate than that of the conventional “compute-and-forward” ( CF ) scheme. Furthermore, with a growing number of users, the proposed grouping scheme strictly outperforms the conventional “decode-and-forward ( DF )” scheme when the erasure probability is smaller than $1-e^{\frac {1}{e}}\approx 0.3078$ . This is in contrast to the two-user case where the currently best known achievability (Khisti et al. , 2013) coincides with the better one between DF and CF . For the case with delayed state feedback, a new hybrid-ARQ-type scheme is proposed, and in the large system regime, it achieves a computation rate scaling like $\Omega \left({\frac {1}{\log (K)}}\right)$ , much higher than the scaling $\Theta \left({\frac {1}{K}}\right)$ achieved by the grouping scheme without feedback.},

  abstract     = {Multi-antenna cache-aided wireless networks were thought to suffer from a severe feedback bottleneck, since achieving the maximal Degrees-of-Freedom (DoF) performance required feedback from all served users for the known transmission schemes. These feedback costs match the caching gains and thus scale with the number of users. In the context of the $L$ -antenna Multiple-Input Single Output broadcast channel with $K$ receivers, each having normalized cache size $\gamma $ , we pair a fundamentally novel algorithm together with a new information-theoretic converse and identify the optimal tradeoff between feedback costs and DoF performance, by showing that having channel state information from only $C&amp;lt; L$ served users implies an optimal one-shot linear DoF of $C+K\gamma $ . As a side consequence of this, we also now understand that the well known DoF performance $L+K\gamma $ is in fact exactly optimal. In practice, the above means that we are able to disentangle caching gains from feedback costs, thus achieving unbounded caching gains at the mere feedback cost of the multiplexing gain. This further solidifies the role of caching in boosting multi-antenna systems; caching now can provide unbounded DoF gains over multi-antenna downlink systems, at no additional feedback costs. The above results are extended to also include the corresponding multiple transmitter scenario with caches at both ends.},

In addition, we give some necessary and sufficient conditions for $\mathbf {P}$ to be hierarchical, and for the case that $\mathbf {P}$ is hierarchical, we give an explicit criterion for determining whether two codewords in $\hat {\mathbf {H}}$ belong to the same block of $\Lambda $ .

  abstract     = {We present a simple syndrome-based fast Chase decoding algorithm for Reed–Solomon (RS) codes. Such an algorithm was initially presented by Wu (IEEE Trans. IT, Jan. 2012), building on properties of the Berlekamp–Massey (BM) algorithm. Wu devised a fast polynomial-update algorithm to construct the error-locator polynomial (ELP) as the solution of a certain linear-feedback shift register (LFSR) synthesis problem. This results in a conceptually complicated algorithm, divided into 8 subtly different cases. Moreover, Wu’s polynomial-update algorithm is not immediately suitable for working with vectors of evaluations. Therefore, complicated modifications were required in order to achieve a true “one-pass” Chase decoding algorithm, that is, a Chase decoding algorithm requiring $O(n)$ operations per modified coordinate, where $n$ is the RS code length. The main result of the current paper is a conceptually simple syndrome-based fast Chase decoding of RS codes. Instead of developing a theory from scratch, we use the well-established theory of Gröbner bases for modules over $\mathbb {F}_{q}[X]$ (where $\mathbb {F}_{q}$ is the finite field of $q$ elements, for $q$ a prime power). The basic observation is that instead of Wu’s LFSR synthesis problem, it is much simpler to consider “the right” minimization problem over a module . The solution to this minimization problem is a simple polynomial-update algorithm that avoids syndrome updates and works seamlessly with vectors of evaluations. As a result, we obtain a conceptually simple algorithm for one-pass Chase decoding of RS codes. Our algorithm is general enough to work with any algorithm that finds a Gröbner basis for the solution module of the key equation as the initial algorithm (including the Euclidean algorithm), and it is not tied only to the BM algorithm.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we discuss two-stage encoding algorithms capable of correcting a fraction of asymmetric errors. Suppose that the encoder transmits $n$ binary symbols $(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n})$ one-by-one over the Z-channel, in which a 1 is received only if a 1 is transmitted. At some designated moment, say $n_{1}$ , the encoder uses noiseless feedback and adjusts further encoding strategy based on the partial output of the channel $(y_{1},\ldots,y_{n_{1}})$ . The goal is to transmit error-free as much information as possible under the assumption that the total number of errors inflicted by the Z-channel is limited by $\tau n$ , $0 &amp;lt; \tau &amp;lt; 1$ . We propose an encoding strategy that uses a list-decodable code at the first stage and a high-error low-rate code at the second stage. This strategy and our converse result yield that there is a sharp transition at $\tau =\max \limits _{0 &amp;lt; w &amp;lt; 1}\frac {w + w^{3}}{1+4w^{3}}\approx 0.44$ from positive rate to zero rate for two-stage encoding strategies. As side results, we derive bounds on the size of list-decodable codes for the Z-channel and prove that for a fraction $1/4+ \varepsilon $ of asymmetric errors, an error-correcting code contains at most $O(\varepsilon ^{-3/2})$ codewords.},

With the random constellation mapping, the upper bound on the BLER under ML decoding depends on the WEF of the nonbinary i-polar code.

A key part of this work involves representing the deletion channel using a trellis and describing the plus and minus polar-decoding operations on that trellis. In particular, the plus and minus operations can be seen as combining adjacent trellis stages to yield a new trellis with half as many stages. Using this viewpoint, we prove a weak polarization theorem for standard polar codes on the deletion channel. To achieve strong polarization, we modify this scheme by adding guard bands of repeated zeros between various parts of the codeword. This gives a scheme whose rate approaches the mutual information and whose probability of error decays exponentially in the cube-root of the block length. We conclude by showing that this scheme can achieve capacity on the deletion channel by proving that the capacity of the deletion channel can be achieved by a sequence of regular hidden-Markov input distributions.},

This operation preserves the average runtime, analogous to the conservation of Shannon capacity in channel polarization. By leveraging a recursive construction in a similar spirit to the Fast Fourier Transform, the method synthesizes virtual compute nodes with dispersed return time distributions, which we call computational polarization. We show that the runtime distributions form a functional martingale process, identify their limiting distributions in closed-form expressions together with non-asymptotic convergence rates, and prove strong convergence results in Banach spaces. We provide an information-theoretic lower bound on the overall runtime of any coded computation method and show that the computational polarization approach asymptotically achieves the optimal runtime for computing linear functions. An important advantage is the near linear time decoding procedure, which is significantly faster than Maximum Distance Separable codes.},

In particular, LRCs with large availability are highly desirable for parallel reading of hot data. In addition to the above applications in distributed storage systems, it was shown by Fazeli et al. that an LRC with large availability can produce a good private information retrieval (PIR) code which allows to reduce the storage overhead of a PIR protocol. Roughly speaking, one can obtain a good PIR code as long as there exists an LRC with large availability. One of the main tasks in studying PIR codes is to design a $t$ -server PIR code with small length for the given dimension. In particular, the construction of binary PIR codes is of great interest. In this paper, we consider a construction of binary LRCs from polynomial evaluations. As a result, a new class of binary LRCs with large availability are obtained. Applying such LRCs to PIR codes, we obtain a new class of binary PIR codes. On one hand, the binary LRCs constructed are new in the sense that the parameter regime is not covered by the known LRCs. On the other hand, the parameters of PIR codes derived from our LRCs outperform the known results in certain parameter regimes and achieve the lower bound given by Fazeli et al. up to an absolute constant.},

  abstract     = {The von Neumann graph entropy is a measure of graph complexity based on the Laplacian spectrum. It has recently found applications in various learning tasks driven by the networked data. However, it is computationally demanding and hard to interpret using simple structural patterns. Due to the close relation between the Laplacian spectrum and the degree sequence, we conjecture that the structural information, defined as the Shannon entropy of the normalized degree sequence, might be a good approximation of the von Neumann graph entropy that is both scalable and interpretable. In this work, we thereby study the difference between the structural information and the von Neumann graph entropy named as entropy gap . Based on the knowledge that the degree sequence is majorized by the Laplacian spectrum, we for the first time prove that the entropy gap is between 0 and $\log _{2} e$ in any undirected unweighted graphs. Consequently we certify that the structural information is a good approximation of the von Neumann graph entropy that achieves provable accuracy, scalability, and interpretability simultaneously. This approximation is further applied to two entropy-related tasks: network design and graph similarity measure, where a novel graph similarity measure and the corresponding fast algorithms are proposed. Meanwhile, we show empirically and theoretically that maximizing the von Neumann graph entropy can effectively hide the community structure, and then propose an alternative metric called spectral polarization to guide the community obfuscation. Our experimental results on graphs of various scales and types show that the very small entropy gap readily applies to a wide range of simple/weighted graphs. As an approximation of the von Neumann graph entropy, the structural information is the only one that achieves both high efficiency and high accuracy among the prominent methods. It is at least two orders of magnitude faster than SLaQ (Tsitsulin et al. , 2020) with comparable accuracy. Our structural information based methods also exhibit superior performance in downstream tasks such as entropy-driven network design, graph comparison, and community obfuscation.},

  abstract     = {We prove a tight uniform continuity bound for Arimoto’s version of the conditional $\alpha $ -Rényi entropy for the range $\alpha \in [0, 1$ ). This definition of the conditional $\alpha $ -Rényi entropy is the most natural one among the multiple forms which exist in the literature, since it satisfies two desirable properties of a conditional entropy, namely, the fact that conditioning reduces entropy, and that the associated reduction in uncertainty cannot exceed the information gained by conditioning. Furthermore, it has found interesting applications in various information theoretic tasks such as guessing with side information and sequential decoding. This conditional entropy reduces to the conditional Shannon entropy in the limit $\alpha \to 1$ , and this in turn allows us to recover the recently obtained tight uniform continuity bound for the latter from our result. Finally, we apply our result to obtain a tight uniform continuity bound for the conditional $\alpha $ -Rényi entropy of a classical-quantum state, for $\alpha $ in the same range as above. This again yields the corresponding known bound for the conditional entropy of the state in the limit $\alpha \to 1$ .},

First, we prove that the error exponents of the typical random codes under the optimal maximum likelihood (ML) decoder and the SMI decoder are equal. As a corollary to this result, we also show that the error exponents of the expurgated codes under the ML and the SMI decoders are equal. These results strengthen the well-known result due to Csiszár and Körner, according to which, the ML and the maximum-mutual information (MMI) decoders achieve equal random-coding error exponents, since the error exponents of the typical random code and the expurgated code are strictly higher than the random-coding error exponents, at least at low coding rates. The universal optimality of the SMI decoder, in the random-coding error exponent sense, is easily proven by commuting the expectation over the channel noise and the expectation over the ensemble. This commutation can no longer be carried out, when it comes to typical and expurgated exponents. Therefore, the proof of the universal optimality of the SMI decoder must be completely different and it turns out to be highly non-trivial.},

The second-order derivative of Kullback’s inequality, which relates the Kullback-Leibler divergence to Cramér’s rate function, provides a description of the Cramér Rao bound.

This article provides sharp bounds on the entropy concavity deficit, which is the difference between the differential entropy of the mixture and the weighted sum of differential entropies of constituent components. Toward establishing lower and upper bounds on the concavity deficit, results that are of importance in their own right are obtained. In order to obtain nontrivial upper bounds, properties of the skew-divergence are developed and notions of “skew” $f$ -divergences are introduced; a reverse Pinsker inequality and a bound on Jensen-Shannon divergence are obtained along the way. Complementary lower bounds are derived with special attention paid to the case that corresponds to independent summation of a continuous and a discrete random variable. Several applications of the bounds are delineated, including to mutual information of additive noise channels, thermodynamics of computation, and functional inequalities.},

We show that given a more natural distortion measure, fitting the data structure of a directed graph, the method of types cannot be applied. The suggested distortion measure aims to preserves the local structure of a directed graph. We build on the recent work of Barvinok and extend the method of types to the two dimensional setting of directed graphs. We see that the extension is quite natural in many ways.

  abstract     = {A secret-sharing scheme realizes the forbidden graph access structure determined by a graph $G=(V,E)$ if the parties are the vertices of the graph and the subsets that can reconstruct the secret are the pairs of vertices in $E$ (i.e., the edges) and the subsets of at least three vertices. Secret-sharing schemes for forbidden graph access structures defined by bipartite graphs are equivalent to conditional disclosure of secrets (CDS) protocols. We study the complexity of realizing a forbidden graph access structure by linear secret-sharing schemes, which are schemes in which the secret can be reconstructed from the shares by a linear mapping. We provide efficient constructions and lower bounds on the share size of linear secret-sharing schemes for sparse and very dense graphs, closing the gap between upper and lower bounds. Given a sparse (resp. very dense) graph with $n$ vertices and at most $n^{1+\beta }$ edges (resp. at least $\binom {n}{2} - n^{1+\beta }$ edges), for some $0 \leq \beta &amp;lt; 1$ , we construct a linear secret-sharing scheme realizing its forbidden graph access structure with total share size $\tilde {O} (n^{1+\beta /2})$ . Furthermore, we construct linear secret-sharing schemes realizing these access structures in which the size of each share is $\tilde {O} (n^{1/4+\beta /4})$ . We also provide constructions achieving different trade-offs between the size of each share and the total share size. We prove that almost all forbidden graph access structures require linear secret-sharing schemes with total share size $\Omega (n^{3/2})$ ; this shows that the construction of Gay, Kerenidis, and Wee [CRYPTO 2015] is optimal. Furthermore, we show that for every $0 \leq \beta &amp;lt; 1$ there exist a graph with at most $n^{1+\beta }$ edges and a graph with at least $\binom {n}{2}-n^{1+\beta }$ edges such that the total share size in any linear secret-sharing scheme realizing the associated forbidden graph access structures is $\Omega (n^{1+\beta /2})$ . Finally, we show that for every $0 \leq \beta &amp;lt; 1$ there exist a graph with at most $n^{1+\beta }$ edges and a graph with at least $\binom {n}{2}-n^{1+\beta }$ edges such that the size of the share of at least one party in any linear secret-sharing scheme realizing these forbidden graph access structures is $\Omega (n^{1/4+\beta /4})$ .

(the generalized cases IV-V for $q\ge 3$ ) in 2013. Those sequences are presented by the combination of the quaternary standard GCSs and compatible offsets. By providing new compatible offsets based on the factorization of the integer $q$ , we propose two new constructions of $4^{q} $ -QAM GCSs, which have the generalized cases I-V as special cases. The numbers of the proposed GCSs are equal to the product of the number of the quaternary standard GCSs and the number of the compatible offsets. Denote the number of prime factors of $q$ counted with multiplicity by $\Omega (q)$ . The number of new offsets in our first construction is lower bounded by a polynomial of $m$ with degree $\Omega (q)$ , while the numbers of offsets in the generalized cases I-III and IV-V are a linear polynomial and a quadratic polynomial of $m$ , respectively. If $q$ has a prime factor larger than 2, the number of new offsets in our second construction is lower bounded by a polynomial of $m$ with degree $\Omega (q)+1$ . As an example, the new offsets in our two constructions for $q=6$ , whose number is bounded by a cubic polynomial, is also given. The proof in this paper implies that all the mentioned GCSs over QAM can be regarded as projections of Golay complementary arrays of size $2\times 2\times \cdots \times 2$ .},

The proposed scheme is shown to be configurable and suited for modern hierarchical compute architectures such as Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) equipped with multiple nodes, whereby each has many small independent processing units with increased core-to-core communications. The proposed scheme is shown to outperform a few of the well–known earlier strategies in terms of total end-to-end execution time while in presence of slow nodes, called stragglers . This performance advantage is due to the careful design of array codes which distributes the encoding operation over the cluster (slave) nodes at the expense of increased master-slave communication. An interesting trade-off between end-to-end latency and total communication cost is precisely described. In addition, to be able to address an identified problem of scaling stragglers, an asymptotic version of array BP-XOR codes based on projection geometry is proposed at the expense of some computation overhead. A thorough latency analysis is conducted for all schemes to demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves order-optimal computation in both the sublinear as well as the linear regimes in the size of the computed product from an end-to-end delay perspective.},

To enable such private communication, we allow the use of a collection of independent secret keys, each of which is shared amongst a subset of users and is known to the server. The goal is to study properties of the key access structures that make the problem feasible and then design encoding and decoding schemes efficient in the size of the server transmission as well as the sizes of the secret keys. We call this the private index coding problem. We begin by characterizing the key access structures that make private index coding feasible. We also give conditions to check if a given linear scheme is a valid private index code. For up to three users, we characterize the rate region of feasible server transmission and key rates, and show that all feasible rates can be achieved using scalar linear coding and time sharing; we also show that scalar linear codes are sub-optimal for four receivers. The outer bounds used in the case of three users are extended to arbitrary number of users and seen as a generalized version of the well-known polymatroidal bounds for the standard non-private index coding. We also show that the presence of common randomness and private randomness does not change the rate region. Furthermore, we study the case where the server has the ability to multicast to any subset of users, and demonstrate how this flexibility can be used to provide privacy and characterize the minimum number of server multicasts required.},

  abstract     = {We study the problem of private set intersection (PSI). In this problem, there are two entities $E_{i}$ , for $i=1, 2$ , each storing a set $\mathcal {P}_{i}$ , whose elements are picked from a finite set $\mathbb {S}_{K}$ , on $N_{i}$ replicated and non-colluding databases. It is required to determine the set intersection ${\mathcal {P}}_{1} \cap {\mathcal {P}} _{2}$ without leaking any information about the remaining elements to the other entity, and to do this with the least amount of downloaded bits. We first show that the PSI problem can be recast as a multi-message symmetric private information retrieval (MM-SPIR) problem with certain added restrictions. Next, as a stand-alone result, we derive the information-theoretic sum capacity of MM-SPIR, $C_{MM-SPIR}$ . We show that with $K$ messages, $N$ databases, and a given size of the desired message set $P$ , the exact capacity of MM-SPIR is $C_{MM-SPIR} = 1 - \frac {1}{N}$ when $P \leq K-1$ , provided that the entropy of the common randomness $S$ satisfies $H(S) \geq \frac {P}{N-1}$ per desired symbol. When $P = K$ , the MM-SPIR capacity is trivially 1 without the need for any common randomness $S$ . This result implies that there is no gain for MM-SPIR over successive single-message SPIR (SM-SPIR). For the MM-SPIR problem, we present a novel capacity-achieving scheme which builds seamlessly over the near-optimal scheme of Banawan-Ulukus originally proposed for the multi-message PIR (MM-PIR) problem without any database privacy constraints. Surprisingly, our scheme here is exactly optimal for the MM-SPIR problem for any $P$ , in contrast to the scheme for the MM-PIR problem, which was proved only to be near-optimal. Our scheme is an alternative to the successive usage of the SM-SPIR scheme of Sun-Jafar. Based on this capacity result for the MM-SPIR problem, and after addressing the added requirements in its conversion to the PSI problem, we show that the optimal download cost for the PSI problem is given by $\min \left {{\left \lceil{ \frac {P_{1} N_{2}}{N_{2}-1}}\right \rceil, \left \lceil{ \frac {P_{2} N_{1}}{N_{1}-1}}\right \rceil }\right }$ , where $P_{i}$ is the cardinality of set ${\mathcal {P}}_{i}$ .},

  abstract     = {A general class of Bayesian lower bounds when the underlying loss function is a Bregman divergence is demonstrated. This class can be considered as an extension of the Weinstein–Weiss family of bounds for the mean squared error and relies on finding a variational characterization of Bayesian risk. This approach allows for the derivation of a version of the Cramér–Rao bound that is specific to a given Bregman divergence. This new generalization of the Cramér–Rao bound reduces to the classical one when the loss function is taken to be the Euclidean norm. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the new lower bounds, the paper also develops upper bounds on Bayesian risk, which are based on optimal linear estimators. The effectiveness of the new bound is evaluated in the Poisson noise setting.},

  abstract     = {We establish sufficient conditions of exact and almost full recovery of the node partition in Bipartite Stochastic Block Model (BSBM) using polynomial time algorithms. First, we improve upon the known conditions of almost full recovery by spectral clustering algorithms in BSBM. Next, we propose a new computationally simple and fast procedure achieving exact recovery under milder conditions than the state of the art. Namely, if the vertex sets $V_{1}$ and $V_{2}$ in BSBM have sizes $n_{1}$ and $n_{2}$ , we show that the condition $ p = \Omega \left ({\max \left ({\sqrt {\frac {\log {n_{1}}}{n_{1}n_{2}}},\frac {\log {n_{1}}}{n_{2}}}\right )}\right )$ on the edge intensity $p$ is sufficient for exact recovery within $V_{1}$ . This condition exhibits an elbow at $n_{2} \asymp n_{1}\log {n_{1}}$ between the low-dimensional and high-dimensional regimes. The suggested procedure is a variant of Lloyd’s iterations initialized with a well-chosen spectral estimator leading to what we expect to be the optimal condition for exact recovery in BSBM. The optimality conjecture is supported by showing that, for a supervised oracle procedure, such a condition is necessary to achieve exact recovery. The key elements of the proof techniques are different from classical community detection tools on random graphs. Numerical studies confirm our theory, and show that the suggested algorithm is both very fast and achieves almost the same performance as the supervised oracle. Finally, using the connection between planted satisfiability problems and the BSBM, we improve upon the sufficient number of clauses to completely recover the planted assignment.},

  abstract     = {Coded computation techniques provide robustness against straggling workers in distributed computing. However, most of the existing schemes require exact provisioning of the straggling behavior and ignore the computations carried out by straggling workers. Moreover, these schemes are typically designed to recover the desired computation results accurately, while in many machine learning and iterative optimization algorithms, faster approximate solutions are known to result in an improvement in the overall convergence time. In this paper, we first introduce a novel coded matrix-vector multiplication scheme, called coded computation with partial recovery (CCPR) , which benefits from the advantages of both coded and uncoded computation schemes, and reduces both the computation time and the decoding complexity by allowing a trade-off between the accuracy and the speed of computation. We then extend this approach to distributed implementation of more general computation tasks by proposing a coded communication scheme with partial recovery, where the results of subtasks computed by the workers are coded before being communicated. Numerical simulations on a large linear regression task confirm the benefits of the proposed scheme in terms of the trade-off between the computation accuracy and latency.},

High probability generalization bounds for the error probability loss function, as well as for a hinge-type surrogate loss function are provided. A stochastic-gradient based alternating-minimization algorithm for the latter loss function is proposed. In addition, a Gibbs-based algorithm that gradually expurgates an initial codebook from codewords in order to obtain a smaller codebook with improved error probability is proposed, and bounds on its average empirical error and generalization error, as well as a high probability generalization bound, are stated. Various experiments demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithms.

This generalizes linear regression and (real) phase retrieval, and is closely related to convex regression. We study this problem in the high-dimensional setting assuming that $k$ is a fixed constant, and focus on the estimation of the unknown coefficients of the affine functions underlying the model. We analyze a natural alternating minimization (AM) algorithm for the non-convex least squares objective when the design is Gaussian. We show that the AM algorithm, when initialized suitably, converges with high probability and at a geometric rate to a small ball around the optimal coefficients. In order to initialize the algorithm, we propose and analyze a combination of a spectral method and a search algorithm in a low-dimensional space, which may be of independent interest. The final rate that we obtain is near-parametric and minimax optimal (up to a polylogarithmic factor) as a function of the dimension, sample size, and noise variance. In that sense, our approach should be viewed as a direct and implementable method of enforcing regularization to alleviate the curse of dimensionality in problems of the convex regression type. Numerical experiments illustrate the sharpness of our bounds in the various problem parameters.},

  abstract     = {Physical platforms such as trapped ions suffer from coherent noise that does not follow a simple stochastic model. Stochastic errors in quantum systems occur randomly but coherent errors are more damaging since they can accumulate in a particular direction. We consider coherent noise acting transversally, giving rise to an effective error which is a $Z$ -rotation on each qubit by some angle $\theta $ . Rather than address coherent noise through active error correction, we investigate passive mitigation through decoherence free subspaces. In the language of stabilizer codes, we require the noise to preserve the code space, and to act trivially (as the logical identity operator) on the protected information. Thus, we develop necessary and sufficient conditions for all transversal $Z$ -rotations to preserve the code space of a stabilizer code. These conditions require the weight- $2~Z$ -stabilizers to cover all the qubits that are in the support of the $X$ -component of some stabilizer. Furthermore, the weight- $2~Z$ -stabilizers generate a direct product of single-parity-check codes with even block length. By adjusting the sizes of these components, we are able to construct a large family of QECC codes oblivious to coherent noise, one that includes the $[[4L^{2}, 1, 2L]]$ Shor codes. The Shor codes are examples of constant excitation codes, where logical qubits are encoded as a code state that is a sum of physical states indexed by binary vectors with the same weight. Constant excitation codes are oblivious to coherent noise since a transversal $Z$ -rotation acts as a global phase. We prove that a CSS code is oblivious to coherent noise if and only if it is a constant excitation code, and that if the code is error-detecting, then the (constant) weights in different cosets of the $X$ -stabilizers are identical.},

For many such states drawn iid from the ensemble, the asymptotically achievable rate is the number of qubits required to be transmitted per state. The Holevo information is a lower bound for the achievable rate, and is attained for pure state ensembles, or in the related scenario of entanglement-assisted visible compression of mixed states wherein Alice knows what state is drawn. In this paper, we prove a general and robust lower bound on the achievable rate for ensembles of classical states, which holds even in the least demanding setting when Alice and Bob share free entanglement and a constant per-copy error is allowed. We apply the bound to a specific ensemble of only two states and prove a near-maximal separation (saturating the dimension bound in leading order) between the best achievable rate and the Holevo information for constant error. This also implies that the ensemble is incompressible – compression does not reduce the communication cost by much. Since the states are classical , the observed incompressibility is not fundamentally quantum mechanical. We lower bound the difference between the achievable rate and the Holevo information in terms of quantitative limitations to clone the specimen or to distinguish the two classical states.},

In prior work, it has been shown that the number of bins in any equilibrium has to be countable, generalizing a classical result due to Crawford and Sobel who considered sources with density supported on [0, 1]. In this paper, we first refine this result in the context of log-concave sources. For sources with two-sided unbounded support, we prove that, for any finite number of bins, there exists a unique equilibrium. In contrast, for sources with semi-unbounded support, there may be a finite upper bound on the number of bins in equilibrium depending on certain conditions stated explicitly. Moreover, we prove that for log-concave sources, the expected costs of the encoder and the decoder in equilibrium decrease as the number of bins increases. Furthermore, for strictly log-concave sources with two-sided unbounded support, we prove convergence to the unique equilibrium under best response dynamics which starts with a given number of bins, making a connection with the classical theory of optimal quantization and convergence results of Lloyd’s method.

  abstract     = {This paper considers a massive random access problem in which a large number of sporadically active devices wish to communicate with a base station (BS) equipped with massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antennas. Each device is preassigned a unique signature sequence, and the BS identifies the active devices by detecting which sequences are transmitted. This device activity detection problem can be formulated as a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) problem for which the sample covariance matrix of the received signal is a sufficient statistic. The goal of this paper is to characterize the feasible set of problem parameters under which this covariance based approach is able to successfully recover the device activities in the massive MIMO regime. Through an analysis of the asymptotic behaviors of MLE via its associated Fisher information matrix, this paper derives a necessary and sufficient condition on the Fisher information matrix to ensure a vanishing probability of detection error as the number of antennas goes to infinity, based on which a numerical phase transition analysis is obtained. This condition is also examined from a perspective of covariance matching, which relates the phase transition analysis to a recently derived scaling law. Further, we provide a characterization of the distribution of the estimation error in MLE, based on which the error probabilities in device activity detection can be accurately predicted. Finally, this paper studies a random access scheme with joint device activity and data detection and analyzes its performance in a similar way.},

  abstract     = {We present an explicit and efficient algebraic construction of capacity-achieving list decodable codes with both constant alphabet and constant list sizes. More specifically, for any $R \in (0,1)$ and $\epsilon &amp;gt;0$ , we give an algebraic construction of an infinite family of error-correcting codes of rate $R$ , over an alphabet of size $(1/\epsilon)^{O(1/\epsilon ^{2})}$ , that can be list decoded from a $(1-R-\epsilon)$ -fraction of errors with list size at most $\exp (\mathrm {poly}(1/ \epsilon))$ . Moreover, the codes can be encoded in time $\mathrm {poly}(1/ \epsilon,n)$ , the output list is contained in a linear subspace of dimension at most $\mathrm {poly}(1/ \epsilon)$ , and a basis for this subspace can be found in time $\mathrm {poly}(1 /\epsilon, n)$ . Thus, both encoding and list decoding can be performed in fully polynomial-time $\mathrm {poly}(1/ \epsilon,n)$ , except for pruning the subspace and outputting the final list which takes time $\exp (\mathrm {poly}(1/ \epsilon)) \cdot \mathrm {poly} (n)$ . In contrast, prior explicit and efficient constructions of capacity-achieving list decodable codes either required a much higher complexity in terms of $1/ \epsilon $ (and were additionally much less structured), or had super-constant alphabet or list sizes. Our codes are quite natural and structured. Specifically, we use algebraic-geometric (AG) codes with evaluation points restricted to a subfield, and with the message space restricted to a (carefully chosen) linear subspace. Our main observation is that the output list of AG codes with subfield evaluation points is contained in an affine shift of the image of a block-triangular-Toeplitz (BTT) matrix , and that the list size can potentially be reduced to a constant by restricting the message space to a BTT evasive subspace , which is a large subspace that intersects the image of any BTT matrix in a constant number of points. We further show how to explicitly construct such BTT evasive subspaces, based on the explicit subspace designs of Guruswami and Kopparty ( Combinatorica , 2016), and composition.},

We develop repair schemes for one or two erasures for these families of augmented codes. Unlike the repair scheme for two erasures of DM-CC, the repair scheme for two erasures for the augmented codes has no restrictions on the positions of the erasures. When the dimension and base field are fixed, we give examples where ARM and ACar codes provide a lower bandwidth (resp., bitwidth) in comparison with Reed-Solomon (resp., Hermitian) codes.

The second-order term in the asymptotic expansion of the rate of these sequences is also given, and the typical values of the relevant quantities are derived. Several applications of the results are illustrated, including bounds on codes for weight-preserving and run-preserving channels (e.g., the run-preserving insertion-deletion channel), a sphere-packing bound for channels with sparse error patterns, and the asymptotics of constant-weight sub-block constrained sequences. In addition, the asymptotics of a closely related notion— $q$ -ary sequences with fixed Manhattan weight—is briefly discussed, and an application in coding for molecular timing channels is illustrated.},

  abstract     = {Resistive memories, such as phase change memories and resistive random access memories have attracted significant attention in recent years due to their better scalability, speed, rewritability, and yet non-volatility. However, their limited endurance is still a major drawback that has to be improved before they can be widely adapted in large-scale systems. In this work, in order to reduce the wear out of the cells, we propose a new coding scheme, called endurance-limited memories (ELM) codes, that increases the endurance of these memories by limiting the number of cell programming operations. Namely, an $\ell $ -change $t$ -write ELM code is a coding scheme that allows to write $t$ messages into some $n$ binary cells while guaranteeing that each cell is programmed at most $\ell $ times. In case $\ell =1$ , these codes coincide with the well-studied write-once memory (WOM) codes. We study some models of these codes which depend upon whether the encoder knows on each write the number of times each cell was programmed, knows only the memory state, or even does not know anything. For the decoder, we consider these similar three cases. We fully characterize the capacity regions and the maximum sum-rates of three models where the encoder knows on each write the number of times each cell was programmed. In particular, it is shown that in these models the maximum sum-rate is $\log \sum _{i=0}^{\ell } {\binom{t }{ i}}$ . We also study and expose the capacity regions of the models where the decoder is informed with the number of times each cell was programmed. Finally we present the most practical model where the encoder read the memory before encoding new data and the decoder has no information about the previous states of the memory.},

The data stored in these systems has the form of unordered sequences, also called strands , and every strand is synthesized thousands to millions of times, where some of these copies are read back during sequencing. Due to the unordered structure of the strands, an important task in the decoding process is to place them in their correct order. This is usually accomplished by allocating part of the strand for an index. However, in the presence of errors in the index field, important information on the order of the strands may be lost. Clustering-correcting codes ensure that if the distance between the index fields of two strands is small, their data fields have large distance. It is shown how this property enables to place the strands together in their correct clusters even in the presence of errors. We present lower and upper bounds on the size of clustering-correcting codes and an explicit construction of these codes which uses only a single symbol of redundancy. The results are first presented for the Hamming metric and are then extended for the edit distance.},

Further, we demonstrate that hypergraphs of Berge girth larger or equal to 4, respectively larger or equal to 3, yield graph-based asynchronous batch codes, respectively private information retrieval (PIR) codes. We prove a hypergraph-theoretic proposition that the maximum number of hyperedges in a hypergraph of a fixed Berge girth equals the quantity in a certain generalization of the hypergraph-theoretic (6,3)-problem, first posed by Brown, Erdős and Sós. We then apply the constructions and bounds by Erdős, Frankl and Rödl about this generalization of the (6,3)-problem, known as the ( $3\varrho $ -3, $\varrho $ )-problem, to obtain batch code constructions and bounds on the redundancy of the graph-based asynchronous batch and PIR codes. We derive bounds on the optimal redundancy of several families of asynchronous batch codes with the query size $t=2$ . In particular, we show that the optimal redundancy $\rho (k)$ of graph-based asynchronous batch codes of dimension $k$ for $t=2$ is $2\sqrt {k}$ . Moreover, for graph-based asynchronous batch codes with $t \ge 3$ , $\rho (k) = O\left ({{k}^{1/(2-\epsilon)}}\right)$ for any small $\epsilon &amp;gt;0$ .},

We first derive a lower bound on the achievable expected distortion in terms of the empirical statistics of the source sequence, the number of states of the encoder, the number of states of the decoder, their period, and the overall delay. The bound is shown to be asymptotically achievable by universal block codes in the limit of long blocks. We also derive a lower bound to the best achievable excess–distortion probability and discuss situations where it is achievable. Here, of course, source coding and channel coding cannot be completely separated without loss of optimality. Finally, we outline a few extensions of the model considered, such as: (i) incorporating a common reconstruction constraint, (ii) availability of side information at both ends, and (iii) extension to the Shannon channel with causal state information at the encoder. This work both extends and improves on earlier work of the same flavor (Ziv 1980, Merhav 2014), which focused only on the expected distortion, without side information at either end, and without the above mentioned additional ingredients.},

We explore the operational roles of these smooth Rényi entropies by establishing one-shot coding theorems for several information-theoretic problems, including Campbell’s source coding problem, the Arıkan–Massey guessing problem, and the Bunte–Lapidoth task encoding problem. We consider these problems in cases where the errors are non-vanishing and for each problem, we consider two error formalisms: the average and maximum error criteria, where the averaging and maximization are taken with respect to the side-information. Using the one-shot coding theorems, we conclude that Kuzuoka’s smooth conditional Rényi entropy and the conditional smooth-⋆ entropy are the solutions to the problems involving the average and maximum error criteria, respectively. Furthermore, we examine asymptotic expansions of these entropies when the underlying source with its side-information is stationary and memoryless. Applying our asymptotic expansions to the one-shot coding theorems, we derive various fundamental limits for these problems. We show that, under non-degenerate settings, the first-order fundamental limits differ under the average and maximum error criteria. This is in contrast to a different but related setting considered by the present authors [IEEE Trans. Inf. Th., 66(12), 7565–7587, 2020], for variable-length conditional source coding allowing errors, in which the first-order terms are identical but the second-order terms are different under these error criteria.},

The paper also formulates a state dependent nonanticipatory epsilon entropy, in which past reproductions are available to the decoder and not to the encoder, the test channel is specified with respect to an auxiliary (state) random process, and the reproduction process is a causal function of past reproduction and the auxiliary random process. This variation is analogous to the Wyner and Ziv (1976) and Wyner (1978) rate distortion function (RDF), of memoryless sources. It is shown that the operational rate of zero-delay codes, with past reproductions available to the decoder but not to the encoder is bounded below by the state dependent nonanticipatory epsilon entropy rate. For the case of multivariate Gaussian Markov sources with square-error fidelity, the optimal test channel distribution and the complete characterization of the state dependent of nonanticipatory epsilon entropy are derived, and also shown that that the two nonanticipatory epsilon entropies coincide. The derivations are new; they are based on structural properties of the stochastic realizations of the reproduction process that induce the optimal test channel distributions. They are derived using, achievable lower bounds on information theoretic measures, properties of mean-square estimation theory, Hadamard’s inequality, and canonical correlation coefficients of a tuple of multivariate jointly Gaussian random processes. Applications of the nonanticipatory epsilon entropy and its state dependent variation are discussed to the areas of control of unstable Gaussian systems over limited memory channels, design of causal estimators for Gaussian Markov sources with a fidelity criterion, computation of the rate loss of causal and zero-delay codes of Gaussian Markov sources with respect to non-causal codes.},

Modern applications such as the internet, social networks, genomics and proteomics generate graphical data, often at large scale. The large scale argues for the need to compress such data for storage and subsequent processing. Since this data might have several components available in different locations, it is also important to study distributed compression of graphical data. In this paper, we derive a rate region for this problem which is a counterpart of the Slepian–Wolf theorem. We characterize the rate region when the statistical description of the distributed graphical data can be modeled as being one of two types – as a member of a sequence of marked sparse Erdős–Rényi ensembles or as a member of a sequence of marked configuration model ensembles. Our results are in terms of a generalization of the notion of entropy introduced by Bordenave and Caputo in the study of local weak limits of sparse graphs. Furthermore, we give a generalization of this result for Erdős–Rényi and configuration model ensembles with more than two sources.},

It is assumed that channel coefficients are constant real numbers and are available at all transmitters and at all receivers. The main objective of this paper is to characterize the number of Degrees of Freedom (DoF) of this channel. Using the real interference alignment technique introduced in Motahari et al. , 2014, we show that $\frac {MN}{M+N} K$ degrees of freedom can be achieved for almost all channel realizations. Also, a new upper-bound on the DoF of this channel is provided. This upper-bound coincides with our achievable DoF for $K\geq K_{u} \triangleq \frac {M+N}{\gcd (M,N)}$ , where $\gcd (M,N)$ denotes the greatest common divisor of $M$ and $N$ . This gives an exact characterization of DoF for $M\times N$ MIMO Gaussian interference channel in the case of $K\geq K_{u}$ . Since there is no cooperation between transmit (or receive) antennas of each user in our transmission scheme, this result shows that the DoF benefit of joint processing in collocated antennas vanishes when the number of users is greater than a certain threshold.},

  abstract     = {Designing Boolean functions whose output can be computed with light means at high speed, and satisfying all the criteria necessary to resist all major attacks on the stream ciphers using them as nonlinear components, has been an open problem since the beginning of this century, when algebraic attacks were invented. Functions allowing a good resistance are known since 2008, but their output is a little too complex to compute. Functions with fast and easy to compute output are known which have good algebraic immunity, such as majority functions and the so-called hidden weight bit (HWB) functions, but they all have the same cryptographic weakness: their too small nonlinearity. In the present paper, we introduce a generalization of the HWB functions into a construction of $n$ -variable balanced functions $f$ from $(n-1)$ -variable Boolean functions $g$ having some property held by a large number of functions. Function $f$ is defined by its support, equal to the image set of a vectorial function depending on $g$ . This makes the function complex enough for allowing good cryptographic parameters, while its output is light to compute. The HWB function is what we obtain with $f$ when the initial function $g$ equals constant 1. Other well chosen functions $g$ provide functions $f$ having good cryptographic parameters. We analyze the constructed functions $f$ , we provide a fast way to compute their output, we determine their algebraic normal forms and we show that, most often, their algebraic degree is optimal. We study their Walsh transform and their nonlinearity and algebraic immunity. We observe with computer investigations that this generalization of the HWB function allows to keep its quality of being fast to compute and having good enough algebraic immunity, while significantly improving its nonlinearity. The functions already obtained in the investigations provide a quite good (and never reached before) trade-off between speed and security. Further (probably difficult) work should allow obtaining, among such generalized HWB functions whose number is huge, still better filter functions to be used in stream ciphers.},

Our first attack is of the guess-and-determine type. Our result significantly improves the state-of-the-art algorithm proposed by Couteau et al., in terms of both asymptotic and concrete complexity, and breaks all the challenge parameters they proposed. For instance, for a parameter set suggested for 128 bits of security, we could solve the instance faster by a factor of about 277, thereby destroying the claimed security completely. Our second attack further exploits the extremely sparse structure of the predicate $P_{5}$ and combines ideas from iterative decoding. This novel attack, named guess-and-decode, substantially improves the guess-and-determine approaches for cryptographic-relevant parameters. All the challenge parameter sets proposed in Couteau et al.&amp;#x2019;s work in ASIACRYPT 2018 aiming for 80-bit (128-bit) security levels can be solved in about 258 (278) operations. We suggest new parameters for achieving 80-bit (128-bit) security with respect to our attacks. We also extend the attacks to other promising predicates and investigate their resistance.},

  abstract     = {Given a binary sequence with length $n$ , determining its minimal rational fraction representation (MRFR) has important applications in the design and cryptanalysis of stream ciphers. There are many studies of this problem since Klapper and Goresky first introduced an adaptive rational approximation algorithm with a time complexity of $O(n^{2}\log n\log \log n)$ . In this paper, we revisit this problem by considering both adaptive and non-adaptive efficient algorithms. Compared with the state-of-art methods, we make several contributions to the problem of finding MRFR. Firstly, we find a general and precise recursive relationship between the minimal bases for two adjacent lattices generated by successive truncation sequences. This enables us to improve the currently fastest adaptive algorithm proposed by Li et al. . Secondly, by optimizing a time-consuming step of the well-known Lagrange reduction algorithm for 2-dimensional lattices, we obtain a non-adaptive, and yet practically faster MRFR-solving algorithm named global Euclidean algorithm. Thirdly, we identify theoretical flaws on some non-adaptive methods in the literature by counter-examples and correct the problems by designing modified Euclidean algorithm named partial Euclidean algorithm. Meanwhile, we further reduce the time complexity of existing algorithm from $O(n^{2})$ to $O(n\log ^{2}n\log \log n)$ by invoking the half-gcd algorithm. We also conduct a comprehensive experimental comparative analysis on the above algorithms to validate our theoretical analysis.},

  abstract     = {The goal of this paper is to investigate linear approximations of random functions and permutations. Our motivation is twofold. First, before the distinguishability of a practical cipher from an ideal one can be analysed, the cryptanalyst must have an accurate understanding of the statistical behaviour of the ideal cipher. Secondly, this issue has been neglected both in old and in more recent studies, particularly when multiple linear approximations are being used simultaneously. Traditional models have been based on the average behaviour and simplified using other assumptions such as independence of the linear approximations. Multidimensional cryptanalysis was introduced to avoid making artificial assumptions about statistical independence of linear approximations. On the other hand, it has the drawback of including many trivial approximations that do not contribute to the attack but just cause a waste of time and memory. We show for the first time in this paper that the trivial approximations reduce the degree of freedom of the related $\chi ^{2}$ distribution. Previously, the affine linear cryptanalysis was proposed to allow removing trivial approximations and, at the same time, admitting a solid statistical model. In this paper, we identify another type of multidimensional linear approximation, called Davies-Meyer approximation, which has similar advantages, and present full statistical models for both the affine and the Davies-Meyer type of multidimensional linear approximations. The new models given in this paper are realistic, accurate and easy to use. They are backed up by standard statistical tools such as Pearson’s $\chi ^{2}$ test and finite population correction and demonstrated to work accurately using practical examples.},

  abstract     = {Distributed computing enables parallel execution of smaller tasks that make up a large computing job. Its purpose is to reduce the job completion time. However, random fluctuations in task service times lead to straggling tasks with long execution times. Redundancy provides diversity that allows job completion when only a subset of redundant tasks is executed, thus removing the dependency on the straggling tasks. Under constrained resources (here, a fixed number of parallel servers), increasing redundancy reduces the available resources for parallelism. In this paper, we characterize the diversity vs. parallelism trade-off and identify the optimal strategy among replication, coding, and splitting, which minimizes the expected job completion time. We consider three common service time distributions and establish three models that describe the scaling of these distributions with the task size. We find that different distributions with different scaling models operate optimally at different redundancy levels, thus requiring very different code rates.},

  abstract     = {This paper formulates a distributed computation problem, where a master asks ${\mathsf N}$ distributed workers to compute a linearly separable function. The task function can be expressed as ${\mathsf K}_{\mathrm{ c}}$ linear combinations of ${\mathsf K}$ messages, where each message is a function of one dataset. Our objective is to find the optimal tradeoff between the computation cost (number of uncoded datasets assigned to each worker) and the communication cost (number of symbols the master must download), such that from the answers of any ${\mathsf N}_{\mathrm{ r}}$ out of ${\mathsf N}$ workers the master can recover the task function with high probability, where the coefficients of the ${\mathsf K}_{\mathrm{ c}}$ linear combinations are uniformly i.i.d. over some large enough finite field. The formulated problem can be seen as a generalized version of some existing problems, such as distributed gradient coding and distributed linear transform. In this paper, we consider the specific case where the computation cost is minimum, and propose novel achievability schemes and converse bounds for the optimal communication cost. Achievability and converse bounds coincide for some system parameters; when they do not match, we prove that the achievable distributed computing scheme is optimal under the constraint of a widely used &amp;#x2018;cyclic assignment&amp;#x2019; scheme on the datasets. Our results also show that when ${\mathsf K}= {\mathsf N}$ , with the same communication cost as the optimal distributed gradient coding scheme proposed by Tandon et al. from which the master recovers one linear combination of ${\mathsf K}$ messages, our proposed scheme can let the master recover any additional ${\mathsf N}_{\mathrm{ r}}-1$ independent linear combinations of messages with high probability.},

This paper studies the accuracy of cooperative network localization in large-scale wireless networks. Based on a decomposition of the equivalent Fisher information matrix (EFIM), we develop a random-walk-inspired approach for the analysis of EFIM, and propose a position information routing interpretation of cooperative network localization. Using this approach, we show that in large lattice and stochastic geometric networks, when anchors are uniformly distributed, the average localization error of agents grows logarithmically with the reciprocal of anchor density in an asymptotic regime. The results are further illustrated using numerical examples.},

To quantify the robustness of these networks, we investigate three different performance measures: the steady-state variance of pairwise differences between vertex states, the steady-state variance of the deviation of each vertex state from the average, and the total steady-state variance of the system. We show that these performance measures are closely related to the concept of biharmonic distance; the square of the biharmonic distance plays a similar role in the system performance as resistance distance plays in the performance of first-order noisy consensus dynamics. We then define the new concepts of biharmonic Kirchhoff index and vertex centrality based on the biharmonic distance. We further derive analytical results for the performance measures and concepts for complete graphs, star graphs, cycles, and paths, and we use this analysis to compare the asymptotic behavior of the steady-state variance in first- and second-order systems. Finally, we propose a theoretically guaranteed approximation algorithm to estimate the total steady-state variance, which has a complexity of nearly linear time with respect to the number of edges. Extensive experiments results validate both efficiency and accuracy of our algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Private information retrieval (PIR) protocols ensure that a user can download a file from a database without revealing any information on the identity of the requested file to the servers storing the database. While existing protocols strictly impose that no information is leaked on the file&amp;#x2019;s identity, this work initiates the study of the tradeoffs that can be achieved by relaxing the perfect privacy requirement. We refer to such protocols as weakly-private information retrieval (WPIR) protocols. In particular, for the case of multiple noncolluding replicated servers, we study how the download rate, the upload cost, and the access complexity can be improved when relaxing the perfect privacy constraint. To quantify the information leakage on the requested file&amp;#x2019;s identity we consider mutual information (MI), worst-case information leakage, and maximal leakage (MaxL). We present two WPIR schemes, denoted by Scheme A and Scheme B, based on two recent PIR protocols and show that the download rate of the former can be optimized by solving a convex optimization problem. We also show that Scheme A achieves an improved download rate compared to the recently proposed scheme by Samy et al. under the so-called $\epsilon $ -privacy metric. Additionally, a family of schemes based on partitioning is presented. Moreover, we provide an information-theoretic converse bound for the maximum possible download rate for the MI and MaxL privacy metrics under a practical restriction on the alphabet size of queries and answers. For two servers and two files, the bound is tight under the MaxL metric, which settles the WPIR capacity in this particular case. Finally, we compare the performance of the proposed schemes and their gap to the converse bound.},

For the achievability, we first consider the case of the one-bit ADCs at the legitimate receiver and apply a binary input distribution where the two input points have the same phase when the channel gain at the legitimate receiver is less than that at the eavesdropper, and otherwise the opposite phase. Then the result is generalized for the case of arbitrary finite-resolution ADCs at the legitimate receiver by translating the input distribution appropriately. We also provide numerical lower bounds on the achievable secrecy rates, and analyze the tendency of the secrecy rates according to the channel difference, the power constraint, and the quantization levels for some cases. For the special case of the real Gaussian wiretap channel with one-bit ADCs at both the legitimate receiver and the eavesdropper, we show that our choice of phase does not lose any optimality for the Wyner code.},

  abstract     = {The Binary Iterative Hard Thresholding (BIHT) algorithm is a popular reconstruction method for one-bit compressed sensing due to its simplicity and fast empirical convergence. Despite considerable research on this algorithm, a theoretical understanding of the corresponding approximation error and convergence rate still remains an open problem. This paper shows that the normalized version of BIHT (NBIHT) achieves an approximation error rate optimal up to logarithmic factors. More precisely, using $m$ one-bit measurements of an $s$ -sparse vector $x$ , we prove that the approximation error of NBIHT is of order $O \left ({\frac{1 }{ m }}\right)$ up to logarithmic factors, which matches the information-theoretic lower bound $\Omega \left ({\frac{1 }{ m }}\right)$ proved by Jacques, Laska, Boufounos, and Baraniuk in 2013. To our knowledge, this is the first theoretical analysis of a BIHT-type algorithm that explains the optimal rate of error decay empirically observed in the literature. This also makes NBIHT the first provable computationally-efficient one-bit compressed sensing algorithm that breaks the inverse square-root error decay rate $O \left ({\frac{1 }{ m^{1/2} }}\right)\vphantom {{\left ({\frac{1 }{ m^{1/2} }}\right)}^{&#39;}}$ .},

Due to advances in technology, such samples of point processes are increasingly encountered. A key object of interest is the local intensity function. It has a straightforward interpretation that allows to understand and explore point process data. We consider functional approaches for point processes, where one has a sample of repeated realizations of the point process. This situation is inherently connected with Cox processes, where the intensity functions of the replications are modeled as random functions. Here we study a situation where one records covariates for each replication of the process, such as the daily temperature for bike rentals. For modeling point processes as responses with vector covariates as predictors we propose a novel regression approach for the intensity function that is intrinsically nonparametric. While the intensity function of a point process that is only observed once on a fixed domain cannot be identified, we show how covariates and repeated observations of the process can be utilized to make consistent estimation possible, and we also derive asymptotic rates of convergence without invoking parametric assumptions.},

The objective of the protocol is to utilize minimum resources, in terms of classical bits needed by Alice and Bob to communicate their measurement outcomes to Charlie, and the common randomness shared among the three parties, while faithfully simulating independent repeated instances of the original measurement. To achieve this, we develop a mutual covering lemma and a technique for random binning of distributed quantum measurements, and, in turn, characterize a set of sufficient communication and common randomness rates required for asymptotic simulatability in terms of single-letter quantum information quantities. In the special case, where the Charlie&amp;#x2019;s action is restricted to a deterministic mapping, we develop a one-shot performance characterization of the distributed faithful simulation problem. Furthermore, using these results we address a distributed quantum rate-distortion problem, where we characterize the achievable rate distortion region through a single-letter inner bound.

Noh et al. proposed bosonic oscillator-to-oscillator codes relying on non-Gaussian resource states as an alternative, and showed that these encodings can lead to a reduction of the effective error strength at the logical level as measured by the variance of the classical displacement noise channel. An oscillator-to-oscillator code embeds K logical bosonic modes (in an arbitrary state) into N physical modes by means of a Gaussian N-mode unitary and N-K auxiliary one-mode Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill-states. Here we ask if – in analogy to qubit error-correcting codes – there are families of oscillator-to-oscillator codes with the following threshold property: They allow to convert physical displacement noise with variance below some threshold value to logical noise with variance upper bounded by any (arbitrary) constant. We find that this is not the case if encoding unitaries involving a constant amount of squeezing and maximum likelihood error decoding are used. We show a general lower bound on the logical error probability which is only a function of the amount of squeezing and independent of the number of modes. As a consequence, any physically implementable family of oscillator-to-oscillator codes combined with maximum likelihood error decoding does not admit a threshold.},

  abstract     = {The trade-off between the two types of error probabilities in binary state discrimination may be quantified in the asymptotics by various error exponents. In the composite case, where the hypotheses consist of sets of states, any such exponent is upper bounded by the infimum of the corresponding pairwise exponents of discriminating individual members of the two sets. Attainability of this upper bound may depend on the type of exponents considered; whether the problem is classical or quantum; the cardinality and the geometric properties of the sets representing the hypotheses; and also on the dimensionality of the underlying Hilbert space. Our main contribution is clarifying this landscape considerably. We show that in the quantum case unattainability is the general behaviour for all the exponents, already in finite dimension, for a simple null-hypothesis and an alternative hypothesis consisting of only two states. Moreover, the upper bound may be strict even in the infinite-dimensional classical case if the alternative hypothesis contains at least countably infinitely many states. We also prove general attainability results, e.g., for classical adversarial and arbitrarily varying hypothesis testing, and for the quantum case where all states are pure, or the states commute with every state in the opposite hypothesis.},

  abstract     = {Epsilon-nets and approximate unitary $t$ -designs are natural notions that capture properties of unitary operations relevant for numerous applications in quantum information and quantum computing. In this work we study quantitative connections between these two notions. Specifically, we prove that, for $d$ dimensional Hilbert space, unitaries constituting $\delta $ -approximate $t$ -expanders form $\epsilon $ -nets for $t\simeq \frac {d^{5/2}}{ \epsilon }$ and $\delta \simeq \left ({\frac { \epsilon ^{3/2}}{d}}\right)^{d^{2}}$ . We also show that for arbitrary $t$ , $\epsilon $ -nets can be used to construct $\delta $ -approximate unitary $t$ -designs for $\delta \simeq \epsilon t$ , where the notion of approximation is based on the diamond norm. Finally, we prove that the degree of an exact unitary $t$ design necessary to obtain an $\epsilon $ -net must grow at least as fast as $\frac {1}{ \epsilon }$ (for fixed dimension) and not slower than $d^{2}$ (for fixed $\epsilon $ ). This shows near optimality of our result connecting $t$ -designs and $\epsilon $ -nets. We apply our findings in the context of quantum computing. First, we show that that approximate t-designs can be generated by shallow random circuits formed from a set of universal two-qudit gates in the parallel and sequential local architectures considered in (Brandão et al., 2016). Importantly, our gate sets need not to be symmetric (i.e., contains gates together with their inverses) or consist of gates with algebraic entries. Second, we consider compilation of quantum gates and prove a non-constructive Solovay-Kitaev theorem for general universal gate sets. Our main technical contribution is a new construction of efficient polynomial approximations to the Dirac delta in the space of quantum channels, which can be of independent interest.},

  abstract     = {We construct new protocols for the tasks of converting noisy multipartite quantum correlations into noiseless classical and quantum ones using local operations and classical communication (LOCC). The former task is known as common randomness (CR) distillation, and it requires offsetting the amount of classical communication against the randomness created. We obtain a new lower bound on the “distillable common randomness,” an operational measure of the total genuine (classical) correlations in a quantum state. Our proof relies on a generalization of communication for omniscience (CO) [Csiszár and Narayan, IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 50:3047-3061, 2004], and our contribution here is a novel simultaneous decoder for the compression of correlated classical sources by random binning with quantum side information at the decoder. For the latter task, we derive two lower bounds on the rate at which Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states can be asymptotically distilled from any given pure state under LOCC. Our approach consists in “making coherent” the proposed CR distillation protocols and recycling of resources [Devetak et al. IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 54(10):4587-4618, 2008]. The first lower bound is identical to a recent result by Vrana and Christandl [IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 65(9):5945-5958, 2019], which is based on a combinatorial method to achieve the same rate. Our second lower bound generalises and improves upon this result, and unifies a number of other known lower bounds on GHZ distillation.},

In many of such systems, multiple sources share a limited network resource and therefore the AoIs defined for the individual sources should be correlated with each other. However, there are not found any results in the literature studying the correlation of two or more AoIs in a status update system with multiple sources. In this work, we consider a multi-source system sharing a common service facility and provide a framework to investigate joint performance of the multiple AoIs. We then apply our framework to a simple pushout server with multiple sources and derive a closed-form expression for the joint Laplace transform of the AoIs in the case with independent M/G inputs. We further show some properties of the correlation coefficient of AoIs in the two-source system.},

A BCH code of length $n$ over $\mathbb {F}_{q}$ is always relative to an $n$ -th primitive root of unity $\beta $ in an extension field of $\mathbb {F}_{q}$ , and is called a dually-BCH code if its dual is also a BCH code relative to the same $\beta $ . The question as to whether a BCH code is a dually-BCH code is in general very hard to answer. In this paper, an answer to this question for primitive narrow-sense BCH codes and projective narrow-sense ternary BCH codes is given. Sufficient and necessary conditions in terms of the designed distances $\delta $ will be presented to ensure that these BCH codes are dually-BCH codes. In addition, the parameters of the primitive narrow-sense BCH codes and their dual codes are investigated. Some lower bounds on minimum distances of the dual codes of primitive and projective narrow-sense BCH codes are developed. Especially for binary primitive narrow-sense BCH codes, the new bounds on the minimum distances of the dual codes improve the classical Sidel&amp;#x2019;nikov bound, and are also better than the Carlitz and Uchiyama bound for large designed distances $\delta $ . The question as to what subclasses of cyclic codes are BCH codes is also answered to some extent. As a byproduct, the parameters of some subclasses of cyclic codes are also investigated.},

  abstract     = {Reed-Muller codes are error-correcting codes used in many areas related to coding theory, such as electrical engineering and computer science. The binary $r^{th}$ -order Reed-Muller code $RM(r,n)$ can be viewed as the set of all $n$ -variable Boolean functions of algebraic degree at most $r$ . Despite the intense work on these codes, many problems are known to be hard (notably, determining their covering radius) and remain open to this day. Fourteen years ago, Carlet and Mesnager improved in [IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, “Improving the Upper Bounds on the Covering Radii of Binary Reed-Muller Codes”, 53(1), 2007] the upper bound on the covering radius of the Reed-Muller code of order 2, and they deduced improved upper bounds on the covering radii of the Reed-Muller codes of higher orders. Until 2021, these upper bounds remained the best ones in the literature. The Reed-Muller code $RM(n-3,n)$ , which corresponds to the dual of the Reed-Muller code $RM(2,n)$ , has attracted much attention. One of the main reasons is that it is precisely the code that has been considered to get the upper bounds derived by Carlet and Mesnager. Those upper bounds have been obtained thanks to the characterization of the codewords of the Reed-Muller code, whose Hamming weights are strictly less than 2.5 times the minimum distance $2^{n-r}$ due to Kasami, Tokura, and Azumi. Despite their impressive work in the seventieth, a more refined study and profound description of those codewords of ${RM}({n-3},{n})$ whose Hamming weight equals 16, and especially 18, seem necessary, as it could help us significantly in improving the covering radius of Reed-Muller codes. In this paper, we push further the known results on the Reed-Muller codes by focusing on the Reed-Muller code ${RM}({n-3},{n})$ . We provide a classification of the codewords of weights 16 and 18 of the Reed-Muller code $RM(n-3,n)$ . Our algebraic descriptions allow us to count the number of such codewords and to enumerate all of them explicitly.},

It is said to be list-recoverable for input list size $\ell $ if for every sufficiently large subset of at least $L$ codewords, there is a coordinate where the codewords take more than $\ell $ values. In this work, we study the list size of random linear codes for both list-decoding and list-recovery as the rate approaches capacity. We show the following claims hold with high probability over the choice of the code (below $q$ is the alphabet size, and $ \varepsilon &amp;gt; 0$ is the gap to capacity). (1) A random linear code of rate $1 - \log _{q}(\ell) - \varepsilon $ requires list size $L \ge \ell ^{\Omega (1/ \varepsilon)}$ for list-recovery from input list size $\ell $ . (2) A random linear code of rate $1 - h_{q}(p) - \varepsilon $ requires list size $L \ge \left \lfloor{ {h_{q}(p)/ \varepsilon +0.99}}\right \rfloor $ for list-decoding from error fraction $p$ . (3) A random binary linear code of rate $1 - h_{2}(p) - \varepsilon $ is list-decodable from average error fraction $p$ with list size with $L \leq \left \lfloor{ {h_{2}(p)/ \varepsilon }}\right \rfloor + 2$ . Our lower bounds follow by exhibiting an explicit subset of codewords so that this subset&amp;#x2014;or some symbol-wise permutation of it&amp;#x2014;lies in a random linear code with high probability.

We say that $R^{\ast}$ is the threshold rate for $\mathcal {P}$ if a random code of rate $R^{\ast} + \varepsilon $ is very likely to satisfy $\mathcal {P}$ , while a random code of rate $R^{\ast} - \varepsilon $ is very unlikely to satisfy $\mathcal {P}$ . While random codes are well-studied in coding theory, even the threshold rates for relatively simple properties like the one above are not well understood. We characterize threshold rates for a rich class of properties. These properties, like the example above, are defined by the inclusion of specific sets of codewords which are also suitably “symmetric.” For properties in this class, we show that the threshold rate is in fact equal to the lower bound that a simple first-moment calculation obtains. Our techniques not only pin down the threshold rate for the property $\mathcal {P}$ above, they give sharp bounds on the threshold rate for list-recovery in several parameter regimes, as well as an efficient algorithm for estimating the threshold rates for list-recovery in general.},

  abstract     = {Due to its high data density and longevity, DNA is considered a promising medium for satisfying ever-increasing data storage needs. However, the diversity of errors that occur in DNA sequences makes efficient error-correction a challenging task. This paper aims to address simultaneously correcting two types of errors, namely, short tandem duplication and edit errors, where an edit error may be a substitution, deletion, or insertion. We focus on tandem repeats of length at most 3 and design codes for correcting an arbitrary number of duplication errors and one edit error. Because an edited symbol can be duplicated many times (as part of substrings of various lengths), a single edit can affect an unbounded substring of the retrieved word. However, we show that with appropriate preprocessing, the effect may be limited to a substring of finite length, thus making efficient error-correction possible. We construct a code for correcting the aforementioned errors and provide lower bounds for its rate. Compared to optimal codes correcting only duplication errors, numerical results show that the asymptotic cost of protecting against an additional edit is only 0.003 bits/symbol when the alphabet has size 4, an important case corresponding to data storage in DNA.},

  abstract     = {Minkowski proved that any $n$ -dimensional lattice of unit determinant has a nonzero vector of Euclidean norm at most $\sqrt {n}$ ; in fact, there are $2^{\Omega (n)}$ such lattice vectors. Lattices whose minimum distances come close to Minkowski&amp;#x2019;s bound provide excellent sphere packings and error-correcting codes in ${\mathbb {R}}^{n}$ . The focus of this work is a certain family of efficiently constructible $n$ -dimensional lattices due to Barnes and Sloane, whose minimum distances are within an $O(\sqrt {\log n})$ factor of Minkowski&amp;#x2019;s bound. Our primary contribution is a polynomial-time algorithm that list decodes this family to distances approaching $1/\sqrt {2}$ of the minimum distance. The main technique is to decode Reed-Solomon codes under error measured in the Euclidean norm, using the Koetter-Vardy &amp;#x201C;soft decision&amp;#x201D; variant of the Guruswami-Sudan list-decoding algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Caching is an efficient way to reduce network traffic congestion during peak hours by storing some content at the users&amp;#x2019; local caches. For the shared-link network with end-user-caches, Maddah-Ali and Niesen proposed a two-phase coded caching strategy. In practice, users may communicate with the server through intermediate relays. This paper studies the tradeoff between the memory size ${\mathsf M}$ and the network load ${\mathsf R}$ for the networks where a server with ${\mathsf N}$ files is connected to ${\mathsf H}$ relays (without caches), which in turn are connected to ${\mathsf K}$ users equipped with caches of ${\mathsf M}$ files. When each user is connected to a different subset of ${\mathsf r}$ relays, i.e., ${\mathsf K}= \binom {\mathsf H}{\mathsf r}$ , the system is referred to as a combination network with end-user-caches. In this work, converse bounds are derived for the practically motivated case of uncoded cache contents, that is, bits of the various files are directly pushed into the user caches without any coding. In this case, once the cache contents and the users&amp;#x2019; demands are known, the problem reduces to a general index coding problem. This paper shows that relying on a well-known &amp;#x201C;acyclic index coding converse bound&amp;#x201D; results in converse bounds that are not tight for combination networks with end-user-caches. A novel converse bound that leverages the network topology is proposed, which is the tightest converse bound known to date. As a result of independent interest, an inequality that generalizes the well-known sub-modularity of entropy is derived. Several novel caching schemes are proposed, based on the Maddah-Ali and Niesen cache placement. These schemes leverage the structure of the combination network or/and perform interference elimination at the end-users. The proposed schemes are proved: (i) to be (order) optimal for some $({\mathsf N}, {\mathsf M}, {\mathsf H}, {\mathsf r})$ parameters regimes under the constraint of uncoded cache placement, and (ii) to outperform the state-of-the-art schemes in numerical evaluations.},

We give in this paper more quantitative strengthenings of this result, which, among other implications, characterize how over-sampling approaches the true mutual information of a continuous-time Gaussian channel with bandwidth limit. The assumptions in our results are relatively mild. In particular, for the non-feedback case, compared to the Shannon-Nyquist sampling theorem, a widely used tool to connect continuous-time Gaussian channels to their discrete-time counterparts that requires the band-limitedness of the channel input, our results only require some integrability conditions on the power spectral density function of the input.},

  abstract     = {Information-theoretic quantities like entropy and mutual information have found numerous uses in machine learning. It is well known that there is a strong connection between these entropic quantities and submodularity since entropy over a set of random variables is submodular. In this paper, we study combinatorial information measures that generalize independence, (conditional) entropy, (conditional) mutual information, and total correlation defined over sets of (not necessarily random) variables. These measures strictly generalize the corresponding entropic measures since they are all parameterized via submodular functions that themselves strictly generalize entropy. Critically, we show that, unlike entropic mutual information in general, the submodular mutual information is actually submodular in one argument, holding the other fixed, for a large class of submodular functions whose third-order partial derivatives satisfy a non-negativity property. This turns out to include a number of practically useful cases such as the facility location and set-cover functions. We study specific instantiations of the submodular information measures on these, as well as the probabilistic coverage, graph-cut, log-determinants, and saturated coverage functions and see that they all have mathematically intuitive and practically useful expressions. Finally, we also study generalized independence between subsets of datapoints (random variables in the entropic case), and connect the independence characterizations to independence in log-submodular distributions. Regarding applications, we connect the maximization of submodular (conditional) mutual information to problems such as mutual-information-based, query-based, and privacy preserving summarization—and we connect optimizing the multi-set submodular mutual information to clustering and robust partitioning. We perform real world as well as synthetic experiments on various data summarization tasks.},

  abstract     = {We consider the problem of (almost) lossless separate encodings and joint decoding of two correlated discrete memoryless sources (DMSs), that is, the well-known Slepian-Wolf (S-W) source coding problem. Traditionally, ensembles of S&amp;#x2013;W codes are defined such that every bin of each $n$ &amp;#x2013;vector of each source is randomly drawn under the uniform distribution across the sets ${0,1,\ldots,2^{nR_{X}}-1}$ and ${0,1,\ldots,2^{nR_{Y}}-1}$ , where $R_{X}$ and $R_{Y}$ are the coding rates of the two sources, $X$ and $Y$ , respectively. In a few more recent works, where only one source, say, $X$ , is compressed and the other one, $Y$ , serves as side information available at the decoder, the scope is extended to variable&amp;#x2013;rate S&amp;#x2013;W (VRSW) codes, where the rate is allowed to depend on the type class of the source string, but still, the random&amp;#x2013;binning distribution is assumed uniform within the corresponding, type&amp;#x2013;dependent, bin index set. In this expository work, we investigate the role of the uniformity of the random binning distribution from the perspective of the trade-off between the reliability (defined in terms of the error exponent) and the compression performance (measured from the viewpoint of the source coding exponent). To this end, we study a much wider class of random&amp;#x2013;binning distributions, which includes the ensemble of VRSW codes as a special case, but it also goes considerably beyond. We first show that, with the exception of some pathological cases, the smaller ensemble, of VRSW codes, is as good as the larger ensemble in terms the trade-off between the error exponent and the source coding exponent. Notwithstanding this finding, the wider class of ensembles proposed is motivated in two ways. The first is that it outperforms VRSW codes in the above&amp;#x2013;mentioned pathological cases, and the second is that it allows robustness: in the event of a system failure that causes unavailability of the compressed bit&amp;#x2013;stream from one of the sources, it still allows reconstruction of the other source within some controllable distortion.},

If FHSs can ensure a wide-gap between two adjacent frequency points to avoid the frequency points with high interference probability, it will significantly improve the FH communication system’s anti-interference ability. Moreover, if each frequency point appears at the same number of times in a sequence period, the system’s anti-electromagnetic interference will be enhanced. Therefore, it is desirable to employ FHSs with low Hamming autocorrelation, wide frequency-hopping gap, and good uniformity in practical applications. However, to the best of our knowledge, no such infinite classes of FHSs have been reported in the literature to date. This paper aims to present two constructions of uniform wide-gap frequency-hopping sequences (WGFHSs) by concatenating two or three adequately designed sequences. For the first time, we obtain two infinite classes of WGFHSs, which are optimal with respect to the well-known Lempel-Greenberger bound.},

Recently, a new theoretical tool, the Boomerang Connectivity Table (BCT) and the corresponding boomerang uniformity were introduced to quantify the resistance of a block cipher against boomerang-style attacks. Here we concentrate on two classes (introduced recently) of permutation polynomials over finite fields of even characteristic. For one of these, which is an involution used to construct a 4-uniform permutation, we explicitly determine the $c$ -DDT entries and BCT entries.

Previous works proved that the decoding bandwidth had a tight lower bound related to the number of available participants. Some threshold schemes that achieved the lower bound (optimal decoding bandwidth) and optimal information rate were constructed for a given number (non-universal case) or multiple distinct number ( $\triangle $ -universal case) of available participants. However, all those CESS schemes have large share sizes. Moreover, they have a common feature that each secret and share are a vector with multiple coordinates, which results in the decoding delay since the combiner must reconstruct a part of coordinates of the secret at first, and these recovered coordinates will be used to reconstruct another part of coordinates of the secret. In this work, we describe a new construction for CESS schemes of non-universal and $\triangle $ -universal cases, whereas each secret and share of our schemes are a single element of a finite field $\mathbb {F}_{q^{e}}$ , and each participant of an authorized subset provides a single element of a same subfield of $\mathbb {F}_{q^{e}}$ to the combiner to reconstruct the secret. We find that the CESS schemes of this type, termed balanced CESS schemes, have an inevitable restriction on the number of available participants, but our schemes has no decoding delay. Furthermore, our schemes have smaller share sizes than other existing works, which are realized by using a smaller sub-packetization $e$ and a smaller base field $\mathbb {F}_{q}$ . Indeed, the sub-packetizations of our schemes are minimum for given $\mathbb {F}_{q}$ among balanced CESS schemes. In addition, when our constructions are used to generate communication efficient $(n,r)$ threshold schemes, we derive a generalized Shamir’s scheme that universally achieves optimal decoding bandwidth and optimal information rate for the first time , where the restriction on the number of available participants is removed.},

  abstract     = {We study the adjacency graphs of feedback shift registers (FSRs) with affine characteristic functions. We first show that, similar to the linear case, the output sequences of FSRs with affine characteristic functions also have the direct sum decompositions. The only difference from the linear case is that one component of the decomposition is a family of affine sequences, rather than linear sequences. Then, based on this fact, we give a relationship between the adjacency graphs of FSRs with affine characteristic functions and the generalized adjacency graphs of FSRs whose characteristic functions correspond to the components of the decomposition. This relationship establishes the algebraic structure of adjacency graphs and greatly simplifies the calculation of them. At last, we especially study the adjacency graph of the FSR whose characteristic function is $q_{k}(x)+1$ where $q_{k}(x)$ is the linear function corresponding to the polynomial $(1+x)^{k}$ . We prove that for any two cycles of this FSR, the number of conjugate pairs shared by them is no more than 4 if $k$ is a power of 2, and no more than 2 if $k$ is not a power of 2.},

Secret sharing schemes for multipartite access structures have received considerable attention due to the fact that multipartite secret sharing can be seen as a natural and useful generalization of threshold secret sharing. This work deals with efficient and explicit constructions of ideal multipartite secret sharing schemes. Most ideal multipartite secret sharing schemes in the literature can be classified as either hierarchical or compartmented. The main results are the constructions for ideal hierarchical access structures, a family that contains every ideal hierarchical access structure as a particular case such as the disjunctive hierarchical threshold access structure and the conjunctive hierarchical threshold access structure, the constructions for three families of compartmented access structures, and the constructions for two families compartmented access structures with compartments. We present an efficient method to construct ideal linear schemes realizing these access structures by linear algebraic techniques on the basis of the relationship between multipartite secret sharing schemes, polymatroids and matroids.},

Finding the optimal scheduling scheme, in this case, is known to be challenging. Accordingly, the Whittle’s index policy was proposed in the literature as a low-complexity heuristic to the problem. Although simple to implement, characterizing this policy’s performance is recognized to be a notoriously tricky task. In the sequel, we provide a new mathematical approach to establish its optimality in the many-users regime for specific network settings. Contrary to previous works in the literature that use restrictive mathematical assumptions, which can be challenging to verify, our novel approach is based on intricate techniques and it is free of any strong mathematical assumptions. These findings showcase that the Whittle’s index policy has analytically provable asymptotic optimality for the AoI minimization problem. Finally, we lay out numerical results that corroborate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the policy’s notable performance in the many-users regime.},

This paper relates Blowfish privacy to an important measure of privacy loss of information channels from the communications theory community: min-entropy leakage. Symmetry in an input data neighbouring relation is central to known connections between differential privacy and min-entropy leakage. But while differential privacy exhibits strong symmetry, Blowfish neighbouring relations correspond to arbitrary simple graphs owing to the framework’s flexible privacy policies. To bound the min-entropy leakage of Blowfish-private mechanisms we organise our analysis over symmetrical partitions corresponding to orbits of graph automorphism groups.

Being of full support-rank is a technical, yet natural condition required to prove a converse result for a capacity expression and satisfied by almost all currently known capacity-achieving schemes, while strong linearity is a practical requirement enabling implementation over small finite fields with low subpacketization degree. Then, the capacity of MDS-coded, linear, full support-rank PIR in the presence of colluding servers is derived, as well as the capacity of symmetric, linear PIR with colluding, adversarial, and nonresponsive servers for the recently introduced concept of matched randomness. This positively settles the capacity conjectures stated by Freij-Hollanti et al. and Tajeddine et al. in the presented cases. It is also shown that, further restricting to strongly-linear PIR schemes with deterministic linear interference cancellation, the so-called star product scheme proposed by Freij-Hollanti et al. is essentially optimal and induces no capacity loss.},

We propose a new approach to handle this correlation and establish a unified method to establish lower bounds for both tasks.

  abstract     = {Meta-learning automatically infers an inductive bias by observing data from a number of related tasks. The inductive bias is encoded by hyperparameters that determine aspects of the model class or training algorithm, such as initialization or learning rate. Meta-learning assumes that the learning tasks belong to a task environment, and that tasks are drawn from the same task environment both during meta-training and meta-testing. This, however, may not hold true in practice. In this paper, we introduce the problem of transfer meta-learning, in which tasks are drawn from a target task environment during meta-testing that may differ from the source task environment observed during meta-training. Novel information-theoretic upper bounds are obtained on the transfer meta-generalization gap, which measures the difference between the meta-training loss, available at the meta-learner, and the average loss on meta-test data from a new, randomly selected, task in the target task environment. The first bound, on the average transfer meta-generalization gap, captures the meta-environment shift between source and target task environments via the KL divergence between source and target data distributions. The second, PAC-Bayesian bound, and the third, single-draw bound, account for this shift via the log-likelihood ratio between source and target task distributions. Furthermore, two transfer meta-learning solutions are introduced. For the first, termed Empirical Meta-Risk Minimization (EMRM), we derive bounds on the average optimality gap. The second, referred to as Information Meta-Risk Minimization (IMRM), is obtained by minimizing the PAC-Bayesian bound. IMRM is shown via experiments to potentially outperform EMRM.},

  abstract     = {Asynchronous Q-learning aims to learn the optimal action-value function (or Q-function) of a Markov decision process (MDP), based on a single trajectory of Markovian samples induced by a behavior policy. Focusing on a $\gamma $ -discounted MDP with state space $\mathcal {S}$ and action space $\mathcal {A}$ , we demonstrate that the $\ell _{\infty }$ -based sample complexity of classical asynchronous Q-learning — namely, the number of samples needed to yield an entrywise $\varepsilon $ -accurate estimate of the Q-function — is at most on the order of $\frac {1}{ \mu _{\mathsf {min}}(1-\gamma)^{5}\varepsilon ^{2}}+ \frac { t_{\mathsf {mix}}}{ \mu _{\mathsf {min}}(1-\gamma)}$ up to some logarithmic factor, provided that a proper constant learning rate is adopted. Here, $t_{\mathsf {mix}}$ and $\mu _{\mathsf {min}}$ denote respectively the mixing time and the minimum state-action occupancy probability of the sample trajectory. The first term of this bound matches the sample complexity in the synchronous case with independent samples drawn from the stationary distribution of the trajectory. The second term reflects the cost taken for the empirical distribution of the Markovian trajectory to reach a steady state, which is incurred at the very beginning and becomes amortized as the algorithm runs. Encouragingly, the above bound improves upon the state-of-the-art result by a factor of at least $|\mathcal {S}||\mathcal {A}|$ for all scenarios, and by a factor of at least $t_{\mathsf {mix}}|\mathcal {S}||\mathcal {A}|$ for any sufficiently small accuracy level $\varepsilon $ . Further, we demonstrate that the scaling on the effective horizon $\frac {1}{1-\gamma }$ can be improved by means of variance reduction.},

  abstract     = {The $k\text {-means}$ clustering problem concerns finding a partition of the data points into $k$ clusters such that the total within-cluster squared distance is minimized. This optimization objective is non-convex, and not everywhere differentiable. In general, there exist spurious local solutions other than the global optimum. Moreover, the simplest and most popular algorithm for $k\text {-means}$ , namely Lloyd’s algorithm, generally converges to such spurious local solutions both in theory and in practice. In this paper, we investigate the structures of these spurious local solutions under a probabilistic generative model with $k$ ground truth clusters. As soon as $k=3$ , spurious local minima provably exist, even for well-separated clusters. One such local minimum puts two centers at one true cluster, and the third center in the middle of the other two true clusters. We prove that this is essentially the only type of spurious local minima under a separation condition. In particular, any local minimum solution only involves a configuration that puts multiple centers at a true cluster, and one center in the middle of multiple true clusters. Our results pertain to the $k\text {-means}$ formulation for mixtures of Gaussians or bounded distributions, and hold in the over- and under-parametrization regimes where the number of centers in $k\text {-means}$ may not equal to the number of true clusters. Our theoretical results corroborate existing empirical observations and provide justification for popular heuristics for $k\text {-means}$ clustering.},

  abstract     = {Parties connected to independent sources through a network can generate correlations among themselves. Notably, the space of feasible correlations for a given network, depends on the physical nature of the sources and the measurements performed by the parties. In particular, quantum sources give access to nonlocal correlations that cannot be generated classically. In this paper, we derive a universal limit on correlations in networks in terms of their covariance matrix. We show that in a network satisfying a certain condition, the covariance matrix of any feasible correlation can be decomposed as a summation of positive semidefinite matrices each of whose terms corresponds to a source in the network. Our result is universal in the sense that it holds in any physical theory of correlation in networks, including the classical, quantum and all generalized probabilistic theories.},

We study scenarios that include either strictly-causal, causal, or non-causal channel side information (CSI) available at the encoder, and also when CSI is not available. This model can be viewed as a form of quantum metrology, and as the quantum counterpart of the classical rate-and-state channel with state estimation at the decoder. Regularized formulas for the capacity-distortion regions are derived. In the special case of measurement channels, single-letter characterizations are derived for the strictly-causal and causal settings. Furthermore, in the more general case of entanglement-breaking channels, a single-letter characterization is derived when CSI is not available. As a consequence, we obtain regularized formulas for the capacity of random-parameter quantum channels with CSI, generalizing previous results by Boche et al. , 2016, on classical-quantum channels. Bosonic dirty paper coding is introduced as a consequence, where we demonstrate that the optimal coefficient is not necessarily that of minimum mean-square error estimation as in the classical setting.},

  abstract     = {Passive environment-assisted communication takes place via a quantum channel modeled as a unitary interaction between the information carrying system and an environment, where the latter is controlled by a passive helper, who can set its initial state such as to assist sender and receiver, but not help actively by adjusting her behaviour depending on the message. Here we investigate the information transmission capabilities in this framework by considering Gaussian unitaries acting on Bosonic systems. We consider both quantum communication and classical communication with helper, as well as classical communication with free classical coordination between sender and helper (conferencing encoders). Concerning quantum communication, we prove general coding theorems with and without energy constraints, yielding multi-letter (regularized) expressions. In the search for cases where the capacity formula is computable, we look for Gaussian unitaries that are universally degradable or anti-degradable. However, we show that no Gaussian unitary yields either a degradable or anti-degradable channel for all environment states. On the other hand, restricting to Gaussian environment states, results in universally degradable unitaries, for which we thus can give single-letter quantum capacity formulas. Concerning classical communication, we prove a general coding theorem for the classical capacity under an energy constraint, given by a multi-letter expression. Furthermore, we derive an uncertainty-type relation between the classical capacities of the sender and the helper, helped respectively by the other party, showing a lower bound on the sum of the two capacities. Then, this is used to lower bound the classical information transmission rate in the scenario of classical communication between sender and helper.},

The answer to this question led to the introduction of a quantity called guesswork by Massey in 1994, which can be viewed as an alternate security criterion to entropy. In this paper, we consider the guesswork in the presence of quantum side information, and show that a general sequential guessing strategy is equivalent to performing a single quantum measurement and choosing a guessing strategy based on the outcome. We use this result to deduce entropic one-shot and asymptotic bounds on the guesswork in the presence of quantum side information, and to formulate a semi-definite program (SDP) to calculate the quantity. We evaluate the guesswork for a simple example involving the BB84 states, both numerically and analytically, and we prove a continuity result that certifies the security of slightly imperfect key states when the guesswork is used as the security criterion.},

First, in the near future, the scale of quantum information processing is quite limited, and when quantum resource available is not sufficient for certain tasks, a possible way to strengthen the capability of quantum schemes is introducing extra classical resources. We analyze the mathematical structures of these hybrid protocols, and characterize the relation between the amount of quantum resources and classical resources needed. Second, a fundamental open problem in communication complexity theory is to describe the advantage of sharing prior quantum entanglement over sharing prior randomness, which is still widely open.

  abstract     = {Extensive quantum error correction is necessary in order to perform a useful computation on a noisy quantum computer. Moreover, quantum error correction must be implemented based on imperfect parity check measurements that may return incorrect outcomes or inject additional faults into the qubits. To achieve fault-tolerant error correction, Shor proposed to repeat the sequence of parity check measurements until the same outcome is observed sufficiently many times. Then, one can use this information to perform error correction. A basic implementation of this fault tolerance strategy requires $\Omega (r d^{2})$ parity check measurements for a distance- $d$ code defined by $r$ parity checks. For some specific highly structured quantum codes, Bombin has shown that single-shot fault-tolerant quantum error correction is possible using only $r$ measurements. In this work, we consider a phenomenological noise model for parity check measurements assuming that each bit of a codeword and the measurement outcome suffer from independent bit flips with some error rate $p$ . For this model, we demonstrate that fault-tolerant quantum error correction can be achieved using $O(d \log (d))$ measurements for any code with distance $d \geq \Omega (n^\alpha)$ for some constant $\alpha &amp;gt; 0$ . Moreover, we prove the existence of a sub-single-shot fault-tolerant quantum error correction scheme using fewer than $r$ measurements. In some cases, the number of parity check measurements required for fault-tolerant quantum error correction is exponentially smaller than the number of parity checks defining the code. The short measurement sequences constructed generally have high weight and our phenomenological noise model is not realistic in this regime. Our error correction strategy could find applications to small codes and LDPC codes if one can manage to keep the weight of the measured parity checks low.},

The code family is based on tessellations of closed, four-dimensional, hyperbolic manifolds, as first suggested by Guth and Lubotzky. The main contribution of this work is the construction of suitable manifolds via finite presentations of Coxeter groups, their linear representations over Galois fields and topological coverings. We establish a lower bound on the encoding rate $k/n$ of $13/72 = 0.180\ldots $ and we show that the bound is tight for the examples that we construct. Numerical simulations give evidence that parallelizable decoding schemes of low computational complexity suffice to obtain high performance. These decoding schemes can deal with syndrome noise, so that parity check measurements do not have to be repeated to decode. Our data is consistent with a threshold of around 4\% in the phenomenological noise model with syndrome noise in the single-shot regime.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we analyze the high-SNR regime of the $M\times K$ Network MISO channel in which each transmitter has access to a different channel estimate, possibly with different precision. It has been recently shown that, for some regimes, this setting attains the same Degrees-of-Freedom as the ideal centralized setting with perfect Channel State Information (CSI) sharing, in which all the transmitters are endowed with the best estimate available at any transmitter. This result is restricted by the limitations of the Degrees-of-Freedom metric, as it only provides information about the slope of growth of the capacity as a function of the SNR, without any insight about the possible performance at a given SNR. In order to overcome this limitation, we analyze the affine approximation of the rate on the high-SNR regime for this decentralized Network MISO setting for the antenna configurations in which it achieves the Degrees-of-Freedom of the centralized setting. We show that, for a regime of antenna configurations, it is possible to asymptotically attain the same achievable rate as in the ideal centralized scenario. Consequently, it is possible to achieve the beamforming gain of the ideal perfect-CSI-sharing setting even if only a subset of transmitters is endowed with precise CSI, which can be exploited in scenarios such as distributed massive MIMO where the number of transmit antennas is much bigger than the number of served users. This outcome is a consequence of the synergistic compromise between CSI precision at the transmitters and consistency between the locally-computed precoders, which is an inherent trade-off of decentralized settings that does not exist in the centralized CSI configuration. We propose a precoding scheme achieving the previous result, which is built on an uneven structure in which some transmitters reduce the precision of their own precoding vector for the sake of using transmission parameters that can be more easily predicted by the other transmitters.},

  abstract     = {A robust positioning pattern is a large array in which the contents of any subarray of given dimension can determine the subarray’s position, even if they are corrupted by errors. In this paper, we propose new explicit constructions and efficient locating algorithms for robust positioning patterns, which improve upon the previous results in two parameter regimes. For robustness against a constant fraction of errors, we construct the first infinite family of $q$ -ary robust positioning patterns whose rate asymptotically achieves the Singleton bound. For robustness against a constant number of errors, we present the first infinite family of binary robust positioning patterns where the gap between the redundancy and the lower bound is logarithmic in the subarray size and independent of the number of errors. Along with these explicit constructions, we also give efficient locating algorithms with time complexity quartic or cubic in the subarray size.},

  abstract     = {Several applications in communication, control, and learning require approximating target distributions to within small informational divergence. The additional requirement of invertibility usually leads to using encoders that are one-to-one mappings, also known as distribution matchers. However, even the best one-to-one encoders have divergences that grow logarithmically with the block length. To overcome this limitation, an encoder is proposed that has an invertible one-to-many mapping and a low-rate random number generator (RNG). Two algorithms are developed to design the mapping by assigning strings in either a most-likely first or least-likely first order. Both algorithms give information rates approaching the entropy of the target distribution with exponentially decreasing divergence and with vanishing RNG rate in the block length.},

Assume that the node has incoming and outgoing messages $\mathbf {x} = (x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots, x_{n})$ and $\mathbf {y} = (y_{1}, y_{2}, \ldots, y_{n})$ , respectively. In this paper, we investigate a class of structures that can be adopted by the node for computing $\mathbf {y}$ from $\mathbf {x}$ , where each $y_{j}, j = 1, 2, \ldots, n$ is computed via a binary tree with leaves $\mathbf {x}$ excluding $x_{j}$ . We make three main contributions regarding this class of structures. First, we prove that the minimum complexity of such a structure is $3n - 6$ , and if a structure has such complexity, its minimum latency is $\delta + \lceil \log (n-2^{\delta }) \rceil $ with $\delta = \lfloor \log (n/2) \rfloor $ , where the logarithm always takes base two. Second, we prove that the minimum latency of such a structure is $\lceil \log (n-1) \rceil $ , and if a structure has such latency, its minimum complexity is $n \log (n-1)$ when $n-1$ is a power of two. Third, given $(n, \tau)$ with $\tau \geq \lceil \log (n-1) \rceil $ , we propose a construction for a structure which we conjecture to have the minimum complexity among structures with latencies at most $\tau $ . Our construction method runs in $O(n^{3} \log ^{2}(n))$ time, and the obtained structure has complexity at most (generally much smaller than) $n \lceil \log (n) \rceil - 2$ .},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we formulate the problem to cope with the transmission of extra bits over an existing coded transmission link (referred to as coded payload link) without any cost of extra transmission energy or extra bandwidth. This is possible since a gap to the channel capacity typically exists for a practical code. A new concept, termed as accessible capacity , is introduced to specify the maximum rate at which the superposition transmission of extra bits is reliable and has a negligible effect on the performance of the coded payload link. For a binary-input output-symmetric (BIOS) memoryless channel, the accessible capacity can be characterized as the difference between the channel capacity and the mutual information rate of the coded payload link, which can be numerically evaluated for very short payload codes. For a general payload code, we present a simple lower bound on the accessible capacity, given by the channel capacity minus the coding rate of the payload code. We then focus on the scenarios where low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes are implemented for the payload link. We propose to transmit extra bits by random superposition for encoding, and exhaustive search (with the aid of statistical learning) for decoding. We further propose, by establishing an auxiliary channel (called syndrome channel ) induced from “zero-forcing” over the binary field, to transmit extra bits with structured codes such as repetition codes and first-order Reed-Muller (RM) codes. Numerical results show that up to 60 extra bits can be reliably transmitted along with a rate-1/2 LDPC code of length 8064.},

  abstract     = {The sequence reconstruction problem, introduced by Levenshtein in 2001, considers a communication scenario where the sender transmits a codeword from some codebook and the receiver obtains multiple noisy reads of the codeword. The common setup assumes the codebook to be the entire space and the problem is to determine the minimum number of distinct reads that is required to reconstruct the transmitted codeword. Motivated by modern storage devices, we study a variant of the problem where the number of noisy reads $N$ is fixed. Specifically, we design reconstruction codes that reconstruct a codeword from $N$ distinct noisy reads. We focus on channels that introduce a single edit error (i.e. a single substitution, insertion, or deletion) and their variants, and design reconstruction codes for all values of $N$ . In particular, for the case of a single edit, we show that as the number of noisy reads increases, the number of redundant symbols required can be gracefully reduced from $\log _{q} n+O(1)$ to $\log _{q} \log _{q} n+O(1)$ , and then to $O(1)$ , where $n$ denotes the length of a codeword. We also show that these reconstruction codes are asymptotically optimal. Finally, via computer simulations, we demonstrate that in certain cases, reconstruction codes can achieve similar performance as classical error-correcting codes with less redundant symbols.},

While the capacity of a channel that introduces only bursts of erasures has been known for more than fifteen years, only recently, the capacity of a channel with either one burst of erasures or multiple arbitrary erasures in any fixed-sized sliding window has been established. However, explicit codes shown to achieve this capacity for any admissible set of parameters require a large field size that scales exponentially with the delay. Recently, it has been shown that there exist codes that achieve the capacity with field size which scales quadratically with the delay. However, explicit constructions were shown only to specific combinations of parameters. This work describes an explicit rate-optimal construction for all admissible channel and delay parameters over a field size that scales quadratically with the delay.},

For a targeted lifting degree of $N$ , the first step of the method is to sieve the integer ring $\mathbb {Z}_{N}$ to make a particular sub-group with specific properties to construct the second column of P (the first column being filled with zeros). The remaining columns of P are determined recursively as multiples of the second column by adapting the sequentially multiplied column (SMC) method whereby a controlled greedy search is applied at each step. The codes constructed with the proposed semi-algebraic method show lengths that can be significantly shorter than their best counterparts in the literature.},

  abstract     = {The deterministic identification (DI) capacity is developed in multiple settings of channels with power constraints. A full characterization is established for the DI capacity of the discrete memoryless channel (DMC) with and without input constraints. Originally, Ahlswede and Dueck established the identification capacity with local randomness at the encoder, resulting in a double exponential number of messages in the block length $n$ . In the deterministic setup, the number of messages scales exponentially, as in Shannon’s transmission paradigm, but the achievable identification rates are higher. An explicit proof was not provided for the deterministic setting. In this paper, a detailed proof is presented for the DMC. Furthermore, Gaussian channels with fast and slow fading are considered, when channel side information is available at the decoder. A new phenomenon is observed as we establish that the number of messages scales as $2^{n\log (n)R}$ by deriving lower and upper bounds on the DI capacity on this scale. Consequently, the DI capacity of the Gaussian channel is infinite in the exponential scale and zero in the double exponential scale, regardless of the channel noise.},
