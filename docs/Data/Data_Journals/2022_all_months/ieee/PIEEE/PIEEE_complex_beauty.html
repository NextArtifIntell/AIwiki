  abstract     = {With the fast development of remote sensing platforms and sensors technology, change detection with heterogeneous remote sensing images (Hete-CD) has become an attractive topic in recent years and plays a vital role in land cover change detection for responding to natural disaster emergencies when homogeneous images are unavailable. Although Hete-CD has been developed for about three decades, and various related methods have been developed and applied successfully in practice, a systematic and comprehensive review of the current achievements regarding Hete-CD remains lacking. Therefore, in this article, we first present an overview of Hete-CD in terms of the related literature. Second, the major techniques of Hete-CD are reviewed in terms of publicly available datasets, the taxonomy of major techniques, results, performance, and quantitative evaluation. Then, some classical methods are selected for comparison and discussion. Finally, based on the discussion and literature review, challenges, opportunities, and future directions for Hete-CD are concluded. The review aims to provide a “one-stop-shop” understanding of the problems with the categories of existing approaches, open opportunities and challenges, and potential future directions for Hete-CD.},

  abstract     = {In the transition to a society with net-zero carbon emissions, high penetration of distributed renewable power generation and large-scale electrification of transportation and heat are driving the conventional distribution network operators (DNOs) to evolve into distribution system operators (DSOs) that manage distribution networks in a more active and flexible way. As a radical decentralized data management technology, distributed ledger technology (DLT) has the potential to support a trustworthy digital infrastructure facilitating the DNO–DSO transition. Based on a comprehensive review of worldwide research and practice, as well as the engagement of relevant industrial experts, the application of DLT in distribution networks is identified and analyzed in this article. The DLT features and DSO needs are first summarized, and the mapping relationship between them is identified. Detailed DSO functions are identified and classified into five categories (i.e., “planning,” “operation,” “market,” “asset,” and “connection”) with the potential of applying DLT to various DSO functions assessed. Finally, the development of seven key DSO functions with high DLT potential is analyzed and discussed from the technical, legal, and social perspectives, including peer-to-peer energy trading, flexibility market facilitation, electric vehicle charging, network pricing, distributed generation register, data access, and investment planning.},

In this article, we discuss decentralized and distributed coordination architectures for the operation of active distribution grids aiming at effectively coping with their complexity. We present relevant methods and algorithms under the framework of multiagent systems (MASs) and decentralized decision-making associated with handling different parts of the optimal grid operation. The decision-making models are based on distributed optimization algorithms using consensus/gossip models, bioinspired algorithms from the field of population dynamics, and a method for decomposing the power-flow model. The developed techniques aim at matching production with demand in microgrids, settling the short-term energy imbalances at the distribution grid level, mitigating voltage deviations, and resolving distribution grid congestions in real-time operation. The algorithms are implemented as MAS-based software platforms, able to aggregate diverse DG units and flexible loads. Results are provided from the theoretical simulation-based models and demonstrations of the operational techniques in actual pilot sites. The applied implementations have been performed in a smart grid pilot site, for which MAS platforms have been developed and tested.},

In this article, an integrated energy management system (IEMS) that performs online analysis and optimization on coupling energy flows in an IES is comprehensively introduced. From the theory perspective, an energy circuit method (ECM) that models natural gas networks and heating networks in the frequency domain is discussed. This method extends the electric circuit modeling of power systems to IESs and enables the IEMS to manage large-scale IESs. From the implementation perspective, the architecture design and function development of the IEMS are presented. Tutorial examples with illustrative case studies are provided to demonstrate its functions of dynamic state estimation, energy flow analysis, security assessment and control, and optimal energy flow. From the application perspective, real-world engineering demonstrations that apply IEMSs in managing building-, park-, and city-scale IESs are reported. The economic and environmental benefits obtained in these demonstration projects indicate that the IEMS has broad application prospects for a low/zero-carbon future energy system.},

  abstract     = {We review recent advances in distributed fiber optic sensing (DFOS) and their applications. The scattering mechanisms in glass, which are exploited for reflectometry-based DFOS, are Rayleigh, Brillouin, and Raman scatterings. These are sensitive to either strain and/or temperature, allowing optical fiber cables to monitor their ambient environment in addition to their conventional role as a medium for telecommunications. Recently, DFOS leveraged technologies developed for telecommunications, such as coherent detection, digital signal processing, coding, and spatial/frequency diversity, to achieve improved performance in terms of measurand resolution, reach, spatial resolution, and bandwidth. We review the theory and architecture of commonly used DFOS methods. We provide recent experimental and field trial results where DFOS was used in wide-ranging applications, such as geohazard monitoring, seismic monitoring, traffic monitoring, and infrastructure health monitoring. Events of interest often have unique signatures either in the spatial, temporal, frequency, or wavenumber domains. Based on the temperature and strain raw data obtained from DFOS, downstream postprocessing allows the detection, classification, and localization of events. Combining DFOS with machine learning methods, it is possible to realize complete sensor systems that are compact, low cost, and can operate in harsh environments and difficult-to-access locations, facilitating increased public safety and smarter cities.},

The spectral and spatial degrees of freedom introduce utilization tradeoffs that can be leveraged under different applications. After briefly reviewing the supporting network building elements (emerging fiber types, multiplexers, optical switches, and amplifiers), we consider networking scenarios such as intra/inter datacenter, terrestrial, undersea, and wireless 5G/6G hauling networks and identify the best utilization plan and key attributes that can be harnessed by the offered spectral and spatial degrees of freedom for each scenario and how optical switching can be employed therein for traffic management. Networks supporting these scenarios are experiencing tremendous traffic growth pushing their existing implementations to their physical capacity-distance limits. New network builds must offer significant capacity multipliers in an efficient and cost-effective manner, requiring new switching solutions for supporting the unabated traffic growths foreseen in the years to come. We discuss how space-division multiplexed networks can help address this challenge in key communication scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Randomly-coupled multi-core fiber (MCF) technology has come to attract lots of attention because of its strong applicability to long-haul transmission systems. Compared with weakly-coupled MCFs with independent cores, it can simultaneously realize higher spatial channel density and ultralow transmission loss using existing ultralow-loss single-mode fiber (SMF) core designs. The strong mode coupling characteristics of randomly-coupled MCFs can provide favorable optical properties, such as suppressed accumulation of modal dispersion (MD), mode-dependent loss (MDL), and nonlinear impairments. This article gives an overview of randomly-coupled MCF technology advancements. First, we describe the classification and design of randomly-coupled MCFs and explain what the randomly-coupled MCFs are and how they are designed. State-of-the-art randomly-coupled MCFs can accommodate four, seven, or 12 cores in a standard 125- $\mu \text{m}$ cladding while achieving ultralow transmission loss and/or small MD, which are very promising for long-haul transmission media. Next, we present the methods to characterize the optical properties of randomly-coupled MCFs and the difference compared to conventional SMF measurements. We also show the low-loss low-MDL connectivity of this type of MCF and the cabling that can suppress MD. A field-deployed randomly-coupled MCF cable testbed is also presented, which confirmed the favorable optical properties of randomly-coupled MCFs after deployment. Then, multi-core amplifier technologies are briefly summarized, and finally, we discuss the performance improvements in the transmissions over randomly-coupled MCFs and suitable application areas.},

Among the several kinds of SDM fiber, a weakly coupled multicore fiber (MCF) is advantageous in that it can be easily upgraded for use in existing equipment and requires no complex signal processing for optical multi-input multi-output (MIMO). In this article, we discuss the progress and standardization activity of MCF technologies from the viewpoint of accelerating the practical application of SDM technology. We first describe the possible application areas of SDM fibers and then show the recent progress of the essential technologies to construct the MCF link: the MCF itself, its splicing and connectorization, and the input/output techniques. We also discuss the availability and deployability of MCF as a large-capacity transmission medium and detail the progress on establishing a new international standard for SDM technology, which includes both historical progress and more recent endeavors on the standardization of optical fiber cables and SDM technology in International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) and International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC).

  abstract     = {Since the 1980s, the single-core optical fiber cable has been the essential data transmission wiring media, with ongoing increases in deployments. Its use case has broadened, with transmission distances ranging from meters to 10000s km, including intrabuilding, fiber-to-the-home (FTTH), terrestrial, and even submarine trunk lines. Currently, optical fiber cable deployment is strongly driven by cloud-based storage, X as a Service (XaaS), and worldwide data center (DC) functionality with the optical interconnection of massive servers on DC campuses. Hence, it is quite natural that the optical fiber cable industry has developed ultrahigh fiber count, high density, and small diameter optical fiber cable, e.g., 6912-fiber-count cable. With high-density cables, massive data capacity can be installed at one time while saving limited space in an underground duct. High-density cable designs have been developed not just by cable structure optimization but through the process of bundling fibers and the use of high-grade optical fibers. Moreover, many enabling technologies have been developed to support the deployment of ultrahigh fiber count cables, such as fiber identification, connectors, mass fusion splicing, and storage systems for fusion splicing points. In this article, state-of-the-art technologies and prospects for ultrahigh-count and ultrahigh-density optical fiber cables and enabling technologies are explained.},

  abstract     = {Wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) has historically enabled the increase in the capacity of optical systems by progressively populating the existing optical bandwidth of erbium-doped fiber amplifiers (EDFAs) in the $C$ -band. Nowadays, the number of channels—needed in optical systems—is approaching the maximum capacity of standard $C$ -band EDFAs. As a result, the industry worked on novel approaches, such as the use of multicore fibers, the extension of the available spectrum of the $C$ -band EDFAs, and the development of transmission systems covering $C$ - and $L$ -bands and beyond. In the context of continuous traffic growth, ultrawideband (UWB) WDM transmission systems appear as a promising technology to leverage the bandwidth of already deployed optical fiber infrastructure and sustain the traffic demand for the years to come. Since the pioneering demonstrations of UWB transmission a few years ago, long strides have been taken toward UWB technologies. In this review article, we discuss how the most recent advances in the design and fabrication of enabling devices, such as lasers, amplifiers, optical switches, and modulators, have improved the performance of UWB systems, paving the way to turn research demonstrations into future products. In addition, we also report on the advances in UWB optical fibers, such as the recently introduced nested antiresonant nodeless fibers (NANFs), whose future implementations could potentially provide up to 300-nm-wide bandwidth at less than 0.2 dB/km loss.},

  abstract     = {Due to widespread applications and rapid development of cloud computing and Internet services, hyperscale data centers have experienced an unprecedented demand for networking. Data center networks are required not only to handle fast-growing traffic, which doubles almost every one to two years, but also to provide high flexibility and availability to support rapidly changing businesses as well. Therefore, hyperscale data center networks have become one of the main drivers for optical interconnect technologies in recent years. In this article, technologies for scaling optical interconnects for inter-data center interconnects (DCIs) are presented. We first describe hyperscale data center network architectures and requirements, as well as the differences between carrier’s optical transport networks and DCI optical networks, with the main focus on metro-DCI and campus-DCI networks. The scale and fast growth rates of DCI networks require innovations not only in data plane technologies but also in control and management planes as well. In data planes, high-capacity flexible coherent technology, pluggable wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM) optical transponders, including 100G direct-detection four-level pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM4) and coherent 400ZR/800ZR, and flex-grid and disaggregated reconfigurable optical add-drop multiplexer (ROADM) optical networks are described. Control and management planes are an integral part of optical transport networks and crucial for effectively operating DCI networks. We show that standard protocols, data models, and modular design of a software platform are essential to building a scalable open and disaggregated optical network, which is fundamental to enabling high automation and intelligence in an optical network. An example control and management platform is discussed in detail. With current fiber capacity approaching the nonlinear Shannon limit, challenges to further scale DCI networks and some potential technologies to support ever-increasing traffic growth are discussed at the end.},

  abstract     = {The advancement of digital coherent technologies has dramatically increased the system capacity per single-core single-mode fiber to the point that we can now approach the Shannon limit by utilizing high-order modulation formats and high-coding gain forward error correction (FEC) codes. Because the required energy per bit increases exponentially the closer we get to the Shannon limit, extending the available optical bandwidth by using ultrawideband wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) and/or spatial-division multiplexing (SDM) is indispensable for increasing the system capacity with high energy efficiency. However, simple extensions of wavelength resources and spatial parallelization dramatically increase the number of transceivers (TxRxs) in proportion to the wavelength/spatial multiplicity. The key to achieving cost- and energy-efficient systems is to reduce the system complexity by using high-density integration and broadband optelectronics. In this article, we overview and discuss the recent advances of coherent optical transceivers integrated with an optical front end and digital signal processing (DSP)/application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC). We then present the transponder architectures and the challenges involved in applying them for massive parallelized transmission systems.},

Yet, after accommodating the world’s exponentially growing appetite for transmitted data for more than three decades, its ability to continue doing so is being challenged by fundamental factors. In this article, we review these factors and examine their consequences in terms of information capacity. In particular, we review the difficulties that are imposed by the nonlinear nature of fiber-optic transmission on the assessment of the capacity and on the definition of fundamental concepts, such as bandwidth and spectral efficiency. We discuss relevant approximations and regimes of operation in which bounds for the capacity can be effectively assessed while covering a broad range of applications ranging from interdatacenter communications to links spanning transoceanic distances. We relate to a broad variety of transmission schemes and discuss the potential benefits of spatial multiplexing with multimode and multicore fibers. State-of-the-art transmission experiments are also reviewed and compared with theoretical capacity bounds.},

In addition, we illustrate the distinguishing feature of VSA, “computing in superposition,” which sets it apart from conventional computing. It also opens the door to efficient solutions to the difficult combinatorial search problems inherent in AI applications. We sketch ways of demonstrating that VSA are computationally universal. We see them acting as a framework for computing with distributed representations that can play a role of an abstraction layer for emerging computing hardware.

  abstract     = {The emerging technology of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) is provisioned as an enabler of smart wireless environments, offering a highly scalable, low-cost, hardware-efficient, and almost energy-neutral solution for dynamic control of the propagation of electromagnetic signals over the wireless medium, ultimately providing increased environmental intelligence for diverse operation objectives. One of the major challenges with the envisioned dense deployment of RISs in such reconfigurable radio environments is the efficient configuration of multiple metasurfaces with limited, or even the absence of, computing hardware. In this article, we consider multiuser and multi-RIS-empowered wireless systems and present a thorough survey of the online machine learning approaches for the orchestration of their various tunable components. Focusing on the sum-rate maximization as a representative design objective, we present a comprehensive problem formulation based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL). We detail the correspondences among the parameters of the wireless system and the DRL terminology, and devise generic algorithmic steps for the artificial neural network training and deployment while discussing their implementation details. Further practical considerations for multi-RIS-empowered wireless communications in the sixth-generation (6G) era are presented along with some key open research challenges. Different from the DRL-based status quo, we leverage the independence between the configuration of the system design parameters and the future states of the wireless environment, and present efficient multiarmed bandits approaches, whose resulting sum-rate performances are numerically shown to outperform random configurations, while being sufficiently close to the conventional deep $Q$ network (DQN) algorithm, but with lower implementation complexity.},

  abstract     = {Programmable wireless environments (PWEs) utilize internetworked intelligent metasurfaces to transform wireless propagation into a software-controlled resource. In this article, the interplay is explored between the user devices, the metasurfaces, and the PWE control system from the theory to the end-to-end implementation. This article first discusses the metasurface hardware and software, covering the complete workflow from the user device initialization to its final service via the PWE. Furthermore, to be compatible with the 5G and 6G wireless systems, the software-defined networking (SDN) paradigm is extended to achieve scalable internetworking and central control in PWE deployments with multiple metasurfaces and multihop communication. Subsequently, the set of SDN foundations is exploited in order to abstract the physics behind PWEs and a theoretical framework is established to describe and manipulate them in an algorithmic form. This can lead to smart radio environments that are readily accessible from various engineering disciplines, facilitating their integration into existing networks, wireless systems, and applications. This article is concluded by outlining strategies for the optimal placement of metasurfaces within a PWE-controlled space, open challenges in PWE security, specialized SDN integration issues, and theoretical problems toward the graph-driven modeling of PWEs.},

  abstract     = {Nonterrestrial communications have emerged as a key enabler for seamless connectivity in the upcoming generation networks. This kind of network can support high data rate communications among aerial platforms (i.e., unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), high-altitude platforms (HAPs), and satellites) and cellular networks, achieving anywhere and anytime connections. However, there are many practical implementation limitations, especially overload power consumption, high probability of blockage, and dynamic propagation environment. Fortunately, the recent technology reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is expected to be one of the most cost-efficient solutions to address such issues. RIS with low-cost elements can bypass blockages and create multiple line-of-sight (LoS) links and provide controllable communication channels. In this article, we present a comprehensive literature review on the RIS-assisted nonterrestrial networks (RANTNs). First, the framework of the RANTNs is introduced with detailed discussion about distinct properties of RIS in NTNs and the two deployment types of RIS, that is, terrestrial RISs (TRISs), and aerial RISs (ARISs), and the classification of RANTNs, including RIS-assisted air-to-ground (A2G)/ground-to-air (G2A), ARIS-assisted ground-to-ground (G2G), and RIS-assisted air-to-air (A2A) communications. In combination with next-generation communication technologies, the advanced technologies in RANTNs are discussed. Then, we overview the literature related to RANTNs from the perspectives of performance analysis and optimization, followed by the widely used methodologies. Finally, open challenges and future research direction in the context of the RANTNs are highlighted.},

  abstract     = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) has emerged as a promising technique for wireless communication networks. By dynamically tuning the reflection amplitudes/phase shifts of a large number of passive elements, IRS enables flexible wireless channel control and configuration and thereby enhances the wireless signal transmission rate and reliability significantly. Despite the vast literature on designing and optimizing assorted IRS-aided wireless systems, prior works have mainly focused on enhancing wireless links with single signal reflection only by one or multiple IRSs, which may be insufficient to boost the wireless link capacity under some harsh propagation conditions (e.g., indoor environment with dense blockages/obstructions). This issue can be tackled by employing two or more IRSs to assist each wireless link and jointly exploiting their single as well as multiple signal reflections over them. However, the resultant double-/multi-IRS-aided wireless systems face more complex design issues as well as new practical challenges for implementation compared to the conventional single-IRS counterpart, in terms of IRS reflection optimization, channel acquisition, as well as IRS deployment and association/selection. As such, a new paradigm for designing multi-IRS cooperative passive beamforming and joint active/passive beam routing arises, which calls for innovative design approaches and optimization methods. In this article, we give a tutorial overview of multi-IRS-aided wireless networks, with an emphasis on addressing the new challenges due to multi-IRS signal reflection and routing. Moreover, we point out important directions worthy of research and investigation in the future.},

The key idea of NOMA is to utilize users’ dynamic channel conditions to improve spectral efficiency and user fairness. Naturally, the two communication techniques are complementary to each other and can be integrated to cope with the challenging requirements envisioned for 6G mobile networks. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the recent progress on the synergistic integration of RISs and NOMA. In particular, the basics of both techniques are introduced first, and then, the fundamentals of RIS-NOMA are discussed for two communication scenarios with different transceiver capabilities. Resource allocation is of paramount importance for the success of RIS-assisted NOMA networks, and various approaches, including artificial intelligence (AI)-empowered designs, are introduced. Security provisioning in RIS-NOMA networks is also discussed as wireless networks are prone to security attacks due to the nature of the shared wireless medium.

  abstract     = {In a backscatter communication system, the backscatter device (BD) transmits its messages to the backscatter receiver (BR) by reflecting the incident signal from an external radio frequency (RF) emitter, instead of using power-hungry active RF components themselves. Thus, backscatter communication has shown great potential for achieving low-power communication. The double-fading effect associated with the backscatter link, however, is a major limiting factor to achieve efficient backscatter communication. Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), a recently developed technology, can be applied at the BD to enhance the backscatter link thanks to the fact that both RIS and backscatter communication share the same reflective principle. Such a design can also allow the backscatter communication system to capture the desired RF signal as a reflective carrier in a complex radio environment. In this article, a comprehensive overview of backscatter communication assisted by RIS is given. We first introduce the basics of backscatter communication, which covers the antenna scattering principle, backscatter modulation, and link budget calculation. Then, the details of RIS are discussed, which include antenna-based RIS and metamaterial-based RIS, followed by the discussion of the roles of RIS in backscatter communication. After that, we provide an overview of three types of backscatter communication systems assisted by RIS, including RIS-assisted unmodulated backscatter communication, RIS-assisted ambient backscatter communication, and RIS-assisted symbiotic radio. Emerging applications of these systems, technical challenges, and future opportunities in this emerging field are also presented.},

The process of determining these channels is complicated when the RIS is composed of passive elements without any sensing or data processing capabilities, and thus, the channels must be estimated indirectly by a noncolocated device, typically a controlling base station (BS). In this article, we examine channel estimation for passive RIS-based systems from a fundamental viewpoint. We study various possible channel models and the identifiability of the models as a function of the available pilot data and behavior of the RIS during training. In particular, we will consider situations with and without line-of-sight propagation, single-antenna and multi-antenna configurations for the users and BS, correlated and sparse channel models, single-carrier and wideband orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) scenarios, availability of direct links between the users and BS, exploitation of prior information, as well as a number of other special cases. We further conduct simulations of representative algorithms and comparisons of their performance for various channel models using the relevant Cramér-Rao bounds.},

To this end, two different typologies of MTS are reviewed: surface-wave-based MTSs and nonspecular reflective MTSs. Both types can be effectively characterized using simplified problems that locally match the homogenized, modulated BCs. A different use of these problems allows for an accurate design of radiated and scattered fields. An accurate ray representation is also suggested, which allows for an effective description of the scattered field also in the Fresnel region and for the insertion of the MTS description in ray-tracing tools for network planning. Several examples of practical implementation are shown, and the challenges in applying electronic reconfigurability are discussed.},

In this tutorial article, we focus our attention on communication models for RISs. First, we review the communication models that are most often employed in wireless communications and networks for analyzing and optimizing RISs and elaborate on their advantages and limitations. Then, we concentrate on models for RISs that are based on inhomogeneous sheets of surface impedance and offer a step-by-step tutorial on formulating electromagnetically consistent analytical models for optimizing the surface impedance. The differences between local and global designs are discussed and analytically formulated in terms of surface power efficiency and reradiated power flux through the Poynting vector. Finally, with the aid of numerical results, we discuss how approximate global designs can be realized by using locally passive RISs with zero electrical resistance (i.e., inhomogeneous reactance boundaries with no local power amplification) even for large angles of reflection and at high power efficiency.},

Between 2020 and 2030, it is forecast that the data traffic of the global internet protocol will increase by 55\% each year, eventually reaching 5016 EB, with data rates scaling up to 1 Tb/s. Besides supporting very high data rates, future wireless networks are expected to offer several other heterogeneous services, which include sensing, localization, low-latency, and ultrareliable communications. Fifth-generation (5G) networks are, however, not designed to meet these requirements. As the demands and needs become more stringent, in fact, fundamental limitations arise, which are ultimately imposed by the inherent nature of the wireless operation.},

  abstract     = {With the advent of 5G technology, the notion of latency got a prominent role in wireless connectivity, serving as a proxy term for addressing the requirements for real-time communication. As wireless systems evolve toward 6G, the ambition to immerse the digital into physical reality will increase. Besides making the real-time requirements more stringent, this immersion will bring the notions of time, simultaneity, presence, and causality to a new level of complexity. A growing body of research points out that latency is insufficient to parameterize all real-time requirements. Notably, one such requirement that received significant attention is information freshness, defined through the Age of Information (AoI) and its derivatives. In general, the metrics derived from a conventional black-box approach to communication network design are not representative of new distributed paradigms, such as sensing, learning, or distributed consensus. The objective of this article is to investigate the general notion of timing in wireless communication systems and networks, and its relation to effective information generation, processing, transmission, and reconstruction at the senders and receivers. We establish a general statistical framework of timing requirements in wireless communication systems, which subsumes both latency and AoI. The framework is made by associating a timing component with the two basic statistical operations: decision and estimation. We first use the framework to present a representative sample of the existing works that deal with timing in wireless communication. Next, it is shown how the framework can be used with different communication models of increasing complexity, starting from the basic Shannon one-way communication model and arriving at communication models for consensus, distributed learning, and inference. Overall, this article fills an important gap in the literature by providing a systematic treatment of various timing measures in wireless communication and sets the basis for design and optimization for the next-generation real-time systems.},

  abstract     = {With outstanding features, machine learning (ML) has become the backbone of numerous applications in wireless networks. However, the conventional ML approaches face many challenges in practical implementation, such as the lack of labeled data, the constantly changing wireless environments, the long training process, and the limited capacity of wireless devices. These challenges, if not addressed, can impede the effectiveness and applicability of ML in wireless networks. To address these problems, transfer learning (TL) has recently emerged to be a promising solution. The core idea of TL is to leverage and synthesize distilled knowledge from similar tasks and valuable experiences accumulated from the past to facilitate the learning of new problems. By doing so, TL techniques can reduce the dependence on labeled data, improve the learning speed, and enhance the ML methods’ robustness to different wireless environments. This article aims to provide a comprehensive survey on the applications of TL in wireless networks. Particularly, we first provide an overview of TL, including formal definitions, classification, and various types of TL techniques. We then discuss diverse TL approaches proposed to address emerging issues in wireless networks. The issues include spectrum management, signal recognition, security, caching, localization, and human activity recognition, which are all important to next-generation networks, such as 5G and beyond. Finally, we highlight important challenges, open issues, and future research directions of TL in future wireless networks.},

  abstract     = {Light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation (laser) sources has many advantages for use in high-data-rate optical wireless communications (OWCs). In particular, the low-cost and high-bandwidth properties of laser sources, such as vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs), make them attractive for future indoor OWCs. In order to be integrated into future indoor networks, such lasers should conform to eye safety regulations determined by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) standards for laser safety. In this article, we provide a detailed study of beam propagation to evaluate the received power of various laser sources, based on which and the maximum permissible exposure (MPE) defined by the IEC 60825-1:2014 Standard, we establish a comprehensive framework for eye safety analyses. This framework allows us to calculate the maximum allowable transmit power, which is crucial in the design of a reliable and safe laser-based wireless communication system. Initially, we consider a single-mode Gaussian beam and calculate the maximum permissible transmit power. Subsequently, we generalize this approach for higher mode beams. It is shown that the $M$ -squared-based approach for analysis of multimode lasers ensures the IEC eye safety limits; however, in some scenarios, it can be too conservative compared to the precise beam decomposition method. Laser safety analyses with consideration of optical elements, such as lens and diffuser, as well as for the VCSEL array, have been also presented. Skin safety, as another significant factor of laser safety, has also been investigated in this article. We have studied the impacts of various parameters, such as wavelength, exposure duration, and the divergence angle of laser sources on the safety analysis by presenting insightful results.},

  abstract     = {The number of mobile users is increasing rapidly, with expected numbers to exceed 5.7 billion, resulting in about 79\% of the total global data traffic. It is anticipated that smartphones, laptops, tablets, and wireless sensors will struggle to get their required share of the radio frequency (RF) spectrum without a significant capacity increase. In the fifth generation (5G) and beyond cellular networks, 1000-fold capacity growth is expected with respect to the fourth generation (4G) and long-term evolution (LTE) wireless networks. Therefore, the RF spectrum is becoming congested and wireless devices must cope with increased cochannel interference. As a result, the data throughput of the devices is severely affected, and the established connection may be poor. Optical wireless communication (OWC) enables wireless connectivity harnessing a huge spectrum, which is available in infrared, visible, or ultraviolet bands. Moreover, OWC is license free thus leading to a cost-effective service. It is a solution to alleviate RF spectrum congestion for both indoor and outdoor scenarios.},

  abstract     = {This article presents an overview of the current state of research and application of haptic (primarily kinesthetic) feedback and force-based teleoperation in the context of surgical robotics. Telerobotic surgery provides an approach for transferring the sensorimotor skills of a surgeon through a robotic platform to perform surgical intervention inside a patient’s body. Integration of advanced sensing and haptic technologies in telerobotic surgery can help to enhance the sensory awareness and motor accuracy of the surgeon, thereby leading to improved surgical procedures and outcomes for patients. The primary mode of sensory feedback has been through 3-D visual observation using stereo endoscopes. However, until recently, the sense of touch, i.e., haptics, has been missing in the commercial telesurgery robots approved for use in the operating room despite over two decades of research and development in the field of haptics for teleoperated systems (“telehaptics”). Research has shown that high-fidelity force feedback can enhance the performance of telesurgery and potential outcomes by enabling the surgeon to have a more natural feel of interaction between surgical tools and tissue as normally experienced during open surgery. Interaction forces, such as those generated during palpation of tissue, insertion of a needle, unintentional (and potentially unsafe) exertion of force by a tool, suture breakage, needle slippage, or tool interaction, are replaced by indirect (virtual) sensations, termed visual haptics, which provides an alternative to sensory compensation. Although there is a significant amount of literature supporting this benefit, there are still several important technical challenges in introducing haptics in telesurgery, including instrumentation, fidelity (transparency), stability, and modalities for force reflection, e.g., direct or indirect. This article examines these challenges and discusses recent work on haptics-based teleoperated surgical robotic systems.},

  abstract     = {Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can provide high-quality 3-D visualization of target anatomy, surrounding tissue, and instrumentation, but there are significant challenges in harnessing it for effectively guiding interventional procedures. Challenges include the strong static magnetic field, rapidly switching magnetic field gradients, high-power radio frequency pulses, sensitivity to electrical noise, and constrained space to operate within the bore of the scanner. MRI has a number of advantages over other medical imaging modalities, including no ionizing radiation, excellent soft-tissue contrast that allows for visualization of tumors and other features that are not readily visible by other modalities, true 3-D imaging capabilities, including the ability to image arbitrary scan plane geometry or perform volumetric imaging, and capability for multimodality sensing, including diffusion, dynamic contrast, blood flow, blood oxygenation, temperature, and tracking of biomarkers. The use of robotic assistants within the MRI bore, alongside the patient during imaging, enables intraoperative MR imaging (iMRI) to guide a surgical intervention in a closed-loop fashion that can include tracking of tissue deformation and target motion, localization of instrumentation, and monitoring of therapy delivery. With the ever-expanding clinical use of MRI, MRI-compatible robotic systems have been heralded as a new approach to assist interventional procedures to allow physicians to treat patients more accurately and effectively. Deploying robotic systems inside the bore synergizes the visual capability of MRI and the manipulation capability of robotic assistance, resulting in a closed-loop surgery architecture. This article details the challenges and history of robotic systems intended to operate in an MRI environment and outlines promising clinical applications and associated state-of-the-art MRI-compatible robotic systems and technology for making this possible.},

  abstract     = {Intraocular surgery, one of the most challenging discipline of microsurgery, requires sensory and motor skills at the limits of human physiological capabilities combined with tremendously difficult requirements for accuracy and steadiness. Nowadays, robotics combined with advanced imaging has opened conspicuous and significant directions in advancing the field of intraocular microsurgery. Having patient treatment with greater safety and efficiency as the final goal, similar to other medical applications, robotics has a real potential to fundamentally change microsurgery by combining human strengths with computer and sensor-based technology in an information-driven environment. Still in its early stages, robotic assistance for intraocular microsurgery has been accepted with precaution in the operating room and successfully tested in a limited number of clinical trials. However, due to its demonstrated capabilities including hand tremor reduction, haptic feedback, steadiness, enhanced dexterity, micrometer-scale accuracy, and others, microsurgery robotics has evolved as a very promising trend in advancing retinal surgery. This article will analyze the advances in retinal robotic microsurgery, its current drawbacks and limitations, as well as the possible new directions to expand retinal microsurgery to techniques currently beyond human boundaries or infeasible without robotics.},

It is fuelled by the industry’s appreciation of the wide range of soft materials available that can be used to create highly dexterous robots with adaptability characteristics far beyond that which can be achieved with rigid component devices. The ability, inherent in soft robots, to compliantly adapt to the environment, has significantly sparked interest from the surgical robotics community.

Their narrow curvilinear shape makes them well suited to passing through body lumens, natural orifices, or small surgical incisions to perform minimally invasive procedures. Modeling and controlling these robots are, however, substantially more complex than traditional robots comprised of rigid links connected by discrete joints. Furthermore, there are many approaches to achieving robot flexure. Each presents its own design and modeling challenges, and to date, each has been pursued largely independently of the others. This article attempts to provide a unified summary of the state of the art of continuum robot architectures with respect to design for specific clinical applications. It also describes a unifying framework for modeling and controlling these systems while additionally explaining the elements unique to each architecture. The major research accomplishments are described for each topic and directions for the future progress needed to achieve widespread clinical use are identified.},

  abstract     = {Telesurgical robotics, as a technical solution for robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RAMIS), has become the first domain within medicosurgical robotics that achieved a true global clinical adoption. Its relative success (still at a low single-digit percentile total market penetration) roots in the particular human-in-the-loop control, in which the trained surgeon is always kept responsible for the clinical outcome achieved by the robot-actuated invasive tools. Nowadays, this paradigm is challenged by the need for improved surgical performance, traceability, and safety reaching beyond the human capabilities. Partially due to the technical complexity and the financial burden, the adoption of telesurgical robotics has not reached its full potential, by far. Apart from the absolutely market-dominating da Vinci surgical system, there are already 60+ emerging RAMIS robot types, out of which 15 have already achieved some form of regulatory clearance. This article aims to connect the technological advancement with the principles of commercialization, particularly looking at engineering components that are under development and have the potential to bring significant advantages to the clinical practice. Current RAMIS robots often do not exceed the functionalities deriving from their mechatronics, due to the lack of data-driven assistance and smart human–machine collaboration. Computer assistance is gradually gaining more significance within emerging RAMIS systems. Enhanced manipulation capabilities, refined sensors, advanced vision, task-level automation, smart safety features, and data integration mark together the inception of a new era in telesurgical robotics, infiltrated by machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) solutions. Observing other domains, it is definite that a key requirement of a robust AI is the good quality data, derived from proper data acquisition and sharing to allow building solutions in real time based on ML. Emerging RAMIS technologies are reviewed both in a historical and a future perspective.},

To better understand the current research status, this article reviews the research progress of second-life lithium-ion batteries for stationary energy storage applications, including battery aging mechanisms, repurposing, modeling, battery management, and optimal sizing. Energy management strategies are reviewed to maximize the economic benefits for SLBs, and the less-demanding applications of SLBs are presented.

This requires the construction of genetic control, sequencing, and feedback systems that have close parallels to electronic design, which is one reason the field may be of interest to readers of IEEE journals. The other reason is that synthetic morphogenesis allows the construction of two-way interfaces, especially optogenetic and optoelectronic, between the living and the electronic, allowing unprecedented information flow and control between the two types of “machines.” This review introduces synthetic morphogenesis, illustrates what has been achieved, drawing parallels wherever possible between biology and electronics, and looks forward to likely next steps and challenges to be overcome.},

Here, we develop two complementary approaches that allow us to determine whether a given molecular circuit, represented by a mathematical model, is capable of fulfilling our design objectives. We discuss algebraic methods that are capable of identifying general principles guaranteeing desired behavior; we provide an overview of Bayesian design approaches that allow us to choose a model that has the highest probability of fulfilling our design objectives from a set of models.

  abstract     = {Synthetic biology approaches living systems with an engineering perspective and promises to deliver solutions to global challenges in healthcare and sustainability. A critical component is the design of biomolecular circuits with programmable input–output behaviors. Such circuits typically rely on a sensor module that recognizes molecular inputs, which is coupled to a functional output via protein-level circuits or regulating the expression of a target gene. While gene expression outputs can be customized relatively easily by exchanging the target genes, sensing new inputs is a major limitation. There is a limited repertoire of sensors found in nature, and there are often difficulties with interfacing them with engineered circuits. Computational protein design could be a key enabling technology to address these challenges, as it allows for the engineering of modular and tunable sensors that can be tailored to the circuit’s application. In this article, we review recent computational approaches to design protein-based sensors for small-molecule inputs with particular focus on those based on the widely used Rosetta software suite. Furthermore, we review mechanisms that have been harnessed to couple ligand inputs to functional outputs. Based on recent literature, we illustrate how the combination of protein design and synthetic biology enables new sensors for diverse applications ranging from biomedicine to metabolic engineering. We conclude with a perspective on how strategies to address frontiers in protein design and cellular circuit design may enable the next generation of sense-response networks, which may increasingly be assembled from de novo components to display diverse and engineerable input-output behaviors.},

Shaped over billions of years by the creative machinations of evolution, this design template encodes the most complex dynamical systems known to us. Yet, it is only in our lifetimes that we are able to directly edit this template and engineer our own designs. The story that I tell in this article is about our early attempts to design and commission our own control systems in living cells. Guided by what we have learned from controlling man-made systems, we are beginning to develop the theory and methodologies needed to build control systems at the molecular level, an endeavor that is as challenging as it is rewarding. If carried out responsibly, this new ability to reshape the DNA template can have a tremendous benefit for our health and well-being, and will drive major advances in basic science, industrial biotechnology, and medical therapy. In this article, I will take the readers of the proceedings on a journey through the new and promising world of rationally designed genetic control systems. Using a minimum of jargon, I will introduce them to the biological concepts needed to develop an understanding and appreciation of the main design concepts emerging in this nascent area of research. My goal is to convey my own sense of excitement about the possibilities, but it is also to impart a feeling of the opportunities that lay ahead for members of the IEEE to contribute with their own creative ideas to the shaping of this most versatile of design templates, the DNA.},

  abstract     = {Synthetic biologists engineered the first genetic toggle switch and clock at the turn of the 21st century. Since the development of these first gene circuits, methods for circuit design and construction have improved dramatically, narrowing the gap between concept and proof-of-principle implementation. Engineered genetic constructs have started to leave the lab for the real world where they are being used in applications, including medicine, biosensing, and industrial chemical production. The field of synthetic gene circuits has also grown from focusing on single, isolated circuits to designing complex systems that operate across multiple populations in carefully engineered consortia. In addition, design methods have progressively moved toward including detailed models of the interactions between the host genome and the synthetic gene circuits that it contains in order to better predict circuit dynamics. This article will review some of the most recent advances in gene circuit design and implementation, with a focus on synthetic gene circuits being applied to address real-world problems.},

  abstract     = {Learning is commonplace in organisms such as ourselves and even in organisms as far distant as the bee and the octopus. Such learning is implemented by brains, or neuronal networks, and has been extensively studied within ethology, psychology, cognitive science, and neuroscience. Whether learning also takes place in nonneuronal settings has remained a matter of sustained controversy, too often dominated by ideological views. In this survey, I will explain how learning can be rigorously interpreted as a form of information processing and then explore the evidence for whether learning also takes place in organismal contexts outside the brain, such as physiology, development, and individual cells. I will try to explain why it is important to build bridges in this way between cognitive science and systems biology, why concepts and methods from various branches of engineering may be helpful in this task, and what the eventual impact may be on how we think about the organism.},

  abstract     = {Spikes and rhythms organize control and communication in the animal world, in contrast to the bits and clocks of digital technology. As continuous-time signals that can be counted, spikes have a mixed nature. This article reviews ongoing efforts to develop a control theory of spiking systems. The central thesis is that the mixed nature of spiking results from a mixed feedback principle, and a control theory of mixed feedback can be grounded in the operator theoretic concept of maximal monotonicity. As a nonlinear generalization of passivity, maximal monotonicity acknowledges at once the physics of electrical circuits, the algorithmic tractability of convex optimization, and the feedback control theory of incremental passivity. We discuss the relevance of a theory of spiking control systems in the emerging age of event-based technology.},

In this article, we will discuss machine learning approaches to address these types of translation and counterfactual problems. We will begin by giving an overview on single-cell biology applications and the relevant translation problems. Subsequently, we will provide an overview of approaches for multidomain alignment and translation in machine learning, including methods based on generative modeling, optimal transport, and causal inference. The bulk of this article will focus on how these approaches have been tailored and applied to important translation problems in single-cell biology, illustrated through concrete examples from our own work.

After introducing its main concepts, we focus on numerical tools, such as optimization and sampling, to predict cellular features and behaviors at a large scale. Optimization approaches exploit that metabolic networks are shaped by evolution and are, thus, assumed to embed a fitness condition reflecting the environment that they evolved in. In the past ten years, there is a trend to generalize metabolic network analysis to consortia of interacting species. This raises technical questions on, for example, optimality in consortia but also more general ones on metabolic coevolution, information exchange, and adaptation. This suggests and allows us to explore interesting analogies to technological systems, specifically to smart grids.},

  abstract     = {Over the past 25 years, there has been an unparalleled increase in understanding of cancer biology. This transformation is exemplified by Hanahan and Weinberg’s decision in 2011 to expand their original Hallmarks of Cancer from six traits to ten! At the same time, mathematical modeling has emerged as a natural tool for unraveling the complex processes that contribute to the initiation and progression of cancer, for testing hypotheses about experimental and clinical observations and assisting with the development of new approaches for improving its treatment. This article starts by reviewing some of the earliest models of tumor growth and tumor responses to radiotherapy. Following Hanahan and Weinberg’s lead, attention then focuses on how closer collaboration with cancer scientists and access to experimental data are stimulating the development of new and increasingly detailed models that account, for example, for tumor–immune interactions and immunotherapy. The article concludes by discussing the ways in which mathematical modeling is being integrated with experimental and clinical studies, and outlining how this could improve disease diagnosis and the delivery of effective personalized treatments to cancer patients. As such, this article serves as an introduction to mathematical modeling of cancer and its treatments, suitable for researchers seeking to enter the field.},

In the United States alone, the number of smart speakers, such as Amazon’s Echo and Google Home, has grown by 78\% to 118.5 million, and 21\% of the U.S. population own at least one device. Given the increasing dependency of society on PVAs, security and privacy of these have become a major concern of users, manufacturers, and policy makers. Consequently, a steep increase in research efforts addressing security and privacy of PVAs can be observed in recent years. While some security and privacy research applicable to the PVA domain predates their recent increase in popularity, many new research strands have emerged. This article provides a survey of the state of the art in PVA security and privacy. The focus of this work is on the security and privacy challenges arising from the use of the acoustic channel. Work that describes both attacks and countermeasures is discussed. We highlight established areas such as voice authentication (VA) and new areas such as acoustic Denial of Service (DoS) that deserve more attention. This survey describes research areas where the threat is relatively well understood but where countermeasures are lacking, for example, in the area of hidden voice commands. We also discuss work that looks at privacy implications; for example, work on management of recording consent. This survey is intended to provide a comprehensive research map for PVA security and privacy.},

Signal decomposition is traditionally achieved by projecting data onto predefined basis functions, often known as atoms. Coefficient manipulation (e.g., thresholding) combined with signal reconstruction then either provides signals with enhanced quality or permits extraction of desired features only. More recently dictionary learning and deep learning have also been actively used for similar tasks. The purpose of dictionary learning is to derive the most appropriate basis functions directly from the observed data. In deep learning, neural networks or other transfer functions are taught to perform either feature classification or data enhancement directly, provided solely some training data. This review shows first how popular signal processing methods, such as basis pursuit and sparse coding, are related to analysis and synthesis. We then explain how dictionary learning and deep learning using neural networks can also be interpreted as generalized analysis and synthesis methods. We introduce the underlying principles of all techniques and then show their inherent strengths and weaknesses using various examples, including two toy examples, a moonscape image, a magnetic resonance image, and geophysical data.},

  abstract     = {Fusing probabilistic information is a fundamental task in signal and data processing with relevance to many fields of technology and science. In this work, we investigate the fusion of multiple probability density functions (pdfs) of a continuous random variable or vector. Although the case of continuous random variables and the problem of pdf fusion frequently arise in multisensor signal processing, statistical inference, and machine learning, a universally accepted method for pdf fusion does not exist. The diversity of approaches, perspectives, and solutions related to pdf fusion motivates a unified presentation of the theory and methodology of the field. We discuss three different approaches to fusing pdfs. In the axiomatic approach, the fusion rule is defined indirectly by a set of properties (axioms). In the optimization approach, it is the result of minimizing an objective function that involves an information-theoretic divergence or a distance measure. In the supra-Bayesian approach, the fusion center interprets the pdfs to be fused as random observations. Our work is partly a survey, reviewing in a structured and coherent fashion many of the concepts and methods that have been developed in the literature. In addition, we present new results for each of the three approaches. Our original contributions include new fusion rules, axioms, and axiomatic and optimization-based characterizations; a new formulation of supra-Bayesian fusion in terms of finite-dimensional parametrizations; and a study of supra-Bayesian fusion of posterior pdfs for linear Gaussian models.},

  abstract     = {For accommodating rapidly increasing power demands, power systems are transitioning from analog systems to systems with increasing digital control and communications. Although this modernization brings many far-reaching benefits, the hardware and software newly incorporated into the power systems also incur many vulnerabilities. By taking advantage of these vulnerabilities, adversaries can launch various cyber/physical attacks to tamper with electricity meter readings, i.e., to steal electricity. It is reported that total worldwide annual economic losses caused by electricity theft reached up to almost one hundred billion dollars in recent years. With methods to tamper with meter readings becoming more versatile, secret, and flexible, electricity theft tends to get even more serious in modernized power systems. For preventing adversaries from stealing electricity, researchers have done a lot of works. Although some related surveys on these works exist, they are not updated or just discuss electricity theft in a specific region. This survey aims to gain a comprehensive and in-depth understanding of the electricity theft issue. After investigating how adversaries tamper with meter readings, we systematically survey all existing detection methods up to date, which is classified into machine learning- and measurement mismatch-based methods. Adverse effects and political and socioeconomic factors of electricity theft are also provided. This survey can help relevant researchers to shape future research directions, especially in the area of developing new effective electricity theft detection methods.},

Some of the most promising application areas include wearable haptic interfaces, assistive robotics, and biomedical devices. Several attributes of soft robotic systems make them well-suited for use in human-wearable applications. Such systems can be designed to accommodate the complex morphology and movements of the human body, can afford sufficient compliance to ensure safe operation in intimate proximity with humans, and can provide context-appropriate haptic feedback or assistance to their wearers. Many soft robotic systems have been designed to resemble garments or wearables that are already widely used today. Such systems could one day become seamlessly integrated into a myriad of human activities and environments. Here, we review emerging advances in wearable soft robotic technologies and systems, including numerous examples from prior research. We discuss important considerations for the design of such systems based on functional concerns, wearability, and ergonomics. We describe an array of design strategies that have been adopted in prior research. We review wearable soft robotics applications in diverse domains, survey sensing and actuation technologies, materials, and fabrication methods.

However, due to the limited computing and communication capabilities, wirelessly powered networks (WPNs) may be incapable of employing complex security practices, e.g., encryption, which may incur considerable computation and communication overheads. This challenge makes securing energy harvesting communications an arduous task and, thus, limits the use of WPNs in many high-security applications. In this context, security at the physical layer (PHY) that exploits the intrinsic properties of the wireless medium to achieve secure communication has emerged as an alternative paradigm. This article first introduces the fundamental principles of primary PHY attacks, covering jamming, eavesdropping, and detection of covert, and then presents an overview of the prevalent countermeasures to secure both active and passive communications in WPNs. Furthermore, a number of open research issues are identified to inspire possible future research.},

Wirelessly powered backscattering wireless sensor networks (WSNs) become particularly important to meet the upcoming era of the Internet of Things (IoT), which requires the massive deployment of self-sustainable and maintenance-free low-cost sensing and communication devices. This article will introduce the state-of-the-art antenna design and radio frequency (RF) system integration for wirelessly powered backscatter communications, covering both the node and the base unit. We capture the latest development in ultralow-power RF front ends and coding schemes for $\mu \text{W}$ -level backscatter modulators, as well as the latest progress in wireless power transfer (WPT) and energy harvesting (EH) techniques. Newly emerged rectenna system, waveform design, and channel optimization are reviewed in light of the opportunities for adaptively optimizing the WPT/EH efficiency for low-power signals with varying conditions. In addition, advanced device packaging and integration technologies in, e.g., additively manufactured RF components and modules for microwave and millimeter-wave ubiquitous sensing and backscattering energy-autonomous RF structures are reported. Inkjet printing for the sustainable and ultralow-cost fabrication of flexible RF devices and sensors will be reviewed to provide a prospective insight into the future packaging of backscatter communications from the chip-level design to complete system integration. Finally, this article will also address the challenges in fully wireless powered backscatter radio networks and discuss the future directions of backscatter communication in terms of “Green IoT” and “Low Carbon” smart home, smart city, smart skin, and machine-to-machine (M2M) applications.},

Although IRS-aided WET shares similar characteristics with IRS-aided WIT, they differ fundamentally in terms of design objective, receiver architecture, practical constraints, and so on.

To realize the promised potentials, advanced resource allocation design plays a decisive role in revealing, understanding, and exploiting the intrinsic rate–energy tradeoff capitalizing on the dual use of radio frequency (RF) signals for wireless charging and communication. In this article, we provide a comprehensive tutorial overview of SWIPT from the perspective of resource allocation design. The fundamental concepts, system architectures, and RF energy harvesting (EH) models are introduced. In particular, three commonly adopted EH models, namely, the linear EH model, the nonlinear saturation EH model, and the nonlinear circuit-based EH model, are characterized and discussed. Then, for a typical wireless system setup, we establish a generalized resource allocation design framework that subsumes conventional resource allocation design problems as special cases. Subsequently, we elaborate on relevant tools from optimization theory and exploit them for solving representative resource allocation design problems for SWIPT systems with and without perfect channel state information (CSI) available at the transmitter, respectively. The associated technical challenges and insights are also highlighted. Furthermore, we discuss several promising and exciting future research directions for resource allocation design for SWIPT systems intertwined with cutting-edge communication technologies, such as intelligent reflecting surfaces, unmanned aerial vehicles, mobile edge computing, federated learning, and machine learning.},

The state of the art regarding SAR and MPE is outlined together with a description as to how these can be modeled in the context of communication networks. We propose a deep learning approach for the design of robust beamforming subject to specific information, energy harvesting, and SAR constraints.

Wired tethers simplify power and data interfaces but restrict the duration and types of experiments that are possible, particularly for the study of sensorimotor pathways in freely behaving animals. To eliminate tethers, there is significant ongoing research to develop fully wireless BCIs having wireless uplink of broadband neural recordings and wireless recharging for long-duration deployment, but significant challenges persist. BCIs must deliver complex functionality while complying with tightly coupled constraints in size, weight, power, noise, and biocompatibility.

In this article, we first compare the design methodology and scalability of narrowband and broadband arrays. An example 10-GHz narrowband rectifier array is presented to showcase the challenges involved in ultralow-power (down to 1 mW/m 2 = $0.1 \mu \text{W}$ /cm 2 ) ground-based harvesting of narrowband satellite signals. The circularly polarized array consists of subarrays with RF power combining before rectification. This approach is then contrasted to harvesting over a wide RF bandwidth, through a comparison of several broadband arrays with rectifiers in each element. This includes a 2–5-GHz bow-tie screen-printed wearable rectenna array with an efficiency exceeding 30\% above 50- $\mu \text{W}$ /cm 2 incident power density and a 2–18-GHz spiral array tested with powers down to $0.1 \mu \text{W}$ /cm 2 . The two types of arrays are analyzed in the context of applications in a ground-based satellite transmitter with narrowband directional power receiver and in a broadband case with multiple widely spaced simultaneous signals.},

  abstract     = {Continuous advances in ultralow-power electronics are a fundamental driving force of developing far-field wireless power harvesting techniques, which generally harnesses low/ambient energy in free space or dedicated wireless power from a power base station. This article reviews recent developments and technology trends in far-field (radiative) wireless power harvesting, including modeling of rectification process inside nonlinear devices, insights into rectenna system design, and demonstrations of emerging applications. The rectification process inside nonlinear devices will be explored, upon which a device selection guideline is provided to help quickly identify suitable devices. Then, the optimization of rectenna design is discussed to realize efficiency enhancement at a limited input power level. Since far-field wireless power harvesting has become a critical enabling technology for battery-free Internet of Things, a series of promising applications is demonstrated in this article to highlight the challenges and opportunities in the field.},

  abstract     = {A comprehensive review of metamaterials and metasurfaces for wireless power transfer (WPT) and wireless energy harvesting (WEH) is presented in this article. According to the features of the electromagnetic field from the source to the receiver, WPT is divided into nonradiative near-field technology and radiative (near and far-field) technologies. Many different and important designs are reviewed and compared. It is shown that metamaterials and metasurfaces can significantly improve the power transfer efficiency and operational distance for WPT systems. They can also improve the energy conversion efficiency of wireless energy harvesters by making the reception less sensitive to incident wave angle and polarization. A rectenna is a critical element for both WPT and WEH. It is shown that metamaterial-based rectennas can achieve a higher RF to dc conversion efficiency. Furthermore, metamaterials can also be used as either parasitic elements or loading components to improve WEH performance in terms of circuit size, beamwidth, and conversion efficiency. Future development directions and opportunities of metamaterials and metasurfaces for WPT and WEH are also proposed in this article.},

  abstract     = {As wireless has disrupted communications, wireless will also disrupt the delivery of energy. Future wireless networks will be equipped with (radiative) wireless power transfer (WPT) capability and exploit radio waves to carry both energy and information through unified wireless information and power transfer (WIPT). Such networks will make the best use of the RF spectrum and radiation, as well as the network infrastructure for the dual purpose of communicating and energizing. Consequently, those networks will enable trillions of future low-power devices to sense, compute, connect, and energize anywhere, anytime, and on the move. In this article, we review the foundations of such a future system. We first give an overview of the fundamental theoretical building blocks of WPT and WIPT. Then, we discuss some state-of-the-art experimental setups and prototypes of both WPT and WIPT, and contrast theoretical and experimental results. We draw special attention to how the integration of RF, signal, and system designs in WPT and WIPT leads to new theoretical and experimental design challenges for both microwave and communication engineers and highlight some promising solutions. Topics and experimental testbeds discussed include closed-loop WPT and WIPT architectures with beamforming, waveform, channel acquisition, and single-antenna/multiantenna energy harvester, centralized and distributed WPT, reconfigurable metasurfaces and intelligent surfaces for WPT, transmitter and receiver architecture for WIPT, modulation, and rate–energy tradeoff. Moreover, we highlight important theoretical and experimental research directions to be addressed for WPT and WIPT to become a foundational technology of future wireless networks.},

  abstract     = {This month’s special issue provides an overview of the state-of-the-art technology and theory for future networks with wireless power transfer and energy harvesting. Wireless communication using radio frequency (RF) radiation has been around for over 100 years and has shaped our society significantly over the past 40 years. However, wireless is not just about communications. For very short ranges, wireless power supply by inductive power transfer has become a reality through several commercial products and standards (Wireless Power Consortium, Power Matters Alliance, Alliance for Wireless Power, and Rezence). Far-field wireless power transfer (WPT) and wireless energy harvesting (WEH) via RF (as in wireless communications) on the other hand could be used for a longer range. Although it has long been seen as a potential for powering low-power devices, it is only recently that wireless (via RF) power has been recognized as a promising technology to cope with the explosion of low-power devices in future networks. Driven by the reduction in the energy needs of electronic devices (remember Koomey’s law according to which, in 20 years, a device will require 10 000 times less energy to compute a given task) and the advent of trillions of internet device objects [Internet of Things (IoT)], there is a need to rethink the design of the network of the future so that wireless can reach its full potential not only to carry information but also to transfer energy.},
