Recent technological advances in intelligent transportation systems have opened up new possibilities for smart mobility in smart cities. Here we present TengYun, a transportation foundation model designed and developed with parallel learning and federated intelligence for our transportation metaverse called TransVerse. TengYun enables decentralized/distributed autonomous organizations with decentralized/ distributed operations, as well as various federated technologies, from federated security, federated control, federated management, federated services, to federated ecology for transportation intelligence in smart cities. An example for a federation of transportation transformers is discussed for illustrating the operating procedure of TengYun.},

While these could be very useful to the younger among us—including in particular also earlier recognition of developmental disorders, usually research and even working demonstrators have been largely targeting an adult population. Only a few studies, including the first-ever competitive emotion challenge, were based on children’s data. In times where fairness is a dominating topic in the world of artificial intelligence, it seems timely to widen up to include children and youth more broadly as a user group and beneficiaries of the promises affective computing holds. To best support according to algorithmic and technological development, here, we summarize the emotional development of this group over the years, which poses considerable challenges for automatic emotion recognition, generation, and processing engines. We also provide a view on the steps to be taken to best cope with these, including drifting target learning, broadening up on the “vocabulary” of affective states modeled, transfer, few-shot, zero-shot, reinforced, and life-long learning in affective computing besides trustability.},

Learning from crowd-labeled data involves dealing with its inherent uncertainty and inconsistencies. In the classical framework, each annotator provides a single label per example, which fails to capture the complete knowledge of annotators. We propose candidate labeling, that is, to allow annotators to provide a set of candidate labels for each example and thus express their doubts. We propose an appropriate model for the annotators, and present two novel learning methods that deal with the two basic steps (label aggregation and model learning) sequentially or jointly.

The framework’s workflow makes it accessible to professional figures without expertise in formal methods, and the high degree of automation minimizes the manual effort required throughout the toolchain.

This article devises a new method to generate region approximations based on rough qualitative direction and distance information. The main idea is first to give a suitability score to smaller regions, cells, that are obtained by partitioning the area of interest, and then to identify candidates to form an approximation by evaluating score contribution ratios under a certain threshold. This article designs a novel mechanism that compares the actual information of cells with the provided rough information in order to calculate suitability scores, and proposes to exploit a regressor model that can predict a threshold given certain suitability scores. Experimental results show that, given a good threshold, this new method can approximate target regions effectively, and that good thresholds can be reliably obtained through a trained regressor.},

  abstract     = {We study the computation of constrained explanations in the framework of abductive logic programming. A general characteristic of abductive reasoning is the existence of multiple abductive explanations. Therefore, identifying a subclass of “preferred explanations” is a relevant problem. A typical approach is to “prefer” explanations that are, in some sense, simple. Several concepts of simplicity were considered in the literature, most notably those based on minimality with respect to inclusion and cardinality. We adopt, as a measure of the quality of an explanation, its degree of arbitrariness that can be briefly described as the number of arbitrary assumptions that have been made to derive the explanation. The more arbitrary the explanation, the less appealing it is, with explanations having no arbitrariness, called constrained, being the preferred ones. In this article, we present a technique that, for a special class of theories, computes constrained explanations. It is based on a rewriting of the theory and the observation into a disjunctive logic program with negation so that the constrained explanations correspond to a subset of its stable models. The proposed technique lays the foundation for using ASP solvers to compute constrained explanations.},

  abstract     = {The five papers in this special section focus on the management and analysis of uncertain, incomplete, and inconsistent information. This has become a crucial issue in the development of intelligent systems. Nowadays, such systems have to efficiently manage large amounts of information of different kinds, often represented in different formats and coming from different sources, such as databases, knowledge bases, sensor networks, as well as various data-driven applications. In the presence of such complex and heterogeneous forms of information, incompleteness, inconsistency, and/or inherent uncertainty inevitably arise. These scenarios call for innovative and intelligent approaches that, by leveraging AI techniques, can explicitly represent inconsistency, incompleteness, and uncertainty, and adequately deal with them. Such approaches are crucial to model realworld scenarios, making systems more effective and successful. Moreover, in many domains, knowledge is subject to frequent changes, so handling evolving knowledge is a key feature that knowledge-based systems should provide. In domains having high-impact consequences (e.g., healthcare and cybersecurity), intelligent systems should support human-in-the-loop models that provide tools to help users to understand and interpret the decisions they suggest, while tackling the challenges of inconsistency, incompleteness, and uncertainty. The AI community has also lately been facing the rising demand of explainable AI systems, which have inevitably to deal with inconsistency, incompleteness, and uncertainty.},

In almost all the applications of metaverses, the sensing system is an essential part and intelligent sensing capacity must be provided. However, due to the insufficient consideration of human factors in most of the studies, digital twins’ sensing in cyber-physical systems cannot achieve smart sensing in metaverses. For this reason, a novel framework for intelligent sensing in metaverses, MetaSensing, is proposed based on parallel intelligence in CPSS. Within the framework of MetaSensing, there are four states of sensing: physical sensing, descriptive sensing, predictive sensing, and prescriptive sensing. To protect sensors’ data privacy in metaverses, DAO-based decentralized sensing is introduced as a mechanism of the operation and maintenance for smart sensing industries.},

With the proliferation of increasingly intelligent systems, the detection and mitigation of motion sickness will face more opportunities along with bigger challenges. On the one hand, the technology for integrated sensors in the intelligent system will provide more accurate and efficient methods for motion sickness detection. However, on the other hand, since cyber-physical systems have been gaining increasing concerns in the past two decades, the cyber-physical-social systems introduce and augment the social characteristics of such systems. The interactions between physical space and cyber space increase the chance of sensory conflicts when people use intelligent systems, such as traveling in intelligent cockpits or using metaverse-related virtual reality devices. The multimodal interaction methods and larger screens will cause more sensory conflicts. The symptoms will be more severe compared to traditional motion sickness. In this article, the classifications are first introduced based on the causes of motion sickness. A new type of multifactorial motion sickness (Xsickness) is discussed, which is foreseeable to be common with intelligent development. Then, the current state-of-the-art detection methods for motion sickness and cybersickness are summarized and theoretical methods for Xsickness detection are discussed.

However, there are multitude of diverse structures that are designed as slanted planes due to rough maritime environments. Traditional methods for scene understanding from 3D point clouds or RGB-D data are energy-consuming and memory intensive, which makes those models less reliable in a resource-constrained system of limited compute, memory, and energy resources on ships. In this study, we present an approach to understanding deck scenes, including slanted structures, using a low-cost monocular camera without prior training. New clusters of slanted angle projections are extracted. The vanishing points of slanted non-Manhattan angle projections are estimated. These slanted planes can be reshaped by compositions of non-Manhattan angle projections. Combined with Manhattan planes, a deck scene can be approximated by Manhattan and non-Manhattan planes. Unlike deep learning-based algorithms, this approach requires no prior training or knowledge of the camera’s internal parameters. Experimental results demonstrated that the method can successfully elucidate diverse elements, including slanted structures, meeting safety monitoring requirements using a resource-constrained monocular camera in a deck environment.},

  abstract     = {Artificial agents that support people in their daily activities (e.g., virtual coaches and personal assistants) are increasingly prevalent. Since many daily activities are social in nature, support agents should understand a user’s social situation to offer comprehensive support. However, there are no systematic approaches for developing support agents that are social situation aware. We identify key requirements for a support agent to be social situation aware and propose steps to realize those requirements. These steps are presented through a conceptual architecture centered on two key ideas: 1) conceptualizing social situation awareness as an instantiation of “general” situation awareness, and 2) using situation taxonomies for such instantiation. This enables support agents to represent a user’s social situation, comprehend its meaning, and assess its impact on the user’s behavior. We discuss empirical results supporting the effectiveness of the proposed approach and illustrate how the architecture can be used in support agents through two use cases.},

Finally, the applicability of KEP is demonstrated on two autonomous systems from different domains; namely, autonomous driving and smart manufacturing. We argue that in complex real-world systems, the use of KEP would significantly improve machine perception while pushing the current technology one step closer to achieving full autonomy.},

The proposed method utilizes a reinforcement learning approach for training a local path planner for navigation in the said environment. With a continuous actor-critic learning automaton (CACLA) applied for continuous action spaces, the proposed algorithm uses a reward structure that formulates a balancing function that gives reward based on balancing the vehicle between artificial potential hills. The drone thereby learns steering control and obstacle avoidance while maintaining a central aligned position with respect to the unknown hallways or corridors. A novel CACLA algorithm and incorporation of a special experience replay memory for the better converging tendency of drone toward the balancing point have been introduced in this article. The proposed reinforcement learning-based online local path planner has been tested on a simulated drone in Gazebo environment.},

However, most recent powerful graph convolution networks (GCNs) separate the spatial and temporal modeling into isolated processes, where GCN models spatial interactions using partially fixed adjacent matrices and 1D convolution captures temporal dynamics, which is insufficient for emotion recognition. In this work, we propose the 3D-Shift GCN, which enables interactions of joints within a spatial-temporal volume for global feature extraction. Besides, we further develop a multiscale architecture, the MS-Shift GCN, to fuse features captured under different temporal ranges for modeling richer dynamics. After conducting evaluation on two regular action recognition benchmarks and two gesture based emotion recognition datasets, the results show that the proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art methods.},

In such times, crowdsensing of spatially tagged disease-related symptoms provides an alternative way of acquiring real-time insights about the pandemic. Existing crowdsensing systems aggregate and release data for pre-fixed regions, e.g., counties. However, the insights obtained from such aggregates do not provide useful information about smaller regions—e.g., neighborhoods where outbreaks typically occur—and the aggregate-and-release method is vulnerable to privacy attacks. Therefore, we propose a novel differentially private method to obtain accurate insights from crowdsensed data for any number of regions specified by the users (e.g., researchers and policy makers) without compromising the privacy of the data contributors. Our approach, which has been implemented and deployed, informs the development of the future privacy-preserving intelligent systems for longitudinal and spatial data analytics.},

Therefore, how to achieve better performance with small amounts of annotated data in the named entity recognition task is an urgent task to be solved. In real scenarios, human beings always rely on some other words in the sentence when they recognize named entities, these words are called triggers. Motivated by this, we first verified the effectiveness of entity triggers for named entity recognition, then constructed a dual learning framework for low-resource named entity recognition based on the duality of entity triggers and corresponding entity, termed DualNER. Experiments show that the proposed methods use 20% trigger-entity annotated data and can achieve comparable results with the conventional model, which is trained by 50%–70% conventional annotated data.},

  abstract     = {Gaussian processes regression models are an appealing machine learning method as they learn expressive nonlinear models from exemplar data with minimal parameter tuning and estimate both the mean and covariance of unseen points. However, cubic computational complexity growth with the number of samples has been a long standing challenge. Training requires the inversion of $N \times N$N×N kernel at every iteration, whereas regression needs computation of an $m \times N$m×N kernel, where $N$N and $m$m are the number of training and test points, respectively. This work demonstrates how approximating the covariance kernel using eigenvalues and functions leads to an approximate Gaussian process with significant reduction in training and regression complexity. Training now requires computing only an $N \times n$N×n eigenfunction matrix and an $n \times n$n×n inverse, where $n$n is a selected number of eigenvalues. Furthermore, regression now only requires an $m \times n$m×n matrix. Finally, in a special case, the hyperparameter optimization is completely independent from the number of training samples. The proposed method can regress over multiple outputs, learn the correlations between them, and estimate their derivatives to any order. The computational complexity reduction, regression capabilities, multioutput correlation learning, and comparison to the state of the art are demonstrated in simulation examples. Finally we show how the proposed approach can be utilized to model real human data.},

  abstract     = {Bayesian optimization (BO) is a powerful class of data-driven techniques for the maximization of expensive-to-evaluate objective functions. These techniques construct a Gaussian process (GP) regression for representing the objective function according to the latest available function evaluations and sequentially select samples and evaluate the function by maximizing an acquisition function. The primary assumption in most BO policies is that the objective function has a uniform level of smoothness over the input space, modeled by a kernel function. However, the uniform smoothness assumption is likely to be violated in a wide range of practical problems, primary domains in which the objective function is evaluated differently at various regions of input space (e.g., through different experiments, software, or approximators). This article develops a BO framework capable of optimizing expensive smooth-varying functions. Unlike the existing techniques that rely on a single GP model, the proposed framework constructs a set of local and global GP models to represent the objective function. The predictive mean and variance at any given sample in the input space are computed according to the posterior probabilities of the local and global GP models. Local and global models are adaptively controlled through a single parameter, which can be optimized along with other GP models’ parameters during the optimization process. Using the predicted local and global values, the expected improvement acquisition function is employed as one of the possible acquisition functions for the selection process. The performance of the proposed framework is assessed extensively through two optimization benchmark problems.},

  abstract     = {The learning process takes place inside clients in federated learning (FL). How to effectively motivate clients and avoid the impact of statistical heterogeneity are challenges in FL. This article proposes contribution- and participation-based federated learning (CPFL) to address these challenges. CPFL can effectively allocate client incentives and aggregate models according to client contribution ratios, by which it can reduce the impact of heterogeneous data. To get effective and approximately fair client contributions faster, we propose an extended Raiffa solution (ERS). Compared to the conventional solution Shapley value, the time complexity of ERS goes from $\mathscr {O}(2^{n})$O(2n) down to $\mathscr {O}(n)$O(n). We perform extensive experiments with the MNIST/EMNIST datasets, heterogeneous datasets, and with different ratios of participation reward. Experimental results demonstrate that CPFL generally has a better learning effect in the heterogeneous case.},

This has gained importance with the major waves of digitization we have seen, especially with the COVID-19 pandemic accelerating digital everything. However, in reality, most machine learning models, despite achieving good technical solutions to predictive problems wind up not being deployed. The reasons for this are many and have their origin in data scientists and machine learning practitioners not paying enough attention to issues of deployment in production. The issues range all the way from establishing trust by business stakeholders and users, to failure to explain why models work and when they do not, to failing to appreciate the importance of establishing a robust quality data pipeline, to ignoring many constraints that apply to deployed models, and finally to a lack of understanding the true cost of production deployment and the associated ROI. We discuss many of these problems and we provide what we believe is a pragmatic approach to getting data science models successfully deployed in working environments.},

IID simplifies the intricate realities and complexities of the real world for their approximate quantifiability and tractability and asymptotic problem-solving. It, however, has also induced significant limitations and gaps in their knowledge, capability, and capacity. Reality-level problem-solving has to go beyond i.i.d. and adopt a broad-reaching non-IID thinking approach, i.e., exploring the comprehensive non-IIDness—heterogeneity and interaction (couplings and entanglement)—of an underlying problem and its behaviors, environment, data, and problem-solving system. Accordingly, this article discusses this foundational, cross-disciplinary, cross-domain, and cross-theory and -practice problem-going beyond i.i.d. and proceeding with non-IID. Concepts, challenges, and prospects of non-IIDness, non-IID thinking, informatics, and learning are discussed for developing reality-level AI, data science, machine learning, and intelligent systems by identifying, quantifying, and synthesizing heterogeneities, interactions, complexities, and intelligence in complex systems and data.},

In this article, we propose an end-to-end Deep Fusion framework for Travel Time Estimation, which exploits multisource heterogeneous traffic information within an encoder–decoder architecture. Specifically, we explore a relational fusion network to learn the relationship of road link segments, and employ an attention mechanism to capture efficient correlations among spatial and temporal features.

Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) combined with RS has attracted researchers’ attention. These new methods model the interaction between RS and users as a process of serialization decision-making. However, these studies suffer from several disadvantages: 1) they fail to model the accumulated long-term interest tied to high reward, and 2) these algorithms need a lot of interactive data to learn a good strategy and are unstable in the scenario of recommendation. In this article, we propose a stable reinforcement learning framework for recommendation. We redefine the Markov decision process of RL-based recommendation, and add a stable module to model high feedback behavior of users. Second, an advanced RL algorithm is introduced to ensure stability and exploratory. The experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

To mitigate these, this work proposes a generalization of both mean square error (mse) GAN and Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) with gradient penalty, referred to as VGAN. Within the framework of conditional WGAN with gradient penalty, VGAN resorts to the Vapnik V-matrix-based criterion that generalizes mse. Also, a novel early stopping-like strategy is proposed that keeps track during training of the most suitable model. A comprehensive set of experiments on a fault-diagnosis task for an industrial robot where the generative model is used as a data augmentation tool for dealing with imbalance datasets is presented. The statistical analysis of the results shows that the proposed model outperforms nine other models, including vanilla GAN, conditional WGAN with and without conventional regularization, and synthetic minority oversampling technique, a classic data augmentation technique.},

Cross-modal retrieval methods typically use these information in multimodal data as a whole and project them into a common representation space to calculate the similarity measure. In fact, only modality-shared information can be well aligned in the learning of common representations, whereas modality-specific information usually brings about interference term and decreases the performance of cross-modal retrieval. The explicit distinction and utilization of these two kinds of multimodal information are important to cross-modal retrieval, but rarely studied in previous research. In this article, we explicitly distinguish and utilize modality-shared and modality-specific features for learning better common representations, and propose an orthogonal subspace decomposition method for cross-modal retrieval, named orthogonal subspace decomposition method. Specifically, we introduce a structure preservation loss to ensure modality-shared information to be well preserved, and optimize the intramodal discrimination loss and intermodal invariance loss to learn the semantic discriminative features for cross-modal retrieval. We conduct comprehensive experiments on four widely used benchmark datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.},

However, while progress has been made on theoretical analysis and formulation of fairness as constraints on error probabilities, our ability to design and train modern deep learning models that reach the targeted fairness goals in practice is still limited. In this work, we focus on an interesting yet common fairness setting, where multiple samples are collected from each individual, and the goal is to maximally reduce performance disparity among individuals while maintaining overall model performance. To obtain such fair deep learning models, we use mode connectivity combined with multiobjective optimization to select the best model out of an identified feasible set of model weight configurations with similar overall performance but different distributions of performance over individuals. Our method is model-agnostic and effectively bridges fairness theory and practice.},

  abstract     = {Goldbach conjecture is one of the most famous open mathematical problems. He asserts that: Every even number greater than two is the sum of two prime numbers. The Goldbach function receives an even number and returns the number of different ways to write it as an unordered sum of two prime numbers. We developed a simple multilayer perceptron that attempts to predict Goldbach’s function. This simple model performs well when trained and tested on numbers up to 4 million. However, as expected, the model’s performance significantly deteriorates when trained on smaller numbers (up to 4 million) but tested on larger numbers (4–10 million). To overcome this problem, we present two novel deep learning architectures. In these architectures, we introduce two types of multiplication layers, which we believe are more appropriate for solving mathematical relations. We show that both architectures significantly outperform the simple multilayer perceptron when trained on smaller numbers and tested on larger numbers. We further improve the performance of the deep learning architectures by using a known analytically derived estimation that is used in order to normalize the model’s output.},

  abstract     = {My college office in Oxford overlooks a narrow, ancient street called New College Lane; directly opposite my office window is a handsome 17th-century house that was the home of Edmond Halley—he of the comet fame—who became Savilian Professor of Geometry at Oxford in 1703. On top of the house is an odd shed-like structure: it was Halley&#39;s observatory. It serves as a daily reminder to me that, 300 years ago, world-changing science could be done in your own home, with facilities no fancier than a garden shed. Fast forward to April 2019, and the first-ever pictures of a black hole, which made front-page headlines across the globe. The Event Horizon Telescope that generated the astonishing images is as far from Halley&#39;s modest observatory as one could imagine: a global network of radio telescopes, in a collaboration involving 13 core partners and dozens of affiliates—supported by a lot of very advanced computer technology, and a big budget. You can still discover a comet from your garden shed, but for the most part, astronomy today is Big Science.},

Type-2 fuzzy systems have the capability to handle high-order uncertainties such as sequential dependencies associated with time series. This study develops a type-2 fuzzy intelligent system for air quality forecasting. Additionally, a dynamic time warping algorithm has been applied to estimate the pattern&#39;s similarity in long time series. The proposed model has been evaluated on a real dataset that contains the one-decade information about outdoor pollutants from April 2011 to November 2020 in Tehran and Beijing. The experiments have confirmed that the proposed model has lower forecasting error than counterpart models in terms of the RMSE, MAE, and MPE for both Tehran and Beijing time-series datasets. Also, the results confirm the superiority of the proposed model with an average area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 95% with a 95% confidence interval. This is promising for the prediction of air quality and make strategic prevention decisions.},

However, the method of identifying the sideslip in surrounding vehicles is rarely developed. The surrounding severe sideslip vehicle threatens the safety of driverless vehicles if the driverless vehicle cannot detect the surrounding sideslip vehicle. Therefore, this study proposes a sideslip recognition model that uses the perception information of driverless vehicles to assess the sideslip driving status of the surrounding vehicles. First, the severe sideslip is defined, which may influence the safety of driverless vehicles, and the sideslip recognition problem is described. Second, the severe sideslip is divided into two categories according to different sideslip trajectories. The two types of sideslip progress are analyzed, and the sideslip features of the two types of serious sideslip are extracted. A sideslip recognition model is established using a logical rule method based on the sideslip features. Finally, some simulation experiments are designed to verify the proposed sideslip recognition model. The simulation results show that the true-positive rate and the false-positive rates are 100% and 6.8%, respectively, which demonstrates that the proposed sideslip recognition model has a good performance.},

We propose a meta-based federated method with mutually constrained propagation (2MFed) method to cope with this. First, 2MFed gives each client the right to choose the most appropriate model from server-side parallel models as its local model, which tolerates hardware heterogeneity. Second, the server mutually exchanges the information of parallel models under the consistency and disparity constraints to improve robustness, thus eliminating data heterogeneity. Third, we use the power of the meta-based label propagation algorithm to treat the federated training as the federated few-shot problem, which removes the model heterogeneity. Finally, extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method. In addition, we evaluate the proposed method on few-shot tasks and demonstrate its excellent performance further.},

In federated learning, all local data should be annotated by alternative labeling techniques since the annotator in the server cannot access the data. Therefore, it is hardly guaranteed that they are correctly annotated. Under this noisy label setting, local models form inconsistent class decision boundaries with one another, and their weights severely diverge, which are serious problems in federated learning. To solve these problems, we introduce a novel federated learning scheme that allows the server to cooperate with local models by interchanging class-wise centroids. The server aligns the class-wise centroids, which are central features of local data on each device, and broadcasts aligned centroids to selected clients every communication round. Updating local models with the aligned centroids helps us to form consistent class decision boundaries among local models, although the noise distributions in clients’ data are different from each other. Furthermore, we introduce a sample selection approach to filter out data with noisy labels and a label correction method to adjust the labels of noisy instances. Our experimental results show that our approach is noticeably effective in federated learning with noisy labels.},

Does it have any correspondence to the social movement organizations in traditional social sciences or the cyber movement organizations in the new digital age? Particularly, issues on DeSci to current professional communities, such as IEEE and its societies, conferences, and publications, are addressed, and the effort for the framework and process of DAO-based DeSci for free, fair, and responsibility sensitive sciences is reviewed.},

Massive efforts have been made by AI communities to combat the pandemic. What roles has AI played in tackling COVID-19? How has AI performed in the battle against COVID-19? Where are the gaps and opportunities? What lessons can we learn to enhance the ability of AI to battle future pandemics? These questions, despite being fundamental, are yet to be answered in full or systematically. They need to be addressed by AI communities as a priority despite the easing of the omicron infectiousness and threat. This article reviews these issues with reflections on global AI research and the literature on tackling COVID-19. It is envisaged that the demand and priority of developing “pandemic AI” will increase over time, with smart global epidemic early warning systems to be developed by a global collaborative AI effort.},

News reprint prediction is a novel research question in the news diffusion field, which predicts whether a news media will reprint a piece of news in the future. During reprinting, an association network among media and entities in the news is formed that reflects their multidimensional dynamic interaction. Existing research primarily focuses on integrating reprint historical records and news content while reprint prediction considering the associations among media and entities in the news remains under-researched. This work develops an entity association network-enhanced method for news reprint prediction, which adopts HIN2Vec to model the dynamic interaction and incorporates the learned embedding and news content through attention mechanism to generate entity-specific content representation. The efficacy of the proposed method is validated on real-world news reprint data. Experimental results show that the fusion of entity association network helps improve the performance of reprint prediction. This research contributes to media communication literature and has significant practical implications.},

However, there is a gap between the research and industry since the leading key performance indicators for businesses are revenue and profit. In this article, we explore the impact of manipulating the profit awareness of a recommender system. An average e-commerce business does not usually use a complicated recommender algorithm. We propose an adjustment of a predicted ranking for score-based recommender systems and explore the effect of the profit and customers’ price preferences on two industry datasets from the fashion domain. In the experiments, we show the ability to improve both the precision and the generated recommendations’ profit.

  abstract     = {The mobile robot six-dimensional (6-D) localization process in GPS-denied scenarios, e.g., in a cave or a mine, is a challenging problem. This article presents the modification of a well-known literature method using Gaussian mixture maps to determine the robot pose in rough terrain and outdoor nonurbanized environment. To improve the accuracy in rough 3-D terrain, I extended the terrain description from a 1-D Gaussian mixture model to a 3-D Gaussian mixture model (3DGMM) combining terrain height and terrain inclination in two orthogonal directions. Using this approach, one can maintain centimeter accuracy even in the most demanding workspaces. Moreover, I replaced the 3-D scan matching process combined with ground-based smoothing by 6-D scan processing (therefore, the 3DGMM method is capable for both land vehicles and flying robots) using the point-by-point extended Kalman filter based on the work by Niewola and Podsedkowski. Thanks to the point-by-point correction approach, it is possible to run the system in real time and process a full point cloud without GPU-based computing up to 300 000 points per second using small computers dedicated to mobile robots.},

  abstract     = {Numerical precipitation prediction plays a crucial role in weather forecasting and has broad applications in public services including aviation management and urban disaster early-warning systems. However, numerical weather prediction (NWP) models are often constrained by a systematic bias due to coarse spatial resolution, lack of parameterizations, and limitations of observation and conventional meteorological models, including constrained sample size and long-tail distribution. To address these issues, we present a data-driven deep learning model, named the ordinal distribution autoencoder (ODA), which principally includes a precipitation confidence network and a combinatorial network that contains two blocks, i.e., a denoising autoencoder block and an ordinal distribution regression block. As an expert-free model for bias correction of precipitation, it can effectively correct numerical precipitation prediction based on meteorological data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and SMS-WARMS, an NWP model used in East China. Experiments in the two NWP models demonstrate that, compared with several classical machine-learning algorithms and deep learning models, our proposed ODA generally performs better in bias correction.},

Specifically, we exploit the graph neural networks to capture the coupling relationships and integrate the coupling relationships into the learning of representations of entities by transmitting and assembling the representations of neighbors along the interaction graphs. In addition, we also propose a light graph neural networks boosted personalized tag recommendation model, namely LNGTR. Different from NGTR, our proposed LNGTR model removes feature transformation and nonlinear activation components as well as adopts the weighted sum of the embeddings learned at all layers as the final embedding. Experimental results on real world datasets show that our proposed personalized tag recommendation models outperform the traditional tag recommendation methods.},

  abstract     = {A major challenge for evolving data stream classification is feature evolution where features of stream instances are dynamically changing as they progress. Existing classification methods considered feature evolution either for fixed-size data or of limited degree with presumed dependence to history, making them unable to work effectively on evolving data streams of unbounded size and arbitrary feature evolution. Particularly, for evolving data streams containing instances of multiple labels, classification coping with feature evolution faces significant challenges. In this article, we present efficient ensemble methods for classifying evolving data streams of both single label and multiple labels through effective model coupling. For single-label classification, we present an improved unsupervised classification algorithm that applies multi-cluster feature selection (MCFS), which was originally proposed for static data classification, in the DXMiner framework to handle each window of instances in a dynamic stream. Our method generates an optimal feature subset and achieves a high classification accuracy. We further improve the time complexity of the feature selection process in MCFS by applying the Ball-tree searching technique. For multi-label classification, we propose an effective fixed-size ensemble classifier based on multi-label KNN, which works only for static multi-label data classification, by incorporating a weight adaptation strategy among the classifiers in the ensemble to dynamically update the model and cope with arbitrary feature evolution of stream instances as the stream progresses. Extensive experiment results on real-life data streams show that our algorithms outperform the existing results for single-label and multi-label classification in classification accuracy and efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Discusses the emergence of artificial intelligence as a new field in engineering. AI first emerged in the 1950s and over the next few decades, experienced both advances and obstacles.1 However, there is now a new era of AI. The history of AI has been an acceleration from object intelligence (e.g., on symbol, behavior, and agent) to system intelligence (e.g., human, nature, and society), and from individual intelligence (e.g., learning intelligence) to metasynthetic intelligence (hybridizing and synthesizing intelligences). Building on the tumultuous AI evolutions, this new-generation AI is accelerating its pace of innovating, differentiating, transforming, and reshaping the world. The new-generation AI not only enables a smarter and more resilient humanity, well-being, and economy, but also everything else. What lessons can we learn from reviewing these AI advances and challenges? What makes AI science and engineering (AISE, or intelligent science and technology) a solid and comprehensive scientific field in addition to transforming other scientific and engineering disciplines and translating businesses and economy into their smart editions? What are the fundamental questions to be addressed in AISE? What forms the body of knowledge of AISE? What type of profile should AI professionals have to meet the requirements of AISE? What should AI education look like to produce qualified AI professionals? These questions deserve enduring, comprehensive, deep, creative, and critical thinking, ideas, and actions first and foremost to establish the AI field. Here, I share my limited view on AISE as a new discipline and the imperative developments, including the AI profession and AI education, to drive and enable the intelligent digital era and Industry 4.0. I hope my humble opinions will spur valuable debate and exchange and systematic and strategic developments of AISE in the broad AI community.},
