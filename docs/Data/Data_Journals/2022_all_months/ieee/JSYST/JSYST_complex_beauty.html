  abstract     = {The exposure possibility of keys poses a great threat to almost all modern cryptography, especially in wireless communications. From the adversary’s point of view, a cryptographic key can be considered as a random variable in its key space, whose security level can be measured in terms of randomness. In this article, we propose a highly exposure-resilient framework, which incorporates redundant randomness of key sources into the design of cryptographic systems to resist key exposure in encrypted communications. As hardware costs continue to decrease, the deployment of redundant randomness at the same time to achieve a better security level is affordable in the future. The framework offers a way to protect the privacy of a single key by fusing multiple redundant keys. Analysis and results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can dramatically reduce the secrecy outage probability, and provides an extensible way to enhance the encrypted communication system’s resistance to unknown eavesdropping or key exposure.},

  abstract     = {Visible light positioning is one of the schemes based on driving modulation to achieve high accuracy of indoor positioning. However, it has shortcomings in system deployment, maintenance, and scalability, which limits its wide application. We propose a high-precision positioning scheme based on high-transparency feature code and lighting devices. First, a feature-code mask is exploited to replace the driving modulation, which aims to reduce the complexity, improve the scalability, and realize high-precision and real-time positioning. Then, a two-dimensional (2-D) feature code is designed to detect the characteristics, which greatly increases the number of LED IDs and decreases the system complexity. Third, the Levenberg–Marquardt iterative algorithm with the constructed perspective-n-point model is applied to obtain the position of the camera. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme can obtain high-precision and real-time positioning. When the measuring height is 1.6 m, the average root-mean-square error (rmse) is 0.044 m. Moreover, when the height is 1.8 m and 2.0 m, the average RMSEs are 0.054 m and 0.064 m, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Composite system reliability (CSR) evaluations suffer from heavy computational burdens because an enormous number of sampled system states must be analyzed. Recently, data-driven approaches are of growing interest because they can accelerate such evaluations by preidentifying success/failure samples. However, the current approaches are limited by unsatisfactory accuracy. Essentially, the main reason is that the data-driven results are not credible. In this article, a trustable data-driven framework based on a deep neural network (DNN) is proposed to enable accurate and credible results for CSR evaluations by the following two aspects: First, a fine-grained identification method with an effective learning strategy is proposed to effectively extract the data features of CSR evaluations and improve the identification accuracy of failure samples. Second, a secure strategy including adaptability criteria and a correction method for the DNN is proposed to guarantee the accuracy of data-driven results. The strategy can determine whether the DNN is utilized to evaluate CSR and reasonably correct the DNN outputs. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.},

The derived expression is novel, as it does not require prior channel state information. This is achieved by employing a probabilistic model for the packet transmission time, avoiding the less realistic deterministic model that is widely used in the literature. Furthermore, the derived expression allows trading accuracy with computational complexity. Our expression is computationally efficient with linear computational complexity. Simulation results demonstrate high accuracy in evaluating the PSPT, with controllable computational complexity.},

DERs can be used for transmission needs, and the technical impacts of them may propagate to the transmission level. To unlock the full benefits of the transmission-distribution coordination, this article proposes a second-order cone programming (SOCP) based expansion model for coordinated transmission and distribution networks by decomposition and parallelization. First, we formulate an SOCP-based subnetwork expansion problem related to voltage phase angle variables which is valid for both transmission and distribution networks. Then, a fully distributed decision-making framework is presented to solve the coordinated transmission-distribution expansion problem iteratively. Taking the total power output of each subnetwork as the interacting variable, we deploy the operation optimization of substations as the master problem and the expansion optimization of subnetworks as the subproblems in the modified iteration algorithm. The feasibility and optimality of the iteration are proved and numerically verified. Simulation results indicate the advantages of the coordinated transmission-distribution expansion which can prevent line congestion, decrease boundary power mismatches and accommodate more DERs.},

The mechanism of the proposed JRO-MDRM scheme is to adopt the optimization technique to collaboratively design the flight route, transmit power, dwell time, waveform bandwidth, and pulselength of each airborne radar node subject to the system kinematic limitations and several resource budgets, with the aim of simultaneously enhancing the target tracking accuracy and low probability of intercept (LPI) performance of the overall system. The predicted Bayesian Cramér–Rao lower bound and the probability of intercept are calculated and employed as the metrics to gauge the target tracking performance and LPI performance, respectively. It is shown that the resulting optimization problem is nonlinear and nonconvex, and the corresponding working parameters are coupled in both objective functions, which is generally intractable. By incorporating the particle swarm optimization and cyclic minimization approaches, an efficient four-step solution algorithm is proposed to deal with the above problem. Extensive numerical results are provided to demonstrate the correctness and advantages of our developed scheme compared with other existing benchmarks.},

  abstract     = {Encrypted data aggregation is an effective approach to preserve power consumption data confidentiality as well as reduce communication overhead in smart grids. As the core component of smart grids, smart meters periodically report encrypted multidimensional data to an aggregator gateway. However, heavy computation and communication overhead may hinder the wide applications of smart meters. Besides, once the secret key is leaked, encrypted data will be broken, thereby violating users’ privacy. In this article, we present a lightweight multidimensional encryption data aggregation (MD-EDA) scheme, enabling a grid control center to retrieve fine-grain aggregated data in a confidential way. In particular, each fog node is installed at the edge of networks, playing the role of aggregator gateway for data verification and aggregation in the same grid area. MD-EDA prevents adversaries from extracting valuable data even if the secret key is compromised. MD-EDA exploits Shamir secret-sharing technique to achieve transmission fault tolerance mechanism from smart meters to a corresponding fog node. The performance evaluation demonstrates the lightweight computation advantages of MD-EDA in the deployment of fog-assisted smart grids.},

  abstract     = {Designing a massive multiple-input multiple-output (M-MIMO) system is complex, time-consuming, and challenging. Conventional MIMO decoders are either inefficient or complex to implement for M-MIMO scenarios. Deep learning (DL) has recently emerged to perform many complex operations more efficiently within a shorter time. In this article, a DL-based iterative network (DLNet) has been proposed for signal decoding in M-MIMO systems. The proposed DLNet decoder is a 40 layer deep neural network (DNN) that can decode M-MIMO signals for uplink Rayleigh and correlated MIMO channels. With the knowledge of the received signals and the M-MIMO channels, the proposed DLNet decoder decodes the messages of all the users. The DLNet considers complex-valued Rayleigh and correlated MIMO channels while decoding. Its training converges faster than other available deep learning (DL) based MIMO decoders. During simulations, the required number of DNN layers, training iterations, and other network parameters are estimated to improve the proposed decoder&#39;s performance. In the M-MIMO perspective, the proposed DLNet has been evaluated for symbol-error-rate (SER) performance, algorithm complexity, and runtime requirement. Simulation results show that the SER of the proposed DLNet decoder performs better by at least 2 dB than other M-MIMO decoding techniques. The DLNet consumes 800 times less time during decoding than other MIMO decoders for equal transmitting and receiving antenna configurations. At the same time, it has 13 times fewer trainable parameters than the available detection-network algorithm.},

  abstract     = {With the application of the Internet of Things and intelligent technologies in industrial systems, the manufacturing efficiency and product quality have been improved, leading to the development of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). Uploading private data to the cloud may lead to data leakage without security protection. Thus, attribute-based encryption (ABE) is widely used to ensure data security and implement data access control, and some multiauthority ABE schemes are proposed to meet the requirement of attributes from different authorities, such as factory and government, which is more suitable for the IIoT system. However, the current multiauthority ABE schemes are with privacy leakage problems on attributes and low-efficiency issues. To address these problems, we propose a multiauthority ABE scheme, which protects users’ privacy by anonymizing attributes in authentication, reduces the computing burden of IIoT devices by adapting online/offline technique and outsourcing decryption to edge devices, and realizes effective attribute revocation. A formal security proof is presented that our scheme is replayable chosen ciphertext attack secure. Finally, we implement the proposed scheme, and experimental results show that our scheme is more efficient than the existing schemes.},

Based on the graph theory, it is possible to distribute the importance, and therefore, the dependencies, among WAMS elements almost evenly, and thus, plan resilient-by-design infrastructures; since no element will be significantly more important than the others, the WAMS will not suffer from single points of failure. Our main goal in this article is the resilience of the communication layer of the WAMS. Although the cyber dependencies of WAMS infrastructures have been studied in the literature, there is a research gap regarding the analysis of the relevant physical dependencies. We propose a method for assessing both the cyber and physical dependencies in the WAMS through eigenspectral analysis. By concurrently analyzing the physical (electrical) and the cyber (informational) dependencies between the electrical buses and the communication routers and by reducing the deviation of their dependence values, it is possible to increase the structural resilience of the communication infrastructure. This will enable the network operators to properly distribute the level of the cyber and the physical dependencies among these components, by selectively applying communication redundancy and communication loops. Through simulations for two IEEE test cases, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Prospect theory is exploited to reflect the user satisfaction and subjectivity from the data offloading, while the MEC servers’ probability of failure owing to the potential overexploitation by the users, is modeled via the theory of tragedy of the commons. A multileader multifollower Stackelberg game is formulated among the MEC servers (leaders) and the users (followers), to determine the servers’ optimal pricing policies and the users’ optimal data offloading strategies. The users’ data offloading decision-making is formulated as a noncooperative game among them and a Nash equilibrium is determined, while the MEC servers’ optimal computing service prices are obtained either through a semiautonomous game-theoretic approach, or through a fully autonomous reinforcement learning-based approach. The performance evaluation and demonstration of the superiority of the proposed framework against other benchmarking alternatives is achieved via modeling and simulation.},

Specifically, two independent AAPs are utilized for the modulated symbols in a GQSFIM subblock to get higher spectral efficiency. With the help of the union bounding technique, the closed-form average bit error probability (ABEP) expression of the GQSFIM system with the maximum-likelihood (ML) detection is derived. Additionally, two low-complexity step-by-step signal detection algorithms, local ML based minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) and local ordered block based MMSE, are provided to reduce the high computational complexity of the ML detection, where the SAP, the two AAPs, and the modulated symbols are detected separately. Numerical results verify the correctness and accuracy of the theoretical ABEP of the GQSFIM system, especially in the high signal-to-noise ratio region. Moreover, the proposed GQSFIM system achieves better spectral efficiency and ABEP performance compared with the typical space-frequency index modulation systems.},

First of all, the data imputation techniques for RTU with a longer update period are proposed to handle asynchronous characteristics and improve computational accuracy using historical and current measurements. Then, the measurement equations are built to process the different types of measurement data from μPMU and RTU. The cubature Kalman filter is adopted to ensure the numerical stability of state forecasting, measurement forecasting, and filter correction.

The competency of this method and the closed form of the outage probability for the users under practical variations, such as imperfect successive interference cancellation and different incentive transmission power levels for the IoT master node, are derived analytically and confirmed via simulation. In addition to that, our asymptotic analysis shows that it is not mandatory to enhance the outage performance of the near user in the final phase of CDRT by using many antennas in the high signal-to-noise-ratio regime. Moreover, a modified particle swarm optimization algorithm is introduced to solve a joint power splitting, time splitting, and power allocation for the proposed system.

However, the number of tracking targets may suddenly increase, which deteriorates the accuracy and robustness of MOT on existing edge cameras (smart cameras leveraging edge intelligence) because of their restricted computing and storage capacities. To address this issue, we propose dynamic computation offloading on a hybrid edge–cloud architecture. When the confidence of MOT decreases because of a sudden increase in tracking targets, an edge camera can dynamically offload its MOT tasks to backend servers and retake the tasks once confidence is recovered. The experiment results show that the accuracy of the hybrid system can be increased by up to 8\% while reducing the network traffic. Therefore, the proposed hybrid approaches can maintain not only the quality and efficiency of image processing on edge cameras but also good tracking performance while reducing communication costs in an environment with dynamically changing people flow.},

In the last step of our process, an overall Lyapunov function is proposed to realize the control objective. Differing from other works, the interconnection influence of the large-scale system is compensated with a more relaxed assumption by introducing the cyclic-small-gain condition. Under the proposed control method, the closed-loop system is capable of being semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded.

In order to inactivate transmit antennas with poor channel quality and, thus, reduce the feedback overhead, a channel gain threshold-based multiantenna selection (CGT-MAS) scheme is proposed without optimization (NOCGT-MAS) and the corresponding single-antenna scheme (NOCGT-SAS) is considered as a baseline. Considering that the number of selected antennas affects both data transmission rate and the feedback overhead, an effective throughput defined as the difference between the data transmission rate and feedback rate is employed for evaluating the system performance. We conduct an effective throughput analysis for both the NOCGT-SAS and NOCGT-MAS schemes and show that an optimal channel gain threshold exists to maximize the effective throughput of the proposed NOCGT-MAS scheme. As a consequence, we propose the optimal instantaneous CGT-MAS algorithm (OICGT-MAS) to maximize the instantaneous effective throughput. Besides, we derive a closed-form expression of an average effective throughput for the CGT-MAS scheme and propose an optimal average channel gain threshold-based multiantenna selection algorithm (OACGT-MAS) for maximizing the derived average effective throughput. Numerical results demonstrate that the effective throughput of the proposed NOCGT-MAS is substantially better than that of conventional NOCGT-SAS. Moreover, although the OICGT-MAS scheme has a slight advantage over OACGT-MAS in terms of the effective throughput, it has a much higher computational complexity than the latter method.},

Through experiments, we show that the model trained by our LAFLAS outperforms those by state-of-the-art algorithms, which demonstrates the effectiveness of DSRA by LAFLAS.},

  abstract     = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are beginning to make a splash in emergency disaster scenarios owing to its excellent air mobility and flexibility. Considering that large base stations often cannot be deployed to disaster areas in the first place and the variation of communication links between UAVs, we formulate the task scheduling problem for disaster scenarios as a two-stage Lyapunov optimization problem and propose a dispersed computing network consisting of UAVs and ground mobile devices, which is used for collaborative computing. We decouple the long-term stability of the task queues of the nodes in the system in terms of time slots as a deterministic optimization problem by Lyapunov techniques. By jointly optimizing the task size transmitted from the control center to the UAVs, the task size computed locally and offloaded by the UAVs and mobile devices, the energy consumption of the dispersed computation system is minimized while ensuring the stability of the computation queues. The simulation results verify that our proposed algorithm is close to the optimal case in terms of queue stability, and our algorithm is able to reduce the system energy consumption by more than 50\% compared to the local computation of UAVs.},

  abstract     = {With the increase in penetration of renewable energy sources (RES), traditional inertia estimation techniques based purely on the number of online synchronous generators are increasingly unsuitable, ultimately leading towards suboptimal frequency control in the electric power grid. The stochastic nature of RES additionally makes the system inertia a time-varying quantity. Furthermore, the frequency and inertial response of power systems change drastically in multiarea power systems with interconnected tie-lines. Hence, it is important for state/parameter estimation (e.g., inertia) in multiarea systems, while ensuring communication between each of the areas. In this article, a client–server-based federated learning framework is used to estimate power system inertia in a multiarea system. Federated learning is a machine learning technique where multiple decentralized devices are trained with local data, and a global model is updated and redistributed by a central server by aggregating the trained weights of the decentralized devices, without exchanging the local data. Using local frequency measurements, obtained from the phase-locked loop of an energy storage system, the inertia at each of the areas can be estimated locally via offline training using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), whereas the CNN weights update in an online fashion. The framework, tested on a two-area power system, accurately estimated the inertia constant for both independent and identically distributed (IID) and non-IID data. Furthermore, the CNN-based method outperformed conventional neural network-based estimation techniques in terms of number of communication rounds and estimation accuracy.},

  abstract     = {In addition to procuring energy, consumers in electricity markets procure demand response (DR) services. Demand and supply of energy in the electricity market drives the demand for DR services. Through the net benefits test (NBT), economic procurement of DR is limited to an amount that ensures that consumers benefit with the procurement of DR services. However, the NBT neither a) recognizes the coexistence of the DR market with the energy market; nor b) optimizes social welfare in the DR market in concert with that of the energy market. This lack of accounting for DR market surplus results in economic inefficiency. To address this shortcoming, we advance past works by: a) proposing a real-time DR market where the DR demand curve is a function of opportunity in the energy market; and b) co-optimizing energy and DR markets such that the total social welfare derived from both markets is maximized simultaneously. We also present an optimal power flow formulation and process to implement our ideas in real-time electricity markets. The formulation is tested on a simple test case and a system based on actual Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) data. For the PJM case, total social welfare is increased by 1.41\% to 3.05\% over existing DR procurement strategies, resulting in $14.5M to $30.9M additional benefits per hour.},

Three PDSs are studied, including a conventional IEEE PDS of 33-bus and two actual PDSs of 59-bus Cairo distribution system, Egypt, and 84-bus Taiwan Power Company (TPC), Taiwan. For the IEEE standard system, the proposed IHBO algorithm achieves the maximum reduction of power losses of 69.44\%, 72.29\%, and 74.725\% for low, nominal, and high loadings, respectively. For the Cairo PDS, the proposed IHBO obtains the best performance with the least minimum, average and maximum fitness of 1.4149, 1.444, and 1.496, respectively. For the Taiwan PDS, it achieves the least minimum, average and maximum losses of 240.88, 264.16, and 308.49 kW, respectively.

However, users often trade their location privacy with services by sharing their location information with an LBS server, without knowing that the server can fully be trusted. In this article, we propose a sky caching-aided spatial querying scheme with the support of a flying drone. The basic idea is that both the user and its drone collaboratively generate a set of dummy locations to hide the current location of the user from the server. We also propose cache admission control techniques to efficiently cache the queried results to minimize the number of duplicated cached copies. The location privacy is analyzed and measured in terms of the location obfuscation and the size of the convex hull area that consists of dummy locations resided within the cloaking areas of user and drone. We conduct extensive simulation experiments using the OMNeT++ for performance evaluation and comparison. The simulation results show that the proposed approach can reduce the number of queries sent to the server, extend the cloaking area, and improve the location privacy of users significantly.},

  abstract     = {Localization demands high-accuracy positioning, and this rings especially true in the context of fifth-generation (5G) millimeter-wave (mmWave) systems. However, it is easier said than done. mmWave systems require a large number of antennas to be deployed at the transceiver, so having ideal hardware components at each antenna is unrealistic. Degradation in the received signal, caused by hardware impairments (HWIs), affects the spectral efficiency, which in turn influences user positioning. Moreover, a high level of clock synchronization between the base station (BS) and the user equipment (UE) is rarely achieved. In this article, we investigate the effect of HWIs on UE localization under synchronous and asynchronous conditions. In order to minimize imperfect synchronization, two anchors or two-way localization protocols, a round-trip (RLP) as well as a collaborative localization protocol (CLP) are used. Conducting the localization process using the BS, we find the position and orientation bounds. We then study the effect of HWIs on the error bounds under the mentioned scenarios. Our numerical results show that HWIs have a significant impact on localization in all conditions, localization using two anchors and the CLP being more robust, however, against HWIs. Based on our outcome, compensating for imperfect synchronization using RLP does not increase the resilience of the system against HWIs.},

To save energy, local control updates and communication between the neighboring agents are based on a distributed periodic event-triggered scheme. Sufficient conditions to guarantee the exponential mean square bounded consensus are derived as linear matrix inequality (LMI) conditions obtained from some delay-dependent Lyapunov–Krasovskii functionals. The proposed design framework computes the required consensus control gain based on a desired level of resilience to DoS. The guaranteed level of resilience in our proposed LMI-based method is less conservative (more realistic) compared to the existing analytical solutions. Two physical constraints, namely nonuniform time-varying communication delay and actuator faults, are also included in the problem formulation to enhance the practicability of the proposed solution. Simulations results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in the presence of the considered cyberthreats and physical constraints.},

Many network security issues are related to it, i.e., denial-of-service attacks, route hijacking, etc. The current path-aware network architecture can effectively overcome this issue through path verification. At present, the main problems of path verification are high communication and high computation overhead. To this aim, this article proposes a lightweight real-time verification mechanism of intradomain forwarding paths in autonomous systems to achieve a path verification architecture with no communication overhead and low computing overhead. The problem situation is that a packet finally reaches the destination, but its forwarding path is inconsistent with the expected path. The expected path refers to the packet forwarding path determined by the interior gateway protocols. If the actual forwarding path is different from the expected one, it is regarded as an incorrect forwarding path. This article focuses on the most typical intradomain routing environment. A few routers are set as the verification routers to block the traffic with incorrect forwarding paths and raise alerts. Experiments prove that this article effectively solves the problem of path verification and the problem of high communication and computing overhead.},

We investigate the secrecy rate maximization problem by jointly optimizing the wireless charging duration, the trajectory, and transmit power of the UAV, subject to limited battery capacity, maximum flying speed, and energy-harvesting causal constraints. To solve this nonconvex problem, we first transform this problem into an equivalent problem with a smooth objective function, and then propose a low-complexity trajectory design and communication resources allocation algorithm for settling the reformulated problem via employing alternating optimization and SCP. Specifically, the reformulated problem is decomposed into three independent subproblems: the wireless charging duration optimization, the transmit power control, and the trajectory design of the UAV. Subsequently, we iteratively solve one of these three subproblems, while the others being fixed until the proposed algorithm converges. Extensive simulation results are provided to demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can significantly enhance the secrecy rate relative to the benchmark algorithms in absence of rechargeable battery or with fixed trajectory and transmit power.},

  abstract     = {As Internet of Things technologies are increasingly being deployed, situations frequently arise where multiple stakeholders must reconcile preferences to control a shared resource. We perform a five-month long experiment dubbed “smartSDH” (carried out in 27 employees’ office space) where users report their preferences for the brightness of overhead lighting. smartSDH implements a modified Vickrey–Clarke–Groves (VCG) mechanism. smartSDH assesses the feasibility of the VCG mechanism in the context of smart building control and evaluated smartSDH’s effect using metrics such as light level satisfaction, incentive satisfaction, and energy consumption. After the initial eight weeks, we noted that average satisfaction with the light levels dropped from 3.44 to 2.94 on a 5-point Likert scale and that satisfaction with incentives dropped from 3.57 to 3.16. This indicates a participation burnout not typically captured by theoretical analyses of VCG mechanisms. Additionally, our experiment reduced energy consumption by 35.22\% over a five-month period, without directly incentivizing lower energy consumption, which provides evidence that much of the current energy consumption may be wasteful. Finally, we observed that environmental readings had statistically significant relationships with the lighting preferences of users, indicating promise for learning preferences from other observable factors.},

There is a systematic procedure to determine the number and positions of antennas in each single-polarization subarray used for the synthetic nested array, in order to achieve more degrees of freedom (DOFs) and larger aperture for difference coarray with limited physical antennas. The increased DOFs of cross- and self-difference coarrays are quantitatively provided. To handle underdetermined parameter estimation with the resulting DOFs, the proposed method first estimates initial DOA and polarization state by using root-MUSIC and oblique projection operator, based on hole-free cross-difference coarray from cross-correlation matrix between subarrays. In the second step, holes in self-difference coarray, which is from autocorrelation matrix of single-polarization subarray, are filled with initial estimation. By exploiting both hole-free self- and cross-difference coarrays, an efficient search-based algorithm with initially estimated parameters is explored for refined estimation. The Cramér–Rao bound for the array and computational complexity of the method are provided. Simulation results are given to demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed array and method.},

This not only causes immense frustration to students who experience large variations in wait-time, but also creates challenges for the university and transport authority in knowing when to schedule extra buses. This article outlines our efforts to instrument a main bus stop on our university campus with Internet of Things (IoT) sensors to monitor passengers queue length. Our specific contributions are as follows: 1) We begin by developing a LoRaWAN ultrasonic sensor for detecting people in the queue. The sensor emits an ultrasonic tone pulse every few seconds, and determines whether someone is in front of it based on the reflections received, if any. Ten sensor units are built, tested, and tuned in a lab environment to achieve optimum detection accuracy and data transmission rate; 2) Next, we install these sensors at a 6-m interval along the campus fence bordering the bus-stop. We develop an algorithm to infer the number of passengers in the queue from sensor data and demonstrate that it achieves reasonable accuracy with a mean absolute error of 10.7 people (for a queue size of up to 100 people); and 3) we develop an optimization model to reschedule bus dispatching time, aiming to minimize total wait time of passengers. We show that a reduction of up to 42.93\% in passengers’ wait time can be achieved by adopting demand-driven bus scheduling.},

In order to maximize the overall end-to-end secure throughput in a given time period, the joint power allocation and trajectory planning are investigated. The formulated optimization problem is nonconvex, which is difficult to obtain the optimal solution with acceptable complexity. Therefore, we propose an iterative algorithm to achieve a suboptimal solution approximately. In the proposed approach, the joint optimization problem is firstly divided into two subproblems, i.e., the power allocation subproblem and the trajectory planning subproblem. The power is optimized by using the method of successive convex approximation with fixed trajectory, and the trajectory was optimized by successive convex approximation with fixed transmit power. Finally, the power and trajectory are optimized alternately. Since the two subproblems are approximated as convex problems, they can be solved efficiently with acceptable complexity. The simulation results show that remarkable gain in terms of secure throughput can be achieved by the proposed joint optimization algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Themodern electricity network has become smarter and more reliable because of the addition of information and communication technology. Dynamic thermal rating systems (DTR) allow existing transmission lines to be operated much closer to their limits. However, line outages after DTR implementation could threaten network security. Thus, system integrity protection schemes (SIPS), which are designed to ensure security, are useful to forestall impending contingencies that could arise from DTR implementation. Furthermore, synchrophasors can improve wide-area monitoring and protection capabilities. However, the reliability of these technologies considering their communication network availability is yet to be studied in a unified framework. Therefore, a novel framework of synchrophasor-based DTR and SIPS is presented while examining eight DTR network topologies and two SIPS schemes simultaneously. A sequential Monte Carlo simulation-based technique is proposed to simulate the effect of the topologies on system-wide reliability. This method is tested on the IEEE-RTS. Results show an improvement of 93.27\% between DTR communication Schemes 1 and 8 in load curtailment. More importantly, the article reveals an improvement of 99.15\% in the load curtailment value in scenarios where SIPS is deployed compared with the case where SIPS is not deployed, highlighting the benefits of DTR and SIPS hybrid implementation.},

Owing to the difficulty of obtaining the accurate distribution parameters of the probability models, the uncertainty of the distribution parameters needs to be considered in the PEF calculation of a combined cooling, heating, and power campus microgrid (CCHP-CMG). In this article, the parameterized probability box (p-box) model is applied for describing the uncertain distribution parameters of the probability model of injected power, and the interval PEF (IPEF) calculation model of a CCHP-CMG is developed. An affine arithmetic-based interval point estimation method (AIPEM) is put forward to solve the IPEF calculation model. The location intervals of injected powers are calculated from their p-boxes, and the interval energy flow calculation is performed with each location interval to estimate the moment intervals of the output variables. Affine arithmetic is used to reduce the interval expansion in the interval calculation, and to further reduce the interval expansion caused by affine multiplication/division operation, a method of removing the accumulation of extra noise terms is proposed. In addition, based on the Nataf inverse transformation and the p-box model, an AIPEM considering the correlation of injected powers is proposed that considers the uncertain correlation coefficients. A case study on a CCHP-CMG shows that the proposed AIPEM has higher computational accuracy than the existing interval cumulant method, especially when the uncertain fluctuation range of the injected power is large, although it consumes more CPU time.},

Generally, a group/swarm of UAVs connect themselves to the BS through cluster head (CH) UAVs, which are intermediary nodes.

However, current research cannot avoid the problem that security and efficiency are not compatible. Some studies use time-consuming cryptographic structures for security, while most lightweight schemes are designed without considering certain security properties, such as perfect forward secrecy, the resistance to known session-specific temporary information attack, etc. In our view, this conflict can be resolved by using lightweight cryptography primitives with special attention to protocol vulnerabilities and ever-evolving security requirements of people. By abandoning all unnecessary cryptographic structures, we propose a comprehensive lightweight three-factor authentication protocol with various security requirements, including adaptive privacy preservation, which is suitable for the user-friendly scenario in the WSN. Through security analysis, real-or-random (ROR) model proof, Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications experimental verification, and security aspect comparison, it is proved that our protocol is superior in the security aspect.

To address this impact, a novel fully distributed observer is established to estimate the leader’s states within fixed time. Subsequently, the state constraint function is introduced so that the designed adaptive control protocol can be used in a uniform structure with unconstrained or asymmetric/symmetric output constraints without changing the adaptive structure. Combining the backstepping technique with fuzzy-logic systems, an adaptive fixed-time local control protocol is constructed to drive each agent to track the leader’s states estimated by the observer. Besides, a novel auxiliary system is introduced to solve the constraint problem of the control input. Furthermore, through rigorous theoretical analysis, it is verified that all signals converge to the compact set close to zero with guaranteed fixed-time convergence rate. At last, a representative simulation is carried out to demonstrate the practicability of the proposed method.},

In response to the above-mentioned challenges, a finite-time containment control algorithm is proposed. First, the multiagent system is considered with inherent nonlinear dynamics and unknown but bounded external disturbances. Second, the desired containment control protocol is presented under a directed interaction topology. Furthermore, by adding a power-integrator technique and Lyapunov function theory, the sufficient conditions are derived for the existence of the finite-time containment controller of a class of second-order multiagent systems.

Second, an EVM-based ED-PA algorithm is proposed, where a simplified closed-form PA solution for the quadrature amplitude modulation is obtained in the case of two transmit antennas. For more transmit antennas, we further propose a low complexity-PA (LC-PA) algorithm, where all the transmit antennas are grouped with two antennas in each group and the proposed EVM-based ED-PA algorithm is utilized to assign the power within each group. Numerical results reveal that the proposed EVM-based ED-PA and LC-PA algorithms have considerably lower complexity and can achieve the optimal average bit error rate (ABER) and suboptimal ABER performance at low-and-moderate signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) region and high-SNR region, respectively, compared with the typical PA algorithms in SM-MIMO system.},

  abstract     = {The impairments due to in-phase and quadrature-phase imbalance at the transmitter and/or receiver, carrier frequency offset, and doubly selective channel (DSC) result in multiuser interference (MUI) and self-intercarrier interference (S-ICI) in multiuser massive multiple-input–multiple-output (MIMO) uplink systems. The MUI and S-ICI significantly deteriorate the performance of the receiver and make data detection quite a challenging task. To tackle this issue, we developed a novel crisscross banded effective channel matrix and a joint equalization and detection technique for multiuser massive MIMO single-carrier frequency division multiple access/orthogonal frequency division multiple access uplink systems with RF impairments under DSC. During each iteration of the proposed method, the MUI and S-ICI are calculated using the soft information from the decoder section, and then the interference canceled signal is fed back to the equalizer section for the joint equalization of the mirror subcarrier pairs. Since the proposed method does not put any restriction on the allocation of mirror subcarrier pairs, it is equally applicable to all types of carrier assignment schemes. Further, the extrinsic information transfer chart of the proposed technique is developed for analyzing the convergence. Extensive simulation studies are conducted to validate the performance of the proposed technique.},

  abstract     = {To maintain image quality under changing weather conditions, complex deep networks have been widely used for image enhancement. Owing to the restricted computing power of Internet of Things enabled smart cameras, existing lightweight solutions using deep neural networks are prone to degrading image quality. Thus, our study incorporates recursive and attention-based enhancement into a lightweight residual network that uses high-efficiency convolution operations as a basic building block. With this modular design on a recurrent neural network, the resulting neural network can be easily optimized according to the hardware specifications of a smart camera. In addition, to adapt to the various weather conditions, we design a sequential environment-aware model deployer that detects continuous weather changes so that the most appropriate image-enhanced model can be deployed. Comparison of experimental results for the proposed approach with our previous study (also the latest study) and other recent research indicate that the performance of image enhancement in rainy, hazy, and snowy scenes can be slightly improved, and the operation speed (seconds per frame) can be increased by 60\%. The detection error rate for the model deployer dropped from 1\% to 0.03\% (improved by 97\%). The image-enhanced results achieved a 4\% improvement in accuracy, demonstrating the method&#39;s effectiveness and benefits for realizing edge intelligence.},

Although preliminary studies have been performed on the resilience assessment for UAV swarms, these studies still have limitations that cannot be ignored, such as network homogeneity, unreasonable resilience process models, and stringent mission baselines. These limitations reduce the reference value of the evaluation results. Therefore, a new baseline-resilience assessment method for UAV swarms is proposed in this article. First, a topological model of a UAV swarm heterogeneous communication network is constructed by introducing the concept of heterogeneous graphs. Second, regarding the integrity of the resilience process, an innovative resilience process model is established. Third, a mission-oriented UAV swarm baseline-resilience assessment method is proposed based on the topological and resilience process models. Finally, the effectiveness and the superiority of the proposed evaluation method are verified by simulations. The results show that the proposed evaluation method is more in line with actual situations than other evaluation methods and the obtained resilience value is more valuable for reference.},

  abstract     = {Cyber-physical systems such as microgrids contain numerous attack surfaces in communication links, sensors, and actuators forms. Manipulating the communication links and sensors is done to inject anomalous data that can be transmitted through the cyber layer along with the original data stream. The presence of malicious, anomalous data packets in the cyber layer of a dc microgrid can create hindrances in fulfilling the control objectives, leading to voltage instability and affecting load dispatch patterns. Hence, detecting anomalous data is essential for the restoration of system stability. This article answers two important research questions: 1) Which data-driven detection scheme offers the best detection performance against stealth cyber-attacks in dc microgrids? 2) What is the detection performance improvement when fusing two features (i.e., current and voltage data) for training compared with using a single feature (i.e., current)? Our investigations revealed that 1) adopting an unsupervised deep recurrent autoencoder anomaly detection scheme in dc microgrids offers superior detection performance compared with other benchmarks. The autoencoder is trained on benign data generated from a multisource dc microgrid model. 2) Fusing current and voltage data for training offers a 14.7\% improvement. The efficacy of the results is verified using experimental data collected from a dc microgrid testbed when subjected to stealth cyber-attacks.},

With the help of the powerful modeling ability of hybrid systems for situation representation and reasoning in network topology, we propose the six-tuple hybrid game model based on modified hybrid stochastic timed Petri nets (M-HSTPN) to reveal the internal cross-level operating mechanisms. Then, we carry out the nonlinear mapping relationship between the hybrid game elements and the symbols of M-HSTPN. Taking the intelligent drones combat problem as an example, we compare differential game, event game, and proposed hybrid game scheme in pursuit–evasion trajectories, action timing, bombing sequence, and formation. The proposed M-HSTPN-based hybrid game scheme can effectively describe the constantly changing pursuit–evasion trajectories and select the action timing to reduce the energy consumption of interception and the target-missing quantity. Furthermore, the proposed hybrid game scheme can reason the optimal bombing sequence and narrow the scope of optimal formation through enriching payoff evaluation indexes with the current hybrid situation compared with the event game scheme and differential game scheme.},

In the multistage structure, different decisions are taken regarding energy trade according to the hours of the day. Generations and price uncertainties that need to be addressed in optimum bidding problems are eliminated with a stochastic approach. Besides, risk management is evaluated through the conditional value-at-risk method. Besides, the test is carried out using real data from Spain in order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model. According to the results obtained from the study, it can be stated that RESs with ESS increase the portfolio profit by 2\%, and even in the case of expected generation, it is 4.1\%, by better managing the energy imbalance of participants.},

The distributed controllers are constructed such that the leader–follower consensus errors converge to a bounded region that is adjustable. The main advantage of the proposed method is that the consensus performance and event inter-execution intervals are taken into account. This strategy greatly accelerates the convergence rates of consensus errors and avoids the Zeno-behavior. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the established consensus protocol.},

Within such a setting, the prosumers and their interactions with the microgrid system become of high significance for its efficient operation. In this article, to model the corresponding interactions, we introduce a labor economics-based framework by exploiting the principles of contract theory, that jointly achieves the satisfaction of the various interacting system entities, i.e., the microgrid operator (MGO) and the prosumers. The MGO offers personalized rewards to the sellers and buyers, to incentivize them to sell and purchase energy, respectively. To provide a stable and efficient operation point, while aiming at jointly satisfying the profit and requirements of the involved competing parties, optimal personalized contracts, i.e., rewards and amount of sold/purchased energy, are determined, by formulating and solving contract-theoretic optimization problems between the MGO and the sellers or buyers. The analysis is provided for both cases of complete and incomplete information availability regarding the prosumers’ types. Detailed numerical results are presented to demonstrate the operation characteristics of the proposed framework under diverse scenarios.},

By taking advantage of the impulsive control strategy, the leader-following consensus issue is transformed into the stability problem of the impulsive error systems. Several sufficient conditions respecting the exponential mean-square stability for impulsive error system under fixed and switching topologies are derived by utilizing the Lyapunov function and the notions of average impulsive interval and ADT. Intriguingly, this article considers that impulsive instant and switching instant are independent of each other. Four potential cases of system evolution under Markovian switching topology are discussed. Finally, simulation results are reported to illustrate the effectiveness of our developed results.},

The goal of an attacker is to destabilize the systems while maintaining the Kullback–Leibler divergence under a certain threshold. First, in order to keep the stealthiness of attacks, the relationship between the threshold of Kullback–Leibler divergence and the upper bounds on the norms of mathematical expectation and covariance of the compromised innovation is given. Then, the sufficient and necessary conditions for the insecurity of systems are derived when all the measurement channels are compromised by an attacker.

  abstract     = {With lots of distributed renewable generators and storage devices integrated into distribution networks, the coordinate economic dispatch (ED) between transmission and distribution networks is needed. A stochastic ED algorithm based on distributed approximate dynamic programming for integrated transmission and distribution networks considering the uncertain renewable generator outputs is proposed. First, the convex power flow models of transmission and distribution networks are proposed. Then, the reservoir levels of pumped-storage hydro stations and the remaining stored electric energy of battery storage stations are deemed as the storage quantities, while the renewable generator outputs are deemed as the exogenous stochastic variables to establish the stochastic storage model for the stochastic ED problem of integrated transmission and distribution networks. The approximate value functions represented by the sum of the piecewise linear functions of the storage quantities are constructed to decouple the multiperiod ED problem into a series of single-period ED problems. Finally, by using the alternating direction method of multipliers, each single-period ED problem of integrated transmission and distribution networks is solved in a distributed manner among transmission and distribution networks. Test results on the modified T6D7 system and a practical Shenzhen city network demonstrate the correctness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.},

Different from the existing results, input delays are assumed to be nonidentical and time-varying. To overcome the difficulty of nonidentical input delays, a novel compensation mechanism is introduced. Moreover, in order to save communication resources, a distributed finite-time self-triggered observer is constructed. By employing the observer and the dynamic surface control strategy, the finite-time adaptive neural control protocol is proposed. It is proved that not only the followers’ outputs can be synchronized with the leader in finite time, but also continuous communication among followers is avoided.

However, the imprecise extraction of saliency features from light field imaging puts a negative impact on the accuracy of saliency results, and the invalid fusion of these extracted features makes saliency results lose details, further cutting down their accuracy. In this article, to effectively extract and fuse saliency features of light field imaging, we propose an attention-oriented refinement and fusion network to solve these problems, which mainly includes the attention-oriented refinement module (ARM) and the attention-oriented fusion module (AFM). Specifically, ARM can precisely refine similar features between focal slices and all-focus image, and fully extract abundant structural characteristics of the light field. Subsequently, AFM can efficiently fuse those features extracted by ARM to obtain saliency results with detail information. Furthermore, different dilated convolution layers embedded with ARM and AFM are leveraged to further capture complete saliency results with detail information. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms other 20 state-of-the-art methods and achieves Top-1 accuracies on three light field datasets.},

The hybrid precoding technique is applied to reduce the implementation cost by separately designing a digital precoder and an analog precoder. Also, we adopt the artificial noise (AN)-assisted transmission method to maximize the SR. In this problem, we aim to jointly optimize the digital precoding vector, AN covariance matrix, and power-splitting ratio under the nonlinear energy harvesting (EH)-constraints.

The investment decisions pertaining to the battery storage facilities and the expansion of power and gas systems are made by an independent investor anticipating the clearing results of gas and electricity markets, modeled as connected mixed-integer lower level programs. The nonconvexity of power generation and the randomness of power and gas demands, as well as renewable energy are considered in the formulation of the lower level problems. To compute this stochastic bilevel optimization with discrete decisions in both levels and interrelated lower level programs, we develop an exact solution methodology in a decomposed master-subproblem form. The application of the method is illustrated on two test systems.

  abstract     = {Alternating current motors are critical to industry, as they drive many machines in the manufacturing and processing industries. To accomplish heavy tasks, often, a number of small motors must operate cooperatively, which means that the operation of the motors must be coordinated using, for example, consensus control. To accomplish this, the motors must communicate with each other. This communication can be periodic or event driven. As periodic communication may waste communication resources when no control update is needed, we propose a need-based self-triggered communication (STC) mechanism to achieve improved communication efficiency. We propose an STC technique for the leader–follower-based consensus control of induction motors. To study this method, we developed both centralized and distributed STC models. In the centralized approach, each motor is connected to a central unit that calculates the next communication time. When distributed STC is used, each motor calculates the next communication time solely based on information from directly connected neighboring motors, thus eliminating the possibility of a single point of failure. Extensive simulations were conducted to validate the proposed approaches. Our results show that the proposed self-triggered consensus control technique gets the same level of performance as a standard periodic control approach while utilizing fewer communication resources.},

  abstract     = {As a classifier, support vector machine (SVM) explains a core problem of machine learning, namely sample classification in statistical terms. It has been widely used in machine learning, data mining, pattern recognition, and other fields. With the wide applications of SVMs in machine learning and big data, privacy protection of sensitive data in SVMs is becoming more and more important, such as face recognition and biometric information. At present, the main privacy protection methods in SVMs are homomorphic encryption and secure multiparty computation. However, there are some problems in current research. The computational efficiency is low, and the scalability of the schemes is poor. In addition, the user must stay online in some solutions. To solve the abovementioned problems, this article designs a secure and efficient classification scheme based on SVM to protect the privacy of private data and support vectors in the calculation and transmission process. First, the distributed two trapdoors public-key cryptosystem proposed by Liu is used to realize the distributed double-key decryption function, weaken the decryption capability of a cloud server with the master key, and prevent the server from launching active attacks. Second, we design a universal secure computing protocol for nonlinear SVMs based on the Gaussian kernel function, which can be extended to polynomial kernel function, sigmoid kernel function and is suitable to different kernel functions. Compared with existing schemes, our solution reduces the amount of encrypted data, simplifies the calculation process, and improves calculation efficiency. Third, an introduced cloud server realizes user offline function. Finally, we analyze the security of the scheme and verify its efficiency through experiments. Analysis and experimental results show that the scheme has the advantages of high efficiency, good scalability, and user offline function.},

We present the X-duplex IRS with the simultaneous wireless information and power transfer, and establish a power consumption model based on real application scenarios. An alternating optimization algorithm is proposed to maximize the energy efficiency (EE) of a multi-input single-output (MIMO) network assisted by the X-duplex IRS. As for the X-duplex relay, we explore an algorithm based on the golden section to optimize the EE. Simulation results comprehensively evaluate the performance of the two auxiliary transmission methods. The X-duplex IRS has higher EE and weighted sum rate (WSR) than the X-duplex relay when sufficient transmission power is available. However, the IRS cannot entirely replace the traditional relay. The X-duplex relay with self-interference energy harvesting achieves a higher WSR and EE when the access point energy is limited or the transmission distance is short.},

This article proposes the concept of electrical carrying quantity based on the electrical betweenness to clarify the characteristics of excess carrying failure analysis from the sight of the topology of power networks. Then, the excess carrying propagation model is constructed, which fully considers the basic topological properties and the configuration of generators and loads of complex power networks. Accordingly, the critical vertices that make network redundancy less effective in suppressing failure propagation are identified, which are defined as stubborn vertices. Afterward, an effective edge-cutting algorithm with low algorithm complexity is proposed based on the nature of stubborn vertices as the failure propagation suppression strategy. Finally, the method has been demonstrated on the IEEE 118-bus system. The results show that network redundancy combined with edge-cutting control operation can completely suppress the propagation of excess carrying failures in complex power systems.},

  abstract     = {The advances in deep learning with the ability to automatically extract advanced features have achieved a bright prospect for human activity recognition (HAR). However, the traditional HAR methods still have the deficiencies of incomplete feature extraction, which may lead to incorrect recognition results. To resolve the above problem, a novel framework for spatiotemporal multi-feature extraction on HAR called CapsGaNet is propounded, which is based on capsule and gated recurrent units (GRU) with attention mechanisms. The proposed framework involves a spatial feature extraction layer consisting of capsule blocks, a temporal feature extraction layer consisting of GRU with attention mechanisms, and an output layer. At the same time, considering the actual demands for recognizing aggressive activities in some specific scenarios like smart prison, we constructed a daily and aggressive activity dataset (DAAD). Moreover, based on the acceleration characteristics of aggressive activity, a threshold-based approach for aggressive activity detection is propounded to meet the needs of high real-time and low computational complexity in prison scenarios. The experiments are performed on the wireless sensor data mining (WISDM) dataset and the DAAD dataset, and the results verify that the propounded CapsGaNet could effectually improve the recognition accuracy. The proposed threshold-based approach for aggressive activity detection provides a more effective HAR way by using smart sensor devices in smart prison scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Battery energy storage systems (BESSs) are essential units in islanded dc microgrids (MGs) with tangible penetration of distributed renewable energy sources. These units play a crucial role in energy management and preferably should be controlled in a decentralized manner. In this regard, the conventional droop control is a well-known technique to implement a decentralized control for load sharing in the presence of various-sized distributed generator (DG) units and variable state-of-charge (SoC) level of BESS units. This method provides plug-and-play (PnP) feature for DG units; however, load sharing accuracy is poor, and voltage is unregulated. This article proposes a novel control system for energy management in islanded dc MGs while providing regulated voltage and highly accurate load sharing simultaneously in a decentralized way. The method uses the SoC level of BESS units in a modified droop control technique. A superimposed ac voltage on the nominal dc voltage of the network is used by the control system, bearing a frequency representing the network&#39;s load state. This frequency defines the operation mode of BESS units. Conducting simulation studies using piecewise linear electrical circuit simulation (PLECS) validates the effectiveness of the proposed control system. The experimental results confirm the viability and feasibility of the proposed control system.},

This article investigates the dynamic multiple-devices multiple-channels access for unsaturated traffic with retransmission mechanism, which is aimed at reducing the long-term data packet loss resulting from buffer overflows and transmission failure. The instant channel selection will lead to a non-negligible impact on the future decision, motivating us to model this problem as a Markov decision process. Limited by the unknown environment knowledge, we proposed a dynamic access policy based on deep reinforcement learning algorithm to optimally select the channel for transmission or keep silent for Internet-of-Things devices. Simulation results confirm that our proposed channel access strategy can reduce the collision and the packet loss of network. Furthermore, it can also work well when coexisting with the devices that adopt time division multiple access (TDMA) or ALOHA protocol.},

  abstract     = {Supervised machine learning is a promising technique to achieve joint resource allocation and selection of mobile relays in cooperative heterogeneous networks. Joint resource allocation and mobile relay selection are NP-hard problems in the sense that they cannot be solved in polynomial time. To solve this problem, highly complex heuristic solutions based on channel conditions and physical-layer parameters have been considered. Our research explores an artificial neural network (ANN) approach to the joint allocation of resources and choice of a mobile relay with efficient utilization of resources in terms of energy efficiency (EE) and spectral efficiency (SE). To this, there exists a tradeoff between the two, i.e., EE and SE, and to consider this tradeoff, a new metric resource efficiency (RE) has already been introduced in the literature. This article addresses the problem of learning a regression model for determining optimal transmit power and resource allocation and choosing the appropriate relay for cooperative communication to maximize RE. Specifically, a multilayer fully connected ANN-based resource allocation and relay selection (ANN-RARS) algorithm is proposed, and a comparison of ANN-RARS with particle swarm optimization-based resource allocation and relay selection (PSO-RARS) algorithm is performed. Based on the performance analysis, ANN-RARS performs better than the PSO-RARS algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Emerging wireless applications are increasingly seeking systems that can provide desirable performance properties with scale. Properties include better power consumption, cost, and error performance. As a result, advances in space modulation hardware thus far have introduced a variety of models attaining these various desirable properties. While many techniques focus on transmitter hardware, approaches involving precoding have emerged to simplify receiver hardware. As such, an existing family of hardware implementation models, referred to as receive space modulation techniques (RSMTs), exists offering different realization options. RSMTs essentially eliminate the need for a full RF receive chain for each antenna at the receiver. It follows that all RSMTs introduced to date achieve realizations through a single spatial dimension. However, a recently introduced transmitter-based technique called signed space modulation (SSM) adds a second spatial dimension that increases the spectral efficiency without the need for nonspatial symbols. In this article, novel hardware design models based on SSM are applied at the receiver by introducing precoding, adding more techniques to the family of RSMTs. The introduced models are compared in terms of cost, power, and computational complexity against receive quadrature space shift keying (RQSSK) that has shown the most favorable traits in past comparisons against other RSMTs.},

Then, we consider the availability of databases of alarm messages and frame the identification of functional dependencies in complex technical infrastructures as an optimization problem whose objective is the maximization of a metric measuring the level of dependence among alarms. A niching-based evolutionary algorithm has been developed to sequentially evolve a population of candidate solutions (group of alarms), maintaining diversity among them thanks to the use of a mechanism of population augmentation. The proposed algorithm is applied to a synthetic database of alarms generated by a complex technical infrastructure simulation model and to a real large-scale database of alarms collected from the particle accelerator of European Organization for Nuclear Research. The proposed algorithm is shown able to identify functional dependencies and to overperform other approaches based on the use of association rule mining algorithms, in terms of capability of extracting rare rules and computational efficiency.},

In this article, we leverage multiple-input–multiple-output (MIMO) technique in the TWR-NOMA system to extract spatial diversity gain for the performance enhancement. Communications between two user pairs are assisted by a relay. Precoding vectors at users as well as the matrix at the relay are specially designed to perform the signal alignment (SA). We derive analytical closed-form expressions for the outage probability and diversity order with both pSIC and imperfect successive interference cancellation (ipSIC). In addition, the ergodic rate and ergodic sum rate are analyzed. Optimal power allocations for the system outage probability and ergodic sum rate are analyzed based on the quality of service. Simulation results are provided to confirm the derived analytical results. The results show that the combination of SA and TWR-NOMA can decrease the outage probability and improve the diversity order effectively. The ergodic rates finally arise ceilings with both pSIC and ipSIC, and the ergodic sum rate can keep increasing as the power allocated to the distant user increases. However, the conventional TWR-NOMA is complete opposite. In summary, compared to TWR-NOMA, TWR-NOMA-SA has higher diversity order and enables distant users to contribute more to system performance.},

In this article, we propose a novel strategy for FiWi network planning to ensure reliability and survivability of the network. Moreover, our proposed FiWi planning strategy satisfies the required quality of service (QoS) to the users even in the case of failures. It has been shown that by deploying the proposed network framework, user services like received signal strength, throughput, delay, etc., are not significantly affected even when there is a failure. The position of backup ONU-AP is optimized in the FiWi network using a stochastic optimization algorithm. Furthermore, we compare different scenarios wherein backup ONU-AP is equipped with varying antenna configurations, such as omnidirectional antenna, sector antenna, and point-to-point (P2P) link to provide the required services to the users. Simulation results show that the P2P solution offers better services compared to sector or omnidirectional antenna configurations. Moreover, results demonstrate that the proposed survivable FiWi network can be successfully deployed without compromising the QoS requirement of the users. In addition, the article also provides reliability of the proposed survivable FiWi network.},

The RIS technology becomes especially attractive due to its capability to operate in a full-duplex (FD) mode, which is able to ideally double the half-duplex radio spectrum efficiency. This article analyzes the performance of an RIS-aided multihop FD relaying system, where an intermediate FD relay is employed to defeat the far-field path-loss effect inherent to RIS communication links. To this end, we analytically derive exact and asymptotic closed-form expressions for the outage probability, average spectral efficiency, and average bit error rate. The RIS-aided system demonstrates effective performance improvement for the proposed network. However, from the results, it is noticed that the increase in the number of RIS units within a certain communication link does not provide linear performance improvement due to the RIS channel&#39;s far-field path-loss model. Thus, mixing active FD relaying techniques with passive RIS platforms can be an ideal solution to improve further system performance, such as outage probability, average spectral efficiency, and average bit error rate in RIS-enabled networks.},

  abstract     = {This article proposes a novel approach for identifying the topology of radial distribution networks. It uses smart meter measurements from loads (e.g., houses) of the network to estimate the voltage sensitivity coefficients with respect to changes in the loads currents. These coefficients are then used to reconstruct the network topology. An enhanced graph learning algorithm with backtracking is proposed to generate a cluster of graphs, from which the best fitting candidate is selected using a set of optimization criteria. The performance of the proposed method is first assessed using the European Low-Voltage IEEE test case, followed by an extensive performance evaluation in noisy conditions on randomly generated topologies. Finally, measurements from a real low-voltage network in Australia are used to validate the method.},

  abstract     = {In industrial applications, the existing fault location methods of resonant grounding distribution systems suffer from low accuracy due to excessive dependence on communication, lack of field data, difficulty in artificial feature extraction and threshold setting, etc. To address these problems, this study proposes a decentralized fault section location method, which is implemented by the primary and secondary fusion intelligent switch (PSFIS) with two preloaded algorithms: autoencoder (AE) and backpropagation neural network. The relation between the transient zero-sequence current and the derivative of the transient zero-sequence voltage in each section is analyzed, and its features are extracted adaptively by using AE, without acquiring network parameters or setting thresholds. The current and voltage data are processed locally at PSFISs throughout the whole procedure, making it is insusceptible to communication failure or delay. The feasibility and effectiveness of the approach are investigated in PSCAD/EMTDC and real-time digital simulation system, which is then validated by field data. Compared with other methods, the experiment results indicate that the proposed method performs well in various scenarios with strong robustness to harsh on-site environment and roughness of data.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we present a robust optimization-based framework for day-ahead reliability assessment (RA) and real-time dispatch to ensure power system reliability under multistage renewable uncertainty. Our framework jointly considers fossil-fuel generators and energy storage in the system. To obtain near-optimal performance in grid reliability, we develop robust multistage decisions based on the concept of “safe-dispatch sets” in the literature. Although such safe-dispatch sets directly answer the RA and real-time dispatch problem, their computation often incurs high computational complexity. To develop low-complexity algorithms, we adopt a divide-and-conquer paradigm. First, we derive the conditions to describe the safe-dispatch sets for a pair of energy storage and generator. The results from this simple building block provide us with useful insights on how the grid reliability is related to the parameters, e.g., the generators’ ramp speeds and the storage capacity. To tackle the general multibus scenario, the uncertainty is split among virtual generator-storage pairs (VGSPs), where we can utilize the results from the one-bus building block. Numerical studies on a standard IEEE 30-bus test case illustrate that our proposed solution requires much lower storage capacity to ensure system reliability compared to state-of-the-art approaches, without renewable curtailment.},

Based on these data, remote doctors can provide the patient with a detailed diagnosis and suitable treatment. However, in wireless communication environment, WBANs may be affected by various attacks, which leads to privacy leakage. Before WBANs come into application, data confidentiality and patient privacy are the main challenges for us. Therefore, we proposed a revocable certificateless authentication scheme that effectively overcomes these problems. In this scheme, to realize large-scale applications, we divided WBANs into several independent areas, and each area is responsible for the patients in its own area. Once a malicious user appears, revocation center can change the key of its own area to achieve efficient revocation. This approach disperses the management burden of the network manager and realizes conditional privacy-preserving. Besides, bilinear pairing is not used in this scheme, which greatly reduces the computational cost. It is especially important for clients with limited capabilities in WBANs. It is proved that the security of this scheme is equivalent to the assumption of elliptic curve discrete logarithm in a random oracle.},

  abstract     = {This article proposes a new bidirectional stochastic adaptive robust framework with transient stability constraints to optimally and securely operate microgrids (MGs). Within the proposed framework, the uncertainties of photovoltaic/wind turbine generation, load, and electricity price are modeled using adaptive robust optimization (ARO), while the uncertainty of unscheduled islanding occurrence is modeled by stochastic programming. Besides covering the uncertainties related to MG operation, the proposed approach considers transient stability uncertainties leading to a more secure MG operation scheduling framework. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first time that transient stability analysis along with stochastic adaptive robust optimization (SARO) is proposed for MG operational scheduling. In addition, a new bidirectional scenario generation method is proposed to model MG unscheduled-islanding occurrence and MG restoration to the grid-connected mode. Modeling both the grid-connected and unscheduled-islanded MG operation modes as well as their transitions further distinguishes the proposed approach from the previous ones. Furthermore, a new solution methodology is presented to solve the proposed MG scheduling problem. This methodology is capable of solving both SARO and transient stability constrained-optimal power flow problems. The proposed MG operation optimization framework and solution method are tested on the modified IEEE 33-bus network.},

With the consideration of the channel estimation error, the joint optimization of the TS factor and source and relay precoding matrices is proposed with robustness against the channel state information mismatch to maximize the mutual information (MI) between the source and destination nodes. We derive the optimal structure of the source and relay precoding matrices to simplify the transceiver optimization problem under fixed and flexible power constraints.

Accordingly, the communication burden of an individual agent is reduced in each group. Moreover, the communication burden of each agent remains constant despite the scale of the network, and energy consumption is also reduced effectively from the perspective of one agent. In a cloud, delayed states of agents are reconstructed via delayed outputs received from a sensor, and a predictor is designed based on observed delay states. A cloud predictive control protocol is developed by dynamic variables and the predicted output to compensate for network delays from a cloud to an actuator, and a disturbance observer is presented based on predicted and local outputs. In theory, sufficient conditions for stability are presented and analyzed, and it is proved that the proposed cloud-based control scheme renders the MAS stable and to achieve output consensus.

Optimally sizing the renewable energy sources (RES) with a battery system enhances the energy reliability and affordability that can address the challenges of ET indexes (ETI). To that end, an ETI-based multiobjective optimal sizing (MOOS) of PV-battery systems for a building situated in a tropical savanna climate (TSC) has been proposed. Objective functions based on ETI viz., loss of power supply probability (LPSP) that ensures energy security/reliability and levelized cost of energy (LCOE) that indicates energy affordability are formulated. An additional index named surplus energy generation (SEG) that minimizes the excess energy generated (EEG) from the PV which could not be sold back to the utility grid is also formulated. A multiobjective grey wolf optimization algorithm (MOGWO) for optimal sizing of PV-battery systems is utilized to resolve the challenges of the ETI. The Euclidean distance-based sorting approach is implemented to find the best optimal solution from the Pareto front of the MOGWO. Further, a techno-economic and reliability analysis of the optimized PV battery system is presented.},

Moreover, data transmission is performed over a nonsecure network that suffers from a denial-of-service (DoS) attack. The DoS jamming attack has affected the network by the occurrence of consecutive packet dropouts, which result in attack-induced packet dropouts. Based on the fact that packet dropouts caused by DoS attacks naturally do not follow a specific statistical pattern, the attack-induced packet dropouts are modeled as an extension of time-varying intervals with no probability distribution. Sufficient conditions are provided to guarantee the uniformly globally exponential stability of the NCS in the form of linear matrix inequalities. Finally, the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed method are demonstrated by simulation results.},

  abstract     = {In a network of multiagent systems (MASs), the interaction between agents is not necessarily cooperative, but may be antagonistic, when the communication topology of a fixed spanning tree is formed. Although the cooperative control methods have been widely studied, the control methods aiming to the coexistence of antagonistic and cooperative interactions are rarely researched. Therefore, for antagonistic and cooperative interactions, this article addresses the bipartite cooperative quantized control problem for nonlinear stochastic MASs by using an event-triggered mechanism. The MASs model we chose allows cooperative and antagonistic interactions to coexist, with every agent being an independent individual. The Gaussian function is introduced to simulate cooperation and competition between two agents. Fuzzy neural networks are applied to approximate the unknown nonlinear functions, which reduces the burden of online calculation. Furthermore, to reduce the communication burden, an adaptive event-triggered approach with a varying threshold is developed. Meanwhile, according to sector bound property, a nonlinearity decomposition strategy of asymmetric hysteresis quantizer is applied. Compared with the previous situation that only event-triggered mechanism or quantizer is considered, this article reduces the communication burden to the greatest extent by codesigning the event-triggered mechanism and quantizer. Based on the backstepping technique, we propose a novel distributed adaptive control protocol, which not only achieves bipartite consensus control, but also guarantees that all the signals in the closed-loop system are bounded in probability, and the bipartite synchronization error converges to a small range near the origin. Finally, the performance of the proposed control strategy is illustrated through simulation.},

Aiming at the characteristics of motion mechanisms, a reliability allocation methodology is proposed. Since motion reliability plays an important role in motion mechanisms, a system decomposition is extended to map motion functions with subsystems. Combined with the analytic hierarchy process model, the subsystem contribution factor is developed. For motion mechanisms, the nondestructive fault events that have a significant impact on motion reliability are considered in the potential reliability improvement factor. To assist in evaluating the criticality of failures, the transformed failure severity factor is utilized. In addition, the dynamic performance factor is developed to evaluate the motion performance of the systems. Then, due to the interactions between the subsystems, the copula theory is applied to investigate the failure dependence, and the reliability model of the system to be apportioned is established. Furthermore, an engineering case about a mechanical system of an aircraft is presented to illustrate the applicability and rationality of the proposed method. The result shows that the reliability allocated to the subsystems is decreased when the failure dependence is considered, which is more reasonable in engineering practice.},

  abstract     = {Proactive eavesdropping via joint jamming and relaying has been proposed to improve the legitimate surveillance performance. However, how will it perform over multiple time slots compared to proactive eavesdropping via jamming remains unknown. To answer this question, proactive eavesdropping via joint jamming and relaying over multiple time slots is investigated with full and causal channel state information (CSI). The problem for maximizing the average eavesdropping rate subject to the peak and average transmit power constraints is investigated, and the online and offline algorithms are proposed. Simulation results confirm that the proposed algorithms are low complex and practically optimal. It is shown that compared to proactive eavesdropping via jamming, the joint jamming and relaying always performs better with full CSI, and performs better with causal CSI when the average transmit power constraint is loose.},

  abstract     = {Real-time dispatch balances the power demand with minimized operating costs. For the current dispatch model, the demand is assumed to be constant within a time interval, while the intra-interval power balance is left to frequency regulation. Based on practical experience and simulations, this behavior may lead to insufficient frequency regulation and uneconomic regulation costs considering the increase in intra-interval fluctuations caused by renewables. In this article, a real-time dispatch method with secondary frequency regulation behaviors is proposed. Without changing the interval of the real-time dispatch command, the system regulation mileage and intra-interval generation adjustment are explicitly formulated in a mixed-integer optimization model. To reduce the computational burden, an efficient two-stage calculation method is proposed. With practical utility data, this article finds that the proposed method can effectively improve the system frequency performance with the subminute net load forecasting curve obtained by an off-the-shelf forecasting approach. Time-domain simulations in IEEE and practical utility systems validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of the frequency performance and total operating costs.},

  abstract     = {The ever-growing applications of the multiterminal direct current (MTDC) systems have introduced interdependence in terms of operation conditions between ac and dc systems. When considering such a conditional dependence, the outage probabilities are affected by the previous fault events in hybrid ac–dc power systems and thus no longer independent, rendering the results from conventional reliability evaluation techniques to be inaccurate. This article provides a method to evaluate the operational reliability of the MTDC-based hybrid ac–dc power systems considering the conditional dependence between the ac and MTDC systems. First, a conditional-dependent fault analysis model is developed to describe the entire temporal fault process. In the proposed model, dynamic state models for components are built considering system parameters that affect their outage probabilities. A redispatch model for the hybrid ac–dc power system is then established to characterize the variation of operation status between different periods. After that, a framework to evaluate the operational reliability of a hybrid ac–dc power system considering conditional-dependent faults is formulated by combining the conditional fault analysis model and the Monte Carlo simulation technique. The impacts of conditional dependence on the reliability of hybrid ac–dc power systems are quantified by the modified reliability indices. Finally, the proposed method is validated by modified IEEE-RTS systems with different MTDC topologies and ac–dc coupling levels to demonstrate the impact of conditional-dependent faults.},

All previous proposals are declared to support fined-grain access control for encrypted data and secure sharing in cloud. However, these schemes have their limitations, as the circuit nodes can only output layer by layer, and the circuit depth of the access structure implemented in the system is a fixed value. In addition, recent results show that these schemes have serious security defects, such as unresisting collusion attacks and vulnerability of the ciphertext stored in cloud. This article aims at solving the problems mentioned above and a scheme with improved efficiency and security is proposed. In the presented scheme, the circuit access structure with any depth less than or equal to the maximum depth is realized through equivalent conversion of circuit. By modifying the parameter form of shares, we solved the limitation that the previous scheme could only output layer by layer upward, and realized that each node could output to any node with a depth greater than its own across layers. This scheme greatly reduces the redundant computational overhead and improves the encryption and decryption efficiency.},

In this article, we first introduce an efficient EMRs management model called on-chain ledger and off-chain storage (OLOS), in which the indexes of EMRs are uploaded on public blockchain and the real EMRs data are stored in native server. This model can relieve the public ledger and save the public cloud space. Meanwhile, it can protect data security by keeping off the direct operation on real EMRs data. Then, to protect the cross-institutional EMRs sharing security and improve the quantum-resist ability, we proposed a secure keyword-searchable attribute-based encryption (KS-ABE) scheme based on lattice cryptography. Moreover, the scheme can prove to be secure against adaptive chosen-keyword attack and adaptive chosen-policy attack in the random oracle model. Besides, comparison analysis and experimental results show that our KS-ABE scheme has fewer communication costs and smaller key sizes than similar literary works.},

  abstract     = {People use smart transportation systems to move around in smart cities, producing a massive amount of valuable mobility data. Although this characteristic enables the development of many intelligent applications, it can expose users to privacy threats. Location privacy is an issue addressed in many mobility contexts, in which there is a privacy concern. Currently, there are some proposals to tackle this problem, and some questions naturally arise: Are these proposals suitable for a dynamic environment, such as smart mobility? What are the impacts of mobility on privacy? In this article, we answer these questions to explore location privacy in smart mobility considering open and online data, one of the fundamental pillars of smart city platforms. We have evidenced the hypothesis that mobility can impact privacy approaches of anonymization (mix zones) and obfuscation (GEO-I) in the context of smart mobility. For this, we performed experiments to characterize and find similarities in the statistical distributions extracted from two stay points metrics, which operate as substrates to build location privacy protection mechanisms. We use an accuracy metric to quantify the datasets’ distributions that matched each other. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of seven real datasets of mono or multimodal mobility. The results showed that the stay point count metric reached 100\% and 83.3\% accuracy for coarse-grained (person and vehicle) and fine-grained (bus, taxi, and person) data. Additionally, we show a similarity between distributions for the same vehicle type for mono and multimodal datasets. Results suggest that privacy has a high dependence on mobility in different granularity levels.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we study the energy-efficient power allocation (PA) for multiuser distributed multiple-input-single-output (D-MISO) system with beamforming (BF) and imperfect channel state information (CSI). Given a target bit error rate, the system energy efficiency (EE) with imperfect CSI is deduced. Subject to the power budget constraints, a constrained optimization problem is first formulated to maximize EE of single-user D-MISO. The optimal BF is shown to be aligned with the channel direction that renders the joint optimization problem to be a PA problem. A near-optimal PA scheme is proposed to tackle this problem by using the concave–convex procedure method and fractional programming (FP) and block coordinate descent (BCD) method, and it can provide nearly optimal performance close to that of optimal exhaustive search scheme with less complexity. On this basis, a suboptimal PA scheme based on the FP and BCD method is developed to further decrease the complexity and maintain similar performance to near-optimal scheme, and it is suitable for the system with more distributed antennas. With these results, two PA schemes are, respectively, proposed for multiuser D-MISO with imperfect CSI to maximize EE. The first scheme can obtain better performance with relatively higher complexity, and the second scheme can gain the performance close to the first scheme with lower complexity, and only smaller performance loss is found. Interestingly, these two schemes have the same optimal performance for perfect CSI, and include the existing ones under perfect CSI as special cases. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the developed schemes.},

Dynamic data collected by multiple LoRa sensors are encrypted in a LoRa server, and the encrypted content is automatically stored in the InterPlanetary file system (IPFS) to ensure data confidentiality, integrity, and availability. To achieve data consistency, the content IDs collected from the IPFS are stored in the quorum blockchain with consortium setup using a smart contract. The consortium network is maintained by the Raft consensus algorithm employing seven nodes. The design architecture of the hardware used for both LoRa transmitting node and gateway has been described in comprehensive manners. The performance of the LoRaWAN system is analyzed by the received signal strength indicator, the communications range, and packet loss rate metrics in both line-of-sight and nonline-of-sight test systems. The data management scheme is implemented in Python, and the performance is evaluated in terms of transaction time and block size.},

The MAES includes an integrated energy distribution system (IEDS) and several networked-RIESs. The IEDS is defined as an integrated system of electrical and natural gas networks. Moreover, the RIES is assumed as a system of multiple local energy carriers such as electricity, heat, and natural gas to provide energy demands. In this research, the IEDS and each RIES are considered as independent systems with individual objectives, so that multiple energy carriers can be directly traded between RIESs. In order to solve the coordinated optimization problems of these interconnected subsystems, the current study implements a distributed optimization framework based on the analytical target cascading structure. In this manner, this study employs an Augmented Lagrangian based penalty function. To solve the local optimization problem of individual energy systems, we utilize the teaching–learning based optimization algorithm. The performance of the proposed method is validated on a test MAES including an IEDS, and three RIESs.},

  abstract     = {By integrating cloud computing and traditional wireless body area networks (WBANs), the emerging cloud-aided WBANs for smart health care have been significantly developed in recent years. However, this new technique that is now in its infancy days also suffers from some challenging issues resulted from untrustworthy cloud servers, such as data security. While attribute-based encryption seems to be suitable for ensuring data security in such complex scenarios, the flaw of existing ABE works in policy hiding inevitably leads to extra privacy issues. For efficiently guaranteeing data security without revealing anything privacy information about the data owner, we adopt the conception named inner-product encryption (IPE) in this article and propose a full attribute hiding IPE scheme that concurrently achieves unbounded attribute vectors and acceptable communication as well as computation efficiency. Compared with the only existing IPE scheme presented by Okamoto and Takashima that simultaneously achieves full attribute hiding and unbounded attributes, our scheme not only covers all the merits in their scheme but also has the high practicality due to tinier size of public parameters and more desirable computation efficiency. Eventually, performance comparisons and implementation results reveal that our article is highly feasible and effective than other works.},

  abstract     = {In this article, a new model for option pricing using the Black–Scholes option pricing method under equilibrium of the option and day-ahead markets is presented. To analyze the performance of the Black–Scholes option pricing method in financial electricity markets, the model is compared with the equilibrium option pricing (Eq-Pr) model. To this end, first, the option pricing curves of the above-mentioned models on the option contract area (OCA) of the financial electricity market are drawn. Here, the option pricing curve means the computed premium price versus strike price, and the OCA is the area of the premium price-strike price plane in which both option buyers and sellers are willing to conclude option contracts. Then, overlap of the Black–Scholes option pricing curve with the OCA and its distance to Eq-Pr curve is assessed. The controversy among researchers about the applicability of the Black–Scholes option pricing in financial electricity markets is assessed by applying the proposed models to a test power system and the conditions in which Black–Scholes option pricing works are discussed.},

We propose to estimate the channel covariance matrix by alternately using the assigned pilots and their phase-shifted pilots in different coherent blocks, which improves the accuracy of channel estimation with imperfect covariance matrix and reduces pilot overhead. Under this scheme, the closed-form expressions of SE with maximum ratio combination (MRC) and zero-forcing (ZF) receivers are derived, which enable us to select key parameters for better system performance. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed channel estimation method and the accuracy of the derived closed-form expressions. When more coherent blocks are used to estimate the covariance matrix, we can get better system performance. Moreover, some insightful conclusions are arrived from the SE comparisons between different receiving schemes (ZF and MRC) and different pilot allocation schemes (orthogonal pilot and pilot reuse).},

  abstract     = {The integration of different energy carriers is a key factor to improve the energy network performance. A micro-energy hub (μEH) concept has recently been proposed in the integrated electricity and natural gas distribution systems (IENGDSs), for generating, converting, storing, and managing different types of energy at the customer level. To improve the performance of μEH, this paper proposes a hierarchical optimization-based model to optimize the sizes of μEH components and locations of μEHs in the IENGDS. The operation and structural sizing constraints of the μEHs are first determined. Then the optimal electricity network buses and natural gas nodes for installing μEHs are determined, considering the operational constraints of IENGDS. The objective in both steps is to minimize operation and investment costs. Moreover, the impacts of seasonal climate changes on energy demands and prices are considered during the planning horizon. Furthermore, the uncertainties in demands and renewable energy generation are quantified with a two-stage stochastic programming framework. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated on an IENGDS that consists of an IEEE 33-bus distribution system and a Belgian 20-node natural gas system. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the optimal hierarchical planning model can improve total line losses and reduce the total purchased electricity from the upstream network and total imported natural gas from gas wells. The simulation results show that if the hierarchical optimization process is not performed in determining optimal placement of μEHs, then IENGDS may operate with electricity network congestion or natural gas pressure violations during the planning horizon.},

This article conducts an in-depth study on topology attacks that aim to interfere with the judgment in topology information and pose potential damage by tampering with measurement data and protection information on branches, namely, protection-branch measurements-based topology attacks (PBT attacks). To achieve PBT attacks in actual networks, we study the protection settings and mechanisms in term of branches including transformers and transmission lines. Then, for the first time, we develop a bilevel model based on the protection configuration from the perspective of security-constrained economic dispatch. Meanwhile, since a bilevel model is constructed against dc state estimation, a conversion method in constructing attack vectors under PBT attacks against ac power system is proposed, which makes PBT attacks more suitable for actual power systems and more concealed. In a set of case studies on an IEEE 14-bus system, the simulation results verify the effectiveness of the model we proposed, analyze the vulnerability of network under PBT attacks, and then identify some critical branches that are defended to cope with PBT attacks. In addition, the comparison between PBT attacks and traditional cyber-overloaded attacks also shows a stronger threat of the studied attacks.},

  abstract     = {Multiaccess edge computing (MEC) and network virtualization technologies are important enablers for fifth generation networks to deliver diverse services. Services are often provided as fully connected virtual network functions (VNFs), through service function chaining (SFC). However, the problem of allocating SFC resources at the edge still faces many challenges related to the way VNFs are placed, chained, and scheduled. In this article, to solve these problems, we propose a game theory-based approach with the objective to reduce service latency in the context of SFC at the edge. The problem of allocating SFC resources can be divided into two subproblems: 1) the VNF placement and routing subproblem, and 2) the VNF scheduling subproblem. For the former subproblem, we formulate it as a mean-field game in which VNFs are contending over edge resources aiming at reducing the resource consumption of MEC nodes and reducing latency for users. We also propose a reinforcement learning-based technique, where the Ishikawa--Mann learning algorithm is used. For the later subproblem, we formulate it as a matching game between VFNs and edge resources to find the execution order of the VNFs while reducing the latency. To efficiently solve it, we propose a modified version of the many-to-one deferred acceptance algorithm (DAA), called the enhanced multistep DAA. To illustrate the performance of the proposed approaches, we perform extensive simulations. The results show that the approaches achieve up to 40\% less resource consumption, and up to 38\% less latency than the benchmarked state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we raise the concern on secure energy efficiency (SEE) over the wireless-powered untrusted relay networks with nonlinear energy harvesting (EH). To achieve data confidentiality and secrecy performance enhancement concurrently, the untrusted relay can enable simultaneous energy signal reception and confidential information forwarding during the second phase, where no dedicated energy transmission phase or relaying signal splitting is needed for the energy supply. In particular, with the help of destination jamming, the relay can also harvest energy from source signal and jamming signal during the first phase, which is different from conventional relaying protocol that only harvests energy from source and recycled energy. Considering the nonlinear EH efficiency, our objective is to maximize the SEE through piecewise region selection and power allocation. To address this intractable nonconvex problem, a two-layer algorithm based on optimization decoupling, fractional programming, Lagrange dual decomposition and difference of convex functions (DC) programming is proposed. The core idea of the proposed algorithm is to convert the primary problem into simple subproblems by sequentially exploiting the above-mentioned optimization methods. Simulation results reveal the superior secrecy performance of the proposed scheme. The proposed algorithm achieves near-optimal solutions with faster convergence rate.},

Through simulations, we conduct case studies in a test CPPS generated by coupling the IEEE 118 Bus System with a scale-free communication network. The protection effects of three heuristic cyber protection strategies, namely, target protection, random protection, and acquaintance protection are compared and analyzed. Simulation results reveal that compared with the other two strategies, target protection can suppress malware propagation and resist malware attacks more effectively. Moreover, we also investigate the optimal cyber protection problem in CPPSs and formulate it as a zero-one integer programming problem. We solve the problem by genetic algorithm and find that some low-degree cyber nodes also play a significant role in resisting malware attacks in CPPSs, especially when the protection budget is tight.},

Therefore, inappropriate CHs will certainly aggravate the unevenness of the network energy distribution, intensively shortening the network lifetime. A well designed CH selection and subsequent power control scheme has been demonstrated to be effective in coping with this challenge. Different from the existing schemes in which the network status information of only a single round was considered to select CHs, in this article, all transmission rounds before the first death of MTC devices are taken into account to determine a CH index table. Specifically, considering that the first energy drain (FED) lifetime is a key indicator for the network to capture complete information, an FED-based CH selection scheme is proposed to optimize network lifetime, where the CH index table is obtained to predetermine the index of the CH in every round. Then, a power control scheme is also proposed to further extend the network lifetime with the constraint of transmission time. Finally, extensive simulations verify the superiority of the proposed scheme in terms of FED lifetime and successfully delivered packets in the absence and presence of the cochannel interference.},

Some studies have analyzed the impact of different network structures on resilience in the supply chain network from both topological and performance perspectives. However, these are mainly concerned with the impact of vastly different network structures on resilience, such as comparing scale-free networks and random networks, and pay less attention to the impact of slight differences in structure on supply chain network resilience. At the same time, the relationships between different resilience metrics have received less attention after cascading failure. In this article, we construct a supply chain network structure-disruption model from both topological and operational perspectives. This model can analyze how disruptions propagate in a supply chain network with any structure and evaluate the resilience of networks under different types of disruptions (node or link failures). Finally, we conduct a numerical simulation and evaluate the impact of different structures on the resilience of agri-food supply chain networks under eight disruption scenarios (random and targeted disruptions). This research can help managers make topological adjustments during various disruption scenarios and protect the most vulnerable nodes/links.},

  abstract     = {Distribution networks are most prone to high impedance faults (HIFs). These types of faults occur whenever an energized conductor makes a contact with some surfaces that are poor conductors such as sand, concrete, branches of trees, etc. The consequential fault current has an absolute magnitude similar to that of load current therefore, the overcurrent relays usually fail to operate correctly during these faults. In the past few decades, several schemes have surfaced for detecting HIFs. The studies conducted in this article suggest an application of discrete wavelet transform to obtain discriminative features of faulty current signals and the development of a threshold-based scheme to discriminate between faulty and nonfaulty situations. The first-level approximate wavelet coefficients are extracted and used to calculate the standard deviation features using a recursive moving window. With the help of these features, faulted phase is also identified simultaneously apart from fault detection. The efficacy of the scheme is tested on a modified IEEE-13 bus test feeder system incorporated with distributed generators. The algorithm has been compared with the conventional HIF detection schemes and the results proved the efficiency and robustness of the proposed scheme to detect the fault under a variety of fault conditions. The main contributions of the proposed scheme are viz., it can correctly differentiate between HIF/LIF and switching events and works well on both grid-connected or islanding mode. Finally, validation with real field fault events captured by digital fault recorder confirms that the proposed framework can assist utility engineers in detecting the HIF/LIF and switching events securely.},

  abstract     = {For the cooperative nonorthogonal multiple access (C-NOMA)-aided integrated satellite-terrestrial network (ISTN), an outage is inevitable if the channel from the satellite to the weak user is in deep fade. To handle this issue, this article proposes to deploy relay nodes to assist the communication, specifically, the relay and strong user forward information, which is sent from the satellite, to the weak user. After that, the weak user can boost its received signal strength by utilizing maximum ratio combining. In this context, we further study two kinds of relay protocols, i.e., decode-and-forward (DF) and amplify-and-forward (AF). For each protocol, the closed-form and asymptotic expressions of the outage probability (OP) are derived and then, based on the asymptotic OP, the diversity order is analyzed. Results indicate the DF protocol is preferable to the AF from the OP aspect although it incurs more computational load. Besides, the diversity order of the proposed ISTN is identical to that of C-NOMA and twice that of the relaying network. Simulation results clarify the superiority of the proposed scheme.},

  abstract     = {Through interacting with wireless environments continuously, continuous spectrum sensing (CSS) had been proposed in the literature to alleviate problems introduced by quiet periods in cognitive radio systems. However, in conventional bandwidth-fixed CSS (BF-CSS) schemes, the precious and finite time-frequency resources are not sufficiently utilized. In this article, we design a bandwidth-adaptive CSS (BA-CSS) scheme to improve time-frequency resource utilization, and analyze its performance in terms of average delay, transmission throughput, and energy efficiency (EE). In our proposal, if a primary user is detected to be absent, a secondary user senses the sensing subband and transmits over the transmission subband; otherwise, it senses the entire frequency band, which consists of the sensing subband and the transmission subband. Based on a four-state Markov chain, we obtain the average number of spectrum opportunities, the probability of detection, and the probability of false alarm. Then, closed-form expressions for the average delay, the transmission throughput, and the EE are derived. We also obtain performance boundaries for the average delay and the transmission throughput. Both theoretical analysis and simulation results show that compared with the conventional BF-CSS, the proposed BA-CSS is able to improve both the delay performance and the throughput performance significantly with negligible decrease in EE.},

  abstract     = {With the rise of blockchain technology, the peer-to-peer (P2P) network system has once again caught people&#39;s attention to equipping a blockchain with a big storage capacity. In the traditional P2P file-sharing network systems, such as InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), data stored in the other nodes cannot be revoked by the owner and can only be removed by other nodes themselves. To comply with the criteria of the European Union&#39;s General Data Protection Regulation, it is important to ensure that personal data can be completely removed by their owners. To improve the privacy and security of the P2P file-sharing system, we propose a revocable and monitorable P2P file-sharing system over a consortium blockchain to achieve revocation of files in the decentralized environment. By using a trusted execution environment, such as Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX), the proposed scheme can verify the integrity of the executables of the P2P file-sharing system and generate a file authentication code for each IPFS node to make sure that the system is synchronized correctly. This scheme elaborately integrates the autonomous smart contracts and Intel SGX hardware to obtain the monitorable merit. The experimental results suggest that enhancing the security and privacy take modest computing costs into consideration. To the best of our knowledge, this scheme is the first attempt to achieve the P2P file-sharing system with securely revocable functions.},

Accurately modeling these attacks is the first step in designing appropriate countermeasures. Therefore, this article aims at power system vulnerability analysis from the operator’s perspective, i.e., identifying the scenarios, where false data injection (FDI) cyberattacks can lead to overflow of multiple lines. A nonlinear optimization model is developed for cyberattacks that can bypass the state-estimation and result in congestion of multiple lines in smart grids. Unlike existing line congestion attacks that focused on dc state-estimation, the proposed model is based on FDIs on targeted set of buses to overflow targeted set of lines by bypassing ac state-estimation. Considering ac state-estimation in the attack model generalizes the proposed model for both transmission and distribution-level power grids. The nonconvex model is then converted to a convex formulation using second-order cone programming relaxation, and global optimality conditions are discussed. Several case studies are considered to validate the effectiveness of the proposed attack model using IEEE 118-bus benchmark.},

In this article, we, therefore, inform the day-ahead scheduling of VPPs with forecast scenarios of the balancing stage, which are complemented with information on nonshiftable load, renewable generation, and electricity prices. These multivariate scenarios (incorporating both time and cross-variable dependencies) are obtained using a machine learning framework in which probabilistic forecasts are converted into time trajectories using a copula-based sampling. The model is enriched with a detailed representation of the intraday decision stage wherein all flexible resources are dynamically allocated over the daily horizon. To ensure the reliability of the solution, we take into full consideration the revenues and unit-specific costs related to the activation of reserves. Outcomes show that improving the representation of the intraday dispatch stage while relying on representative balancing uncertainties are two complementary components for increasing the quality of the VPP day-ahead strategy, which ultimately fosters its economic value.},

Taking that into consideration, we focus on a UAV swarm-enabled communication network in this article, where a fixed-wing UAV acts as a legitimate user and a neighboring UAV eavesdropper attempts to eavesdrop the confidential information forwarded by rotary-wing UAV relays. In particular, we jointly optimize transmit power on the base station and UAV relays, power allocation coefficient and beamforming on UAV relays, and trajectory of the fixed-wing UAV to maximize the average secrecy rate. Due to the nonconvexity of the optimization problem, the block coordinate descent method is utilized to solve it. Specifically, the overall optimizing problem is divided into four subproblems in which the transmit power, power allocation coefficient, beamforming vector, and the trajectory of user are optimized, respectively. By employing the successive convex approximate method, subproblems are transformed to convex problems which are numerically tractable. Numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and show that compared with benchmark schemes, the considered transmission scheme with artificial noise and optimized network parameters can improve secrecy rate by about 13.8\%.},

We formulate an optimal power–water–heat flow (OPWHF) problem and develop a computationally efficient heuristic to solve it. The proposed heuristic decomposes OPWHF into subproblems, which are iteratively solved via convex relaxation and convex–concave procedure. Simulation results validate that the proposed framework can improve operational flexibility and social welfare of the integrated system, wherein the water and heating networks respond as virtual energy storage to time-varying energy prices and solar photovoltaic generation. Moreover, we perform sensitivity analysis to compare two modes of heating network control: by flow rate and by temperature.

To this end, two novel energy-efficient architectures are proposed, which are, respectively, named as adaptive FC (AFC) architecture and adaptive SC (ASC) architecture. The proposed architectures can adapt the connections between the radio frequency chains and antenna elements according to the channel environment, so that the hardware overhead can be reduced remarkably compared with the conventional counterparts. Afterwards, two novel hybrid precoding algorithms are proposed based on the AFC and ASC architectures. Particularly, in the proposed algorithm, a subspace projection-based branch-and-bound method is developed to derive the switch precoding matrix, thereby the computational burden can be reduced by more than two orders of magnitude in comparison to the traditional branch-and-bound method. Additionally, the problem of PS precoding matrix is reformulated as a positive semidefinite quadratic form via an elegant diagonal loading factor, so that the PS precoding matrix can be obtained easily. Simulation results verify that the proposed architectures and algorithms can offer both high energy efficiencies and spectral efficiencies.},

The objective is to optimize the total cost and the technical dissatisfaction in a way that the economy of system operation and energy supply quality for the risk-averse scheme is guaranteed simultaneously. Based on the trapezoidal fuzzy membership function, the fuzzy constraint is constructed to quantify the technical dissatisfaction of the nodal voltage and supply temperature. Then, a multiobjective min–max–min problem is formulated to hedge the IEHS against risk imposed by the uncertain variables. Since the formulated two objectives compete with each other, a risk-averse multiobjective solution procedure based on the augmented epsilon-constraint algorithm is developed to recast the multiobjective problem into its equivalent single objective problem. And the accurate Pareto fronts under different risk levels are obtained with several iterations. Numerical case studies are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed method. It provides benefits in the aspect of balancing the economy and energy supply quality under network constraints and uncertainties.},

A key distinction to prior works is that this article considers sensor nodes aided by backscatter communications, which allow them to communicate with negligible energy cost using ambient radio frequency (RF) signals. The article contains three main novelties. First, it presents a mixed integer linear program (MILP) that can be used to compute the global optimal solution. Second, it also outlines a centralized greedy scheduling (CGS) algorithm that selects nodes based on their energy and the number of covered targets. Third, it presents a distributed greedy scheduling (DGS) algorithm that selects nodes according to their energy level. The simulation results show that equipping nodes with ambient backscattering capability increases the ratio of complete targets coverage by more than 100\% as compared to existing techniques.},

  abstract     = {In the recent years, there has been a tremendous increase in the use of wireless medium and radio frequency spectrum due to the development of new types of wireless networks, applications, and enabling technologies. Consequently, the radio frequency spectrum is getting overcrowded due to this increasing demand. Traditionally, frequency bands are allocated to licensed users for their specific use. Cognitive radio allows secondary users to communicate using these frequency bands. However, this may result in interference to the primary users. Information of the relative positions of the primary and secondary users and the distance between them can be exploited to avoid this interference. In our work, we use cooperative localization strategy to determine the distance between the secondary and primary users. This distance information is then utilized to adjust the transmission power of the secondary nodes so that the interference threshold of the primary users is not exceeded. The proposed methodology is evaluated using simulation experiments. Different aspects of the proposed algorithm including location and distance estimation, channel availability, and channel capacity against transmission power and path loss are evaluated. The results show that the proposed scheme is able to achieve considerable gains as a consequence of interference avoidance.},

IEEE 802.11ax is the current WLAN standard proposed to meet these requirements. This article analyzes the uplink-multiuser-orthogonal frequency division multiple access-hybrid access (HA) mechanism of the 802.11ax system under error-prone channel conditions. We propose an enhanced Markov chain model for analyzing such a WLAN system. By solving the system model, we derive vital systems performance metrics, such as aggregate and per-STA throughput, random access (RA) capability packet loss probability, mean delay, jitter, fairness, and worst-case delay bounds. Our analysis also considers different physical (PHY) and medium access control (MAC) layer aspects, such as channel bandwidth, the number of resource units (RUs), packet aggregation feature, fading, path-loss, modulation and coding schemes (MCS), etc. Furthermore, we have studied the MCS link adaptation-based dynamic HA process where the RUs are dynamically adapted between scheduled access and RA mechanisms. Additionally, to capture the role of PHY and MAC layer parameters on multi-Basic service set scenarios, we have integrated the Markov chain-based modeling with the stochastic geometry-based model. Our analytical model has been validated against extensive simulations, and the tradeoff between the metrics is studied.},

With the advancement of technologies, robotic applications have evolved to integrate multiple distributed robots. As a result, the integration of formal verification-based methods to assure the correctness of the interactions between multiple distributed robots has become ever more important. However, going from formally verified models designed in formal environments/software such as UPPAAL to robotic simulation software such as robot operating system (ROS) and Gazebo is time-consuming and prone to human errors. Nonetheless, such a translation from formal to simulation environment is essential for robotic applications that are going to be deployed in the real world, for obvious economical and safety reasons. In this article, we provide our insights into the development of a framework that integrates design and formal verification at a higher level of abstraction and then performing a translation to ROS, focusing on a scenario for distributed drones representing urban air mobility. Through this article, we seek to accelerate the development cycle in transitioning from formally verified systems to simulation.},

Another major advantage is the existence of adaptive learning dynamics that involve realistic, constrained decision making, and converge to Nash equilibrium. If players are not fully rational (e.g., constrained or regulated), such convergence is generally not guaranteed except in some special games, such as potential games (PGs). Within each PG, there exists a potential function that connects the global objective with players’ payoffs and actions such as optimizers of the global objective align with Nash equilibrium. Therefore, PGs have been widely utilized in many engineering domains and recently to power grids. This article summarizes the state-of-the-art existing literature on applying various PG models in power grids and provides an overlook of potential models and algorithms that have not received sufficient attention but possess unique capabilities to solve existing challenges in power grids.},

  abstract     = {Several schemes have been proposed to enable cloud servers to search encrypted medical data to preserve patients’ privacy. However, the existing schemes use inefficient attribute-based encryption (ABE) approaches for access control. Also, servers cannot learn whether a doctor can achieve the access policy of a document and this check is done by doctors, so unrelated documents are outsourced. Moreover, the existing schemes only support single data-owner setting, where a doctor needs to share a key with each patient. To address these limitations, we develop an efficient ABE approach. Patients use it to encrypt the symmetric key (that encrypted a document), so that only authorized doctors can obtain the key and decrypt the document. Patients also send to the server the encryptions of an access policy and the document’s keywords. Doctors send the encryptions of the keywords, and their attributes. Then, the server returns the documents the doctor is authorized to access without being able to learn the keywords, the access policy, and the doctor’s attributes to preserve privacy. Our analysis indicates that our scheme can preserve privacy, and our experimental results demonstrate that our scheme requires less communication/computation overhead compared to the existing schemes. Also, the number of keys in the system are significantly reduced.},

To this end, a modulated gated recurrent unit deep learning based network named improved gated recurrent neural network has been proposed. The designed network, which has a recurrent neural network based structure, benefits from one update gate that can capture sudden changes in transient voltage and current signals and also enhance computational efficiency. Furthermore, to enhance robustness of the designed network under noisy conditions, a new informative-based loss function is formulated. The proposed loss function utilizes generalized form of mutual information to enhance robustness of designed network in the presence of Gaussian and non-Gaussian noises.

Therefore, this article studies the impact of interference caused by mMTC connections. We theoretically model the intercell interference (ICI) minimization problem for the existing orthogonal multiple access (OMA) technique and propose its corresponding solution. Furthermore, we jointly solve the ICI and the cochannel interference minimization problem for the IoT users when the nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technique is used. For the proposed OMA and NOMA schemes, we design a cooperative scheduler to reduce the impact of such interference. The results show that our proposed schemes provide up to 58\%, 75\%, and 100\% more improvements in terms of user’s data rates, energy consumption, and connection density, respectively.},

This operation-planning framework provides a suitable and interactive environment for the electricity market, distribution company (DISCO), electric vehicle (EV) aggregator, and rival DISCOs to increase the HC. The problem is modeled via a bilevel conditional-value-at-risk-constrained stochastic programming approach. The DISCO, in the upper level (UL), tries to maximize the HC and minimize the operating costs while interacting with a passive electricity market and an EV aggregator. The aggregator, in the lower level, aims to maximize their profit by interacting with the primary DISCO in the UL and the rival DISCO, to satisfy the EV owners. The Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions are used to recast the model into an equivalent single level. The proposed framework is tested on a 33-node distribution network. Results show how an interactive-based framework can contribute to maximizing the HC of DGs.},

Nevertheless, the available ramp-up power for compensating the supply-demand gap in the power system could be limited due to the operational constraints of power networks and generation units. As a result, in this article, a transactive flexible-ramp-up-management-mechanism is offered in order to enable system operators to exploit the scheduling of microgrid systems with the aim of ensuring power requirements of the multi-microgrid system meet the flexible-ramp-up constraints. Therefore, the mechanism would result in the efficient rescheduling of local flexible resources in a multi-microgrid distribution system in order to address the ramp-up constraints in the system. The offered mechanism limits the information exchange between microgrids and the system operator to transactive control signals and accumulated power exchanges to impede privacy concerns of independently operated entities. Lastly, the recommended mechanism is implemented on the IEEE-37-bus test system, where, its effectiveness in addressing the overall system flexible-ramp-up limitations is investigated.},

Not to mention, within some regions, COVID-19 social distancing measures have led to a temporary transfer of energy demand from commercial and urban centers to residential areas, causing an increased use and higher charges, and in turn, creating economic impacts on customers. Therefore, the marketplace could benefit from developing an Internet of Things ecosystem that monitors energy consumption habits and promptly recommends action to facilitate energy efficiency. This article aims to present the full integration of a proposed energy efficiency framework into the Home-Assistant platform using an edge-based architecture. End users can visualize their consumption patterns as well as ambient environmental data using the Home-Assistant user interface. More notably, explainable energy-saving recommendations are delivered to end users in the form of notifications via the mobile application to facilitate habit change. In this context, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first attempt to develop and implement an energy-saving recommender system on edge devices. Thus, ensuring better privacy preservation since data are processed locally on the edge, without the need to transmit them to remote servers, as is the case with cloudlet platforms.},

In this article, we propose to use SM in an HSTCS scheme consisting of a satellite, multiple terrestrial relays with multiple-input and multiple-output configuration, and a destination node equipped with multiple antennas on the ground. We derive a union bound for the symbol error probability in a fairly exact form and diversity order to shed light on the significant system parameters on the performance. Our theoretical results are validated through Monte Carlo simulations, and it is shown that using the SM technique provides a better error performance in the considered HSTCS system when compared to vertical Bell Laboratories layered space-time and space-time Alamouti codes.},

The analysis does not rely on the traditional reduced-order transformation, but constructing Lyapunov functions directly focused on the original system. Based on the direct method and the separation method, different control strategies are proposed, under which the addressed CVINNs can achieve synchronization perfectly in a fixed time. The corresponding synchronization criteria in terms of matrix inequalities are derived, which are more concise and easier to verify than algebraic inequalities conditions, and the estimation of the settling times. The direct method makes full use of some innovative inequalities in the complex field; the exponential parameters in the designed controllers are independent. Finally, in order to fully support the theoretical results, based on two typical activation functions, the proposed theoretical results are numerically validated and compared.},

Transfer learning can address nonstationarity by sharing knowledge from one system to another, however, in areas like machine prognostics and defense, data are fundamentally limited. Therefore, transfer learning algorithms have little, if any, examples from which to learn. Herein, the authors suggest that these constraints on algorithmic learning can be addressed by systems engineering. We formally define transfer distance in general terms and demonstrate its use in empirically quantifying the transferability of models. We consider the use of transfer distance in the design of machine rebuild procedures to allow for transferable prognostic models. We also consider the use of transfer distance in predicting operational performance in computer vision. Practitioners can use the presented methodology to design and operate systems with consideration for the learning theoretic challenges faced by component learning systems.},

  abstract     = {Parameters, no matter whether they are uncontrollable uncertainty factors or controllable variables, have a great impact on the states and performances of continuous engineering systems. Acquiring an explicit expression of the complicated implicit function between these parameters and system states, called parametric problem in this article, will facilitate immediate analysis of parameters’ impact on the system, optimal parameter design, and uncertainty quantification. Polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) is a globally optimal polynomial approximation method for parametric problems, but it suffers from the curse of dimensionality, i.e., the number of basis functions and consequent computational burden increases rapidly with the number of parameters (i.e., dimensions). This article proposes a PCE method characterized by the arbitrarily sparse basis and novel generalized Smolyak sparse grid quadrature and, hence, effectively relieves the curse of dimensionality for high-dimensional problems. This basis is not restricted by any existing fixed-form truncation and can merely incorporate a few important basis functions. The novel generalized sparse grid can remarkably reduce the number of required collocation points compared with the prevailing classic sparse grid while achieving high accuracy. The proposed method is universal for parametric problems in engineering systems and is exemplified by parametric and probabilistic power flow problems of electrical power systems. Its effectiveness is validated by computational results on the IEEE 30-bus, 118-bus, and 500-parameter 9241pegase systems.},

  abstract     = {The unprecedented proliferation of smart home together with wireless sensor networks has enriched human’s daily life. Inevitably, the smart home without the guard of authentication mechanism is bound to bring a series of security issues. Hence, a great number of authentication protocols have been designed to verify the user’s identity and ensure that the data be accessed with authorization in smart home. Recently, (M. Shuai et al., 2019) (Computers &amp; Security, 2019) proposed a two-factor anonymous authentication scheme for smart home and presented that their scheme can be immune to various attacks. However, by careful analysis, we found that (M. Shuai et al.’s, 2019) scheme needed further improvements in session key forward secrecy and against: type-I node capture attack and node impersonation attack. As a going step to this direction, here, we first design a robust two-factor user authentication also for smart home based on the elliptic curve cryptography. Second, we give security proofs to demonstrate that the construction of the proposed scheme can be of user anonymity, session key forward secrecy, and resist all attacks shown in this article. Third, performance comparisons covered in storage/network communication/computation costs are carried out to indicate that our scheme can be comparable to those newly designed schemes, especially, the user and gateway in our scheme need only 352 and 320 bits, respectively.},

We aim to design 1-b spatial equalization matrix coefficients that minimize the postequalization mean squared error that leads to a nonconvex problem. Known solutions based on semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and forward–backward splitting (FBS) are proposed to solve the 1-b spatial equalization matrix design problem. The SDR-based algorithm can achieve excellent bit error rate (BER) performance. However, its high complexity limits its use in large-scale system configurations. The FBS-based algorithm contains several predetermined tuning parameters that are scenario-dependent and nontrivial to obtain. Moreover, the performance of the FBS-based algorithm still requires improvement. On the basis of these considerations, we propose two algorithms for solving the 1-b spatial equalization matrix design problem. The first algorithm reduces the performance gap between the unquantized linear minimum mean squared error equalizer and the 1-b SDR-assisted equalizer while maintaining a reasonable complexity; the second algorithm balances the tradeoff between complexity and performance. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms can achieve excellent BER performance compared with state-of-the-art methods.},

In this article, we study a joint subchannel and power allocation scheme in order to improve the energy efficiency of small cells with energy harvesting unit in NOMA HetNets. In the scheme, we propose a modified Gale–Shapley algorithm based on the interference hypergraph for subchannel allocation that can dynamically adjust the number of small cells on the same subchannel. Furthermore, we optimize the power allocation for small cell users by the Lagrangian dual method. Numerical simulation results are presented to demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves superior performance compared with the existing well-known methods and traditional orthogonal frequency-division multiple access system.},

Most of the existing hybrid precoding schemes involve iterative searching or alternating optimization, so their computational complexity is high and they do not take advantage of parallel computing to improve the real-time performance. In this article, considering the scenarios where the number of data streams equals to the number of RF chains, we propose a family of hybrid precoding schemes by leveraging the equivalent channel and singular value decomposition for a better tradeoff between spectral efficiency and computational complexity. Simulation results with different system settings show that our proposed schemes are superior to other existing schemes in terms of system spectral efficiency.},

First, a NOMA pairing and relay selection scheme is designed. Then, the closed-form expressions for the energy-information coverage probability (EICP) and the effective secrecy throughput of the near IoT devices are derived. Finally, the EICPs of the far IoT device under random relay selection and opportunistic relay selection schemes are obtained. Moreover, the asymptotic expressions of the EICP for both the near and far IoT devices are derived, which show that the asymptotic EICP when the number of antennas at the source or relay tends to infinity is only dependent on the location distribution of nodes and blockage environment. The simulation results show that NOMA can outperform orthogonal multiple access, and the advantage of the opportunistic relay selection scheme over the random relay selection scheme is more obvious when the density of the relay is relatively large.},

Therefore, we introduce an extended authentication scheme with robust anonymity for the Internet-of-Things-enabled multiserver infrastructure in the TMIS using a physically unclonable function. The informal security evaluation solicits that our proposed model effectively counters numerous security threats faced by modern TMIS-based protocols. The robustness of our protocol is examined formally using the random oracle model and Scyther verification tool. Further, to get true experimental results, we have separately executed all cryptographic operations for patient, physician server, and medical server.

The joint allocation of time–frequency blocks and power is optimized to maximize the transmission rate of the destination, while ensuring the transmission rate and energy supply of the relay. The time–frequency block pairing algorithm and the block power allocation algorithm are integrated to achieve the optimal solution.

The aggregate signature can reduce bandwidth and storage space in this sensor network by aggregating multiple signatures from different signers into a short signature.

In this article, we propose a new noninteractive identity-based aggregate signature protocol from lattices. We prove that the proposed protocol is secure in the quantum random oracle model. Additionally, the performance of the proposed protocol is much better than most previous protocols according to our experiment.

The previous ciphertext policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) schemes with the function of hidden policy are only suitable for a single authority, and the existing multiauthority CP-ABE schemes do not realize the hidden policy. In addition, a large number of schemes utilize AND gate access policies so that expressiveness is weak. In this article, a scheme of online/offline multiauthority CP-ABE supporting the policy hiding function is proposed. The proposed scheme uses a combination of multiple attribute authorities (AAs) and one central authority (CA). Each AA, respectively, controls different attribute sets and distributes attribute private keys to users. Moreover, the AA can also relieve the computation overhead of the CA. In order to enhance the expressiveness than that of the existing schemes, we adopt the access policy of the linear secret sharing scheme. In the previous schemes, the access policy is used as the ciphertext component and uploaded directly to the cloud server. Especially, in the scenario of medical cloud data sharing, access policy may contain sensitive information. Therefore, the proposed scheme preserves privacy information by realizing the technology of the hidden policy. To improve the performance, our scheme utilizes the online/offline encryption to achieve a low computation cost in the online phase. Additionally, we also proved that the proposed scheme is secure based on the standard model.},

More precisely, state transformations with the scaling function are devised to keep the involved velocity and attitude within their corresponding constraints. The fixed-time property is obtained in the sense of guaranteeing that the settling time is lower bounded by a positive constant, which is independent of initial states. The actuator faults as well as the network induced errors are handled via the bound estimation approach and well-defined smooth functions. By strict Lyapunov arguments, all closed-loop signals are proved to be semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded, and the tracking errors of velocity and attitude converge to the residual sets around origin within a fixed time.},

We analyze the tradeoffs when considering not only the energy spent on transmission but also the circuitry power consumption, thus making the analysis of much more practical interest. In addition to the well-known spectral efficiency improvements, results show that FD also outperforms HD in terms of reliability. We show that sER introduces not only benefits in EE matters but also some modifications on how to achieve maximum reliability fairness between uplink and downlink transmissions, which is the main goal in this article. In order to achieve this objective, we propose the use of a dynamic FD scheme where the small base station determines the optimal allocation of antennas for transmission and reception. We show the significant improvement gains of this strategy for the system outage probability when compared to the simple HD and FD schemes.},

Well-designed architecture is key to manage the SoS complexity, and thus plays a considerable role in the SoS development and evolution. Architecture selection that aims to identify the desired architectures from a large alternative design space is an initial but critical step toward successful architecture design. Decision-makers need scientific methods to identify those better, more informed but perhaps unexpected architecture solutions. However, the unique SoS characteristics such as interdependency and autonomy bring significant challenges to the architecture selection studies. This article identifies seven critical perspectives in SoS architecture selection, including the conceptual framework, evaluation criteria, interdependency, uncertainty, autonomy, dynamic evolution, and computational methods. The available methods, tools, and processes in the SoS and associated domains are reviewed thoroughly regarding each perspective. This review provides a comprehensive understanding of the current research status of SoS architecture selection. It builds a holistic picture that brings the fragmented pieces of the puzzle together. Towards the end, this article presents a series of research directions for future SoS architecture selection studies.},

  abstract     = {The optimal operation of a microgrid (MG) is a nonlinear multiconstraint problem. In addition to optimizing the output of different distributed generations (DGs) at the same time, the output of DGs at different times must be coordinated to achieve a balance between power supply and load demand. To solve the optimal operation problem of an MG, an optimal operation model to minimize user electricity cost and MG operation cost is proposed in this article. This model refines the load types and considers the scheduling elasticity of multiple types of home loads of end-users. It also quantifies the scheduling elasticity as the demand response based on the time-of-use price. Furthermore, to solve the problems of a complex solving process and long computation times for the MG optimal operation model, a global optimization algorithm based on a radial basis function (RBF) metamodel is proposed. The novelty of the proposed algorithm is that it adopts Latin hypercube sampling and an RBF to construct a metamodel. The constructed RBF metamodel is used to replace the proposed MG optimal operation model to estimate the function values, thereby avoiding calling the original complex objective function repeatedly. The proposed model and algorithm are tested on the modified IEEE 37-bus and 300-bus systems. The test results show that, the proposed model can effectively reduce the electricity cost of the end-users and enable the MG to obtain more electricity selling revenue. Meanwhile, the proposed algorithm can effectively reduce computational burden and time and has higher search efficiency of the global optimal solution and computational accuracy.},

This is a cluster-first, route-second type of method that includes an event-triggering algorithm to deal with the time-space model of vehicles and a specially designed cognitive module to decide the vehicle behaviors, which is represented by three kinds of preference in the behavior probability: the guidance, the memory, and the rules.

  abstract     = {To improve the security of industrial Internet of things (IIoT), several concrete constructions of certificate-based proxy signature (CBPS) scheme without bilinear pairing were proposed in the last few years. However, many previous constructions were found impractical, either fail to meet the claimed security properties or contain design flaws. In particular, in some instances, a malicious proxy signer can claim to be the original signer by forwarding the messages from original signer to any proxy signer, and the receiver cannot determine whether the delegation of signing power has been reused. In this article, we first demonstrate some security issues and design flaws in the previous proposals of CBPS scheme. As follows, to further address the above deficiencies, three new constructions of CBPS scheme with improved security are introduced. In the first two proposals, the delegation validity can be verified by the designated verifier (proxy signer), and the delegation of signing power for the last construct is publicly verifiable (any signer). Furthermore, formal security proofs are given using forking lemma in the random oracle, assuming that the discrete logarithm problem is hard. Compared with the previous CBPS schemes, our constructions are efficient with respect to computation and communication. Finally, we discuss the two necessary conditions for constructing secure CBPS schemes, to avoid security flaws in future research.},

The considered network consists of a hybrid access point and two groups of users, namely near and far users. A near user and a far user are selected to form a NOMA pair, which harvest energy during the downlink phase and transmit information during the uplink phase. Specifically, we consider two cases of energy-transfer time and analyze the corresponding performance. We first analyze the performance of the case with fixed energy-transfer time and derive the exact expression for the ergodic rate. Due to the doubly near-far effect, the far user experiences poor performance. To address this issue, an adaptive energy-transfer time scheme is designed by maximizing the far user’s data rate, and the optimal solution is derived. To reduce the system complexity, a suboptimal solution is proposed, and the ergodic rate&#39;s exact expression is derived. Simulation results reveal that the suboptimal solution achieves near-optimal performance and has a lower computational complexity. Moreover, a one-tier NOMA network is set to be a benchmark, and numerical results show that the two-tier system outperforms the one-tier system significantly under the appropriate radius setting.},

  abstract     = {Network slicing is a promising technology for providing customized logical and virtualized networks for the fifth-generation (5G) use-cases (enhanced mobile broadband, ultrareliable low-latency communications, and massive machine-type communications), which pose distinct quality of service (QoS) requirements. Admission control and resource allocation mechanisms are pivotal for realizing network slicing efficiently, but existing mechanisms focus on slicing the radio access network. This article proposes an approach encompassing intelligent and efficient mechanisms for admission control and resource allocation for network slicing in the 5G core network. The admission control mechanism introduces two solutions, one based on reinforcement learning (called SARA) and the other based on deep reinforcement learning (called DSARA). SARA and DSARA consider the QoS requirements of 5G use-cases, differentiate network core nodes from edge nodes, and process slice requests in time windows to favor the service provider’s profit and resource utilization. Results show that SARA and DSARA overcome existing mechanisms for managing admission control and resource allocation in 5G core network slicing.},

  abstract     = {Massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) has aroused extensive interest in communication industry, as it can effectively increase communication system capacity and reduce transmit power. For massive MIMO-orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems, traditional pilot assisted channel estimation methods need to obtain the channel response of data subcarriers by interpolation. However, when the channel response of continuous data subcarriers changes dramatically, the accuracy of channel estimation will be decreased. In this article, therefore, a novel channel prediction framework that integrates the imperfect channel estimation of the massive MIMO-OFDM into the deep neural network scheme is proposed, thus replacing the interpolation method and achieving higher accuracy of channel estimation. From algorithm analysis and simulation results, the performance of proposed deep neural network channel prediction method based on the imperfect channel estimation outperforms the conventional least square method based on interpolation. Furthermore, compared with minimum mean square error, there are no need for channel autocorrelation matrix, prior statistics of noise variance, and the complex matrix inversion operations. In summary, deep neural network is an efficient method for the imperfect channel estimation in massive MIMO-OFDM systems.},

Reducing congestion costs, increasing the penetration of renewable energy, and network stability are the most important benefits of this modification. The DLR forecasting is a significant issue and can be very useful in network management decisions for real-time and day-ahead. So far, however, very few studies have talked about the literature on day-ahead DLR forecasting. This article develops various DLR forecasting models based on historical meteorological data and machine learning techniques. Accordingly, multilayer perceptron, group method data handling, support vector regression, back-propagation neural network, extreme learning machine (ELM), and hierarchical ELM (H-ELM) techniques compete for short-term DLR forecasting of two 400 kV overhead transmission lines, installed in the Khaf and Ghadamgah regions in Iran. The meteorological parameters such as air temperature, wind speed, wind direction, and solar radiation in the studied areas are utilized as input variables for selected methods. Different evaluation indicators assessments the forecasting results of each technique. Finally, evaluations emphasize the effectiveness and capability of the H-ELM method with the lowest forecasting error values and the highest correlation coefficient value compared to other methods. Experiments exposed the DLR forecasting models&#39; generalizability at various points of the line without the extension of monitoring devices and communication infrastructures.},

First, by introducing a semi-Markov process, the model we investigated is more practical and stands for an extension of the Markov jump CDNs that have been widely studied. Second, an adaptive event-triggered sampling controller is newly proposed for semi-Markov jump CDNs, unlike the periodic event-triggered control scheme, the adaptive event-triggered sampling control strategy can further reduce the controller’s update frequency by adaptively adjusting its threshold. Moreover, with the help of a novel two-sided looped-functional and some advanced inequality techniques, the conservatism of the obtained result is greatly reduced. A sufficient synchronization condition that ensures the stochastic stability of the error system is established. Finally, to show the validity and superiority of the proposed method, several examples including some comparisons and applications are given in the simulation part.},

This article proposed a two-stage weather-driven risk-constrained robust unit commitment (WRRUC) model. Compared with the existing RUC works for IEHSs, two main contributions are made in our work: 1) a unified weather-driven uncertainty modeling method is proposed for the IEHS, which could decrease the conservativeness of the robust decision-making framework; 2) the uncertainty set boundaries are set as adaptive variables and the aftermath of unmodeled uncertainties is quantified by additional operational risk term in the objective function. The proposed WRRUC model is solved by the column-and-constraint generation algorithm. Compared with other off-the-shelf UC models, the summation of operational costs and risks of the test system is remarkably lower than the RUC case, verifying the effectiveness of the proposed weather-driven unified modeling of uncertainties and adaptive robust dispatch framework.},

  abstract     = {In the era of cloud computing, massive quantities of data are encrypted and uploaded to the cloud to realize a variety of applications and services while protecting user confidentiality. Accordingly, the formulation of methods for efficiently searching encrypted data has become a critical problem. Public-key encryption with keyword search is an efficient solution that allows the data owner to generate encrypted keywords for a given document while also allowing the data user to generate the corresponding trapdoor for searching. Huang and Li proposed a public-key authenticated encryption with keyword search (PAEKS) scheme to resist keyword guessing attacks, where the data owner not only encrypts keywords but also authenticates them. However, existing PAEKS-related schemes carry a tradeoff between efficiency, storage cost, and security. In this article, we introduce a novel framework called identity-certifying authority-aided identity-based searchable encryption, which has the advantage of reducing storage space while remaining the efficiency and security. We formally define the system model and desired security requirements to represent attacks in a real scenario. In addition, we propose a provably secure scheme based on the gap bilinear Diffie–Hellman assumption and experimentally evaluate our scheme in terms of its performance and theoretical features against its state-of-the-art counterparts.},

In a conventional charging system (CCS) with a competitive environment, the competition between charging stations can utilize game theory as a price competition game model. On contrary, charging stations with different ownerships under the VCS umbrella will cooperate to act as one charging station for EV drivers in order to increase customer satisfaction and obtain more profits collectively and individually. The proposed VCS consists of three parts—participating charging stations, EVs contracting with the VCS, and finally the VCS operator. The operator is responsible for optimally routing the EVs to a suitable charging station within the VCS. A new formulation for implementing this novel concept is presented to allow interaction between various VCSs to maximize the profit gained by each VCS as well as minimize the transit charging time and cost for each customer as a measure representing customer satisfaction. Different case studies are introduced to evaluate the significance of the VCS concept. The performance of the VCS is compared to CCS, and the results show that VCS provides superior customer satisfaction and higher profit.},

Considering various operation modes of actual ships, this paper proposes a hierarchical coordinated control, which includes primary control level (PCL) and power management system (PMS) for the coordinated operation of the power sources in dc-SMGs. The coordination between the PCL and the PMS provides the following features: First, the PCL includes primary speed regulation (PSR) of diesel generator (DG) and primary voltage control (PVC) of dc bus. The PVC can realize the dynamic/steady load power sharing by adding the virtual impedance loop, and the PSR of DG performs the rotation speed to follow the reference. Second, the PMS includes optimal speed reference setting and secondary voltage recovery control that can realize variable-speed operation of DG according to its optimal energy efficiency characteristic and improve the power quality.

Then, based on the obtained estimation results, the dynamic Lyapunov guidance vector field (DLGVF) is proposed, which can guide UAVs to converge to not only the expected standoff distance in the horizontal plane but also the desired height in the vertical plane. Moreover, the DLGVF renders the UAV trajectories flexible and shortens the convergence time by skillfully introducing adjustment parameters. Finally, to simultaneously complete the missions of target tracking and obstacle avoidance, an integrated method based on the DLGVF and the interfered fluid dynamical system is presented.

However, as disease diagnosis technologies usually use lots of clinical medical data, patients’ privacy becomes increasingly important since the clinical results of medical data are much sensitive. In this article, to deal with the privacy preservation issue of patient’s medical data, we propose a privacy-preserving disease diagnosis scheme that is based on the Mahalanobis distance test, in which the role of the system consisting of query user (QU), aided cloud server (ACS), and classification cloud server (CCS) is to jointly calculate and protect the diagnosis data over the sensitive and outsourced medical data. In the diagnosis model, we outsource the clinical diagnosis process to be dealt with by the CCS, and then, the ACS can reduce the computational cost of the user side. We utilize the homomorphic re-encryption scheme to realize a secure computation over the outsourced medical data, and then, employ a secure multiplication (SM) protocol to implement the privacy-preserving Mahalanobis distance to output the disease diagnosis. Concretely, we provide an extended SM algorithm to solve the problem of multiplication of two encrypted data, and a minimum value comparison algorithm over ciphertext for comparing the encrypted Mahalanobis distance. Finally, we give the experimental performance in real data sheets, and the experimental results indicate that our scheme provides a lower computational cost in practical diagnosis services.},

  abstract     = {This article proposes an environmental cognition method for execution on a graphics processing unit (GPU) oriented single-board computer (SBC). We develop a lightweight environmental cognition system for real-time mapping by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) by considering the weight of a cognition system as a tradeoff between the flight time and mapping efficiency and loss of environmental cognition capabilities. Heavy systems consume battery power rapidly while ensuring high computational performance and impacting flight envelope. The proposed method enhances real-time mapping speed by using GPU parallelism and minimizing the data transfer between the embedded central processing unit (CPU) and GPU. Specifically, the point cloud data (PCD) from the light detection and ranging are transformed into global coordinates and voxelized. The occupancies of the voxels are updated in a probabilistic manner to eliminate dynamic noise. The analysis of field tests confirms that the proposed method generated and updated the voxel map in real time without losses. In contrast, Octomap executed on a CPU- or GPU-oriented SBC generated and updated the voxel map in a limited manner, resulting in the significant loss of PCD due to the computational burden or heavy data transfer traffic from GPU to CPU. The proposed method contributes to develop a smart environmental cognition system for the autonomous flight of UAVs.},

An observer with a cascade structure is proposed in order to obtain (in a continuous way) the estimated free-delay state vector. The base of the cascade structure is a continuous-discrete observer that achieve the continuous estimation of the delayed state, which reduces the convergence time and allows to reduce the remaining subsystems in the cascade. The rest of the cascade structure is composed by predictors that compensate the delay induced by the original signal. The performance of the observer is evaluated by estimating the state of an uncertain chaotic system with delayed measurements by considering different scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Benefitingfrom the rapid development of communication technology and Internet of Things (IoT) devices, crowdsensing is on the rise. Sensor data from IoT devices can be requested for data analysis and utilization, however, the collected data of an object from multiple devices are usually different. Therefore, how to extract the most reliable data from numerous data has become an important topic, and truth discovery receives great attention. These collected data often contain personal sensitive information, if users’ privacy cannot be protected, many users are unwilling to contribute their data, and the usability of the published data will be greatly reduced. In this article, a robust privacy-preserving truth discovery scheme is proposed to simultaneously achieve the reliability and privacy of data. Specifically, the data are collected and encrypted before it is sent from the user. Compared with the existing works, there are two additional benefits, trusted third party and noncolluding platforms are not necessary anymore, hence the robustness is improved and single-point failure bottlenecks are eliminated. Besides, the proposed RPPTD is secure against many known attacks in open wireless networks, and the human-factor-aware differential aggregation attack. Finally, the performance evaluation indicates that our scheme is efficient and suitable for the practical environment.},

  abstract     = {In this article, by introducing nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scheme into the massive spatial modulation (SM) MIMO in cooperative relay networks, a massive cooperative NOMA-aided SM (NOMA-SM) system is presented. The ergodic rate performance of uplink massive cooperative NOMA-SM with finite alphabet inputs is investigated over Rayleigh fading channels. According to the performance analysis, the mutual information between the SM signals transmitted by users and the signal received at the base station (BS) is derived. Based on this, the theoretical lower bound and tight approximation of the ergodic rates are deduced for performance evaluation. With the aforementioned results, simple expressions of the ergodic rates are derived for the system with single-antenna relay, which can simplify the calculation of theoretical ergodic rate. Besides, when the number of receive antennas at the BS is very large, the asymptotic ergodic rate analysis is presented for massive cooperative NOMA-SM system, and the corresponding asymptotic lower bounds of the ergodic rate are derived. Simulation results indicate that the presented theoretical analysis is valid and can match the corresponding simulation well. Thus, the ergodic rate performance can be well assessed in theory.},

  abstract     = {In real-world scenarios, in order to encourage one to report others crimes, judicial department usually rents independent cloud storage spaces to receive the precious evidences from whistleblowers. Since the uploaded data are not controlled by cloud users, remote data integrity is very important. Public cloud auditing enables an auditor to periodically check the integrity of outsourcing data on behalf of users, without retrieving the entire data file. However, most existing data auditing schemes have potential security vulnerabilities, and thus cannot defense many security attacks (e.g., the man-in-the-middle attack). Meanwhile, it is significant to protect whistleblower’s identity privacy, reward the real data uploader, and further trace the responsibility of slanders accurately. From the aforementioned requirements, we present an efficient blockchain-assisted conditional anonymity privacy-preserving public auditing (BA-CAPPPA) scheme with reward mechanism. The Ethereum blockchain is integrated into BA-CAPPPA to enhance the security level of the whole public auditing mechanism. Theoretical analysis results show that the BA-CAPPPA achieves man-in-the-middle attack resistance, storage correctness guarantee, data privacy-preservation, conditional identity anonymity, and reward mechanism. Performance evaluations and comparisons demonstrate that BA-CAPPPA could outperform some state-of-the-art data auditing schemes.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates the relationships between the pole-to-pole fault current and the topology in the bipolar voltage sourced converter (VSC)–high-voltage dc (HVdc) grid. Based on the improved high-frequency equivalent model, it is found that the pole-to-pole fault current value is significantly influenced by the grid topologies, which is different from the situation in symmetrical monopole dc grid. It is also found that only the adjacent converters and the subadjacent converters of the fault lines will impact the fault currents, while the other converters with longer electrical distances basically have negligible contribution to the fault current. According to above mechanism, the simplified index is also proposed in this article to evaluate the fault current level of dc grid efficiently when its topology varies. The proposed index can make evaluations by simple calculations between different topologies and avoid solving complex differential equations one by one when pole-to-pole fault occurs at different lines. Based on the practical evaluation index, the genetic algorithm is used to optimize the dc grid topology to limit the fault current level. Finally, the simulation verification is performed based on the six-terminal bipolar VSC–HVdc grids, and some suggestions on topology design are given.},

First, in order to maximize system throughput and user access rate by using many-to-many resource sharing to improve spectrum utilization. Second, considering imperfect channel state information, we propose a subcell division strategy based on location information, with the set partitioning algorithm to model intracell users as multiple many-to-many resource sharing sets satisfy the constraints. Finally, the problems of interference accumulation and low computational efficiency, a distributed power optimization algorithm based on quadratic transform is devised, which solves the multiratio fractional planning problem through the three steps of convex relaxation, fractional programming and alternating optimization. Experimental results show that the system throughput and D2D user access rate can be significantly enhanced with the proposed resource sharing framework and resource management scheme, especially in systems with a dense D2D deployment.},

In this article, a transactive framework is proposed for a distribution network in which transactive agents participate in a local market and submit their bids to local TEM for day-ahead planning. However, due to complexity of the market and effects of a multitude of factors in the market outcome, deriving the optimal bid is not a trivial task. In order to learn the optimal bidding strategy in such a complex system with incomplete information, soft actor-critic method is utilized. Two scenarios are analyzed and compared. The first scenario assumes only one agent uses the learning method, while in the second scenario a number of residents form a coalition with a representative learning agent. Then, allocation of power assigned to the whole coalition between its residents is discussed. Comprehensive simulations are conducted for the 37-bus IEEE distribution system in two different scenarios to compare nonlearner agents with learner agents in both scenarios.},

To cope with the problem, researchers resort to the in-network computation model in which the computation capability is distributed among nodes in IIoT. Existing works on the in-network computation assume that the network connectivity built in advance meets the performance requirement of the in-network computation model. Nevertheless, no node placement methods have been proposed to build network connectivity supporting in-network computation. For this reason, we propose an in-network-computation-oriented node placement (INP) algorithm. The INP algorithm first decomposes the whole problem into several delay constrained relay node placement problems, and then, solves them sequentially. Moreover, we prove that the INP algorithm ensures explicit time complexity and approximation ratio. Finally, we verify the efficiency of this work through extensive simulations and preliminary experiments.},

Compared with the existing results on consensus of multiagent systems under cyber attacks, the agents’ dynamics in this article are described by higher order heterogeneous switched nonlinear systems. The cyber attacks, actuator faults, asynchronous switchings, and the high complexity of the system make the existing consensus algorithms ineffective. A novel control scheme for the output consensus of the multiagent system subject to cyber attacks is proposed.

  abstract     = {With the rapid growth of fifth-generation (5G), network operators have met with difficulties in ensuring user satisfaction due to diverse service-level agreement (SLA) requirements. Application-aware routing is able to potentially address this issue in implementing differentiated routing policies corresponding to various applications. To facilitate the application-aware routing, software-defined networking (SDN) and segment routing (SR) are potential solutions with programmability property to steer network traffic into appropriate routing paths. However, application-aware SR encounters two main problems, including application identification for encrypted traffic and path identification with human intervention. Therefore, this article proposes a new SDN-based SR mechanism that could help network operators overcome these problems. This approach implements reinforcement learning to adapt to dynamic networks in order to optimize the quality of experience (QoE) that network operators must guarantee. The proposal also considers the application class to implement corresponding routing policies for various applications to meet the stringent SLA requirements. Identifying the applications is sometimes complicated due to encrypted network traffic. Hence, our proposal implements a traffic classification approach to classify encrypted traffic into different kinds of applications. Obtained results under considered conditions illustrate that our proposal outperforms the standard SR mechanism related to QoE and decreases up to 64.39\% of overhead compared to several benchmarks.},

  abstract     = {The computing and storage resources of an edge node in a mobile edge computing (MEC) system are limited. One edge computing node cannot cache all the services supported by the entire MEC system. A service chain caching and scheduling strategy should be designed to improve the service processing capacities of the edge computing nodes under high computing load conditions. This article combines the open Markov queuing network for the first time to model the process of edge node analysis and processing of computationally intensive tasks as a mixed integer nonlinear programming problem. Moreover, a mathematical model for the service chains is established. We analyze the average service response time during task execution to optimize the performance of service chain caching and scheduling. Experiments show that the outer approximation (OA) algorithm obtains better results than MindtPy and Multistart. The average response time obtained by the OA algorithm is 2.2\% and 6.9\% lower than those obtained by the MindtPy and Multistart algorithms, respectively. The OA algorithm using this mathematical model can effectively reduce the average service response time and improve the resource utilization of the edge server.},

Putting a limit on the power drawn by each of the transcoding processors in a server reduces the overall power consumption, but it also hinders the efficient allocation of transcoding tasks. We address this with a dynamic programming algorithm, together with a heuristic, which maximizes total processing capacity while limiting power consumption in a server with heterogeneous processors. A further greedy algorithm determines the bitrates, at which content is transcoded for each channel, and allocates transcoding tasks to processors, while taking video quality, popularity, and workload balance into account. The initial assumption is that all contents are transcoded to all bitrates for every channel. Then, the algorithm gradually reduces the number of versions to be produced by transcoding, while minimizing the consequent reduction in popularity-weighted video quality, as well as balancing the workload across processors. Experimental results show that our scheme improves aggregate popularity-weighted video quality under a power constraint by 3.82\%–39.12\%, compared to benchmark methods.},

  abstract     = {The repercussion of increased electric vehicle (EV) charging demand is notable at the distribution grid especially during the cold morning, while users tend to precondition their vehicles before leaving their premises. Moreover, due to the price declination, a tendency of installing level 2 chargers in residential premises is anticipated, which should stimulate the appearance of a new peak to the residential load profile. Hence, multiple scenarios of preconditioning are simulated, and the corresponding network’s quality metrics (e.g., voltage level and power losses) are assessed to analyze the impact. And a remarkable consequence is observed. As a consequence, to mitigate the consequences and manage the new peak load, the optimal reconfiguration of network is implemented, and unfortunately, with a larger number of EVs, this technique fails to attain the minimum voltage level. Therefore, leveraging this high number of EVs, instead of relying on the network reconfiguration, power is assumed to be injected from idle EVs through vehicle-to-grid (V2G) energy transmission. An integer linear program is formed to schedule a set of EVs in participating in V2G, and the outcome indicates that V2G alone could not compensate for the disturbance in the network. Accordingly, a hybrid method of V2G and reconfiguration is proposed and evaluated to assist the network in handling the new peak load, and this hybrid solution reduces power losses in the network by 50\% on average and maintains the voltage level above the operational threshold of 0.95 p.u.},

Then, these measurements are applied to the proposed procedure to calculate the feature set utilizing fault-on and prefault information and predict TSS by a decision tree classifier. Since the feature set does not include any postfault (i.e., after short-circuit clearance) data, the proposed method has the capability of fast prediction of postdisturbance TSS, and hence, it provides more opportunity for system operators and/or special protection systems to implement timely corrective actions to prevent instability. Also, the results of the time-domain analysis carried out in IEEE14-bus, IEEE39-bus, 16-Machine (68-bus), and IEEE118-bus test systems and comparison of them with previous techniques reveal that although the proposed method requires fewer PMUs, it can forecast TSS accurately under N-1 and N-2 conditions. Besides, these results confirm that, considering the measurement error, when the rotor angle of SGs is estimated using the data measured by WAMS, the proposed method accurately predicts TSS.},

The strategy also incorporates rooftop photovoltaics (PVs) in reducing the power consumption of the building. In this article, the randomness of PV output is handled using scenario modeling under a rolling time-horizon framework, where feedback regarding EV mobility is also utilized in real time. In addition, the degradation of EV batteries is limited by controlling the charging/discharging cycles required for peak reduction. To provide incentives for contributing to peak reduction, a cooperative game is presented, wherein the EVs are conceptualized to work in a coalition with the building’s energy management system. The payoffs in the game are decided based on the power extraction of EVs from the building combined with degradation costs incurred by individual EVs. The results demonstrate up to 40\% reduction in demand peaks and 25\% reduction in energy costs using the proposed energy management methods.},

To protect distribution grids from these FDIs, the first step is to model cyberattacks that can cause overvoltages. An accurate nonlinear optimization model is developed for stealthy FDI cyberattacks that can result in overvoltages on targeted nodes in distribution grids without being detected by bad data detection algorithms. Compared to the existing research, which mainly focused on dc state estimation for transmission systems, the proposed model formulates cyberattacks that cause overvoltages using ac state estimation in distribution grids. The proposed nonlinear model is then approximated to a convex optimization model using second-order cone programming relaxation formulation to guarantee that a global optimum exists for the model. Several case studies are considered to validate the effectiveness of the proposed attack model. It is shown that by limiting the FDIs on targeted buses to 20\% of their nominal load, multiple buses can experience severe overvoltages in a distribution grid.},

  abstract     = {With the development of mobile computing, map matching algorithms are utilized to recover vehicles’ traveling routes. Existing map matching algorithms usually infer the traveling routes based on a driving cost model that considers various traveling features and driving preferences (referred to as weights). In general, the weights are estimated either empirically or through data-driven approaches. For empirical setting, the weights are determined based on field studies and must be reestimated when the driving scenarios are changed. Alternatively, in data-driven approaches, the weights are determined from the analysis of historical routes of vehicles. However, estimation bias may be introduced due to the selection of data sources. To decrease the estimation bias, this article proposes a distribution-based weights estimation method. Specifically, the weights are estimated by inferring their distributions through Bayesian inference based on the driver traces collected in a city scale. Next, a sampling-based strategy is adopted to determine the weights values from their distributions. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves a higher map matching accuracy than the existing approaches, and it is applicable for both linear and nonlinear driving cost models used in map matching algorithms. Moreover, the estimated weights can help to understand driver preferences in different traveling cases.},

  abstract     = {A generational shift has led to the evolution of distributed generation (DG) and microgrids. The loads connected in a microgrid can be both linear and nonlinear. Nonlinear loads deteriorate the power quality by drawing harmonic currents. Drawing of nonlinear currents will make the voltage waveform nonsinusoidal, which may prove harmful for other loads connected to the system. Previously, passive and active filters were used to mitigate harmonics, but they are expensive and bulky. The state of the art is to exploit multifunctional capabilities of inverter-interfaced DGs to deal with the power quality issues. This article presents the typical sources of generation of the harmonics, their deleterious effects, available standards, and detection techniques. Harmonic mitigation strategies for both grid-connected and islanded microgrids have been discussed in detail. The aim is to review and categorize the various strategies adopted by authors in recent times to mitigate harmonics and bring out the research gaps so that further avenues can be explored in this area.},

  abstract     = {Although cloud computing is one of the promising technologies for online business services, how to schedule real-time cloud jobs with high quality of service (QoS) is still challenging current techniques. With the advancing of machine learning, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has demonstrated its outstanding capability in dispatching time-sensitive tasks. However, the reinforced rewards in DRL are typically unavailable until the completion of the scheduling for all the jobs. Considering the fact that the trajectory of jobs in cloud is always long, current DRL-based solutions will meet challenges in finding the trajectories with high rewards, and thus would have issues such that the finally trained scheduling policy is suboptimal. To improve the problem, in this article, we propose a more advanced approach called a deep adversarial imitation reinforcement learning (AIRL) framework for scheduling time-sensitive cloud jobs. Specifically, we focus on scheduling user requests in a way to maximize job successful rate along with a significant reduction on job response time. We present the detailed design of our method, and our experimental results demonstrate that AIRL can generally outperform the existing cloud job scheduling approaches, including the DRL-based method, in the presence of different real-time workload and computing resource configurations.},

  abstract     = {This article presents a programmable multiple frequencies clock generator with a process and temperature compensation circuit design. The proposed clock generator can achieve a stable and wide frequency range output for a single input frequency by using digital control codes as well as process and temperature compensation mechanisms. In our approach, the first step is to adjust the duty-cycle of the input clock by using a digitally controlled pulsewidth modulator (DCPWM) to generate an output clock signal with a duty-cycle of 20\% to 80\%. Second, the various duty-cycle clock outputs of the DCPWM are integrated by the duty-cycle-to-voltage converter to generate analog voltage signals to control the succeeding voltage-controlled ring oscillator (VCO). Through the use of various control voltages, different VCO output frequencies are generated. Finally, by using the process and temperature compensation circuit, the proposed clock generator can provide a stable and wide frequency range. The proposed chip is fabricated in a 180-nm CMOS process and has an output frequency range of 35–138 MHz at a supply voltage of 0.9 V. At 120 MHz, the power dissipation and rms jitter are 224.3 μW and 7.84 ps, respectively. The active area of the chip is 0.62 mm × 0.76 mm.},

The management of the network in microgrids (MGs) allows the implementation of effective and innovative management strategies. We propose a hybrid control strategy to maintain voltage levels within the operational limits using the RESs reactive and active power outputs. The proposed regulation strategy considers different MGs that are managed by different owners, who contribute to regulating the voltage on the distribution systems. In order to obtain an effective regulation, each MG can collaborate with the others. In the first instance, voltage is regulated inside MG using available distributed generation resources in correspondence of the bus of over/undervoltage is detected (stage 1). Next, more MGs can contribute to alleviating the problem involving other distributed generation resources (stage 2). The control method is based on sensitivity analysis, which allows selecting the appropriate distributed resources: we propose also a new method of calculating the sensitivity coefficients for radial and meshed networks. We demonstrate the effectiveness and the robustness of the proposed voltage control scheme using comparisons and representative studies by extensive simulations on two test networks performed by the proposed methodology. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the control actions and the used algorithm.},

However, using separately the route planning and resource optimization method cannot take full advantage of the airborne platform. Considering this issue, we propose a joint online route planning and resource optimization strategy in the ARS to improve the system capability for MTT. First, a kinematic model of the ARS, including the mathematical expression between the radar states and the system control parameters, is introduced, which integrates the route planning to the radar scheduling scheme. Next, the posterior Cramér–Rao lower bound about route planning and resource optimization variables for the tracking targets is derived. Then, a scaled-based utility function is established to quantify the MTT performance. Hereafter, a nonconvex problem is formulated by minimizing the utility function with route and resource constraints, and then a efficient three-stage partition-based solution is proposed. Finally, simulation experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Furthermore, over the traditional benchmark algorithm, the tracking performance of the proposed approach improves 30.44\%.},

  abstract     = {Advanced metering infrastructure targets the real-time collection of massive multisource data with smart meters (SMs), forming a key component of active distribution networks (ADNs). To achieve comprehensive situation awareness for ADNs, the use of high-speed and reliable two-way communications, such as 5G communications, is the basis. However, it is challenging to optimally allocate wireless resources for massive data, especially when emergency events occur randomly. This study discusses an energy-efficient and optimal wireless resource allocation method employing 5G uplink-based machine-type communications for achieving ADN situation awareness. We propose a 5G-based framework that can reasonably reserve resource blocks for emergency data and model the resource allocation scheme as a problem of maximizing energy efficiency (EE). Then, by using the sample average approximation theory, we transform the stochastic constraint and summarize the scheme as a mixed-integer linear programming problem. Finally, we construct an iterative algorithm based on the Lagrange dual algorithm for searching the global optimal allocation scheme. The results of simulations and experiments illustrate that even if emergency events occur randomly, our algorithm can optimally support the cooperative transmission of all sampled data while providing the best EE for large-scale SM communications.},

We model individual discovery periods as a slotted random access protocol with half-duplex user equipment (UE). We outline a simulation framework using the open-source network simulator 3 (ns-3) and evaluate the discovery process’s performance as a function of the size of the resource pool, UE density, and the transmission probability. We establish that there exists an optimal transmission probability that minimizes discovery time for a given network configuration. However, because a UE cannot know the number of neighbors when it goes off-network, we develop a method to allow UEs to learn the optimal transmission probability during discovery. We compare our algorithm’s performance to the 3rd Generation Partnership Project standards prescribed method and others to demonstrate its superiority.},

  abstract     = {Power systems are undergoing significant transformations due to the introduction of microgrids (MGs) and distributed energy resources (DERs). In this regard, MGs as new entities in the system facilitate the integration of independently operated DERs to the power system. In this structure, DERs would be operated by independent agents, while the microgrid&#39;s control unit (MCU) would coordinate agents’ resource scheduling to maximize social welfare. In this structure, the uncertainty of resources operated by agents could lead to real-time energy imbalance in the MG resulting in agents’ loss of profits. Consequently, a novel transactive-based-scheme is developed in this article to facilitate flexibility service exchange between the agents to minimize the real-time energy imbalance in the MG. In this context, MCU provides independent agents with bonuses as transactive signals to exploit their operational scheduling while addressing privacy concerns. The proposed framework increases the overall social welfare as well as minimizes the dependence of the MG on the upper-level system to ensure the demand–supply balance in the MG. Finally, this scheme is implemented on an MG with a multiagent structure to investigate its effectiveness in minimizing the real-time energy imbalance in the system.},

This short article presents a novel continuous permutation method for wind power correlation analysis. With the novel eigen-permutation, the proposed method is applicable to tackle the correlation analysis even the correlation matrix of random variables is not positive definite. A continuous permutation is then proposed to reduce the permutation deviation and, hence, to reduce the error of steady-state related calculations. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed method in dealing with the nonpositive definite correlation matrix of the wind speeds. Also, compared to the traditional methods, the proposed method achieves more than an 80\% reduction of the general error in the correlation analysis, which also contributes to higher accuracy in the power flow calculation.},

To meet the reliability requirement specified by the smart grid communication standard, we propose a linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control on the wireless link to ensure its reliability. First, a state-space model of wireless links is constructed based on a path loss model, in which the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SNIR) is chosen as the state of the system. Then, an improved Kalman filter and a linear quadratic regulator control are adopted to estimate the state and obtain the optimal transmitting power, respectively. In addition, the confidence interval of the SNIR is estimated to compensate for the filtered random factors on the SNIR. Finally, to evaluate the proposed LQG controller, we compare it with state-of-the-art methods through simulation and verify its effectiveness in a real-world UHV substation.},

To handle this challenge, this article proposes an anonymous authentication protocol with delegation and revocation for CDNs depending on the proxy resignature (PRS) cryptography. Specifically, we first present an efficient revocable PRS (R-PRS) scheme, which is proved to be secure under the extended Computational Diffie-Hellman assumption. Then, based on R-PRS scheme, the proposed protocol enables the origin server to delegate and revoke the authentication capability to the CDN nodes without leaking its private key. Furthermore, our protocol not only provides anonymity, mutual authentication, and session key establishment, but also achieves forward security. Eventually, theoretical analysis and implementation demonstrate that the proposed protocol has an excellent performance in efficiency and practicality.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we propose a three-dimensional (3-D) joint angle and delay estimation approach for massive multiple-input and multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems on the basis of the channel state information of a single base station, which is equipped with multiple antennas. By modeling the propagation channel by a finite number of multipath rays, we present a joint azimuth-angle, elevation-angle, and path delay estimation algorithm, in which a new version of subcarrier smoothing is developed for full-rank correlation matrix construction. The new algorithm offers closed-form parameter estimates and is applicable to arbitrary array configurations. The Cramér–Rao bound for the considered problem is derived as well. Simulation results with a typical outdoor millimeter-wave setup are finally presented to verify the efficacy of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {This article studies the secondary users’ sum-throughput in an in-band full-duplex (I-FD) cognitive wireless powered backscatter communication network. The secondary network consists of a hybrid access point (H-AP) and a finite number of geographically distributed secondary backscatter sensors (SBSs), each capable of using either the conventional or backscatter communication. The secondary network shares the primary network’s spectrum using an underlay spectrum sharing model. In this model, the H-AP and SBSs operate in I-FD mode to achieve improved spectral and time efficiency. Moreover, when an SBS has little available energy, it switches to the low-energy consumption backscatter method instead of the conventional transmission method. The goal is to maximize the sum-throughput of the SBSs. It is shown that such a problem is a convex optimization problem. Closed-form expressions for the optimal allocated time and energy to SBSs are derived and solved via a low complexity and efficient algorithm called joint optimal time and energy allocation (JOTEA). Numerical results illustrate that the JOTEA algorithm achieves a higher sum-throughput than the benchmark equal time allocation method. Furthermore, if the self-interference cancellation circuit considerably cancels self-interference in the H-AP, the I-FD mode achieves a higher sum-throughput performance than that of the half-duplex mode. Moreover, using backscatter communication results in a further increase in the sum-throughput.},

  abstract     = {In this article, a novel Markov pinning strategy, where each mode corresponds to a specific pinning strategy and the switches from one specific pinning strategy to another are governed by the transition probability matrix, is proposed for synchronization control problem of coupled delayed neural networks. With consideration that topological structures of networks are usually time-dependent, a general polytopic time-varying coupling model is studied. In coupled delayed neural networks, each node frequently exchanges information with its neighboring nodes so as to realize synchronization. Since communization network is with limited transmission resource, network congestion may occur, and thus information of neighboring nodes may not be available. Furthermore, as the amount of information that needs to be transmitted will change with the number of pinned nodes, packet dropout rate is considered to be random switching. By Lyapunov function method, a sufficient condition is obtained to globally synchronize the coupled delayed neural networks, and then the Markov pinning controller is designed. Finally, an illustrative example, where all nodes synchronize quickly under the control of Markov pinning controller, is used to demonstrate the advantages and potential of the new design strategy.},

Two algorithms are developed that determine fault indices and transient features for simulation-based training, classification, and backup protection purposes. The proposed data-driven approach is effective under high penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs), and is robust under microgrid topology variations. Moreover, it requires few sensors (two for radial structure) and is easy to implement, yet provides high degree of reliability.

In this article, CFs in power grids are theoretically modeled proposing a Markov decision process (MDP) framework with the aim of developing optimal load-shedding (LS) policies to mitigate CFs. The embedded Markov chain of the MDP, established earlier to capture the dynamics of CFs, features a reduced state-space and state-dependent transition probabilities. We introduce appropriate actions affecting the dynamics of CFs and associated costs. Optimal LS policies are computed that minimize the expected cumulative cost associated with CFs. Numerical simulations on the IEEE 118 and IEEE 300 bus systems show that the actions derived by the MDP result in minimum total cost of CFs, compared to fixed and random policies. Moreover, the optimality of derived policies is validated by a CF simulation based on dc power flow for the IEEE 118 bus system. Therefore, such actions developed by the proposed theoretical MDP framework can serve as a baseline for devising optimal LS strategies to mitigate CFs in power grids.},

In this article, we design an energy-efficient amplify-and-forward relay-assisted PLC, where outage probability based on energy-efficiency is minimized by jointly optimizing the relay location and power allocation (PA) in two scenarios: 1) absence and 2) presence of the end-to-end direct link. To reduce complexity, using a novel and nontrivial approach, we obtain a closed-form expression of the outage probabilities for both the scenarios. Further, an equivalent problem is formulated to make the optimization problem more tractable to obtain its solution. In the absence of direct link, a closed-form solution of the problem is obtained by the optimization schemes where underlying variables are optimized individually and jointly. While, in the presence of the direct link, a closed-form solution is obtained using a nontrivial tight approximation algorithm. Via numerical results, the outage expressions are validated, and various insights on optimization of PA and relay location are obtained. Finally, with respect to energy-efficiency, it is shown that the joint optimization gives an outage improvement of around 55\% and 37\% in the absence and presence of the direct link, respectively.},

Earthquake signal detection and phase-picking, as the core of aftershocks monitoring system, is time-sensitive. Generally, the data generated by seismic stations are transmitted to the cloud for integration, storage, and processing through the network, contributing to network congestion and affecting the real time of earthquake warning as well as the supported applications. Edge computing, a new paradigm for real-time IoT tasks, has emerged as a trend to address concerns of response time, requirement, saving bandwidth costs, as well as data safety and privacy. Therefore, a neglected problem was tackled in this article. First, to meet the real-time requirement, we proposed a novel lightweight deep learning model called lightweight context-aware attention networks for earthquake signal detection and phase-picking. We optimized the deep learning model and reduced the computation requirements to deal with edge devices that have lower computation power than cloud servers. Second, we deployed the model to the Jetson Nano, a small edge device, to offload computation tasks from cloud servers to edge devices. In this way, seismic stations do not need to send raw data to a centralized server. Third, experiments show that our method is robust and easily generalized to other databases. The entire model is only 3.7 MB and achieves the accuracy-latency trade-off.},

Most of them considered that all sensors were equally important and aimed to maximize the number of recharged sensors. The purpose of energy recharging is to extend the lifetime of sensors whose major work is to maximize the surveillance quality. In a randomly deployed wireless rechargeable sensor network, the surveillance quality highly depends on the contributions of coverage and network connectivity of each sensor. Instead of considering maximizing the number of recharged sensors, this article further takes into consideration the contributions of coverage and network connectivity of each sensor when making the decision of recharging schedule, aiming to maximize the surveillance quality and improve the number of data collected from sensors to the sink node. This article proposes an energy recharging mechanism, called an energy recharging mechanism for maximizing the surveillance quality of a given WRSNs (ERSQ), which partitions the monitoring region into several equal-sized grids and considers the important factors, including coverage contribution, network connectivity contribution, the remaining energy as well as the path length cost of each grid, aiming to maximize surveillance quality for a given wireless sensor network. Performance studies reveal that the proposed ERSQ outperforms existing recharging mechanisms in terms of the coverage, the number of working sensors as well as the effectiveness index of working sensors.},

A dispatchable region refers to the set that consists of all admissible patterns of nodal renewable power injections under which the power flow is solvable without violating security bound constraints. This article studies the dispatchable region in distribution networks under alternating current power flow model. A rank minimization problem is proposed to test power flow solvability under a fixed nodal power injection pattern, providing basic operation to construct the exact dispatchable region. A sequential low-order semidefinite programming procedure is developed to solve the problem. Furthermore, based on a global outer approximation of the second-order conic relaxation of the distflow model, a linear programming-based polyhedral projection algorithm is developed to calculate an outer approximation of the dispatchable region. The projection algorithm is also applied to the traditional linearized distflow model. Combining the feasibility test procedure, it is shown that the intersection of the respective dispatchable regions obtained from two linearized power flow models produces a fairly accurate approximation for the true dispatchable region under the exact nonlinear distflow model.

This article proposes a multiobjective network-constrained framework for the day-ahead scheduling of hydrogen systems (HS), including hydrogen production from water electrolysis by electrolyzers, hydrogen storage, stationary fuel cells, and fueling of fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs). This framework includes various physical constraints to ensure reliable operation and considers integrated demand response and conservation voltage reduction, and reactive power support from HSs for realistic day-ahead scheduling. It also incorporates the cooperative operation of PV units and HSs to supply power for water electrolysis from stationary HSs equipped with onsite PVs. Moreover, conditional value-at-risk is applied to address the risk of PV output, FCEVs’ H2 demand, loads, and market price.

To this end, in this article, we consider the problem of joint waveform control and space-time resource management for maneuvering targets tracking in NCMRS. First, the joint waveform type as well as parameter selection and space-time resource management optimization model is proposed, where both the network system resource consumption and the overall tracking performance of maneuvering targets are considered and employed as the network comprehensive cost. Then, to solve the established optimization problem efficiently, a modified particle swarm optimization (MPSO)-based joint waveform control and space-time resource optimization (JWCSTRO) algorithm is put forward. In the MPSO-based JWCSTRO algorithm, the system sampling period, the activated nodes, the node-target assignment, and the subarray number, transmit energy and transmit waveform type, as well as parameter of each activated node can be adjusted jointly and adaptively, where the former five implement the space-time resource optimization and the last one achieves the waveform control in NCMRS. Finally, numerical simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MPSO-based JWCSTRO algorithm. Furthermore, compared with the five other benchmark algorithms, the maximum and minimum improvement ratios of the network comprehensive cost of the proposed MPSO-based JWCSTRO algorithm are 44.89\% and 21.68\%, respectively.},

  abstract     = {In this article, a two-hop simultaneous wireless information and power transfer relay network using a decode-and-forward strategy is considered. In order to improve the spectral efficiency, the relay node performs in full-duplex (FD) mode, and each node is equipped with multiple antennas. First, the end-to-end achievable rate is formulated for FD and half-duplex (HD) modes under imperfect channel state information (ICSI). Then, the optimal closed-form expressions for power allocation at the source and relay, as well as the energy harvesting ratios, are derived for primal variables associated with the dual variables through analytical solutions. We propose an iterative primal-dual algorithm based on the ellipsoid method so as to obtain final answers. Numerical results demonstrate the FD achievable rate superiority over the HD mode under proper self-interference cancellation (SIC). According to the existing results, there is an immense discrepancy between the achievable rates in perfect CSI and ICSI cases. Also, the impact of the relay distance from the source node, the number of antennas, and different SIC modes are investigated on the end-to-end achievable rate.},

The resilience model considers the invulnerability and recoverability of the microgrid and represents the power balance of the microgrid, energy storage, and maintenance policies. The cost model adapts the levelized cost of energy measure to the context of island microgrids. We conduct experiments to investigate two microgrid architecture decisions of how much excess generation capacity and redundancy to provide. The experiments show that redundancy of generative sources provides greater resilience for similar cost, and resilience improves quickly as excess power capacity is added while the cost grows more slowly. Case studies for island microgrids show how a redesign of the microgrid can improve resilience without increasing costs. The article contributes to the literature a model for decisions makers to evaluate the tradeoffs between resilience and cost for island microgrids that must depend on their own distributed energy resources.},

  abstract     = {The integration of smart infrastructures that facilitate two-way communication via information and communication technology (ICT) has enhanced the efficiency and sustainability of the power network. However, technologies, such as dynamic thermal rating (DTR) systems and system integrity protection schemes (SIPS), have disadvantages, including infrastructure failures, cyber–physical interdependencies, and cyber intrusions. These disadvantages contribute to the reduced reliability of the network. Comprehensive exploration of the reliability impacts of multiple smart grid technologies on a single power network has not been conducted. A DTR and SIPS system integrating wide area monitoring functions using phasor measurement units (PMUs) is presented in this study, and the effect of ICT contingencies on network reliability is investigated. A Monte Carlo simulation approach and a scenario reduction technique are utilized in this article. This approach is evaluated on the IEEE-RTS to demonstrate the advantages of ICTs. The approach is suitable for different network topologies, in which the difference lies in the number of required PMUs. Results demonstrate that a reliable SIPS can minimize the aging process while slightly influencing load curtailment despite the increase in overall network aging due to DTR. PMU functional failures result in load loss due to loss of observability despite their high availability.},

We analyze the average bit error rates (ABERs) for our proposed IM-MH scheme with perfect channel state information (CSI) and imperfect CSI, respectively. We also propose the index-modulation embedded double-serial MH (IM-DSMH) scheme, which randomly activates one OAM mode as the serial second hop to transmit the hopping signals in the IM-MH scheme, to further decrease the ABER of wireless communications. Extensive numerical results demonstrate that our proposed schemes within a narrowband can achieve the low ABER and significantly increase the SE. Also, the ABERs of our proposed IM-MH and IM-DSMH schemes are around 25\% and 10\%, respectively, compared with that of the mode hopping scheme.},

This article incorporates the resilience-oriented line priority index to periodically prioritize the power lines based on their specifications and conditions, and by doing so, this improves the efficiency of the assessment. A multiobjective mixed-integer linear programming model is developed to dynamically determine the drone’s optimal routing and speed in order to assure that the drone gathers sufficient data while completing the assessment mission in the shortest period of time. Since the proposed optimization algorithm needs to be solved multiple times for different sections of the power network, we propose a set of solution algorithms to reduce the computational burden and allow the proposed algorithm to reach the optimal solution quickly.

When spectrum sensing is performed in radar bands, sliding-window-based detection can be used to exploit the sparsity of the radar pulse signal in the time domain and obtain a sufficient number of samples. The detection performance and sensing time depend on the configuration of the windows. The detection performance was optimized when the window size was equal to the pulsewidth. However, the pulsewidth is generally unknown. Another way to increase the detection performance is to obtain more samples of the window. However, this causes large computation overhead owing to the sparsity of radar signals. Therefore, we propose an adaptive-sliding-window-based detection scheme to address these problems. First, the window is adaptively applied. Second, a pulsewidth estimation algorithm is proposed to approximate the window size to the pulsewidth for each detection. Additionally, we demonstrate the performance improvement of the proposed scheme and evaluate the estimation error of the proposed algorithm via simulations.},

This yields a fault detection scheme with fault identification, fault pole discrimination, and high-resistance tolerance abilities. Extensive simulations confirm that the proposed detection scheme can identify the metallic short circuit fault within 1 ms, with the ability to promptly detect faults with high resistance in less than 3 ms taking the communication delay into consideration. This method does not cause any mal-operation of dc circuit breakers as a result of faults on adjacent lines and power order changes. The proposed scheme has immunity to noise and provides full-length protection of the protected transmission line. Simulation results show significant suppression of both the amplitude and the rate-of-rise of the fault current during the fault detection process, which enhance the reliability and stability of the protected grid.},

Next, the time intervals related to stable and unstable dynamics are distinguished.

We explore joint user pairing and resource allocation to maximize fair throughput in a downlink scenario. In each pair, the user with a stronger channel (strong user) acts as a relay for the other one (weak user), and optimal power and blocklength are allocated to achieve max–min throughput. To this end, first, only one pair is considered, and optimal resource allocation is explored. Also, a suboptimal algorithm is suggested, which converges to a near-optimal solution. Finally, the problem is extended to a general scenario, and a suboptimal C-NOMA-based user pairing is proposed. Numerical results show that the proposed C-NOMA scheme in both SC and MRC strategies significantly improves the users’ fair throughput compared to the NOMA and orthogonal multiple access (OMA). It is also investigated that the proposed pairing scheme based on C-NOMA outperforms the hybrid NOMA/OMA scheme from the average throughput perspective, while the fairness index degrades slightly.},

  abstract     = {As one of the key components of intelligent transportation systems, the Internet of Vehicles enables vehicles to acquire and exchange essential information with each other and other facilities. As an infrastructure that directly connects the vehicles to the Internet, the roadside unit (RSU) is responsible for collecting information generated by the vehicle and transmitting it to the control center for analysis. However, ever-increasing number of vehicles and sensors will lead to a large amount of data. Furthermore, there exists redundancy in the data collected within a data collection period by vehicles. Both of these can severely reduce the efficiency of data storage and upload. In this article, we consider that each RSU installs a mobile edge computing server and present delta encoding correction for saving data cache space and transmission time. First, we propose a new cost model and an evaluation method for delta encoding of COPY/ADD class. Then, the type of delta encoding and the corresponding merging rules are defined. Based on these rules, we proposed a minimum delta encoding cost (MDC) algorithm, which adopts the idea of divide and conquer to obtain a superior correcting sequence of delta encoding. Theoretical analysis proves that the proposed MDC algorithm can generate the encoding sequence with the smallest total cost without affecting information reconstruction. In addition, we conduct experiments based on the randomly produced synthetic dataset. Experiment results show that, compared with the Greedy, One-Pass, and 1.5-Pass algorithms, the delta encoding output by the MDC algorithm has better performance in saving cache costs.},

Compared to most of the available strategies that employ local estimation and/or compensation algorithms, this approach performs a global impairments estimation and compensation based on nonlinear least squares. The proposed method estimates and compensates for the chromatic dispersion (CD), carrier frequency offset (CFO), in-phase/quadrature (IQ) imbalance, and laser phase noise in two steps. First, it estimates the quasi-static parameters related to the CD, CFO, and both transmitter and receiver IQ imbalance. Second, it estimates both transmitter and receiver lasers’ phases and compensates for all the imperfections by using a zero-forcing equalizer. Simulations show the effectiveness of the approach in terms of statistical performance and computational time. The estimation performance is assessed by computing the Cramér–Rao lower bound, while the detection performance is compared to a modified clairvoyant equalizer.},

To maximize utilization, various machine and deep learning models have been developed to study data. While data-driven applications improve countless products, hyperparameter tuning for the models is still a time-consuming and resource-intensive process. Cloud computing provides infrastructure support for the training of deep learning applications. The cloud service providers create an isolated virtual environment for clients who share physical resources, e.g., CPU and memory. On the cloud, resource management schemes are implemented to enable better sharing among users and boost system-wide performance. However, general scheduling approaches, such as spread priority and balanced resource schedulers, do not work well with deep learning workloads. In this article, we propose SpeCon, a novel container scheduler optimized for short-lived deep learning applications. Based on virtualized containers, such as Kubernetes and Docker, SpeCon analyzes the typical characteristics of training processes. We design a suite of algorithms to monitor the training’s progress and speculatively migrate the slow-growing models to release resources for fast-growing ones. Specifically, the extensive experiments demonstrate that SpeCon improves an individual job’s completion time by up to 41.5\%, 14.8\% system-wide, and 24.7\% in terms of makespan.},

In addition, a novel data-driven authentication and secure communication protocol is proposed to mitigate the risk of fraud and identity theft.

  abstract     = {The nonlinear distortions attributed by radio frequency power amplifiers (PAs) are inevitable in millimeter-wave (mmWave) systems due to the high frequency and large bandwidth. This nonlinearity induces multiplicative distortion and intercarrier interference in mmWave multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing systems, which in collusion with a frequency-selective channel and a carrier frequency offset (CFO) brings great challenges to signal detection. Furthermore, the nonlinearity destroys orthogonality of the training pilots and degrades the estimation accuracy of the channel gains and the CFO. Also, the target posterior distribution for data detection becomes analytically intractable due to the nonlinearity. In this article, we present an importance-sampling-based framework for estimating the CFO in the presence of PA impairment, which utilizes few pilots and initializes the channel estimator. We propose a particle-filter-based iterative algorithm for data detection, where the intractable posterior distribution is approximated by weighted random measures. Furthermore, a sequential-maximum-likelihood-based semiblind channel estimator in the presence of nonlinearity is proposed. Performances of the estimator and the detector are evaluated by means of normalized mean square error, mean square error, and bit error rate. To validate the efficacy of the channel and the CFO estimator, the Cramer–Rao bound (CRB) and the weighted Bayesian CRB are derived, respectively.},

New techniques to improve the electrical power system, including the distribution system, are thus needed. One such technique is dynamic distribution system reconfiguration (DNSR), which involves altering the network topology during operation, providing significant benefits regarding the increased integration of DRES. This paper lays out an improved model which aimed to optimize the system operation in a coordinated way, where DRES, energy storage systems (ESS) and DNSR are considered as well as the uncertainty of these resources. The objective function was modeled to incentivize the uptake of DRES by considering the cost of emissions to incentivize the decarbonization of the power system. Also, the switching costs were modeled to consider not only the switching, but also the cost of degradation of these mechanisms in the system operation. Two systems are used to validate the model, the IEEE 119-bus system, and a real system in São Miguel Island. The results of this paper show that using DNSR, DRES, and ESS can lead to a significant 59\% reduction in energy demand through a 24-hour period. In addition, using these technologies results in a healthier, more efficient, and higher quality system. This shows the benefits of using a variety of smart grid technologies in a coordinated manner.},

Existing blockchain-based solutions are generally not of industrial strength, where limitations include scalability and lack of engagement by participating clients. In this article, blockchain-in-the-loop FL is our proposed approach of intertwining classic FL and Hyperledger Fabric with a gamification component. Our proposed approach is a fusion of secure application integrated to seal and sign-off asynchronous and synchronous collaborative tasks of FL. The enterprise-level blockchain network provides an immutable ledger that can be leveraged at different FL layers to ensure auditable tracing and level-up security in industrial settings. We evaluate our proposed approach with three different datasets to demonstrate the security enhancements that improve the FL process, resulting in a more accurate global ML model to converge with the possible best performance.},

Specifically, we proposed a potential FDI attack model against ICSs of wind farms considering the power distribution of wind farms. Based on the characteristics of the proposed attack model, a profit-oriented attack strategy is discussed as a composition of attack detection. Considering the characteristics of the compromised data and those of normal data, we develop countermeasures to detect the POFDI attack, through the relationship between the characteristics of WTs in wind farms.

Our main novel contribution is to link these two elements (namely, coordination and deformation). In particular, the core idea of our approach is that the robots’ motions minimize a global measure of the deformation of their positions relative to a prescribed shape. Based on this idea, we propose a linear shape controller that also incorporates a term modeling an affine deformation. We show that the affine term is particularly useful when the deformation to be controlled is large. We also propose controls for the other variables (centroid, rotation, and size) that define the geometric configuration of the team. Importantly, these additional controls are completely decoupled from the shape control. The overall approach is simple and robust, and it creates closely coordinated robot motions. Being based on deformation, it is useful in several scenarios involving manipulation tasks, e.g., handling of a highly deformable object, control of an object’s shape, or regulation of the shape formed by the fingertips of a robotic hand. We present simulation and experimental results to validate the proposed approach.},

For this challenge, we proposed an iterative optimization approach in previous work, in which all robots as a whole obtain the optimal goal pattern, and then, move to the goal without collision to form the pattern. However, this approach results in high consumption in terms of time and the path that robots travel as the number of robots increases. To improve efficiency, we propose a grouping-based optimization method. First, a specific grouping strategy (the number of groups and the number of data points in each group are fixed) is utilized to group the multiple robots. And then in an obstacle environment, each group of robots completes its optimal pattern formation in parallel without collision through coordination within and between groups. The simulation results of the multiletter pattern formation validate the effectiveness of the method proposed in this article compared to the method without grouping.},

  abstract     = {How to plan the collision-free path effectively is crucial for autonomous ground vehicles to avoid collisions. The vehicle may lose its lateral dynamic stability due to high speed, time-varying speed and multifriction road during tracking the collision-free path. In this article, an advanced collision avoidance framework is proposed to avoid collision efficiently with road friction estimation and dynamic stability control. First, an improved A* algorithm is constructed to generate a desired trajectory for collision avoidance, which is capable of observing road regulations and overcoming the vehicle mechanical drawbacks. Next, a model predictive control-based path-tracking controller is established to solve the tracking task as a multiconstraint and multitarget optimization problem, where optimized steering angle and additional yaw moment can be calculated. Meanwhile, a novel long short-term memory based road friction coefficient estimator is built to observe road friction. Moreover, electric power steering system controls the steering motor to realize the desired steering angle. The additional yaw moment can be obtained by differential braking. Finally, hardware-in-the-loop platform tests are conducted to validate that the proposed controller can not only avoid collisions effectively, but also have a good performance on keeping the vehicle dynamic stability with accurate road friction estimation.},

In the proposed self-triggered policy, continuous measurement error monitoring and neighbors’ event listening are avoided, thereby further saving system sensor resources. Furthermore, under a unified framework, the controllers’ inherent nonlinearities and the influence of data quantization in digital communication networks are studied. In comparison with the previous event-triggered sampling schemes, the developed policies do not only study the multiagent coordinated control in terms of system sampling performance and state convergence performance but are also suitable for the scenarios with controller output fluctuations.

  abstract     = {This article proposes deep learning (DL) framework constructed using deep autoencoder (DAE) to detect the malicious nodes in an Internet of Things (IoT) network assisted by the cognitive radio (CR) technology. In the IoT era, a plethora of nodes are connected to the network for the purpose of collecting and exchanging data. CR technology finds its role in IoT applications because of its ability to efficiently exploit the available spectrum. In this article, we consider IoT nodes as secondary users that perform cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS). Specifically, these IoT nodes sense the spectrum and send their reports to the fusion center (FC) to determine whether the spectrum is occupied by the primary user or not. In such a scenario, the existence of malicious IoT nodes might mislead the FC. To determine which of these IoT nodes are benevolent and which are malicious is crucial. We adopt a DAE-based DL framework, called DAE-TRUST, to detect malicious nodes in CR-assisted IoT. The proposed DAE-TRUST is able to identify the malicious nodes, whose reports can be excluded from the spectrum detection process. Simulation results, in six different real-world environments, show that our DAE-TRUST enhances the performance of CSS in IoT applications.},

This enables us to censor less informative training data with high accuracy and thereby the training costs of the MLP, RNN, and SVM are reduced without a considerably adverse effect on their prediction performances in testing processes.

However, the auditing result will be invalid if the data have been modified dynamically in the process of data anonymization when sharing data to others with sensitive information. In existing solutions, a data sanitizer is needed to anonymize the data and transform the signature. However, such data sanitizers introduce new security risks, and the static anonymous strategy is not flexible to different application scenarios. Therefore, we propose a new scheme based on redactable signature. In our proposed scheme, the cloud server can transform the signature directly without the additional sanitizer while sharing sensitive data. The signature transformation does not influence the integrity checking of the stored data. The signature not only can be used to authenticate the source of sharing data, but can also be used to check the integrity of the stored data in the cloud. Both the security proof and experimental analysis show that our proposed scheme is secure and more efficient than the existing schemes.},

The proposed energy management process leverages the benefits of simultaneous deployment of online direct load control (DLC) and conservation voltage reduction (CVR) for decreasing peak energy demand. Initially the proposed problem is designed as a time-coupled stochastic mixed integer nonconvex programming (MINCP) to accommodate long-term offline beneficial aspects in real-time optimization framework, which is later simplified using merger of Queueing theory and Lyapunov optimization. A successive mixed integer linear programming (s-MILP) solution approach is proposed for accurate and fast convergence of the revised MINCP framework. The efficacy of the developed strategy is evaluated after comparing with two-benchmark energy management models (viz. offline and online greedy algorithm) by demonstrating on modified IEEE 69-bus test system. Further scalability of the proposed approach is validated by testing on large distribution networks.},

Leveraging on the distributed conjugate beamforming receiver and the generalized additive quantization noise model, we first derive a closed-form expression for the achievable sum spectral efficiency (SE). The resultant expression enables us to precisely quantify the effects of key parameters, such as the transmit power of access points (APs), the numbers of groups, users’ antennas, APs’ antennas, and quantization bits. Due to the joint influence of channel hardening property, multiantenna gain, and intergroup interference, the research becomes sophisticated particularly. The result shows that when the sum-SE is small, the multicast is better than the unicast and vice versa. Typically, it reveals that the full-resolution DAC can be replaced by 5-bit low-resolution DAC to achieve the same performance, and the additional antenna at users can effectively enhance the system performance. Then, according to a generated energy cost model, the formula of the energy efficiency (EE) is obtained. When the DAC quantization is equal to 2-bit, it can achieve the maximum sum EE. Finally, the simulation results are provided to verify the derived results.},

In this regard, this article proposes mixed-integer quadratic programming formulations to determine the topology of distribution network and estimate distribution system states simultaneously using micro-phasor measurement units and smart meter data. Two approaches based on ac optimal power flow are proposed and analyzed: polar power-voltage (PPV) formulation and rectangular current-voltage (RIV) formulation. The proposed models can identify multiple simultaneous switching actions and different topology configurations including radial and meshed networks. Only measurement data at each time interval are needed to identify the topology and states of the system correctly. The proposed models are tested on a modified IEEE-33 bus system with realistic load data from the Pecan Street Inc. database and a real distribution feeder of an electric utility. The results confirm that both models can identify system topology and states with remarkable accuracy in real-time, whereas the RIV model outperforms the PPV model.

The day-ahead dynamic price is coupled with active distribution network constraints to prevent the formation of new peaks. To tackle up the complexities of unbalanced network and distributed generation (DG) integration, the merits of symmetrical domain components are utilized.

The article uses traffic data from the M42 and M6 motorways in the U.K. to investigate the probability of coexistence of other vehicles in the adjacent lanes, which induce interference and act as potential reflectors. The results show that the probability of coexistence of other vehicles in the adjacent lanes is lane-independent and it increases during the rush hours to 90\%, while it decays to less than 10\% during the off-peak and early morning hours. The intervehicular distance and the BER performance vary widely between different lanes and different periods of the day. The results also show that the BER performance of V2V-VLC system with non-line-of-sight (NLOS) component and with LOS component are comparable at rush hours. However, high BER values are predicted during the off-peak hours for NLOS components of the channel.},

  abstract     = {Future smart grids represent interdependent cyber-physical systems that involve multiple interactions between a power grid and a communication network. Such a mutual dependence increases the risk of large-scale cascading failures. Thus, it is important to conduct a joint vulnerability analysis. Unfortunately, existing works failed to identify the combination of power nodes and communication nodes that present the greatest damage impact. In this article, we first present a model that captures the interdependence between the two subsystems using stochastic geometry; then, we conduct a joint vulnerability analysis. We propose an attack strategy that targets the most influential nodes in both subsystems. We show that, based on six joint targeted nodes, this strategy presents a comparable and, in some cases, larger damage impact compared to the traditional exhaustive search attack and with very low complexity. Our investigations reveal that 1) the proposed joint attack strategy presents a large damage impact at a significantly small simulation runtime and 2) attacking the most influential communication nodes solely or the most influential power nodes solely achieves a comparable damage impact to that of the proposed joint attack.},

Meanwhile, by using the backstepping technique and Lyapunov stability theory, a distributed adaptive fuzzy controller is proposed to guarantee that all the consensus-tracking errors between followers and leader converge to an adjustable neighborhood of the origin in the presence of the sensor and actuator failures, unmodeled dynamics, and disturbance.

Moreover, the unprecedented scale and heterogeneity of Internet of Things (IoT) devices make these schemes inapplicable to IoT networks. Therefore, to rectify these issues, this article presents a secure patching framework for IoT with different network isolation levels to efficiently mitigate and control malware propagation. It uses remote attestation to detect compromised devices with a high probability and identify the origin of malicious activities. It also proposes virtual patching of devices via physical unclonable functions (PUFs) to contain the malware spread. The isolation levels are based on the susceptible, exposed, infected, and resistant (SEIR) model that act as an access control list to quantify device operation and mitigate D2D malware spread. We present a security analysis based on the access control logic model. A performance evaluation with a comparative analysis is also discussed using the SEIR model. These analyses confirm the reduction in patching time and superior performance of our framework, i.e., with 10\% of initially infected devices, IoT-Proctor had a reduction rate of malware five times faster than the existing techniques.},

In addition, existing approaches that support range search over encrypted datasets have limitations associated with efficiency, accuracy, and security. Seeking to address these limitations, we formally propose the definition of the forward privacy for secure range searches. Also, we demonstrate how three widely used cryptographic tools— order-preserving encryption (OPE), pseudorandom function, and one-time pad–can be leveraged to design an efficient, accurate, and forward secure (EAFS) searchable encryption scheme supporting range search in encrypted numerical databases. In the proposed EAFS scheme, a trapdoor only matches the last data record that satisfies the search range, and the other results are found iteratively using the previous result. The chain-like search and the embedded ciphertexts of OPE simultaneously guarantee its efficiency, forward privacy, and accuracy. We also use the simulation-based method to demonstrate that our scheme is secure. Then, we implement EAFS in Microsoft Azure and evaluate its performance. The evaluation findings demonstrate that our proposed scheme supports secure range search practically and efficiently.},

Nevertheless, how to effectively allocate resources in network slicing based CF-mMIMO networks is still a challenging problem to be tackled. In this article, we present a novel resource allocation scheme for network slicing based multi-tenant CF-mMIMO networks to maximize the infrastructure operator’s revenue while maintaining the quality of network services. Specifically, the resource allocation scheme is first formulated as an optimization problem, which is NP-hard and nonconvex. Then, the problem is decomposed into two subproblems. For the first subproblem, we propose a joint user clustering and power control coefficient allocation algorithm, which not only maintains fairness among users but also improves the access rate of CF-mMIMO networks. For the second subproblem, the interior-point method is adopted. In our article, extensive simulations are carried out to prove the effectiveness of the proposed resource allocation scheme. Our experimental results indicate that the proposed scheme leads to a lower outage probability and a higher infrastructure provider’s revenue than existing approaches.},

  abstract     = {Multiple-input–multiple-output (MIMO) is a key technology used to meet the requirements of 5G systems. In millimeter-wave (mmWave) bands, directional beamforming is applied at both the transmitter and the receiver to establish an efficient radio link. The mmWave bands specified in 5G specifications range from 24.25 to 40.0 GHz. Accordingly, different countries may allocate different bands to support 5G services because of the availability of the spectrum and the countries’ radio management policies. For international roaming, user equipment (UE) must support multiband operations based on a fixed antenna hardware structure that is designed to target a specific operating band. Hence, the frequency discrepancy that results from using different operating bands causes distortion in the achieved beamforming pattern. In this article, we investigate the impact of frequency discrepancy on beamforming performance in mmWave phased array antenna systems at the UE side, considering the resultant beam pattern and interference. In this effort, we studied three major side effects—deviation of the beamforming direction, change in the effective array length, and change in the normalized interelement spacing. The numerical results indicate that a large frequency discrepancy causes severe distortion in the resultant beamforming pattern and introduces more interference into the system.},

Developing and analysis of a joint IBFD radar-communication (RadCom) system is at the core of this article. This system derives the range-Doppler image from the state of an adaptive filter, which already exists in a typical IBFD transceiver. Our approach is waveform-independent and reuses the radio frequency (RF) front-end while it requires little additional digital logic. The proposed system is prototyped to assess the modem-radar coexistence in a real-world IBFD communication link budget. Employing the prototyped system, we quantify the additional required logic resources and investigate whether such a RadCom approach dictates a tradeoff between the two intended functionalities. The experimental results show that the proposed solution enables a communication system to detect targets within 20 m while maintaining an IBFD link with another communication node.},

  abstract     = {An iteration-variable-correction (IVC) based method is proposed for solving optimal power flow (OPF) of transmission-distribution-coupled (TDC) systems. First, a TDC system can be divided into a single coordinator and multiple agents. Then, the basic formulation, subproblem construction, and selection of iteration variables are given based on the conventional heterogeneous decomposition algorithm (HGD). Considering the limitations of the conventional HGD, the IVC is proposed. According to the general theory of the IVC, when it is applied to solve TDC OPF, the voltage magnitude of boundary buses and the multipliers corresponding to boundary power injections will be corrected every four iterations with first-order and second-order differential operations on historical results in the previous four iterations. The quadratic convergence of the IVC is proved under several weak assumptions. The numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed IVC has the same accuracy as the method based on the centralized OPF model. Also, better convergence and efficiency can be achieved under the IVC compared with some conventional decomposition methods, including alternating direction method of multipliers, auxiliary problem principle method, analytical target cascading method, and the HGD.},

  abstract     = {Most of the existing research focuses on electricity theft cyberattacks in the consumption domain. On the contrary, a high penetration level of distributed generators (DGs) may result in increased electricity theft cyberattacks in the distributed generation domain, which is the focus of this article. In these attacks, malicious customers can hack into the smart meters monitoring their DG units, which are usually photovoltaic, and manipulate their readings to report higher injected energy to the grid and claim more profit under feed-in tariff programs. This article proposes a data-driven approach based on machine learning to detect such thefts. We adopt an anomaly detection approach where a theft detection unit (TDU) based on a regression tree model is designed to detect suspicious data. Historical records of solar irradiance, temperature, and smart meter readings are utilized in the training stage of the detector. The probability density function of the error between the actual readings from DG meters and the predicted generation by the regression model is utilized as a metric to detect suspicious data. Several theft scenarios are used to assess the performance of the TDU. Furthermore, a comparison study with other detectors is presented to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed TDU.},

With the ability to rapidly access rugged areas, aerial monitoring by drones is fast becoming a viable tool for ecologists to monitor wild animals. Unfortunately, this approach results in significant disturbance to different species of wild animals. Inspired by motion camouflage, this article explores a navigation method for a drone to covertly observe a group of animals and their habitat. Unlike existing motion-camouflage navigation approaches that deceive a single target, we introduce a sliding-mode-based method that reactively navigates the drone to induce less optical flow on multiple targets’ visual system. The proposed method is computationally simple and suitable for a drone to closely observe a group of moving animals with reduced visual disturbance. Computer simulations are conducted to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Reverse auction-based incentive mechanisms have been widely adopted to stimulate mobile workers to participate in mobile crowdsensing (MCS), where workers need to provide location information for winner selection. However, most existing mechanisms rely on trusted platforms. The worker’s location data uploaded to platforms thus can be easily exposed. Recent works start to incorporate location privacy in designing incentive mechanisms, but they have not considered the task’s location privacy and the worker’s location privacy simultaneously. Therefore, we propose a bilateral location privacy-preserving mechanism for MCS on untrusted platforms. In our model, each worker adopts differential privacy to obfuscate his location locally and then submits the obfuscated location together with the bid information. Besides, instead of the exact location, the task requester is only required to upload the task profile and the task’s obfuscated location. Then, we propose the lowest-cost winner selection mechanism which aims to minimize the social cost of winner selection under the location constraint while ensuring task quality requirements, and adopt the critical payment determination mechanism to determine the payments for the winners, which satisfies truthfulness, individual rationality, and computational efficiency. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on real-world datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed mechanisms.},

In this context, taking into consideration the spatial channel correlation at the APs, this article investigates the performance of cell-free massive MIMO systems with variable-resolution quantization, i.e., each analog-to-digital converter at the APs and quantizer at the CPU use arbitrary bits for quantization. Specifically, we first introduce a technique based on linear minimum mean-square to perform channel estimation. On this basis, we then derive the closed-form expressions of achievable rates over spatially correlated Rayleigh fading channels for both uplink and downlink if maximal ratio combining and maximal ratio transmission are used at the CPU. Finally, simulation results validate our theoretical analyses and corroborate that the performance of channel estimation and achievable rates reduces as the spatial correlation strengthens. Moreover, from a statistic perspective, under the constraint of the total number of quantization bits, it is preferable to assign more bits to the AP with larger aggregated large-scale fading coefficient and lower channel correlation.},

In this work, an attempt is made to efficiently schedule both the grid-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-grid operational modes of EVs with the objective of reducing power loss in the distribution system in presence of distributed generation (DG). The EVs are modeled by considering the dominating factors, such as EV State of Charge (SoC), trip conditions, EV battery capacity, charging/discharging levels. An improvement to the existing grasshopper optimization technique is also suggested in this article, which enhances the exploring capability of the metaheuristic algorithm. The presented methodology is a combination of smart charging method, voltage stability index, and enhanced grasshopper optimization algorithm (EGOA), which decides the size of DGs to be placed in the system. The proposed hybrid approach tries to schedule both the EVs and DGs so as to achieve reduced power loss and improved voltage profile. In order to test the robustness of the proposed strategy, various analyses considering uncertainty in EVs and load conditions are performed.},

The first criterion is based on the ratio of both end incremental phase current phasors, and the second one uses the magnitude ratio of positive sequence incremental currents. Both the criteria are adaptive to line terminal currents and complement each other enriching the method applicable for any system condition.

In this article, an optimization approach is proposed to determine the optimal locations and sizes of photovoltaic and wind generation systems in microgrids with PEV-parking lots. The developed approach addresses 1) the uncertainty of generation profiles of photovoltaic and wind generation systems and loads; 2) the DSTATCOM feature of photovoltaic and wind generation systems; and 3) microgrid constraints. The feasible PEV conditions are also considered, i.e., initial and preset conditions of their state of charge, arriving and departing times, and various controlled/uncontrolled charging schemes. To solve the planning model, we have developed a bilevel metaheuristic-based approach. The upper-level and lower-level optimization tasks are to optimize the decision variables of renewable energy sources and PEVs, respectively. Both energy losses through the lines and energy from the main grid are considered as subobjectives to be minimized. Various simulations and study cases are performed to assess the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The outcomes show the efficacy of the proposed approach to simultaneously plan renewable energy sources and manage PEVs to form an autonomous microgrid.},

Therefore, these two modules are separated in our article and executed successively in different coordinate systems. Specifically, we create a decision topology for lane changing or following decision based on spatio-temporal lane-change gaps in relative moving coordinate, which consists of the node representing the gap and the edges representing the connectivity between two gaps. Combining the decision topology with the behaviors of surrounding dynamic vehicles, a local cost map is generated and the target decision gap is selected. Once the decision is done, a smooth and safe trajectory from the ego-vehicle to the target decision gap, that satisfies the constraints of acceleration and curvature, is obtained in the geodetic coordinate through polynomial trajectory generation. The real-time performance and effectiveness of this method were verified in the dynamic high-speed interaction scenarios.},

This article proposes a novel A-TVC, which follows the VD conditions and, consequently, improves the LVRT capability of the DFIG-based WF. In this approach, a lookup table is presented to control the transient voltage based on the short-circuit capacity at the point of common coupling (PCC), VD index on the grid, and generated power limitations of the DFIG. By applying the proposed control strategy, the DFIG could not only smooth the dc-link voltage fluctuations and reduce the stator and rotor overcurrents in a faulty grid but also increase the PCC and stator voltages and, thus, enhance the transient voltage stability. Simulations and control-hardware-in-the-loop experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy for improving the LVRT capability of the DFIG in severe balanced and unbalanced VD conditions.},

With the growing trend of extreme weather events in the Caribbean region, evaluating hazard effects of wind storms on power distribution systems becomes increasingly important for disaster preparedness and fast responses in utilities. These catastrophic events disable critical paths of electricity overhead infrastructure, resulting in extended power outages and loss of critical services. In this article, probabilistic wind storm models for the study region have been built by mining the 169-year storm events recorded in the Hurricane Database from the National Hurricane Center of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. In addition, a simulation approach is presented to evaluate the impacts of wind storms over the power distribution system under different levels of hazards using a random storm trajectory generator and geographic information system data. Extensive studies for the Puerto Rico’s electrical distribution system indicate that our models and procedure effectively estimate the number of affected customers and load loss due to a wind storm impact.},

This study develops a method for generating synthetic interdependent critical infrastructure networks (SICIN) using simulation and nonlinear optimization techniques. SICIN consists of three components: 1) determining the location of facilities in individual networks via a modified simulated annealing algorithm; 2) generating interdependent links based on a novel pseudo-tripartite graph algorithm, and 3) simulating network flow using nonlinear optimization considering the operations of individual networks and their interdependencies. Two existing systems of interdependent infrastructure networks are used to validate the proposed method. The results demonstrate that SICIN outperforms state-of-the-art simulation methods according to multiple topological and flow measures of similarity between the simulated and real networks. The outcomes of this research include 1) a sample of a simulated system of interdependent networks that can serve as a test case for infrastructure models and 2) a generalized algorithm that can be used to generate synthetic interdependent infrastructures given partial data of any real network.},

  abstract     = {Enabling machine-to-machine (M2M) communications on cellular networks will provide a promising future for smart cities and the Internet of Things. M2M systems involve a huge number of connected devices that may synchronously be activated to react to some event. This massive synchronous access causes intensive congestion and collisions in the random access channel (RACH), which is used as a first step to access network resources. In this article, we introduce a dynamic tree-splitting (DTS) algorithm to resolve RACH collisions for delay-sensitive devices during burst arrival scenarios. The DTS algorithm assigns a specific number of preambles to the collided devices for their next access attempt. The number of preambles is determined based on the mean number of collisions in each random access opportunity, with the aim of increasing the utilization of preambles. A mathematical analysis of the proposed algorithm is presented as well as the derivations of throughput and access delay. The analysis and simulation results show that DTS reduced access delay and increased RACH throughput by approximately 12\%, compared to recent benchmarks, with a mean of three preamble transmissions and a success rate above 0.98, which indicates the efficiency and reliability of the proposed algorithm.},

The inefficient VM placement (VMP) and sharing of common physical machines among multiple users leads to resource wastage, excessive power consumption, increased intercommunication cost, and security breaches. To address the aforementioned challenges, a novel secure and multiobjective VMP (SM-VMP) framework is proposed with an efficient VM migration. The proposed framework ensures an energy-efficient distribution of physical resources among VMs, which emphasizes secure and timely execution of user application by reducing intercommunication delay. The VMP is carried out by applying the proposed Whale Optimization Genetic Algorithm (WOGA), inspired by whale evolutionary optimization and nondominated sorting based genetic algorithms. The performance evaluation for static and dynamic VMP and comparison with recent state of the arts observed a notable reduction in shared servers, intercommunication cost, power consumption, and execution time up to 28.81\%, 25.7\%, 35.9\%, and 82.21\%, respectively with increased resource utilization up to 30.21\%.},

In this article, a superimposed-pilot-based channel estimation scheme is proposed for multicell multiuser MIMO uplink systems. In this scheme, the pilot sequences and data sequences are superimposed, but the space generated by the pilot sequences and the space spanned by data sequences are separated far enough in order to reduce interference. Based on this scheme, the minimum mean-square error channel estimation is deduced, and the optimal power allocation between the pilots and the data signals is derived to maximize throughput. These results show that our proposed scheme can overcome the pilot contamination and achieve better performance than the traditional time-multiplexing scheme with mutually orthogonal pilot sequences for different users when the coherent time slot is limited.},

First, we use optimization-based-iterative techniques such as exhaustive search (ES) and gradient search (GS) with barrier, which are generally used to obtain the global optimum and local optimum of the nonconvex optimization problem, respectively. Considering that these techniques require a centralized unit to share information with each other, we propose multiagent deep reinforcement learning to solve this optimization problem in a distributed manner, which provides optimal decision making together with efficient deep network training under inequality constraints including transmit power, power splitting ratio, and minimum requirement data rate for D2D and cellular users. In this proposed method, we consider the virtual environment in which each agent can train their model according to shared information, and then, we deploy the trained model into the actual environment where each agent can only know their channel gain, interference power, and required minimum throughput. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can afford a near-global-optimum solution with much lower computation complexity than ES and outperforms the GS.},

On the basis of graph theory, an error system is established. The tracking problem of an MAS is transformed into a stabilizing issue. An implicit manifold is constructed, and an improved form of the off-the-manifold coordinate, with a regulating factor, is introduced. Further, a consensus tracking control problem for an MAS with unknown dynamics is studied. A distributed I&amp;I consensus tracking control strategy is designed in combination with an adaptive I&amp;I estimator. The error between the real value and its estimation is selected as an I&amp;I implicit manifold, and an off-the-manifold coordinate is then defined. An adaptive update law is designed for guaranteeing the invariance and attractiveness of this manifold.

  abstract     = {Owing to the nonoverlapping spectrum, light fidelity (LiFi) and WiFi technologies can coexist and form a heterogeneous LiFi WiFi network (HLWN). The performance of HLWN significantly depends upon the load balancing strategies. Since load balancing of HLWN is a nonconvex mixed-integer nonlinear programming optimization problem, it is mathematically intractable, and therefore, the conventional optimization methods fail to provide an optimal global solution. Although an optimal solution can be obtained using the exhaustive search method, it would be computationally complex. Therefore, in this article, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based algorithm is explored for solving the load balancing problem for the downlink HLWN at reasonably low complexity and near optimal performance. We have proposed three different reward functions for RL; the first and second reward functions work toward maximizing average network throughput and user satisfaction, respectively. The third reward function is designed to maximize the long-term system throughput and ensure at least 50\% user’s satisfaction for all users. In order to study the effects of link aggregation on the system performance, this article considers two different types of receiver schemes, namely, single access point (SAP) and link aggregation (LA) scheme. While the SAP allows the user to receive data only from an SAP, the LA scheme allows the user to receive data simultaneously from both LiFi and WiFi AP. This article also includes effect of random orientation of the receiver device and handover overhead. Furthermore, concepts of domain knowledge have been included in this article to reduce the computational complexity of the algorithm. The proposed system performance is compared with the the following two benchmarks: received signal strength (RSS) and exhaustive search based on the computational complexity, average system throughput, and user satisfaction. It is shown that the proposed RL scheme outperforms the RSS scheme in average system throughput and user satisfaction. The RL scheme with an appropriate reward function provides a matching performance to the exhaustive search at reasonably low complexity.},

  abstract     = {The contributions of this article include a new concept, a new question, and a new method. This article proposes the concept of functional community, which is different from conventional topological community. Functional community is defined with two meanings: (1) tighter internal coupling for better efficiency within the same community; (2) more internal transmission from source to sink nodes within the same community. Then a new question about how to detect functional communities in power grids is analyzed, and most existing algorithms are not applicable. Therefore, a new method is put forward. Corresponding to meaning 1, electrical coupling strength (ECS) is defined to replace conventional adjacency matrix; corresponding to meaning 2, power supply strength is defined and integrated with ECS to form the newly defined electrical functional strength. Based on these two changes, we apply the proposed power supply modularity as a benchmark to evaluate any partitioning of power grids. Moreover, the Newman fast algorithm is modified with power supply modularity maximization to detect functional communities in power grids. The capability of the proposed partitioning method is demonstrated via the IEEE-118, IEEE-300 bus systems, and an Italian power grid. We argue that the conventional topological modularity may exaggerate the community characteristics of power grids and is inferior to the power supply modularity in detecting some functional features in communities. The work can also give inspiration to other engineering networks for functional communities.},

  abstract     = {Due to the complicated structure of the aircraft engine, it is hard to observe the damage and determine its status with the traditional diagnosis method, which sets a fixed threshold for some specific parameters. To accurately reflect the condition of the engine, this article provides a novel fault diagnosis method for the TFE-731 turbofan engine and develops an online diagnosis system. With the combinations of model-based and data-driven approaches, models are constructed to create the so-called digital twins of the engine parameters. For the model-based approach, the physical isentropic compression is used as the basis of the model. For the data-driven approach, the fast orthogonal search is utilized to ensure that the model outputs close to the real engine data. Based on the model prediction-based monitoring strategy, the status of the engine can be identified online. By using the proposed method, an alarm will be triggered once the tested engine outputs cross the boundaries generated by the digital twins. This method can be further applied in quality control to examine the abnormal parts of an aircraft engine. Finally, the digital twins’ online diagnosis system is realized in the practical TFE-731 test facility, verifying the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {In case of high-impact low-probability events, in order to restore the critical loads of the distribution network as much as possible, it is necessary to employ all available resources such as microgrids and distributed generations. This article presents a two-stage method for critical load restoration after an extreme event utilizing the coordination of all available distributed generations, microgrids, and demand response programs. In the first stage, the postdisaster reconfiguration of the network is determined, and in the second stage, the demand response outputs of the responsive loads and the restoration status of all critical loads are ascertained. In the first stage, an algorithm is proposed to determine electrical islands, and in the second stage, a new model based on the generalized Benders decomposition algorithm is proposed, which considers demand response programs and all operational constraints and aims to maximize the restored critical loads. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by simulating the 33- and 69-bus test systems.},

  abstract     = {The millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar technology has attracted significant attention because it is susceptible to environmental lighting, wall shielding, and privacy concern. This article proposes a novel noninvasive human activity recognition system using a mmWave radar. The proposed framework first transforms mmWave signals into point clouds. Generally speaking, it consists of four major components: denosing, enhanced voxelization, data augmentation, and dual-view machine learning to lead to accurate and efficient human activity recognition. The proposed new methodology considers the spatial–temporal point clouds in physical environments through a modified voxelization approach, enriches the sparse data based on the symmetry property of radar rotations, and learns the activity using a dual-view convolutional neural network. To evaluate the performance of the proposed learning models, a dataset involving seven different activities has been established using a mmWave radar platform. The experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed system can achieve 97.61\% and 98\% accuracies during the tests of fall detection and activity classification, respectively. In comparison, the proposed scheme greatly outperforms four other conventional machine learning schemes in terms of the overall accuracy.},

  abstract     = {In blockchain-enabled applications, it is difficult to preserve privacy completely because of the openness of each signer’s public key. In this article, an efficient multiattribute-based signature scheme with key aggregation (M-ABS-KA) is presented that supports a flexible threshold predicate. This construction aggregates the public keys and provides a compact signature that is verified as a group, which realizes faster batch verification than confirming them individually. Furthermore, both the multisignature scale and the public key length are independent of the number of signers and attributes in this scheme. To the best of our knowledge, this M-ABS-KA scheme is the first multi-ABS protocol with an aggregated public key and fast batch verification. Based on the hardness of the computational Diffie–Hellman problem, it is formally proven that the proposal achieves unforgeability in the random oracle model and enjoys signer privacy. Additionally, the performance is evaluated in theoretical and experimental analyses with other related ABS schemes, and the results show that it is feasible and efficient in storage, bandwidth, and computational cost. Finally, as an illustrative application, we design a framework of the blockchain-enabled electronic health records assessment system based on this presented M-ABS-KA scheme.},

  abstract     = {By increasing the penetration of wind power in the modern power systems, to investigate transient stability is of special importance. This article presents an innovative index based on the concept of the potential energy boundary surface along with kinetic energy, which aims to detect the transient instability of a power system comprising doubly fed induction generator (DFIG)-based wind farms. Accordingly, transient instability detection (TID) is performed without directly calculating the unstable equilibrium point and thus the computational load is decreased. Since the proposed approach requires only the postfault data that can be easily measured by the phasor measurement units, it is suitable for real-time applications. Therefore, the proposed approach can be applied as a general tool to any power system with any change in topology and operating conditions. Moreover, considering that the current-balance form is the preferred industry model for the implementation of transient stability simulation, the network equations in the current-balance form are extracted for grid-connected DFIG and synchronous generators. Different scenarios are simulated in the Western System Coordinating Council 3-machine, 9-bus system, and the 10-generator New England system. To validate the new index for TID, simulation results are compared with the transient stability index and out-of-step distance relay. The obtained results validate the correctness and effectiveness of the presented new index.},

Due to resource limitations, WSNs are subject to many failures, including hardware (permanent faults), software, and communication failures. To ensure data reliability, the data collected by WSNs must be clean of faults. This article presents a centralized faulty data detection and recovery approach, which can detect, recover, and recognize different types of faults (offset, gain, stuck-at, out of bound, and random faults). It operates in two phases: Faulty data detection and recovery and fault type identification (FTI). After detecting the fault, the faulty data will be discarded and replaced by an estimated value based on the Kalman filter. FTI provides a unique solution by determining the types of faults and report them to the end-user for an application-specific decision-making process. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through experimental results, with comparison to state-of-the-art techniques of the same application.},

To that end, this article proposes a systematic and effective technique for feasibility check and configuration design of electrified PBT fleets without the need for the sophisticated optimization toolbox and high performance computing. The configuration design aims at determining the number of BEBs and their on-board battery capacities to meet the PBT prespecified schedule under different sizes of chargers. The proposed model is tailored for BEBs designed to either boost their batteries on-route at intermediate bus stations using fast chargers (opportunity charging) or charge while parked at the depot (in-depot charging). The developed model is also utilized to generate the aggregated power demand profiles of electrified PBT fleets under different charging practices. Based on the generated power demand profile, a lifecycle cost analysis is conducted to compare BEB-based PBT options to their diesel counterparts.},

The number of integrated model inputs is optimal, making it appropriate for automatic generation control purposes. This model can work accurately in nominal conditions without abnormal events. Thus, the gathered data from an identification test in a 325 MW steam unit in nominal situations is employed to estimate the proposed model&#39;s unkn0own parameters using a genetic algorithm. Additionally, the condenser back-pressure (CBP) effect in the steam unit generation is elaborated. Regarding the CBP dependency on environmental conditions, like the wind speed, this effect is treated as an uncertainty in the article. Consequently, a novel turbine model considering the CBP effect is introduced. Determining the CBP uncertainty bounds is another problem addressed in the article using an efficacious information gap decision theory method on the recorded data in abnormal conditions. Finally, the derived model and parameters in both nominal and abnormal conditions are validated using the operational data, and the results are discussed.},

A dynamic coding–decoding technique is applied during the data transmission process among sensing nodes. The purpose of the investigation is to limit the estimation error into a predetermined allowed region characterized by an ellipsoid, in spite of the existence of the so-called unknown-but-bounded (UBB) disturbances. Sufficient conditions are established for the existence of required filter, and the filtering gains can be determined by virtue of solving certain set of matrix inequalities.

Consequently, the utilities and electric distribution companies need to adapt their current business models to maintain service reliability, while higher granular data scarcity hinders accurate decision-making processes. In this context, this article proposes an integrated top–down bottom–up approach that aims at estimating the essential higher granular demand data through a two-layer physics-based framework. In the top–down model, various economic-demographic regression models are developed to unlock higher granular demand in geographic areas and technology/policy adoptions, while in the bottom–up layer, our in-house-developed physics-based building simulator is employed to simulate sectoral disaggregated demand patterns. The simulation error is modeled by the least-squares estimation of a Fourier series, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithm, and long short-term memory (LSTM) network, where the numerical results show the superiority of the LSTM in capturing the simulation errors. To reveal the merits of the proposed hierarchical framework, the state of New Jersey in the US is chosen as the test case directed by the Energy Master Plan to pursue a set of targets by 2021, which is the target year in this article, while data scarcity is in place.},

Although existing attribute-based encryption technology is suitable for realizing data access control, the problems of large number of matching contents of search results and high computational overhead remain exist. In light of this, an authorized data secure access scheme with specified time and relevance ranked keyword search is proposed to achieve accurate matching of the search results and reduce user’s cost. First, an authorization token on attribute-based access policy and the specified time is constructed. According to the token, the data meeting the access policy is selected within the specified time. Second, we leverage order-preserving index and extended keyword vector to construct keyword index, then the search results of user specified amount are sorted by relevance score. With the use of specified time and relevance for twice screening, the user can get the relevant search results accurately. Finally, the security proof and efficiency analysis show that the scheme is of feasibility.},

  abstract     = {Device-to-device (D2D) communications with non- orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) have been proved in enhancing the network capacity and reducing the burden of the traditional cellular network. Due to reusing the same resources, the underlying D2D communication may cause high interference to cellular users, and thus reducing the network throughput. To alleviate this issue, we consider moving D2D users to the unlicensed band. In this case, D2D users can reuse the resources in cellular networks or share the unlicensed band with WiFi users. However, a critical question is how to effectively perform NOMA user clustering and determine D2D pairs that should use unlicensed band and how to guarantee the quality service of users at both networks. Our objective is to maximize the network throughput by investigating a joint resource allocation problem of user clustering, power control, and D2D mode selection. Since the formulated problem is a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem, finding an optimal solution is a great challenge. To solve this problem, we propose to use a swarm intelligence approach, namely whale optimization algorithm in solving our optimization problem with an efficient solution. Through simulation results, we show that our proposed scheme attains a better performance than other alternative schemes.},

With a large number of antenna elements, a progressive time delay across antenna elements incurs a change in the beam direction as a function of subcarriers in an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing system. Considering the difference in delay across the entire array, a new channel estimation framework is proposed by using a maximum likelihood criterion as a function of the analog training beam and pilot subcarrier assignment. The resulting design achieves asymptotic orthogonality among the channel paths and minimizes the mean squared error. An extension of the proposed design to a uniform planar array is discussed. The Cramér–Rao lower bound for joint channel estimation with hybrid beamforming is derived to verify the effectiveness of the proposed design.},

  abstract     = {The traditional covert communication channel relying on a third-party node is vulnerable to attack. The data are easily tampered with and the identity information of the communication party is fragile. Blockchain has the characteristics of decentralization and tamper resistance, which can effectively solve the above problems. In addition, some confidential information needs to be transmitted covertly in the transparent blockchain. A smart contract deployed in the blockchain to automatically realize its function can replace a centralized node to provide credible guarantee for communication. The diversity of parameters, data redundancy, and code programmability of smart contract make it an excellent carrier for covert communication under blockchain. In this article, we propose a covert communication model combined with smart contracts to covertly transfer information in the blockchain environment. To implement this model, we use the parameters in the contract to map the secret information sequence, and call the contract to transfer message. Voting contract and secret bidding contract are combined to instantiate the proposed model, and optimized versions of the two contracts are also proposed to reduce costs. Moreover, we use encryption algorithms and two-round protocols to ensure data privacy and design corresponding information embedding and transmission methods for different scenarios. To improve the concealment of communication, redundant options, effective price ranges, and invalid bids are set in two contracts, respectively. The experimental results show that the proposed model has tamper resistance and low complexity, and it is feasible to use this model for covert communication.},

  abstract     = {This article presents a multiobjective multiscenario framework for the placement of remote-controlled switches (RCSs) to enhance the efficiency and reliability of the unbalanced distribution systems. Two scenarios are formulated, which include healthy and postfault persistent conditions. A healthy condition consists of cumulative power loss and aggregated RCS installation and maintenance costs as objectives. Postfault persistent condition includes the total number of restored load and aggregated RCS installation and maintenance costs as objectives. A set of optimal solutions are derived by employing the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) for multiple scenarios. Lastly, a set of optimal solutions are derived by employing a multiscenario integrated NSGA-II (MSNSGA-II) optimization technique utilizing the already obtained optimal solutions. The key contribution of this article is the design of an algorithm, which can deal with both healthy and persistent postfault conditions. The second significant contribution is the consideration of uncertainty in the load and renewable energy sources along with the network reconfiguration. Another vital contribution of this article includes the application of the holomorphic embedding power flow method in an unbalanced distribution system. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is demonstrated by implementing the proposed method on the IEEE 34-bus and IEEE 123-bus system.},

The research on implementing Industry 4.0 is lagging behind the degree of attention Industry 4.0 attracts. Moreover, contrary to the exponential growth that Industry 4.0 research shows, the implementation of Industry 4.0 in practice is less often covered in the relevant literature. The challenges of implementing Industry 4.0 are even less frequently addressed. Industry 4.0 implementation challenges can be either managerial or technological. In our recent paper, we analyzed managerial implementation challenges. This article, as a continuation of our previous work, identifies, codes, and defines the technological Industry 4.0 implementation challenges. It further analyzes hindering relationships between Industry 4.0 technologies and identifies main challenge themes important for system designers.

Low-resolution digital-to-analog converters (DACs) are equipped at both the base station (BS) and the relay station (RS), and the amplify-and-forward protocol is adopted at the RS. Under the Rician fading channel, closed-form approximate expressions for the achievable sum rate are derived with perfect and imperfect channel state information. A more general power law is extracted to save transmit power without reducing the achievable sum rate, and a local optimal power allocation scheme is proposed to improve the channel capacity of active users. Then, the tradeoff between the achievable sum rate and the EE is discussed. The numerical results show that, due to the quantization noise, the transmit power has a limited increase in the achievable rate. In addition, it is more valuable to improve the DAC quantization bit at the RS when the number of BS antennas is larger than that of RS antennas. In addition, under strong line-of-sight channels or high pilot transmit power conditions, the channel estimation accuracy is higher, and the best tradeoff between the achievable sum rate and the EE can be obtained when the DAC quantization bit is 4.},

Hence, PV array reconfiguration techniques have become highly popular to minimize the ML of PV arrays. In this article, an optimal dynamic topology reconfiguration method based on a switching matrix is presented for series–parallel (SP) interconnected PV array to mitigate the ML, thereby maximizing the power generation of the PV array. The design of the switching matrix is presented that enables each string of the PV array to be divided into two sections to carry out the efficient dynamic topology reconfiguration with improved flexibility and scalability. The proposed reconfiguration method is assessed and compared with the SP scheme and the recently developed cross diagonal view method. The effectiveness of the proposed solution for the TCT scheme is also confirmed through simulation experiments. The numerical results indicate that the multiple peaks on P-V curves can be reduced and MPPT can be implemented with a simple control algorithm. Additionally, the maximum power generation improved by 20.13\% and 14.39\% on average compared to the SP scheme and TCT scheme, respectively, for different mismatch conditions of partial shading and random PV module failures.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, severe hurricanes have occurred frequently, posing a huge challenge to the distribution network (DN) operation. Electric buses (EBs) possess large-capacity batteries and are widely used in public transit under normal circumstances. Before a hurricane occurs, some idle EBs can be preallocated to different charging stations equipped with vehicle-to-grid and served as sources for emergency power supply. This article proposes a prehurricane EB preallocation method to assist the resilience enhancement of a fragile DN. A two-stage data-driven robust stochastic programming technique is applied to build this model. Different scenarios are generated, and the corresponding posthurricane restoration processes are considered in the determination of the preallocation strategy. Also, the uncertainties of hurricane-induced physical damages are considered in modeling, which is described as a strengthened confidence set. The established model aims at exploring the optimal preallocation strategy of EBs with minimum load losses under the worst-case distribution. A column-and-constraint generation algorithm is then used to solve this proposed model. The proposed method is tested on a modified IEEE 33-bus system with 50 EBs. The results indicate that preallocating EBs to charging stations can improve the resilience of the posthurricane DN effectively.},

  abstract     = {This article proposes a fully distributed resilient control scheme for islanded alternating current microgrids to achieve economic operation under uncertain communication links. Based on the well-known hierarchical control structure and consensus algorithm, a distributed resilient economic dispatch algorithm is first designed to determine the optimal generation point, and then, a distributed resilient secondary controller is developed to track the optimal generation point and eliminate the frequency deviation. Different from the robust secondary control schemes, which require the upper bound of uncertainties in dealing with the uncertain communication links and offline design the communication coupling weights through a central controller, the proposed scheme applies adaptive control technology to online design the communication coupling weights based on communication neighbor information, such that the adverse effects of uncertain communication links can be counteracted. Thus, the proposed adaptive scheme is fully distributed in contrast to existing robust schemes. The Lyapunov approach-based theoretical analysis shows that frequency restoration and generation cost minimization can be achieved for the islanded microgrid under some proper assumptions. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed scheme is verified by several simulation studies in MATLAB/Simulink.},

  abstract     = {Server consolidation in a virtualized cloud environment improves resource utilization by hosting many virtual machines (VMs) on a single machine. The host server failure induces a serious risk of the interruption of services provided through VMs hosted on the failed server. Ensuring high reliability and availability from the unpredicted host server failures is a challenging task, and this assurance guarantee is the quality of service to the users. Executing latency-sensitive workloads within a time frame, multireplica strategy-based reliability assurance is used in general. In this article, we propose two reliability-ensured scheduling approaches by strategically allocating the jobs to machines to satisfy their reliability and deadline requirements. The proposed approaches “Replication with equal failure rate” and “Efficient reliability replication method” are used to schedule the jobs to machines with equal and different failure rates, respectively, while satisfying both the deadline and reliability requirements of the jobs. Both the scheduling approaches dynamically select the machines for the jobs to minimize the number of replicas based on job characteristics and failure rate of machines. Also, we adopt an overlapping mechanism to further minimize the resource utilization. The extensive simulation results on randomly generated and real-world data at different scales show that the proposed approaches perform better than other state-of-the-art approaches.},

  abstract     = {In this article, the problem of nonfragile tracking protocol design for high-order multiagent systems with Lipschitz-type node dynamics is investigated. Considerations are that the network is subject to aperiodic intermittent communications and the in-neighboring agents’ interactions switch in a directed graphs set, in which each element contains a directed spanning tree. The zero-order holder is employed to keep the local information from in-neighboring agents as the network communications are out of action. By virtue of a proposed two-step switching mechanism, one equivalently casts the concerned consensus tracking issue into asymptotically stabilizing a class of uncertain switched time-delay systems. Taking advantage of algebraic graph theory, Lyapunov–Krasovskii stability analysis, and robust nonfragile control approach, it is proved that the nonfragile consensus tracking can be achieved if a group of linear matrix inequalities are feasible and, for each time interval, the communication rate is larger than a threshold value. Numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.},

The focus of this article is on investigating and managing the impacts of the electric vehicle (EV) charging and solar photo-voltaic (PV) generation considering TSO–DSO interaction constraints. These constraints include the driving point impedance that reflects the impact of the DER-rich distribution system on the upstream HV network and voltage profile control through the on-load tap changing (OLTC) transformer’s operation. The aim is to optimally utilize the existing assets and flexibilities to have more EVs and PVs at the distribution level without violating constraints at both transmission and distribution levels. The proposed model could readily be used by policymakers to design and implement the proper time-of-use tariffs for improved handling of the increasing EVs and PVs penetrations in emerging distribution networks.

  abstract     = {Wireless sensor network (WSN) technology is considered to be an integral part of large-scale and efficient deployment of Internet-of-Things (IoT). More specifically, in mission-critical IoT applications, trust in the sensor data is becoming increasingly important. Sensor nodes have limited processing, storage, and communication capabilities, which make them susceptible to attacks and unreliable functioning. However, the limitations in the energy resources of the sensors are a major challenge in maximizing the network’s lifetime. Grouping the sensors into clusters was proposed to address such energy limitations. Many meta-heuristic clustering protocols have been proposed to maximize the network lifetime, which is an NP-hard problem. This problem is more complicated when considering the trust factor. The majority of existing clustering models were built to reduce the energy consumption in the network without considering the energy consumption required to detect untrusted nodes, and thus, it requires extra energy consumption to perform this task. This article proposes a clustering protocol with a trust model that detects the untrusted nodes through energy and data-trust. In addition, the proposed clustering protocol maximizes the network’s lifetime through the good characteristics of stochastic fractal search optimization. Finally, a novel fitness function is introduced to select the cluster-heads among the trusted nodes. The function is based on the following four parameters: 1) the remaining energy of the nodes; 2) the density of the nodes; 3) the distance between each node and the base-station; and 4) the network’s dissipated energy. When forming the clusters, the density of the cluster-heads is considered to balance the load of all of the cluster-heads. The experimental evaluation performed here affirms the efficacy of the proposed protocol in comparison with existing protocols.},

It is supposed that the transmitted measurement signals are ruined by attackers randomly. A key issue is how to design the controller parameters to keep the desirable performance of the closed-loop system under DoS attacks which are characterized by their frequencies and durations. To this end, the event-based AOFTSMC is proposed first to increase robustness against the attack and reduce the computational load. Then, an explicit effect of the duration and frequency of DoS attacks on the stability of the closed-loop systems under the presented controller is analyzed. Moreover, the scheduling of controller updating times is determined. This leads to derive the maximum bandwidth of the cyber layer which is required to guarantee the stability of the closed-loop system. Then, the designer can outline suitable controller parameters in different situations in the presence of uncertainties and DoS attacks. Finally, numerical simulation results illustrate the validation and effectiveness of the proposed methodology.},

  abstract     = {The decentralized economic scheduling of multimicrogrid is an important aspect in the operational planning of microgrids (MGs). This article proposes an approach to maximize economic benefit among MGs through cooperative scheduling. The cooperative scheduling is achieved via price signals so that MGs are encouraged to share power among themselves for economic benefit. An MG operator generates a time-variable tariff based on energy trading status so that the parking lot operator and distributed battery energy storage system aggregator participate with flexibility in the MG’s energy management. The Shapley value method is used for generating fair price signals. The stochastic Dantzig–Wolfe decomposition is used to solve the resulting optimization problem in a decentralized manner. The uncertainties related to load demand and renewable energy sources are captured using scenario-based methods, whereas the uncertainty associated with plug-in hybrid electric vehicles is modeled using copula theory based estimation. The simulation studies and comparison with the existing methods establish that the proposed approach effectively reduces the total energy cost in a decentralized manner with the minimum amount of information exchange.},

Most of the existing searchable encryption schemes are based on the single cloud server model, which has some limitations, such as the single point of failure and malicious insiders. In contrast, the multicloud server model has higher data availability and security. However, directly moving the existing keyword search schemes to the multicloud would cause larger storage and search costs, and the data security cannot be distinctly improved. In addition, different from single cloud, a challenge is how to effectively verify query integrity when some cloud servers return incorrect or incomplete results in a multicloud situation. To ensure the data security, we propose an iterative encryption method to ensure the file privacy even if multiple cloud servers collude with each other. We use Bloom filter to map keywords and construct a tree index for each cloud server to achieve secure and efficient distributed keyword search. To verify the query integrity, we propose a fast verification algorithm to embed the file content and index information into the file ID. The analysis and experiments demonstrate the security and effectiveness of our scheme.},

However, the results of detecting the community were found to be random when using LPA. Based on previous improvements to the LPA, this article proposes a new LPA (NOHLPA) that joins multilayer neighborhood overlap and historical label similarity. The NOHLPA considers both the node update order and label selection rules. We cited the label entropy as the basis for node update order and defined multilayer neighborhood overlap and historical label similarity for calculating node preferences to devise more appropriate label selection rules. We test the NOHLPA on five real datasets and compare NOHLPA with different combinations of algorithms. The experimental results show that the NOHLPA effectively improves the accuracy of community partitioning while ensuring stability.},

  abstract     = {Due to the rapid development and wide application of mobile devices, mobile edge computing (MEC) technology improves system performance by offloading vehicle computing tasks to the edges of the network. In order to save device power, shorten transmission delay, save network bandwidth, or shorten execution time, many related works have been proposed. Different from these works under the constraints of system resources, we adopt another method to maximize the admission of mobile users&#39; tasks to meet the service requirements. Compared with these works, this method can allocate and utilize all system resources more effectively and admit as many tasks as possible. Further, we prove that the approximate ratio of its solution to the optimal solution of the problem of maximizing task admission in MEC is bounded. The above claim is verified by the conducted simulations and the simulation results show that there is a small difference between its solution and the optimal one. On the other hand, if the system resources can be increased at a bounded rate, another algorithm is proposed to control the compromise between the overall system performance and the robustness of its obtained solution.},

  abstract     = {DC microgrids can be operated under a hierarchical control strategy, and it needs a communication-based layer. The implementation of digital controllers and the communication infrastructure can make a dc microgrid vulnerable to cyber-attacks. This article introduces an approach based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) to detect and mitigate cyber-attacks in a dc microgrid. The proposed method is based on the artificial neural network (ANN), which can be categorized as an AI-based method. The proposed application implements an ANN to detect and mitigate false data injection attacks (FDIAs). FDIAs try to inject false data into the system to affect the control application of the dc microgrid, and it can shut down the dc microgrid. The proposed method can calculate the value of the false data, and it can detect and remove the attack simultaneously. The proposed method is tested in a MATLAB/Simulink environment. Also, to have more accurate results, the introduced approach is examined under different conditions and cyber/physical disturbances (e.g., communication delay, noise, plug-and-play of additional units, and time-varying FDIAs). Besides, a comparison is considered to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. The obtained results can conclusively prove the effectiveness, accuracy, and authenticity of the proposed method to successfully detect the FDIAs and remove the cyber-attack.},

  abstract     = {In highly penetrated microgrids (MGs), the problem of voltage and frequency deviations exceeding their permissible limits, becomes significant with higher share of renewable based distributed generation (DG). The existing real-time control systems of highly penetrated MGs cannot cope on its own with such deviations, owing to the large generation and demand mismatch mainly during off-peak hours. A dump load (DL) can help with voltage and frequency regulation by consuming excess generation. However, further investigation is required to highlight the importance of optimal DL allocation on the operation of MGs. The mixed-integer distributed ant colony optimization is introduced as a novel application in droop controlled islanded MGs to minimize voltage and frequency deviations and system losses. The optimization problem was formulated as a single- and multiobjective problem to allocate a DL and the optimal droop settings for DG in islanded microgrid (MG) during off-peak hours. The proposed optimization method was teamed up with a special backward/forward sweep load flow method to account for DG droop characteristics and enhance the solution convergence. The method was applied to the IEEE 69- and 118-test systems and validated against competitive swarm and evolutionary metaheuristics. Results have shown that an optimally sized and allocated DL with optimized droop setting could minimize voltage and frequency deviations to an acceptable level, while reducing power losses incurred by the installation of such load into the MG.},

  abstract     = {5G mobile networks are envisioned to substantiate new vertical services with diverse performance requirements. Slicing in the radio access network (RAN) promises an efficient solution for these diversified needs of 5G networks, which foresees the separation of the base station functionality between the central unit (CU) and the distributed remote radio heads. In this article, we formulate a mixed integer programming (MIP) framework that maximizes the throughput by jointly selecting the optimal functional split and the routing path from a connected user equipment to the CU, while satisfying the agreed service level agreements (SLAs) of each service. Furthermore, we propose an effective heuristic, SlicedRAN, which creates isolated RAN slices premised on the service requirements connected through a fronthaul/backhaul (FH/BH) network and obtains near-optimal solutions in a short computing time compared to the MIP framework. Our results show that there is a tradeoff between the architecture of the FH/BH network and the minimum SLA of each slice, which provides a solution to efficiently design a virtualized network infrastructure. According to the results, the SlicedRAN outperforms existing state-of-the-art up to 112\% gain in throughput. Results are shown close to the optimal results, with a loss below 5\%.},

This article proposes a two-step wind power prediction method, which consists of two phases: long time-scale coarse prediction and short time-scale fine correction. In the long time-scale phase, a complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition-based sigma point Kalman filter approach is proposed to coarsely predict wind power merely with historical data. In the short time-scale phase, a deep deterministic policy gradient approach learns from real-time weather information to correct the coarse prediction result, which results in an improved prediction accuracy. A real-life case study confirms that the proposed method can properly predict wind power generation and have a better prediction accuracy than existing techniques, thus offering a viable and promising alternative for predicting wind power generation.},

HD stands for the horizontal distribution of the tasks in the fog layer. Each sensor in the user devices independently captures data of varying formats. Parallel execution on these data is possible based on its directed acyclic task graph (DATG), and the corresponding results facilitate the ease of decision-making. Toward this, in HD-Fog, the sensor nodes in user devices offload their tasks to a nearby fog node based on a greedy selection criterion. This fog node then further offloads the smaller subtasks, based on the DATG, among other fog nodes for parallel execution. Through extensive real-life metric-based emulation and comparison against traditional Fog and Cloud computing schemes, we observe that our approach 1) reduces the overall operational delays by 29\% and 96\%, and 2) offers promising speedup values. The proposed HD-Fog scheme also indicates a reduction in energy consumption by 30\% compared to traditional fog computing schemes.},

In sending data, TCP has a congestion control algorithm that allows TCP to handle any congestion problems on the network. In this article, we analyzed the HMIPv6 performance using TCP YeAH and TCP CUBIC with various user equipment (UE) speeds. It showed that each TCP had a fairly stable delay and throughput under the condition of the single connectivity handover with an average delay of 192.8196 ms and average throughput of 52.8812 Mb/s. Whereas, in the dual connectivity handover condition, each TCP had a fluctuating delay and throughput directly proportional to the increasing UE speed. Therefore, TCP YeAH dominated the stability in dual connectivity with an average delay of 221.4226 ms and average throughput of 44.4004 Mb/s. Overall, this article found that TCP YeAH performed better than TCP CUBIC in both the single connectivity and dual connectivity handovers.},

  abstract     = {Data sharing is a basic data processing mechanism in the cloud storage. Data confidentiality and the receiver privacy are two important requirements of data-sharing systems. Because the data owner does not wish anyone who is not authorized to access the shared data and the authenticated data receiver also does not wish anyone else to know that he/she has accessed the shared data from the data owner. Broadcast encryption gives a possible solution to these requirements of data-sharing systems. This article constructs a data-sharing system over lattice by designing an efficient identity-based broadcast encryption (IBBE) scheme which achieves the data confidentiality and the identity privacy simultaneously. Besides the data owner, no one knows the identities of the authenticated data receivers in the proposed data-sharing system. Data confidentiality is achieved by the indistinguishability under the selective identity and the chosen ciphertext attacks (IND-sID-CCA) of the proposed IBBE scheme. It is proven in the random oracle model that the IND-sID-CCA security is based on the hardness of the learning with errors problem which can resist the quantum attacks. Inherited from the proposed IBBE scheme, the proposed data-sharing system also has several other characters which are suitable to the practical application. The most important feature is that all the public parameters size, private key size, and the ciphertext length are constant for any data receivers set in the proposed system. Hence, the proposed system adapts to the situation of large receiver group. Moreover, the proposed data-sharing system supports efficient member joining. When a new user asks to access the uploaded data, the existing receiver does not need to update his/her private key. The decryption cost of the existing receiver will remain unchanged when the outsourced data have been updated. Detailed performance analysis and a simulated experiment of the designed core algorithm are given by using Java program on a personal computer Intel Core i7-8700 K (3.7 GHz), 32 G RAM which verifies the design results in this article.},

Unfortunately, the energy limitations of the existing off-the-shelf small-size UAVs are significant challenges, especially during long missions. In this article, first, we investigate the communication model of a heterogeneous UAV-assisted wireless network that consists of multiple energy-constrained battery-powered small-size UAVs (a.k.a. follower UAVs) and a large-size UAV (a.k.a. dispatcher UAV) with solar energy harvesting capability. Subsequently, we propose an aerial energy sharing algorithm to improve the lifetime of the system by orchestrating energy balancing among follower UAVs. In particular, the dispatcher UAV having large energy capacity owing to its battery size and solar energy harvesting capability shares its energy with follower UAVs using radio-frequency-based power transfer through beamforming. The proposed energy sharing algorithm considers the placement, available battery capacity, and mission execution time of the follower UAVs to decide the energy sharing points with optimum efficiency. Extensive simulations show that our proposed algorithm outperforms existing algorithms in terms of charging efficiency and energy balancing among UAVs.},

  abstract     = {The consumer’s short-term load forecasting plays an essential role in microgrid energy distribution. However, the load forecasting at consumer level is more challenging than at substation level due to high volatility and uncertainty in energy consumption. In literature, many machine learning-based forecasting models have been explored. However, there is a need of developing a robust and accurate model to handle highly inconsistent energy consumption. In this article, we propose a robust and accurate model for consumer’s short-term load forecasting, which uses feasible techniques such as random forest, support vector regressor, and long short-term memory as base predictors to handle varying traits of energy consumption. For the final decision-making on forecasting result of these predictors, it assigns weights to each predictor dynamically as per the forecasting efficacy. The proposed model is tested on different consumer’s varying traits of energy consumption. The experimental results show that the proposed model achieves forecasting error reduction by 3.46 and 2.53 in terms of average RMSE and MAE, respectively, in comparison with the existing models. It is robust and accurate even in presence of highly volatile and uncertain load patterns, and thus, it can better fit for microgrid energy management.},

  abstract     = {Dynamic wireless power transfer (DWPT), as an emerging technology of coupling the electrified transportation network and power grid, is regarded as a powerful solution for electric vehicles (EVs) promotion. In this article, we propose an intelligent path planning strategy for each individual EV by combining the urban electrified transportation network, power grid, and DWPT. Based on the Floyd algorithm, we ensure the timeliness of path planning by updating the link weights in real time. The EV intelligent path planning strategy comprehensively considers the travel time, charging energy, charging cost, and user convenience. In addition, to ensure that the grid bus voltage has the lowest deviation rate while considering the bus load limit, we propose a multi-stage two-layer optimization algorithm to determine the charging power of each link. The upper layer uses the particle swarm optimization, and the decision variable is the charging power of each link; the lower layer calculates the voltage deviation rate by solving the alternating current optimal power flow model. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate that the intelligent path planning strategy proposed in this article can effectively guarantee a good comprehensive performance in terms of travel time, charging energy, charging cost, and user convenience.},

Although there have been plenty of works on the optimal AP deployment (OAD), however, the issue remains open that how to deploy APs energy-savingly in 3-D environments while considering some practical demands. Therefore, this article investigates the OAD with the objective of minimizing the total AP transmission power while guaranteeing the effective coverage by jointly optimizing the transmission power and location of each AP. Different from existing works, our article fully considers not only real 3-D environments with various obstacles but also the differentiated coverage demand and the restrictions on AP locations. To solve this NP-hard optimization problem, this article first proposes a novel hybrid swarm intelligence optimization algorithm, named PSO-Lévy-DFOA. The computational results on 16 benchmark functions and comprehensive comparisons with other algorithms demonstrate the superior global convergence performance of PSO-Lévy-DFOA. The proposed PSO-Lévy-DFOA-based OAD method is then applied to WLAN planning in a two-story building. It has been shown that the total AP transmission power can be considerably reduced compared to the current deployment while still fulfilling the effective coverage.},

Despite these manifold advantages, they can still be affected by unfavorable activities of jammer. Therefore, it is of high importance and need to investigate random jamming specially for security-constrained cooperative FSO communication protocol. This article develops a new system model of relay-assisted FSO system and studies a novel mathematical framework to analyze the performance of decode-and-forward protocol-based cooperative FSO system in presence of random relay jamming effects. In presence of jammer, the probability density functions (pdfs) of different additive noises, i.e., a mixture of negative exponential and Gaussian random variables (RVs) and mixture of negative exponential RVs are derived. A closed-form expression of the average bit error rate (ABER) is analytically evaluated by using the derived pdfs in the presence of random relay jamming effects. In presence of jammer, an approximate and simple expression of a threshold-based detector is obtained. By studying the ABER performance comparison, it is shown that the proposed approximate detector works satisfactorily compared to the maximum-likelihood detector in presence of random relay jammers. In addition to that, ABER performance of a general relay FSO system with an arbitrary number of relays is also obtained.},

This article presents a comprehensive review of robust control methods for microgrids, including AC, DC, and hybrid microgrids, with different topologies and different types of interconnection to conventional power systems based on recently published research studies. The main control objectives, along with proposed control methods, are comparatively discussed for different types of microgrids.

Our scheme allows the sensors planted or worn by a user in the IBC system to signcrypt sensitive data using the public key of the management center in the PKI system, and then uploading it to the cloud server. Subsequently, the equality test can be executed by the cloud server on diverse ciphertexts to determine whether they contain the identical plaintext and return the corresponding result after receiving a request from an application provider.

  abstract     = {In this article, an adaptive real-time communication system is proposed that leverages the software-defined networking (SDN) paradigm to provide end-to-end deadline guarantees. SDN is an emerging networking paradigm that allows control of the network through directly programmable software controllers, offering the flexibility to manage and optimize network resources dynamically. By utilizing these SDN features, a novel networking system, called RT-SDN, is presented that can effectively support real-time communication through cooperative routing and scheduling. To this end, we present a highly efficient routing algorithm that can adaptively reconfigure the routes of existing flows to find bandwidth-guaranteed routes for all flows. We then introduce a new priority assignment scheme that can achieve better deadline guarantees (i.e., better schedulability). In addition, RT-SDN allows routing and scheduling to operate together by employing a feedback loop between them. We implemented a prototype of RT-SDN as an SDN controller and deployed it on a testbed network of 30 BeagleBone devices. Our experiment results show that RT-SDN can be deployed in real-world commodity networks to provide end-to-end deadline guarantees, and the proposed schemes collectively improve the schedulability to a significant degree.},

To alleviate this issue, distributed controllers are designed that are robust to uncertainty and are optimal with respect to some meaningful performance index (referred to as being inverse optimal). It is shown that using the presented distributed robust inverse optimal controller the network of agents converge to a common value of interest or follow the trajectory of a leader node despite uncertainties. A comprehensive study is performed with the time varying bounded parameters uncertainties on the drift and the input matrices of the state-space representation of the MASs. Sufficient conditions for stability analysis are provided using the Lyapunov theory to show that the distributed controller can stabilize the MAS globally.

For effectively solving the above problems, we devise certificateless elliptic curve aggregate signcryption (CL-ECASC) scheme for IoTs that can improve the authentication efficiency, realize data confidentiality, and avoid the problems of complex certificate management and key escrow. Under the hardness of discrete logarithm and computational DiffieHellman problems on elliptic curve, CL-ECASC is proved to has the IND-CCA2 security (indistinguishability under the adaptive chosen-ciphertext attacks) and UF-CMA security (existentially unforgeable under the adaptive chosen-message attacks). CL-ECASC has relatively faster computation efficiency and lower communication cost, and so it is suitable for secure transmission of the information in the previously mentioned environments.},

In this article, we make the first attempt to study the problem of authenticity verification for dynamic social data. To this end, we first propose a novel authenticity verification framework, and then, propose a self-balancing hash tree scheme to tackle challenges brought on by the vast scale and dynamics of social data. To maximize the search efficiency for the self-balancing hash tree, we introduce a balance factor to define an unbalanced node as its balance factor is not chosen from a predetermined set. Furthermore, we propose three algorithms to balance unbalanced nodes in the self-balancing hash tree. Rigorous theoretical analyses prove that our framework can determinately detect any fake query results returned by data consumers.

Since transient and short-term voltage stability may exist solely or simultaneously, a universal model-free prediction method has been employed to distinguish between stable, critical stable, and unstable cases. The proposed prediction algorithm gives an early prediction of transient and short-term voltage instability by investigating four patterns on the trajectory of relative frequency deviation and inertia frequency response and simple negotiation between generation bus agents.

  abstract     = {Multilayer satellite networks (MLSNs) are viewed as a promising framework of the future satellite communication networks by realizing cooperative communication among satellites in different orbits. In this article, we introduce the cooperative nonorthogonal multiple access (C-NOMA) scheme into a two-layer geostationary Earth orbit/low Earth orbit satellite network in a frequency coexistence scenario and investigate the performance of the considered network. Taking into account the dynamic properties and channel characteristic of the satellite nodes, we first establish the generic architecture and then obtain the equivalent end-to-end signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios along with the feasible region of power allocation coefficients based on the C-NOMA principle. Furthermore, the analytical expressions of the system ergodic capacity and outage probability are derived and approximated using Meijer-G functions to evaluate the system performance efficiently. Finally, simulation results are provided to attest the validity of the theoretical results as well as show the superiority of the C-NOMA scheme and the impact of various parameters on the system performance.},

In ESS, the state of charge (SoC) balancing control plays an essential role. In this article, a local-distributed and global-decentralized SoC balancing control strategy is proposed for hybrid series-parallel ESS. Under the proposed scheme, the SoC of ESUs in each local string converge to the same value driven in a distributed manner and the SoC balance among different strings and power sharing of the ESS under both the charging and discharging modes are realized in a decentralized manner. Because there are no communication links between dispersed ESU strings, the scalability of the ESS is improved. Small signal stability analysis is carried out, which provides a guide for parameter design. Simulation results verify the effectiveness and correctness of the proposed method.},

A comparative study of different operating modes for a doubly fed induction generator with a permanent magnet synchronous generator is analyzed for tidal stream turbines based on the variation in the tidal current speed.

One challenge in the modeling of CES is the identification of how interactions in a complex situation occur and their combined influence on CES resilience. This article presents a resilience holon that can be used to analyze complex resilience situations. It is made up of 24 elements (defining types of resilience, threats, interactions, and disruptions), which have varying importance to specific situations. Holons can be linked together hierarchically or in a network. An application of the resilience holon to a documented real-world resilience situation, widespread flooding in a city, illustrates its use. Pathways taken by threats and disruptions, as the flood effects cascaded through the city, are shown as connections between holons. The resilience holon could be used to decompose diverse resilience situations involving CES, to identify where critical vulnerability points are and how the whole resilience situation could be improved. The visual nature of the resilience holon could be used in an interactive way, allowing stakeholders to better understand the full resilience picture of CES that they use or operate.},

The proposed nonadaptive Lyapunov filter has good bandpass filtering characteristics, thus allowing the rapid rejection of the dc-offset and the harmonics. The proposed open-loop phase angle deviation algorithm is, moreover, a rescuer as regards estimating the fundamental frequency deviation, signifying that it correctly compensates the estimated amplitude and the phase angle information through the use of a mathematical regression approach under off-nominal frequency conditions.},

Distributed computing architecture provides opportunities for managing these key changes by introducing solutions within substation computers and digital devices such as phasor measurement unit. The proposed decentralized voltage stability using a distributed coordination platform is a secondary emergency control mechanism utilizing large amounts of data in real-time for faster monitoring and control with the legacy system. The developed algorithms have been validated using the IEEE 30, 57, 118, and 300 bus systems using offline and real-time hardware-in-the-loop testbed modeling and simulation. To demonstrate the flexibility of the distributed coordination blocks, multiple case studies and implementation are presented. With control decisions required under changing operating conditions, the IEEE 30 bus system is simulated in real-time using a digital simulator and a network simulator (NS-3). The impact of the SYN flood cyberattack and tolerance of the computing infrastructure to resulting missing data have also been illustrated.},

  abstract     = {Natural disasters and accidents have underscored the need for operative solutions that can enhance the resiliency of power distribution network (PDN). This article proposes novel methods of scheduling of battery energy storage system (BESS) and loads of microgrid to enhance the resiliency of PDN. A mixed-integer linear programming model is developed to minimize the energy mismatch between available resources and critical loads during outage period. The proposed model is aimed at minimizing the shedding of high critical loads (hcl) and maximizing the serving time of hcl during outages. In order to increase the longevity of the load serving, the fuzzy-based approach is developed to control the C_rate of the BESS. Moreover, to increase the resiliency of hcl, partitioning of BESS capacity is proposed, which provides more flexibility for charging/discharging control of the BESS. The concept of variable dispatch interval is introduced to reduce the frequent switching of loads. By considering the reactive power, an apparent power resiliency metric is proposed to quantify the resiliency of PDN. The IEEE 33-bus network is tested under various restoration periods in order to verify the performance of the proposed methodology in the MATLAB environment.},

To support the business lifecycle, organizations also need to monitor the actual processes during run time and not only in their design time. Standard compliance verification is important in the lifecycle for reasons, such as detection of noncompliance as well as operational decisions of running processes. With the promotion of connectivity of systems, existing and new security standards can be employed but there are important aspects, such as technically measurable indicators, in the standards and automation of compliance verification that need to be addressed. This article presents an automated and continuous standard compliance verification framework used to check devices, systems, and services for standard compliance during secure onboarding and run time.

The basis of the proposed scheme is to minimize the total transmit power subject to a predetermined target localization accuracy requirement, where the target localization accuracy is evaluated with the Crámer–Rao lower bound. Subsequently, the PABARNS scheme results in a mixed nonlinear Boolean-nonconvex optimization problem. In view of the unique feature of the optimization model, a two-step technique based on the heuristic algorithm and alternating direction method of multipliers method is presented to solve the underlying optimization problem, with merit of that it is more workable than other existing approaches when the power and bandwidth lie in any bound set.

  abstract     = {Ensuring the security of cloud storage services is an ongoing challenge, due to the increasingly complex and dynamic threat landscape. One particular challenge is how to design security and efficient data encryption approaches. For example, the key used to encrypt data is generally a string of long random number, and this key is uploaded to the cloud server for security. The threshold password authentication secret sharing (TPASS) protocol is commonly used to save encryption keys. However, existing TPASS protocols may not fully achieve the desired security and efficiency levels due to the complexity of the protocol design. Hence, in this article, we propose an efficient dual-server secret sharing protocol (DssP) based on password authentication for cloud storage services. In our approach, users only need to remember a simple password to achieve random key access through dual server cooperation. We then mathematically prove that DssP meets the security requirements, and also evaluate its performance to show that it has less computational and communication overheads than other similar protocols.},

  abstract     = {This article presents a crowd monitoring system based on the passive detection of probe requests. The system meets strict privacy requirements and is suited to monitoring events or buildings with a least a few hundred attendees. We present our counting process and an associated mathematical model. From this model, we derive a concentration inequality that highlights the accuracy of our crowd count estimator. Then, we describe our system. We present and discuss our sensor hardware, our computing system architecture, and an efficient implementation of our counting algorithm—as well as its space and time complexity. We also show how our system ensures the privacy of people in the monitored area. Finally, we validate our system using nine weeks of data from a public library endowed with a camera-based counting system, which generates counts against which we compare those of our counting system. This comparison empirically quantifies the accuracy of our counting system, thereby showing it to be suitable for monitoring public areas. Similarly, the concentration inequality provides a theoretical validation of the system.},

  abstract     = {The inappropriate mechanism designs for demand response (DR) in the community of microgirds (CoMGs) may cause massive problems, such as increase of consumers’ costs, rebound peaks, and thereby lack of optimality in the network. In this article, a bilevel energy management system (EMS) is proposed to tackle the challenges associated with DR programs for CoMGs. The current structure successfully models users’ behavior and dissatisfaction in the first level of optimization to develop best DR program for each of them. Moreover, in the second level, power system constraints are taken into account to prevent voltage and current deviation from their statutory limits. Each user is assumed to be part of a microgrid (MG) whose operation is controlled and optimized through its local EMS in the first level. On the other hand, the overall operation of all MGs is delegated to the whole system operator, which acts as the central EMS (CEMS) in the second level. An iterative transactive energy management method is proposed by CEMS to fairly limit the excess power of the MGs one day ahead for voltage and current regulation. The obtained results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed structure in preventing discomfort issues, voltage deviation and creation of the rebound peaks in the system.},

  abstract     = {Photovoltaic (PV) systems have been gaining popularity among distribution network engineers. The integration of these small-scale sources has a variety of benefits for the distribution network. One of the most important benefits is the power loss reduction. However, a high penetration level of PV systems may disrupt the protection coordination of conventional overcurrent relays of the distribution network, reducing the profit of the electricity distribution company (EDC) due to healthy feeder de-energization. This paper determines the optimal penetration level of PV systems in the distribution network considering both power loss reduction profit and protection miscoordination cost to maximize the profit of the EDC. The merits of the proposed methodology are verified through several case studies on a simulation model of the IEEE 33-bus test system in the Electrical Transient Analyzer Program (ETAP) environment considering the reliability data of the IEEE Roy Billinton Test System.},

Quantifying the capacity while considering network security and the local renewable accommodation policy is a challenge. This article proposes a scenario-based bilevel mathematical model using a Bayesian integrated optimization method to evaluate and quantify the connectable capacity of distributed wind generation in distribution networks, which effectively integrates the characteristics of wind power and the local accommodation policy. The constraint on the generation curtailment ratio (CR) is innovatively designed to represent the renewable accommodation policy and integrated with network security constraints to coordinatively quantify the capacity. The model is solved by the Bayesian integrated optimization method. The regression-based algorithm greatly reduces the complexity of alternating iteration and improves the calculation efficiency. Practical cases are used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Results indicate that the method is more efficient than traditional optimization algorithms, and CR integration ensures that the connectable capacity fits local renewable energy development policies well.},

This framework is a multiobjective optimization, in which the amount of curtailed energy, the number of switching actions, and the vulnerability of operational components are selected as the main criteria for decision-making process. The optimization problem is formulated in the form of a stochastic mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem. In this article, a windstorm event followed by flooding is analyzed as a two-phase natural disaster. In this regard, the uncertainties associated with gust-wind speed, floodwater depths, and load demands are taken into account by the proposed framework. The initial configurations of islands are formed just ahead of the storm event (first stage), and their borders are changed in the second stage, which is associated with the storm event and its aftermath. The final configurations of islands are determined by the third stage once the uncertainties of floodwater depths are revealed. In the proposed framework, the emergency generators (EGs) are assumed to be prone to flooding, and a novel approach is proposed for quantifying the flood-related failure probability of EGs. Likewise, overhead distribution structures are recognized as vulnerable components to storms. The proposed framework is implemented on a test system, and its effectiveness is investigated and verified through seven case studies.},

Adaptive modulation and coding is considered at the physical layer along with video layer aware automatic repeat request (VLA-ARQ) at the link layer. The VLA-ARQ scheme is aware of video characteristics. Scalable video coding (SVC) based video streaming is carried out at the application layer. A novel cognitive radio network frame structure is proposed accommodating cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS), relaying primary user’s (PU) transmission, and secondary users’ (SU) opportunistic transmission to maximize quality of experience (QoE) and to minimize total power consumption. In SVC-based video streaming, successful reception of a particular video layer is dependent upon the successful reception of its higher layers, which influences the eventual QoE at the user end. A set of optimal values of CSS time duration, sensing decision threshold, cooperation, and transmission power control are obtained under the constraints of detection reliability, PU spectrum efficiency, and SU power budget. Extensive simulation results with respect to the system parameters show the efficacy of the proposed system. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed technique offers more than 14\% gain in overall utility with the proposed CSS and cross-layer parameter optimization strategy.},

  abstract     = {By combining independent systems (e.g., financial systems, power infrastructure, transportation networks), systems of systems (SoSs) can provide additional services. The ability to withstand faults, minimize service disruption, and efficiently recover (resilience) is a key performance characteristic. Current resilience metrics, however, require improvement. Each SoSs is approached with different assumptions about fault magnitude and recovery strategy. Thus, engineers currently have difficulty answering the basic question: Between alternative designs A and B, which is more resilient? SoS resilience metrics should reflect that the system interfaces are the most potent leverage point, have a standardized fault and recovery strategy, incorporate SoS dynamics, and apply to both natural and artificial systems of systems. In response, we develop the system of systems resilience metric (SoSRM). SoSRM methodology uses the definition of SoS to identify appropriate fault locations and graph theory to define fault and recovery duration. SoSRM is applied to two case studies to demonstrate application. First, an intertidal oyster reef ecosystem&#39;s system dynamics model is presented to demonstrate SoSRM methodology. Next, a military SoS demonstrates the application of SoSRM to a stochastic multi-agent system. Validation simulations show that SoSRM reflects expected fault impact and that methodological choices for fault duration do not drive SoSRM results. This article presents a new design tool capable of comparing the resilience between two SoS architectures.},

However, the required massive dataset for a deep learning model in a robot system easily leads to privacy leakage. There have been few reports on privacy-preserving deep learning models, and none on multikeys, in robot systems. Existing privacy-preserving deep learning schemes in multiple keys have low efficiency and high interactions in non-robotic environments. To address these issues, this article proposes a privacy-preserving deep learning model with homomorphic re-encryption (PDLHR) and secure calculation tools in a robot system. The proposed re-encryption scheme is based on the Bresson-Catalano-Pointcheval (BCP) cryptosystem, which solves the multiple keys question, keeps the homomorphic nature, and is more simplified than the existing re-encryption scheme based on the BCP cryptosystem. The secure calculation tools are designed to realize efficient ciphertext computations. Compared to the previous work, PDLHR decreases the interactions in the decryption process, improves the ciphertext training efficiency, and preserves the privacy of input data, training model, and inference results. Security analysis and performance evaluations demonstrate that the proposed scheme realizes security, efficiency, and effectiveness with low communication and computation costs.},

Existing mechanisms either use a trusted third party (TTP) or location perturbation techniques. In TTP-based mechanisms, when the security of a TTP is compromised, the user’s privacy is breached. On the other hand, in location perturbation-based mechanisms, privacy is achieved at the expense of query accuracy. To overcome these problems, in this article, a novel smart-area-selection (SAS)-based location privacy protection algorithm is proposed. The proposed approach does not require the user to trust any party including LBS. The proposed efficient mechanism achieves privacy without compromising the accuracy of the query. Furthermore, our SAS-based mechanism uses a user-specific geographical coordinate system and public key encryption for additional security. In the existing location privacy protection mechanisms, when LBSs are accessed continuously, more location information can be extracted by a smart adversary. A specially designed query region spreading algorithm is used in the proposed mechanism to overcome this problem. The validity of the proposed SAS-based location privacy protection mechanism is demonstrated by simulation results.},

Afterward, the nonlinear synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE)-based XGBoost is used to classify the islanding (I) and nonislanding (NI) events with the following characteristics: high accuracy, good sensitivity, and faster speed. Here, the SMOTE is used as an offline prefeature processing approach to reduce the unbalancing/uncertainty of “I” and “NI” classes and helps the intelligent classifier to impart a fair classification result.

  abstract     = {Inthis article, we propose a novel, model-independent, unified detection strategy based on disagreement Laplacian potential for effective identification of cyber anomalies in interconnected autonomous direct current (dc) microgrid (MG) clusters. This interconnection enables inter and intra-microgrid power exchange between them, thereby rendering efficient and maximum utilisation of the distributed energy resources. However, these clusters are vulnerable to cyber intrusion that disrupt the power sharing schemes. As such, we have investigated the effect of false data injections at various vulnerable points, including both voltage and current sensors in primary, and data transmission points in the distributed secondary, local, and global tertiary layers. Simultaneously, a logical evaluation in the form of data-integrity indices are formulated from the outcomes of the proposed detection scheme to provide for their timely mitigation. Ultimately a fault-ride through operation of the converters is achieved instead of alienating the misbehaving component, unlike previously reported works.},

The IBI is considered as the main TDS-OFDM drawback in the harsh long-delay underwater acoustic (UWA) multipath channel. This article proposes a new scheme called X-transform time-domain synchronous index modulation (IM) OFDM to eliminate the TDS-OFDM IBI, explore the multipath diversity, and reduce the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). Particularly, X-transform, which merges the discrete Hartley transform and discrete Fourier transform in a very low-complexity unitary matrix, and IM techniques have been employed to remove the effects of IBI existing in underwater acoustic (UWA) TDS-OFDM. Moreover, compressive sensing has been adopted to guarantee a reliable UWA channel estimation based on a guard interval IBI-free region. The proposed scheme is evaluated over simulated and experimental UWA channels. The computer simulation and the real experiment show the outperformance of the proposed scheme in terms of bit error rate, computational complexity, PAPR, energy efficiency, and spectral efficiency over its conventional benchmarks.},

The heterogeneity of the networks, devices, and services introduces serious vulnerabilities to security, especially distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, which exploit massive IoT devices to exhaust both network and victim resources. As such, this article proposes FOGshield, which is a localized DDoS prevention framework leveraging the federated computing power of the fog computing-based access networks to deploy multiple smart endpoint defenders at the border of relevant attack-source/destination networks. Cooperation among the smart endpoint defenders is supervised by a central orchestrator. The central orchestrator localizes each smart endpoint defender by feeding appropriate training parameters into its self-organizing map component, based on the attacking behavior. Performance of the FOGshield framework is verified using three typical IoT traffic scenarios. Numerical results reveal that the FOGshield outperforms existing solutions.},

This article explores connections between network topology and reliability, and proposes a graph-based approach to enhance the reliability of distribution systems by installing new tie-lines. The problem is cast here as an edge-connectivity augmentation problem, with 2-edge connectivity being desired to ensure service restoration under the outage of any single line in the network. However, in practice, such a target may not be economical or feasible. Therefore, a systematic optimization framework is presented in this article to model partial augmentations to the system for improving the reliability at a select subset of nodes. This approach allows for selectively strengthening parts of the network based on connectivity requirements. The article also proposes the use of graph-based metrics to characterize the reliability of distribution networks. Applications of the approach to realistic distribution test systems demonstrate its effectiveness in identifying line additions that can favorably impact system reliability. Numerical results also quantify the reliability improvement achievable through partial augmentation.},

  abstract     = {Motion cueing algorithm (MCA) is used to reproduce the realistic driving motion feeling for the user of the virtual vehicle using linear acceleration and angular velocity motion signals while respecting the physical constrains of the simulation-based motion platform. Classical washout filter is the most common and commercial type of the MCA because of easy tuning, short processing time, and simplicity. The classical washout filter is a conservative method in using workspace because of the worst-case scenario tuning technique. Also, the existing adaptive washout filter based on time-varying cut-off frequency does not consider the dexterity of the motion platform as considering this factor leads to use the high acceleration areas of the platform workspace. In this article, an adaptive washout filter is designed and developed based on time-varying cut-off frequency using dexterity and direction monitoring factors to use the available high acceleration areas of the platform for better generation of the high-frequency part of the motion signal. The proposed adaptive washout filter is composed of three fuzzy logic units for each mode including longitudinal, lateral, yaw, and heave and each unit has two inputs including motion sensation error between the real vehicle driver and user of the motion platform and the weight of the end-effector which is a parameter based on dexterity and current position of the end-effector. Each fuzzy logic unit has also one output which is the selected cut-off frequency of the related washout filter. The proposed adaptive washout filter uses the high dexterous areas of the workspace because it considers the dexterity of the motion platform in calculation of the end-effector weight as the second input of the fuzzy logic units. The proposed adaptive washout filter is validated in MATLAB/Simulink programming language and the experimental results indicate that the proposed adaptive washout filter performed better than existing adaptive and classical washout filters in terms of motion sensation error between the driver of real vehicle and the user of motion platform as well as usage of the platform workspace.},

In this article, a novel distributed energy resource management system (DERMS) solution is proposed by adopting the real-time optimal power flow approach for coordinated control of the distributed PV inverters. The proposed approach eliminates the dependence on load knowledge via measurement feedback correction, and it can be implemented in real time. One challenge is that the technique is sensitive to the data availability and integrity of voltage measurements. Therefore, a decentralized DERMS approach is developed by leveraging the concepts of state estimation. The framework and the effectiveness of the solution approach are numerically demonstrated on a real distribution feeder in Southern California.},

  abstract     = {The existing mission planning models for conventional agile Earth observation satellites assuming stable push-broom imaging cannot be directly adapted to newly developed superagile Earth observation satellites (SA-EOS) with dynamic imaging capabilities. To guarantee the application efficiency of SA-EOS, a novel mission planning modeling method for multipoint target imaging within a single pass (MTI-SP) is proposed. First, a two-step preprocessing method for point targets based on the “nonalong-track” characteristic of SA-EOS converts multiple point targets into imaging strips as an atomic mission for further planning. Then, a triple of decision variables is defined, i.e., the index of the imaging sequence of multiple strips, indices of the push-broom direction of the strips, and normalization coefficients of the imaging time of each endpoint of the strips, on the basis of the one-to-one correspondence between the triple and the imaging time. Third, an optimal MTI-SP mission planning model with two objective functions, namely maximizing the mission coverage benefit (MCB) and minimizing the mission completion time (MCT), is established by considering the imaging time window and attitude transition time. An improved particle swarm optimization algorithm is used for the MTI-SP solution. The results of comparison experiments indicate that the proposed model can achieve the maximum MCB with lower computational consumption. Compared with the two fixed push-broom sequence models and the independent point targets model, the MCT of the proposed model is improved by 47.1\%, 24.56\%, and 89.45\%, respectively. The experiment results show that the proposed modeling method can be further applied in ground operational systems of SA-EOS.},

For a comprehensive planning algorithm, other options, such as including static VAR compensators (SVCs), feeders upgrade, or adding distributed generators, are considered along with ESSs. Different scenarios are utilized to model the load variation, the renewable resources’ intermittency, and the market price fluctuation. The problem constraints include an ESS dynamic model that reflects the capacity and lifetime limitations. Different battery technologies with different costs and dynamic characteristics are compared. The network power flow model is added to account for the voltage level and feeders’ capacity. Power limits constraints are included for the DGs and SVCs as well. The optimization problem is formulated as a mixed-integer quadratic programming problem. To validate the proposed technique, a case study is conducted on a real 41-bus radial feeder in Ontario, Canada using real data for renewable sources, loads, and market prices.},

When full channel state information (CSI) is available to the transmitter and limited CSI is available to the receiver, an optimal precoding matrix is derived for GSTLC with linear combining that is based on the minimum mean square error (MMSE) criterion. Moreover, the detection signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) is derived corresponding to the optimal MMSE precoder. Using the SINR, we propose a receiver combining scheme that selects the best combining matrix, thereby minimizing the bit error rate (BER) from a codebook that includes candidate combining matrices. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed GSTLC with the optimal combiner achieves the theoretical lower bound of BER. In addition, we show that the GSTLC with combiner selection performs better than conventional precoded spatial multiplexing methods in terms of the BER.},

  abstract     = {In this article, various converters integrated with renewable sources to the utility grid along with its control strategies are proposed. The proposed system uses a buck–boost converter to extract maximum power from photovoltaic (PV) and maintain power balance between the system and utility grid through a voltage source converter (VSC) employing bidirectional power flow. The main feature of the buck–boost converter presented here is to boost the dc voltage of the load by integrating the PV and dc output of the VSC in series. Moreover, the boost converter is utilized to extract the maximum power from a wind source. Additionally, a voltage management scheme is proposed to achieve a regulated constant voltage magnitude higher than that of a conventional voltage source converter integrated with the utility grid. Besides, it can be realized using a conventional voltage source converter along with the existing renewable sources in the system. Finally, the proposed system is validated through simulation and experimental results under various operating conditions.},

However, we point out that this CLS scheme is insecure, and a malicious users can create a valid forged signature on any new message by performing public key replacement attacks. The security flaws of the underlying CLS scheme cause that the upper transaction scheme cannot keep its claimed security. In this article, we describe how this forgery attack works against the CLS scheme, which demonstrates that Yeh’s scheme cannot achieve its original security. Furthermore, to further solve the above-mentioned security flaws, a concrete construction of CLS scheme with improved security is presented. Our improved scheme can be rigorously proved using Forking lemma in the random oracle model, assuming that solving the discrete logarithm problem is infeasible. Finally, a secure transaction scheme for android-based mobile payments is proposed from our improved CLS scheme.},

Data aggregation is a fundamental computing service in edge computing. However, existing data aggregation schemes do not consider the problem of fine-grained data aggregation. Besides, most schemes use a pair-based signature scheme, which cannot meet the actual situation of limited resources of terminal devices. In this article, we propose a lightweight, fine-grained privacy-preserving data aggregation scheme. The terminal devices add the user’s characteristic identifier bit in the generated message. Therefore, the edge servers can combine the characteristic identifiers in the messages to perform fine-grained data aggregation according to the aggregation rule list to obtain aggregated data of multiple target groups. We also use the unpaired signature scheme based on the elliptic curve, which has a faster signature and verification speed. Also, we use masks to avoid the privacy leakage of user’s characteristic identifiers. According to the experiments, the computation and communication overhead of our scheme is low. Simultaneously, the cloud center can dynamically update the aggregation rule list sent to the edge server according to the demands.},

It provides the direction of arrival (DOA) information of the user equipment (UE) when it rotates, and thus, significantly reduces the overhead of beam searching. However, in digital beamforming (DBF), the transceivers are not designed based on DOAs, which makes it more challenging to utilize attitude information to reduce system overhead. In this article, we propose an attitude information aided DBF algorithm. Specifically, based on the clustered channel model, we derive the relationship between channel variation and the attitude of UE during the rotation. Furthermore, it is proved that only the transmitter at UE requires to be redesigned after the rotation, while the receiver at base station does not. Compared with the joint transceiver design, the performance loss is generally trivial. Therefore, we propose an AIA digital transmitter design algorithm for uplink transmission with equal power allocation. The spectral efficiency performance can approximate the optimal joint transceiver design performance without real-time channel state information. We also extend the method to unequal power allocation case and propose the algorithm with water-filling power allocation. Finally, simulation results are presented to examine the effectiveness of proposed algorithms.},

  abstract     = {The achievement of accurate and reliable localization is invariably a predominant bottleneck to the realization of shearer automation. Unfortunately, the positioning accuracy may significantly degrade and the yield may be unsatisfactory due to the existence of the line-of-sight (LOS), non-line-of-sight (NLOS) along with mixed LOS-NLOS situations in complicated under-ground environments. To address this issue, this article proposes a novel localization algorithm called GMM-NNIMM-CLMFO, which is a combination of the Gaussian mixture model (GMM), neural network (NN)-based interacting multiple model (NNIMM), Caffery localization (CL), and moth-flame optimization (MFO). The GMM is first used to re-estimate the range, and the variational Bayesian cubature Kalman filter with the assistance of NN under the IMM framework is then respectively employed to diminish the LOS and NLOS errors. Then, based on the result of GMM-NNIMM, the CL method is used to compute the position coordinates of the target node. Finally, the MFO algorithm is implemented to optimize the positioning outcome sourced from the GMM-NNIMM-CL method. The proposed method is evaluated by using P440 sensors, and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed technique is able to remarkably enhance the overall positioning accuracy, and outperforms other approaches. It can therefore efficiently alleviate the influence of NLOS errors and achieve more accurate position estimation, thereby manifesting better positioning performance and higher robustness in mixed LOS/NLOS situations.},

In this article, we design a novel feedforward neural networks (FFNNs) based data aggregation scheme that integrates the attributes of artificial intelligence to boost the computational intelligence of intra-BANNs for prolonged network lifetime. In the proposed scheme, data division and labeling are performed to transmit detected information using two different types of packets with different sizes to save energy resources and to avoid redundant data transmission. FFNN-based periodic data transmission exploits the fitness function approximation characteristics of FFNN to increase the transmission probability of critical information with minimum energy consumption and delay, whereas our proposed event-driven data transmission also ensures the transmission of high priority data with minimal delay and storage overhead. The detailed evaluation and comparison of our proposed framework with three existing schemes conducted using the Nano-Sim tool highlight that our proposed scheme performs 50\%–60\% better than state-of-the-art schemes in terms of residual energy, delay, and packet loss.},

  abstract     = {This article presents a distributed connectivity maintenance algorithm for a multiagent system composed of unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs). We consider a homogeneous network of UUVs that move on a 2-D plane with bounded linear speeds. The time-division multiple-access protocol, which is a commonly used communication protocol for UUVs, is used by the agents in the network to communicate with each other. Due to the communication constraints imposed by the protocol, the agents do not have access to the current positions of their neighbors. This presents a significant challenge in developing a connectivity maintenance algorithm that can be formally verified. Using only local information from an agent’s neighbors, the algorithm provides motion constraints for each agent in the network, which can then be used by each UUV’s motion planner to plan a connectivity-preserving reference trajectory. In addition to providing mathematical proofs expressed in a way that is typical in the systems and control community, we give formal proofs of the results that establish network connectivity for the presented algorithm under suitable assumptions on each agent’s motion planner and controller. The formal proofs are carried out using the KeYmaera X theorem prover, which is an interactive formal verification tool for hybrid systems. This article also highlights the utility of formal verification tools in identifying scenarios that could be overlooked when employing proofs that are not carried out in a formal system for complex distributed algorithms such as the one presented in this article.},

In such a situation, the selectivity of a protection scheme is crucial for maintaining an uninterrupted supply to customers. In this article, a q-axis component-based protection scheme is proposed for the distribution system with a PV plant. The method extracts the second-order harmonic components of q-axis voltage and current at relaying point for fault detection and direction identification. Using this direction information at both ends of a line segment to be protected, internal and external faults are discriminated. The performance of the proposed method is tested on 14-bus distribution system for various fault cases. A comparative analysis with existing techniques shows the strength of the proposed method. Hardware-in-loop testing using OPAL-RT simulator as system and Arduino NANO microcontroller as relay validates the performance of the proposed method in real-time.},

In the edge computing environment, the fixed edge equipment supplies computing services for adjacent IoT devices. Therefore, edge computing suffers location leakage as the connection and authentication records imply the location of IoT devices. This article focuses on the location awareness in the edge computing environment. We adopt the “deniability” of authentication to prevent location leakage when IoT devices connect to the edge nodes. In our solution, an efficient deniable authentication based on a two-user ring signature is constructed. The robustness of authentication makes the fixed edge equipment accept the legal end devices. Besides, the deniability of authentication cannot convince any third party that the fact of this authentication occurred as communication transcript is no longer an evidence for this connection. Therefore, it handles the inherent location risk in edge computing. Compared to efficient deniable authentications, our protocol saves 10.728\% and 14.696\% computational cost, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Disaggregation of resources is a datacenter strategy that aims to decouple the physical location of resources from the place where they are accessed, as opposed to physically attached devices connected to the Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCIe) bus. By attaching and detaching resources through a fast interconnection network, it is possible to increase the flexibility to manage datacenter infrastructures while keeping the performance of the pooled and disaggregated devices. This article introduces workload scheduling and placement policies for environments with disaggregated memories. These policies are driven by accurate prebuilt performance degradation models. We focus on the use of nonvolatile memory to store data and/or to provide memory extensions. Following a software-defined approach, persistent memories are combined to provide higher capacity and/or bandwidth devices, or used by multiple workloads to increase the number of running workloads. Different combinations of workloads and associated soft deadlines are used to evaluate the placement policies using a system simulator. When using the first-fit policy, results show that a disaggregated system can reduce missed deadlines up to 49\% when compared to a physically attached system. When our proposed policy with workload awareness is enabled in a disaggregated system, missed deadlines can be reduced up to 100\% (no deadlines missed).},

As eye-catching as this technology has been, data security remains one of the obstacles it faces since the wrongful use of data leads to several damages. In this article, we propose a proxy re-encryption approach to secure data sharing in cloud environments. Data owners can outsource their encrypted data to the cloud using identity-based encryption, while proxy re-encryption construction will grant legitimate users access to the data. With the Internet of Things devices being resource-constrained, an edge device acts as a proxy server to handle intensive computations. Also, we make use of the features of information-centric networking to deliver cached content in the proxy effectively, thus improving the quality of service and making good use of the network bandwidth. Further, our system model is based on blockchain, a disruptive technology that enables decentralization in data sharing. It mitigates the bottlenecks in centralized systems and achieves fine-grained access control to data. The security analysis and evaluation of our scheme show the promise of our approach in ensuring data confidentiality, integrity, and security.},

However, after outsourcing data to the cloud, data owners have limited control of their data, and external systems are incorporated to manage it. Several research-based solutions use encryption techniques to prevent unauthorized access to the data but ignore the challenge of maintaining the trace of valid changes applied to the data. Provenance data can be used to ascertain the integrity of data and, therefore, should be immutable and secured from adversaries since it contains private information. This article proposes an efficient way of securing access logs by leveraging blockchain. A generic framework is designed, tested, and evaluated, with results showing our model can effectively enhance the security of provenance data. This work considers two categories of data users and account for the distinct roles and permitted actions on the outsourced data.

In this article, we aim to utilize the MEC facilities integrated with time-varying renewable energy resources for charging/discharging scheduling known as green scheduling of on-move electric vehicles (EVs) in a geographical wide area comprising of multiple charging stations (CSs). In the proposed system, the charging/discharging demands and the contextual information of EVs are first transmitted to nearby edge servers. With instantaneous electricity load/pricing and the availability of renewable energy at nearby CSs collected by aggregators, a weighted social-welfare maximization problem is then solved at the edges using greedy-based algorithms to choose the best CS for the EV’s service. From the system point of view, our results reveal that compared to cloud-based scheme, the proposed MEC-assisted EVs scheduling system significantly improves the complexity burden, boosts the satisfaction (QoE) of EVs’ drivers by localizing the traffic at nearby CSs, and further helps to efficiently utilize the renewable energy across CSs. Furthermore, our greedy-based algorithm, which utilizes the internal updating heuristics, outperforms some baseline solutions in terms of social welfare and power grid ancillary services.},

The quadrotor system is divided into an underactuated position and the fully actuated attitude subsystem. A single hidden layer feed-forward neural network is used for the estimation of unknown dynamics associated with the attitude subsystem. Moreover, a nonlinear disturbance observer is designed to tackle the unknown bounded external disturbances acting on the attitude subsystem by supplying its estimation in the control laws that help in mitigating the chattering phenomena. The proposed methodology ensures the finite-time convergence of the tracking error and does not prone to the singularity problem in control. The closed-loop finite-time stability is investigated using the Lyapunov theory. Besides, an expression for the convergence time has been derived. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is initially assessed using numerical simulations for the way-point tracking as well as circle tracking tasks and then validated in real-time using DJI Matrice 100 by performing a lemniscate tracking task. To show the superiority of the proposed methodology over existing methods, a comparative study has been done and found the improved tracking performance in the proposed approach.},

In VANETs, signed messages need to be authenticated by roadside units in a very short time. Certificateless aggregate signature (CLAS) scheme has been considered as one of the promising solutions to solve the problem of limited network bandwidth and computing power in VANETs environment. In this article, we propose an efficient pairing-free CLAS, named eCLAS, which is suitable for communication between vehicle to infrastructure. The aggregated signature allows individual signature on different messages from different vehicles to be aggregated into one short signature. In the random oracle model, the security of the scheme is proved by the adaptive selection message attack and the difficulty of computation of discrete logarithm problem on the elliptic curve. Additionally, the security analysis shows that the proposed scheme can meet security requirements in VANETs. Compared with existing schemes, the result demonstrates that our scheme has obvious advantages in signature verification, thereby granting it better applicability.},

Moreover, to reduce the switching losses in the power electronics converter, the nearest level modulation technique has been adopted, increasing overall efficiency. Furthermore, a modified multilevel inverter has been presented for grid integration, which requires a reduced number of switching components and isolated dc sources. In addition, system stability and sensitivity analysis are presented to evaluate the performance of the controller. The proposed scheme reduces the harmonic content in the grid current and the steady-state error in the grid injected power.

Our purpose is to maximize system energy efficiency with the preferential use of renewable energy under several practical restrictions, such as limited battery capacity, energy causality, quality-of-service (QoS) requirement, and transmit power constraints. An offline policy is first presented under ideal assumptions, i.e., noncausal knowledge of the channel state information and energy harvesting dynamics are known in advance, which causes it to become a performance upper bound. In particular, the offline policy is designed in an iterative manner with the use of the fractional programming technique. Moreover, inspired by the offline policy, we exploit statistical information to present two practical online algorithms. Specifically, the Markov chain method predicts prospective information through use of the finite-state Markov model, whereas the timing detection scheme focuses only on the resource optimization of the current time slot. Numerical results illustrate that both online algorithms perform closely to the offline policy, which indicates that they can achieve a good tradeoff between performance and implementation complexity.},

  abstract     = {Accurate locating of the faulty section is desired in dc microgrid due to the presence of power electronic converters and low-impedance cables. Some of the existing schemes consider power sources at only one end of the line; thus, assume that the fault current is injected from only one end of the line. This assumption is not true in the case of meshed dc microgrids, where fault current would be supplied from both ends. Moreover, existing communication-based methods require either a fast communication network or data synchronization. To address the aforementioned issues, this article proposes a novel local fault location scheme for meshed dc microgrids. Low- and high-impedance faults are located by measuring the current by localized intelligent electronic device. Based on the parameter estimation approach, the fault location is estimated by sampling the peak values of the fault current. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is evaluated based on offline digital time-domain simulations in MATLAB/Simulink software environment for a meshed test microgrid system and experimentally verified by implementing in a laboratory-scale hardware setup. Comparing the proposed method with other existing methods proves the effectiveness of the proposed technique for different types of faults.},

Because the MMC has an additional degree of freedom, an alternative control philosophy has recently been proposed, in which the dc-bus voltage is controlled through the dc-side power. In this paper, a comparison of these control approaches is presented and their main differences are described. Considering the increasing requirements imposed by system operators to converter-interfaced systems, guidelines are also given to provide supplementary services such as virtual inertia provision, short-term frequency support, virtual capacitor emulation, and oscillation damping. The provided insights are useful for selecting the appropriate MMC control strategy and for developing new supplementary controls for facilities based on the MMC topology.},

  abstract     = {Credit system is generally associated with the banking and financial institutions, although it has far reaching implications for residents of countries, such as U.S., particularly for those with a poor credit history. Specifically, a credit score computation (CSC) quantifies an individual’s credit value or credit risk, which is used by banking and financial institutions, as well as other entities (e.g., during purchasing of insurance policies and application of rental properties), to facilitate their decision-making (e.g., whether to approve the insurance policy purchase or the level of premium). Although a number of CSC models have been proposed in the literature for supporting different application scenarios, privacy protection of CSC is rarely considered despite the potential for leakage of user private information (e.g., registration, hobbies, credit, relationships, and inquiry). Such information can then be abused for other nefarious activities, such as identity theft and credit card fraud. Thus, in this article, we first analyze the privacy strength of existing CSC models, prior to presenting the formal definition of a privacy-preserving CSC system alongside its security requirements. Then, we propose a concrete construction based on Paillier encryption with three proposed noninteractive zero-knowledge schemes. To demonstrate feasibility of our proposal, we evaluate both its security and performance.},

  abstract     = {Synchrophasor technology has been very effective in addressing complex protection problems. Based on the experimental study of the impact of denial-of-service (DoS) cyberattacks on synchrophasor-assisted protection scheme, “adaptive dependability/security bias protection scheme,” a DoS pre-emptive and detection framework is presented in this article. The suggested structure helps in the identification of different types of DoS attacks (targeting data availability) and address resolution protocol (ARP) spoofing (compromising data confidentiality) via unique fingerprints developed using Wireshark network data. Redundant PDC datastream and random data path selector module (RDPS) in the framework help reduce the probability of a successful DoS attack. However, during a successful attack, the framework ensures that a healthy PDC datastream is used by the end application. The proposed methodology&#39;s efficacy has been verified using a western system coordinating council 9 bus, and IEEE 39 bus test systems on the real-time digital simulator (RTDS) based cyberphysical wide area measurement system testbed with industrial standard hardware phasor measurement units (PMUs). The results show that the proposed framework can effectively improve the performance of the synchrophasor-based adaptive dependability/security bias scheme during DoS attacks and avoid maloperation of the protective devices, which enhances the power system&#39;s stability.},

We aim to minimize the energy consumption of all users by optimizing the resource allocation (including power and computation resources) and subchannel assignment, subject to the given latency constraint. The formulated problem, however, is a nonconvex combinatorial optimization problem. Nevertheless, we decompose the problem into a resource allocation subproblem and a subchannel assignment subproblem, and then solve the two subproblems iteratively. On one hand, we investigate the hidden convexity of the resource allocation subproblem under the optimal conditions, and propose an efficient algorithm to optimally allocate the resources by dual decomposition methods. On the other hand, we formulate the subchannel assignment subproblem into an integer linear programming problem and strictly prove that the problem is nondeterministic polynomial-time hard. We then solve it optimally by branch-and-bound methods, which is shown to be efficient in extensive simulations. Moreover, through considerable simulation results, we show that our proposed algorithm helps greatly reduce users’ energy consumption when communication resources (e.g., bandwidth) are limited. Additionally, it is verified that NOMA outperforms orthogonal multiple access in multiuser latency-sensitive MEC systems.},

  abstract     = {Prosumers are agents that both consume and produce energy. This article studies the optimal energy management of a residential prosumer which consists of a renewable power plant and an energy storage unit. Energy could stream among power grid, renewable plant, storage unit, and demand, providing a highly flexible energy supply and the opportunity of arbitrage. To capture the uncertainty of renewable generation and electricity price, as well as the rolling horizon feature of the multiperiod energy management, the problem is formulated as a robust data-driven dynamic programming (RDDP). Kernel regression is utilized to build the empirical conditional distribution in a data-driven manner, and all candidates that reside in a Wasserstein metric-based ambiguity set are taken into account to tackle the inexactness of the empirical distribution. The RDDP can be transformed into a series of convex optimization problems with cost-to-go functions in their constraints. The piecewise linear expression of the cost-to-go function is retrieved from dual linear programs. Through such an analytical expression of cost-to-go functions, the RDDP can be solved via backward induction, unlike the popular stochastic dual dynamic programming technique that incorporates forward and backward passes. Case studies validate the performance and advantage of the proposed RDDP approach.},

  abstract     = {Increased electrification in the residential and transport sectors is changing the energy demand profiles significantly, which results in reshaped peak demand. These changes in demand profiles can cause grid overloading and jeopardize network reliability especially when the excessive use of electricity within a network is uncoordinated. In this article, an aggregated coordination mechanism is proposed for electric vehicle (EV) charge–discharge scheduling to manage the peak demand in the low-voltage (LV) residential networks. The proposed model uses mixed-integer-programming-based optimization approach to minimize the cost of energy while managing the peak demand and complying with grid constraints. A stochastic model is presented to account for the uncertainties associated with forecast inaccuracies of the day-ahead scheduling. The proposed strategy is assessed by means of simulation studies considering an LV residential neighborhood in Sydney, Australia. The results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy to minimize the cost of electricity for the EV owners while managing the peak demand for the grid operators. Comparison with the state-of-the-art EV scheduling strategies indicates that the proposed strategy can improve the load factor of the local network up to 36\%, the peak-to-average ratio up to 27\%, and cost reductions up to 56\%.},

This has led to concerns being raised regarding the security of the supply of the Portuguese electric system as well as concerns relating to system inertia. Deploying and efficiently using various flexibility options is proposed as a solution to these concerns. Among these flexibility options proposed is the use of battery energy storage systems (BESSs) as well as relaxing system inertia constraints such as the system nonsynchronous penetration (SNSP). This article proposes a stochastic mixed-integer linear programming problem formulation, which examines the effects of deploying BESS in a power system. The model is deployed on a real-world test case and results show that the optimal use of BESS can reduce system costs by as much as 10\% relative to a baseline scenario and the costs are reduced further when the SNSP constraint is relaxed. The amount of RES curtailment is also reduced with the increased flexibility of the power system through the use of BESS. Thus, the efficiency of the Portuguese transmission system is greatly increased by the use of flexibility measures, primarily the use of BESS.},

Different from the existing results, the side information is adopted synergistically besides the intercepted data. Meanwhile, the attacker needs to remain stealthy to the false-data detector. We analyze the performance degradation of system under the proposed attack strategy by deriving the remote estimation error covariance recursion. With the stealthiness constraint, the optimal stealthy attack can be obtained by solving a convex optimization problem accordingly. Besides, we provide a specific algorithm to calculate the falsified measurements. Finally, the effectiveness of explored attack strategy is demonstrated via simulation examples.},

This article proposes a method based on model predictive control (MPC) and artificial neural networks (ANNs) to detect and mitigate the FDIA in dc microgrids that are formed by parallel dc–dc converters. The proposed MPC/ANN-based strategy shows how MPC and ANNs can be coordinated to provide a secure control layer to detect and remove the FDIAs in the dc microgrid. In the proposed strategy, an ANN plays the role of the estimator to implement in the cyber-attack detection and mitigation strategy. The proposed method is examined under different conditions, physical events and cyber disturbances (i.e. load changing and communication delay, and time-varying attack), and the results of the MPC-based scheme is compared with conventional proportional-integral controllers. The obtained results show the effectiveness of the proposed strategy to detect and mitigate the attack in dc microgrids.},

  abstract     = {The conventional over/under voltage, over/under frequency based anti-islanding protection scheme presents significant nondetection zone (NDZ) under critical loading conditions of distribution networks. To overcome this challenge, a unique hybrid technique has been proposed in this article for the anti-islanding protection of distributed generators (DGs). The algorithm requires the injection of an active oscillatory disturbance signal of very small magnitude through the current control loop along the direct axis of the synchronously rotating reference frame of the converter. Small signal stability analysis of the system is carried out to analyze the effect of such active signal injection having different frequencies. The anti-islanding protection algorithm first involves the superimposition of d-axis voltage. Thereafter, two novel indexes are proposed based on which the trip signal logic is developed for the protection scheme. The methodology has been found to detect an unintentional islanding scenario within 90 ms from the initiation instant. The efficacy of the proposed hybrid anti-islanding protection scheme is tested under various abnormal operating conditions by performing simulations on the CIGRE LV test system. Experimental validation of the proposed methodology has also been carried out in Controller Hardware-in-the-Loop (CHIL) platform using Typhoon HIL 602+ and Speedgoat baseline real-time target machine.},

  abstract     = {In a wireless cellular system, resource allocation among active users is a challenging task. The cellular systems with nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) solve the problem of bandwidth and time allocation. All the active users in the same NOMA cluster are allowed to access the complete cluster bandwidth at the same time. However, power allocation in NOMA is a multiconstraint optimization problem. The complexity of power allocation increases with the increase in the number of users inside the cluster. This article presents a novel technique for power allocation in a NOMA downlink cluster, using the magic sum of the magic matrix. The sum throughput (SUMTP) and the min–max fairness index (MMFI) are calculated and compared with an existing method for the downlink NOMA system. The proposed method shows comparable SUMTP performance to the conventional optimized method while ensuring better MMFI. We observed an inverse association between SUMTP and MMFI. In addition, the execution time of the proposed method is much lesser than that of the conventional optimized method owing to lower number of flops required for magic-matrix-based power allocation.},

  abstract     = {A novel scheduling algorithm supporting mixed unicast and multicast traffic and featured by the longest virtual queue first (LVQF) was proposed for combined input and crosspoint queued (CICQ) architecture. Considering the differences between unicast and multicast traffic, LVQF takes the virtual queue length as the weight value for unicast and multicast queues. The weight setting of LVQF coordinates the fairness of unicast and multicast scheduling efficiently. Moreover, the design of LVQF is characterized by approaching the inherent work-conserving of the output queued architecture. By balancing the occupancy of crosspoint buffers, LVQF maintains the switch operating in a work-conserving state to the largest extend. By introducing the traffic regulation module in CICQ, an enhanced approaching work-conserving (AWC) algorithm developed from LVQF (AWC-LVQF) is proposed to further approach the work-conserving state. Simulation results demonstrate that LVQF and AWC-LVQF algorithms can significantly improve the average latency performance with respect to the existing popular algorithms for CICQ switch. In particular, the performance improvement enlarges as the ratio of multicast traffic increases.},

The American Heart Association CPR guidelines recently have an increased focus on quality of consistent chest compressions and highlighted the need for frequent refresher courses. Literature has shown that standard training manikins do not accurately represent human torso compression forces. Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technologies can simulate or enhance training environments and have shown promise for CPR training. Haptics is the touch element of virtual experiences and the literature has suggested that haptics can produce higher fidelity force feedback over standard training manikins. This review aims to determine the state of research of virtual and AR and haptic-enabled CPR training systems. VR approaches examined feedback, visual kinesthetic manipulation, and gamification. Systems using AR have examined the potential benefits of real-time feedback and quick reference. Haptic approaches have examined different mechanisms and design principles for reproducing realistic human CPR. Hybrid systems explore collaborative training and methods for immersion. These systems offer the potential for immersive training and realistic haptic rendering. However, to reach widespread adoption they must overcome the limitations of cost and mechanical complexity.},

The advent of 5G and fog computing architectures also facilitates applications of IoV and makes the enormous IoV data outsourcing and sharing in cloud and fog more convenient. However, the data outsourcing and sharing will incur many security concerns to IoV including data leakage and breach as the users cannot direct control their data. To guarantee IoV data security, a novel scheme is proposed for IoV data sharing with high efficiency. In our scheme, we utilize ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) to achieve confidentiality and fine-grained access control for IoV data shared in cloud and fog. Nevertheless, as another intrinsic feature in IoV environment, the dynamicity in a group of connected vehicles brings some challenges to our scheme. To deal with this situation, we bring forward a concept of auditable user revocation for CP-ABE to adapt to the dynamic vehicle groups. Moreover, online/offline and verifiable outsourcing techniques are leveraged to improve the efficiency and guarantee the correctness of decryption. At the end, we demonstrate the security and efficiency for our scheme by giving detailed security analysis and performance evaluation with extensive experiments.},

  abstract     = {Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks have always been a nightmare for network infrastructure for the last two decades. Existing network infrastructure is lacking in identifying and mitigating the attack due to its inflexible nature. Currently, software-defined networking (SDN) is more popular due to its ability to monitor and dynamically configure network devices based on the global view of the network. In SDN, the control layer is accountable for forming all decisions in the network and data plane for just forwarding the message packets. The unique property of SDN has brought a lot of excitement to network security researchers for preventing DDoS attacks. In this article, for the identification of DDoS attacks in the OpenFlow controller, a probabilistic technique with a central limit theorem has been utilized. This method primarily detects resource depletion attacks, for which the DARPA dataset is used to train the probabilistic model. In different attack scenarios, the probabilistic approach outperforms the entropy-based method in terms of false negative rate (FNR). The emulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the approach, by reducing the FNR by 98\% compared to 78\% in the existing entropy mechanism, at 50\% attack rate.},

More specifically, with the aid of union bound technique, a general performance analysis framework of the OSM system with channel estimation errors is proposed. Based on the above analysis framework, the upper bounds of bit error rate for the static and dynamic modes of OSM are both derived, respectively. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the analytical bounds are tight for a wide range of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and variable system configurations.},

This article introduces a strategy for enhancing transient stability margin of active distribution networks with high penetration of electric vehicles (EVs). The proposed optimization strategy intends to control EVs contributions during transient stability conditions. The EVs contributions are controlled through a new index proposed based on the system&#39;s total corrected critical kinetic energy (TCCKE). The proposed procedure for TCCKE calculation is driven by a hybrid algorithm taking into account the equal area criterion and sensitivity analysis. The suggested procedure for TCCKE only depends on the during fault data and as a result, the proposed optimization strategy is useful to prevent transient instability in the case of first swing instability. The proposed optimization is applied and evaluated on the IEEE test systems. The results clearly demonstrate the applicability and efficacy during a multitude of fault and emergency conditions.},

For this evaluation, variable bit rates (VBR)s for WH-SFBMC are considered for transmission in 3-state Fontan land mobile satellite suburban environment. Further, symbol error rate (SER) and spectral efficiency are analyzed based on the obtained SINR expressions. Such analyses are conducted to support VBR quality of service (QoS) in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-based digital video broadcasting standards utilizing ISTBS. Furthermore, pilot-based channel estimation error variance is evaluated for VBR WH-SFBMC. Later, block-by-block system computational complexity of VBR WH-SFBMC, perfect reconstruction (PR)-filterbank multicarrier (FBMC), and OFDM schemes are evaluated. It is shown that, VBR WH-SFBMC is rate-dependent and relatively more complex system than single rate PR-FBMC and OFDM. However, the SER performance of WH-SFBMC is illustrated to outperform PR-FBMC and OFDM significantly even for higher bit rates in presence of CFO and PHN.

  abstract     = {We consider secure downlink multiple-input–multiple-output (MIMO) communications between a transmitter and multiple users when there exists a passive eavesdropper. A downlink main channel between the transmitter and a user is estimated through uplink pilot symbols in a time-division duplex mode. On the other hand, to hinder an eavesdropper from estimating the eavesdropper channel between the transmitter and the eavesdropper, the transmitter does not send any pilot symbols. The main channel is hence available at the transmitter only, while the eavesdropper channel is unavailable at any node. Assuming these channel state information (CSI) conditions, we propose a MIMO transmission method using space–time line code (STLC) with artificial noise (AN) for enhancing the physical layer security. The STLC enables noncoherent detection at the receiver, i.e., a user, without CSI and achieves full spatial diversity. We derive the lower bound of the secrecy sum rate for the proposed STLC transmission method without AN, with AN, and with AN and imperfect CSI. Moreover, numerical results verify that the proposed STLC scheme outperforms the conventional eigen-beamforming and the precoding space-time block code in terms of secrecy sum rate regardless of the signal-to-noise ratio, the number of transmit antennas, and the CSI uncertainty.},

  abstract     = {Natural disasters could lead to large-scale power outages by causing severe damages to distribution networks (DNs). Developing highly efficient outage management schemes is imperative for expediting service restoration. To this end, a novel multistage co-optimization model is proposed to seamlessly integrate the repair crew dispatch with the distribution system restoration. Furthermore, multiple sources of uncertainties are incorporated. To properly handle these uncertainties, a novel hybrid modeling approach is developed. In particular, the first stage is cast as a deterministic optimization problem to determine the crew route option prior to the realization of uncertainties. The second stage is to reconfigure the DN for forming multimicrogrids considering the uncertainties in crew travel time and repair time, which is formulated as a stochastic program. In the third stage, a robust optimization framework is applied to acquire a scheduling plan of various DERs that is immune to the worst-case realizations of electricity demand and photovoltaic generation. Finally, an advanced solution method is devised to achieve the computational tractability based on constraint and column generation and progressive hedging approaches. Numerical tests on the modified IEEE 37-bus DN show that the computation performance of the proposed solution method well fits the real-time application and also demonstrate that the highest demand curtailment is reduced by 3.3\% and the variance of the restoration outcome is lowered by 40.5\% compared with a recently proposed benchmark.},

  abstract     = {This article develops a nonlinear, multimodal, and multiobjective formulation of the combined economic environmental operation (CEEO) problem in hybrid AC-multiterminal (AC-MT) high-voltage direct current grids. In these grids, the technologies of voltage source converters support more active and reactive power control in AC grids. The aim of the CEEO issue is to minimize the overall cost of fuel and the pollutant emissions of generators. Also, transmission loss minimization is another target. An improved crow search algorithm (ICSA) is proposed for obtaining the solution of the formulated problem. The proposed ICSA combines the merits of CSA by randomly switching into local search around the best crows’ position. Pareto dominance is activated to improve the crow&#39;s memory and the external repository for multiobjective models. The ICSA is tested on modified IEEE 30-bus, the Egyptian West Delta Power Network, and the large-scale 118-bus system to solve the CEEO problem in AC-MTDC grids. The simulation results illustrate the proposed ICSA capability for finding diversified Pareto solutions with several possible operating points. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the proposed ICSA is demonstrated in terms of its solution robustness compared with previous techniques.},

The proposed framework aims to achieve three objectives: minimizing the operating cost, minimizing the energy losses, and improving the voltage profiles. The proposed framework determines the optimal operational schedules for the network reconfiguration, the charging/discharging of BESSs, and the dispatch of the energy resources. The proposed DSEM framework is tested on two smart DSs that include BESSs and different types of energy resources. A comparison of the results obtained from different operational scenarios demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed DSEM framework.

The predicted posterior Cramer–Rao lower bound (PCRLB) in the cluttered background is slighted relaxed and utilized as the optimization metric. The optimization model is then established as minimizing the worst case of PCRLB under the constraint of total power budget. By using the monotonic decreasing and invertible properties of the relaxed PCRLB, a fast sequential relaxation-based solver is proposed for this problem solving. At each iteration, the proposed solver tests the power allocation (PA) to one target whether should be set as the minimum level. Simulation results show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed solver, compared with convex optimization-based methods. The results also imply that the target distance and reflectivity are two main factors that influence the PA in our strategy.},

PV inverters are modeled to inject available PV generation into a network during PV generation hours and to provide VAr compensation during rest of the time. BESSs are modeled to store surplus PV power during high penetration of PV generation and to discharge stored energy during no/low PV generation hours. An optimization problem is formulated to determine the optimal VAr compensation setpoints for PV inverters and optimal charge/discharge schedule for the BESSs. The maximization of PV hosting capacity and the minimization of energy loss are the objective functions for the first and second stages, respectively. The limits on bus voltage magnitude, line flow, state-of-charge (SOC) of BESSs, charging and discharging of BESSs, PV inverter capacity, etc., are considered to be the operational constraints. The CONOPT solver of general algebraic modeling system software is used for solving the optimization problem. The contribution of the proposed approach is to show that significant energy loss reduction can be obtained with the optimal time-varying setpoints of PV inverters and BESSs.},

Applying the block-coordinate-descent method and the successive convex approximation, an algorithm is proposed to handle the nonconvex optimization problem.

Recent advances in battery technologies have made battery energy storage systems (BESS) more economically viable than ever before, which makes them suitable for many grid-scale applications. By providing grid support, distributed BESS can serve as enablers for higher penetrations of renewables at the DN. Distributed BESS can also provide ancillary services (AS), such as frequency regulation and reserves, to the bulk power grid. This article proposes a budget-constrained planning model for optimally sizing and siting distributed BESS in a DN to provide grid support for a renewable-rich DN and provide AS to the electricity market. The proposed model, formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming problem, maximizes the total profit of participating in the AS markets while supporting the operation of an unbalanced DN.

Unlike conventional control methods for DCMGs, the proposed distributed cooperative control method is capable of obtaining a constant total generated power from PVs, thus minimizing the impact of the intermittent nature of PVs on the total generation. This operation subsequently reduces the charging stress on the backup energy storage system (BESS) and increases the lifetime of the BESS in the DCMG. The proposed control method can also intelligently reduce the total generation cost of the DCMG via monitoring and analyzing the information of energy sources and minimizing the quadratic cost function. The dynamic model of the proposed controller is thoroughly analyzed, and its effectiveness in terms of providing controllable generated power and cost reduction is validated for different generation-demand scenarios.},

A recursive sliding-mode dynamic surface control (DSC) strategy with a nonlinear gain is addressed for the containment problem of uncertain MASs in strict-feedback form. Two factors, a recursive dynamic sliding-mode surface and a nonlinear gain function, are introduced to solve the contradiction between control accuracy and dynamic performance in the traditional DSC method. The function approximation technique, by radial basis function neural networks, is employed to compensate unknown dynamics. On the basis of the backstepping and graph theory, a full-state feedback containment control strategy is presented. Subsequently, we propose an output feedback containment control strategy via a state observer for individual followers. From the Lyapunov stability theorem, we construct an improvement Lyapunov function for the MAS, and it is proven that all followers converge to a convex hull formed by leaders for both full-state feedback and output feedback cases. Simulation examples are presented for verification of the effectiveness of the strategy.},

  abstract     = {This article improves spectral efficiency performance of the cooperative intercell interference (ICI) cancellation by channel state information (CSI) muting with time-domain thresholding. In the original scheme, each transmitter superposes ICI replica signal to the original transmission signal so as to cancel them at the receiver side. Suppose uplink CSI estimation, its imperfection becomes significant since the transmission power of the user terminal is generally lower than that of the base station; ICI cancellation capability is limited. In order to overcome this problem, incorrect CSI needs to be properly muted. However, the qualification of CSI around the noise level is a challenging issue. A key proposal is to focus on the time-domain impulse response wherein the channel power is concentrated to the specified part in the observation range. It can accurately differentiate useful CSI even in the noise-limited region; generation of erroneous ICI replica signals is prevented and remaining transmission power can be re-allocated to the desired signal. Therefore, the ICI cancellation capability can be fully provided to maximize overall spectral efficiency. Simulative evaluation validates its possibility and effectiveness; average spectral efficiency can be improved by up to 11.9\% compared to the original approach using full CSI.},

  abstract     = {Wind power producers have recently gained a significant penetration in the electric power network, which might cause some challenges for the system operation due to the uncertainties in the generated power. In this way, wind power owners may offer different services, such as providing reserve capacity besides their conventional role of delivering just energy. Currently, conventional generators are the main responsible for providing some reserve in case of uncertainty in renewable generation and demand changes. Therefore, this article introduces a novel approach that allows wind power producers to participate in both energy and reserve markets alongside conventional generators. A two-stage stochastic programming model is deployed for this purpose and the proposed approach is examined on the IEEE RTS 24-bus. The simulation results demonstrate that for ensuring a higher level of reliability by the suggested scheme, both conventional generators and wind power producers will receive more revenue in both markets, although the demands should pay more.},

The existing PI-based IA procedure cannot efficiently tackle the position inaccuracy and blockage or may cause a long IA delay because of the inefficient beam learning. Based on the sparse scattering of mmWave signals, the serving area is partitioned into smaller areas and the beams are learned for each small area. Moreover, the number of learned beams is restricted and fixed after learning. Thus, the impact of position inaccuracy and blockage can be mostly mitigated and the IA delay is short in each successful IA. The analysis shows the lower bound of the probability of miss detection. Additionally, the simulation results show that the proposed approach can achieve a reasonable IA delay and superior IA performance than other PI-based approaches.},

This article presents a framework for rapid, quantitative comparisons of robustness in SoS architectures that leverages complex network methods for assessing robustness and design of experiments (DoE) techniques for validating their use in the scenario of interest. We consider both single-layer and multilayer network representations of SoS and focus on algebraic connectivity, inverse average path length, and largest connected component size as measures of robustness. Two case studies are used to illustrate our framework and assess its utility: a command, control, communications, computer, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C4ISR) simulation and a multilayer message-passing network simulation. We find that most of the considered network metrics capture expected robustness trends, though their ability to capture these trends is often affected by the scenario of interest. These results demonstrate the potential value of complex network methods for lightweight analysis of robustness in SoS architecture alternatives, when appropriately supported by DoE methods for understanding their limitations.},

The model is formulated as a bilevel optimization problem in which the upper level maximizes the TVPP&#39;s profit regarding network reliability and the lower level clears the market from ISO&#39;s viewpoint.

In this article, we propose an energy consumption optimization strategy based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and transfer learning (TL) techniques. We implement an adaptive reward to autonomously adjust parameters in a reward function to balance energy consumption and quality of service (QoS) requirement of users during the learning process. We further formulate a cell activation/deactivation problem as a Markov decision process and set up our proposed relational DRL model to meet the QoS requirements of users with a minimum number of active remote radio heads under a traffic model defined to simulate a real-world scenario. A weighted TL algorithm has been developed in DRL to validate sample data from a source task. Extensive simulations reveal that the proposed scheme based on the adaptive reward has better performance in balancing the QoS requirement of users and system energy consumption. Finally, based on our simulation results, we conclude that combining DRL with TL speeds up the learning process.},

  abstract     = {When software vulnerabilities threaten the security of users, new research on approaches to reduce security vulnerabilities must be explored. The development of deep learning has opened up the era of automatic code vulnerability detection, extricated humans from multifarious pattern definition, and feature selection. However, existing deep learning based vulnerability detection schemes are still in their early stage, most of them adopted token-level representing schemes, losing the logical information above token level and resulting in the narrowing of differences between codes. They always had low accuracy and high false positive rate. In addition, it is noticed that most code vulnerability detection methods focused on C/C++, and little work can be found on Java. In light of this, we propose an intelligent sentence-level vulnerability self-detection framework (ISVSF), which considers the syntax characteristics of Java and adopts sentence-level method representation and pattern exploration. Experimental results demonstrate that the ISVSF outperforms the existing token-level vulnerability detection schemes in terms of accuracy, false positive rate, detection time, etc. In addition, fast and strong vulnerability feature extraction enables ISVSF to learn vulnerability-related features quickly and achieve high accuracy with providing little training samples, thereby reducing the demand for training dataset effectively.},

In this article, the proposed technique is focused on estimating the resistance and detecting the fault even during high-resistance fault case. Resistance is estimated using the local measurements available at the bus. After that, the sign of the estimated resistance is compared at both ends of the line segment to detect the fault and the use of the sign of resistance eliminates the time synchronization issues. The proposed method is capable of detecting the fault in radial as well as ring configuration dc microgrid. A ring main dc microgrid system is simulated using the EMTDC software to validate the proposed technique. The performance of the proposed approach is also validated using a dc microgrid hardware setup and tested for numerous situations.

  abstract     = {Owing to energy liberalization and increasing penetration of renewables, renewable energy trading among suppliers and users has gained much attention and created a new market. This article investigates a double-auction scheme operated by an aggregator with limited supervision for energy trading. To ensure beneficial bidding for renewable generators and end users (EUs) considered as agents, a multiagent Q-learning (MAQL) based bidding strategy is developed to maximize their cumulative reward. Each agent first provides their information about renewable supply or demand to an aggregator who will then return the information about aggregate supply and demand. Without knowing the business model of the aggregator, the agents use Q-tables to estimate the expected cumulative reward and determine their bidding prices accordingly. Finally, the aggregator coordinates energy trading between agents who will then update their Q-tables on the basis of the amount of power bought or sold at the prices they bid. The proposed approach can avoid some unnecessary or unrealistic assumptions generally made by model-based approaches, such as the assumption on the knowledge of others’ bidding profiles or the assumption of an oligopoly; it can consider the influence of bidding strategies on the market, which cannot be properly addressed by a conventional proportional allocation mechanism. A numerical analysis using real-world data and considering a profit maximization model for the aggregator shows that the proposed approach outperformed comparable methods in terms of profits of renewable generators and energy satisfaction level of EUs: iterative double auction by approximately 29\%, heuristic bidding by 39.9\%, random bidding by 38.1\%, NSGA-II-based multiobjective approach by 62\%, and MOEA/D-based multiobjective approach by 83.1\% on average.},

The proposed algorithm derives robust offering curves to participate in the day-ahead market. In addition to the day-ahead market, intraday and balancing markets are considered for reducing the negative effects of poor predictability of wind speed. In the proposed hybrid framework, intraday and balancing market prices as well as wind speed are modeled by proper scenarios, while robust optimization is used to model the day-ahead price uncertainty. Besides, the risks of stochastic parameters are modeled by the conditional value at risk (CVaR). Based on the results of robust optimization, the uncertainty of the day-ahead market price reduces the aggregator profit by 21.3\% in the worst case, whereas CVaR results show a 13.2\% profit reduction due to the worst-case scenario realization in stochastic parameters.},

  abstract     = {Designing a neural network using simulation waveforms for high-impedance fault (HIF) detection is a challenging task, particularly in case of applications on distribution networks. Based on the characteristics of HIF transient zero sequence currents (TZSCs), a novel methodology is proposed for HIF detection in the time domain, which includes 1-D variational prototyping-encoder (1-D-VPE) and decision tree (DT) algorithm. The proposed HIF detection scheme consists of four steps: First, the TZSCs collected from simulations are applied to train the 1-D-VPE neural network, whose encoder is used as the feature extractor. Then, the extracted features are utilized to train the DT classifier. After that, the well-trained encoder and DT are employed to test field TZSCs. Finally, the 1-D-VPE neural network is fine-tuned with some of the field TZSCs. The performance of the proposed method is analyzed using waveform samples collected from the PSCAD/EMTDC simulation platform and the actual distribution networks. The results show that the proposed method provides good classification performances on both simulation and field data at high noise levels without transformation between different domains, and the classification accuracy can be improved by fine-tuning with some field TZSCs.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates legitimate eavesdropping and secure communication in a multicarrier interference network, where a suspicious link coexists with an unsuspicious link, in the presence of a full-duplex monitor. It is assumed that the unsuspicious users (UUs) are under illegal eavesdropping threat from the suspicious users (SUs), and the monitor can send jamming signals to interfere with the SUs. The UUs are required to cooperate with the monitor for reducing the secrecy outage probability of the UUs to be lower than that without the monitor’s jamming. Under this secrecy outage constraint along with the transmit power constraints, the problem for maximizing the successful eavesdropping probability of the monitor by jointly allocating the transmit powers of the monitor and the UUs is investigated. The problem is solved with the Lagrange duality method by proving the time-sharing property holds, where two algorithms are proposed for obtaining the dual function based on the block coordinate descent method and the successive convex approximation method. Simulation results verify that the proposed algorithms are superior to the noncooperative strategy and the passive eavesdropping strategy, and achieve high successful eavesdropping probability and low secrecy outage probability simultaneously.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, industrial parks play a significant role in the development of electricity market plans, and can thus provide excellent opportunities for market players to actively participate in various electricity markets. The demand response aggregator (DRA) is a major market player that can take advantage of these opportunities. In restructured electricity markets, identifying the consumption patterns of different classes of consumers can be effective in furthering the goals of the DRA. In previous studies on the self-scheduling of the DRA, consumer behavior has not been considered. Such an approach leads to numerous technical problems in the restructured electricity markets. For this purpose, herein, a practical mechanism is presented for executing the self-scheduling process of the DRA by considering the load disaggregation algorithm. The integration of self-scheduling and load disaggregation processes creates a hierarchical optimization problem. The main aim of the constructed hierarchical structure is to find the optimal self-scheduling of the DRA to consciously participate in the electricity markets by identifying the behavior of different consumers. The proposed structure is implemented and evaluated on the industrial park in Saveh, Iran. The time-of-use (TOU) and reward-based demand response (DR) programs are considered as the tools available for the DRA to trade the DR volumes in the day-ahead and balancing electricity markets.},

  abstract     = {The utilization of low-voltage direct current (LVdc) distribution system is gaining popularity in recent years due to its numerous advantages. However, the development of efficient fault detection scheme for an LVdc microgrid is a challenging problem. This article proposes a fast and effective variational mode decomposition (VMD)-based fault detection technique for the LVdc distribution system with penetration of renewable sources using the local end current measurements only. This scheme processes the rate of change of current signal of the distribution lines through the VMD algorithm that decomposes it to different modes. The cumulative energy of the most significant mode is being computed and used as a fault detection index. The proposed scheme is tested for pole to pole and pole to ground fault with broad variation in fault location, fault resistance, and distributed generations penetration in grid-connected and islanding mode of microgrid operation. The performance of the proposed technique is compared with the existing differential current and overcurrent relaying scheme as well as other existing schemes. The testing has been done in MATLAB/Simulink and Typhoon hardware-in-loop testbed. The proposed scheme detects all types of fault with wide variation in fault and operating conditions of the microgrid with faster response time. The test results indicate that the proposed protection scheme is a potential candidate for providing effective protection measure for LVdc microgrid.},

In order to lighten the communication burden and enhance the data security, the EDCM is introduced in the observer-to-controller channel. In case of the measurement outliers, a specific saturation function is adopted in the observer structure to restrain the abnormal innovations so as to mitigate the side effects brought from the outliers. The aim of this article is to design an observer-based controller, such that in the presence of measurement outliers, the closed-loop NS achieves the input-to-state stability (ISS) under the EDCM. By means of the uniform quantization technique, a criterion is first established in terms of the sizes of the encoding alphabet and the encoding period so as to ensure the detectability of the NS, and the requirement is also given on the capacity of the communication channel at each time instant. Then, with the help of ISS theory, the desired controller is obtained with its gain matrix parameterized by the solution to a certain inequality that can be solved via standard software packages. Finally, the effectiveness of the derived theoretical results is verified through three numerical simulation examples.},

We aim to maximize DL sum-rate, whilst prescribing a certain quality of service for UL users, by optimizing the location of FD-UAV and available resources. The problem is nonconvex; so we propose an iterative method by exploiting the difference of convex functions programming to jointly optimize transmission power of users, FD-UAV location, and FD-UAV transmission power.

The results are also compared with previously reported methods. The simulation results and the comparisons showed that the proposed methods could properly share the power among subgrids and DGs in both ac and dc subgrids.

  abstract     = {Available transfer capability (ATC) plays an essential role in deregulated power network scheduling. This value determines the power that can be transferred between deregulated regions. The ATC value is limited by transmission line constraints and reliability marginal terms. In this article, the impact of dynamic line rating (DLR) instruments, which are generally used to enhance the capacity of transmission lines, on the ATC is investigated. In addition, a robust ATC evaluation model is proposed to find worst cases for determining the reliability marginal terms and considering them in the ATC evaluation. The robust ATC evaluation model includes a master problem, formulated to determine ATC and total transfer capability, as well as two bilevel subproblems, formulated to find the reliability marginal terms. The Benders decomposition algorithm is derived to solve the proposed robust ATC evaluation. An uncertain environment, including wind farm powers, dynamic line capacities, and load demand values, is also considered to cover the stochastic nature of such uncertainty sources. A probabilistic approach is proposed to calculate the expected value of ATC and depict the cumulative distribution function of each variable. The proposed probabilistic model is based on dividing the stochastic set into smaller groups, similar to clustering techniques. However, the significant differences between the proposed probabilistic and cluster-based models are due to detecting the optimal value of a reduced number of stochastic sets and finding the members of each cluster set. In other words, a sequential game-theoretic approach is applied to divide the data into smaller sets. The impact of DLR on the proposed robust ATC evaluation problem and the efficiency of the proposed probabilistic model are evaluated by comprehensive studies based on the IEEE 118-bus test system.},

In particular, two CSS scenarios are considered, one is secondary users (SUs) with a single antenna and the other is SUs with multiple antennas. In the multiantenna case, a Riemannian mean-based data fusion method is proposed to fuse sensing data from SUs with multiple antennas. To implement CSS, we propose a FRDK-based framework, where SUs collect sensing data, preprocess, and upload these data to an appointed fusion center (FC). Then, the FC transforms these data as samples on a manifold and uses the FRDK algorithm to train a classifier for identifying the state of PU. Furthermore, the convergence and the complexity analysis of training process are presented. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed FRDK-based CSS method is verified under different conditions.},

Motivated by this topic, a general control law based on an enclosing potential combined with a consensus-based target observer is presented for the target enclosing of unmanned aerial vehicles with limited perceptual abilities. Asymptotic stability can be guaranteed under some assumptions of target&#39;s property and network connectivity, whereas the enclosing control law may lose efficacy when capturing an agile target. Then, a novel group of leader–follower interactive potentials combined with a modified observer are derived to promote the robustness by strengthening the interactions between informed and uninformed nodes in a bicyclic spatial layout.

Among manufacturing systems, job-shop scheduling plays a key role due to its wide applications. In this article, we study a green job-shop scheduling problem with variable machining speeds (JSPVMS) aiming at minimizing the makespan as well as the total energy consumption (TEC). First, a new mixed-integer linear programming model is formulated for this green JSPVMS. Then, a new knowledge-based multiobjective memetic algorithm (MOMA) is developed to address this problem. In our MOMA, a novel decoding scheme based on the problem property is well designed to obtain better tradeoff solutions between makespan and TEC. Furthermore, a novel local search is proposed to search for promising nondominated solutions by discovering problem-specific knowledge. Additionally, the proposed MOMA utilizes the advantage of the genetic operator and local search to balance the exploration and exploitation. The effectiveness of each improvement component (decoding scheme and local search) in our MOMA is verified by comparing experiments among different MOMA variants. Finally, we compare our MOMA with several well-known multiobjective optimization algorithms (i.e., NSGA-II, SPEA2, and MOEA/D) on JSPVMS instances. Experimental results indicate that our MOMA significantly outperforms the other algorithms on most of the instances.},

  abstract     = {In this article, a capacity expansion framework is proposed for failure-prone flow-networks. A systemic risk measure that quantifies the risk of unsatisfied demand due to cascaded edge failures is considered. To minimize the total cost of additional edge capacities, while keeping the risk of unsatisfied demand below a certain threshold, a general stochastic optimization problem is formulated. The distribution of unsatisfied demand is calculated via Monte-Carlo simulations embodied within a grid search algorithm that identifies the feasible region. Thereafter, the cost-optimal edge capacity expansion plan is computed by a differential evolution algorithm. Contributions of this article are: 1) consideration of both immediate investment and future risk costs of capacity expansion plans; 2) a generic flow-network model that can be tuned for different real-life applications; 3) addressing the stochastic nature of both supply and demand simultaneously within a systemic risk framework; 4) use of eigenvector centrality for edge grouping in systemic risk analysis. An extensive numerical study is performed to investigate the effects of different edge grouping methods, characteristics of stochastic components, and cost parameters on the feasible region and optimal solution.

  abstract     = {Low latency is a prerequisite for real-time applications, and random access is almost an inevitable choice for large-scale wireless networks. In this article, we consider how to decrease access delay in random access manners for the industrial Internet of Things. We propose a novel scheme by integrating multiple subchannels on the user equipment (UE) side with message-level successive interference cancellation (SIC) on the sink side. Specifically, for any UE that starts an uplink transmission, it just stochastically chooses parts of its subchannels and then simultaneously transmits the same message on them without any power control. On the sink side, the sink decodes signals from UEs using SIC across multiple subchannels. Based on the proposed multichannel SIC scheme, minimizing the access delay in the random access manner is equivalent to minimizing the probability of decoding deadlock. Based on the mathematical method of density evolution and the help from the differential evolution algorithm, an optimal distribution for choosing subchannels is presented. With the optimal distribution, the average access delay is minimized.},

The proposed technique requires minimal secure hardware combined with a randomized approach to detect roving malware in IoT devices. We present an experimental validation of the proposed technique using a Raspberry Pi setup. A comparison with the existing attestation techniques shows that PRoM has a significantly lower execution time while maintaining a higher probability of detection for an adversary. Moreover, PRoM does not affect the normal operation of IoT devices and, therefore, ensures high availability.},

The new CDMO-BRB approach is implemented in a parent–child framework. In the parent process, cooperative optimization is equipped with a multipopulation strategy and another redundant-gene strategy to simultaneously optimize the structure and parameters of BRBs in heterogeneous structures. In the child process, distributed learning is designed to improve optimization efficiency and avoid early convergence and overfitting. A benchmark case on pipeline leakage detection is studied. Case study results show that the structure and parameters of BRB can be optimized simultaneously by pushing forward the Pareto front. In comparison with previous studies, CDMO-BRB has produced superior performance. Moreover, distributed learning is also separately validated.},

  abstract     = {The problem of phasor measurement units (PMUs) placement for state estimation in modern power grids has emerged with renewed interest in recent years. Conventional optimal PMU placement (OPP) formulations without limitations on observability propagations pose the power grid at the higher risk of losing its observability under unexpected contingencies or malicious cyberattacks. In order to mitigate these impacts in PMU deployments, by extending our proposed enhanced OPP formulation under the concept of the observability propagation depth (OPD), a probabilistic variation of this enhanced OPP is presented. To further explore the robustness of OPP problems under severe contingencies, a linearized probabilistic observability model is proposed and incorporated with the previous enhanced OPP model into a bilevel optimization framework. Thus, in addition to derive the minimum number of PMUs by solving the enhanced OPP model in the upper level, the optimal PMU configuration with the maximal probabilistic observability can also be depicted in the lower level. By solving the dual problem of the lower-level problem under Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions, this bilevel optimization formulation can be reformulated into a single-level mixed-integer linear programming problem, which can be easily solved by commercial optimization tools. Extensive simulations are conducted on several IEEE test-bed systems as well as the Polish-2383 system to demonstrate the feasibility and the effectiveness of the proposed formulation. Simulation results indicate that there is strong evidence that the probability of losing the observability of a bus is positively related to its OPD.},

However, we observe that according to the individual characteristics of each vehicle’s owner, the movement of each vehicle is regular, i.e., there are some locations that vehicles visit frequently, and some locations that they rarely visit. Evidently, pseudonym change strategies for these locations are different. To address these issues, we propose a sensitivity-based pseudonym change mechanism, which can take full advantage of the regularity of a vehicle’s movement, thereby achieving personalized location privacy. A pseudonym age analytical model is used to quantify the achieved location privacy. Furthermore, we propose a new metric to measure the level of personalized location privacy protection. The results of the performance evaluation demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing approaches in realizing personalized location privacy.},

In existing practice, systems are decomposed based on empirical knowledge of system architects and the prevailing architecture of organizations responsible for developing systems. The decomposition of systems (and SoS) involves aspects of engineering, management, and social sciences. How the decomposition approach breaks down a complex system determines the effectiveness of the integration strategy. In this article, we recommend that a complex system (and more specifically, a complex sociotechnical system) should be decomposed and aligned along five perspectives or layers: operation, function, physical, implementation, and organization. At each layer, the system architecture exhibits a certain level of complexity. Aligning modules at each layer with modules at the level above can help reduce the complexity of the overall system making it more manageable. This article presents a system architecting methodology that employs interlevel and intralevel dependency matrix (I2DM) to enable this approach. The I2DM methodology employs stochastic optimization in combination with heuristics to align modules in the different layers and then identifies problematic interactions that could pose problems in system integration. The article also describes how techniques from pattern recognition, data analytics, and clustering can be applied to system architecture models to formulate and assess the efficacy of a system integration strategy. The ontology underlying the systems architecting and integration strategy is also presented.},

In this article, we propose a decentralized attribute-based access control mechanism. Compared with the existing well-known schemes, the proposed scheme enhances private security and the confidentiality of shared data. An anonymous key extraction protocol is introduced to help users prove their identities with zero knowledge and help the authorities to generate legitimate private keys without knowing the users global identifiers and specific attributes. We also eliminate linear relationships among the keys appearing in the previous reported works, which makes unauthorized users unable to combine their private keys to generate a legal secret key or combine their respective decryption results to recover the plaintext message. Performance and security analyses show that the new work is secure against collusion attacks, thus protecting users’ privacy and security. Besides, the security of the proposed scheme is reduced to the q-PBDHE assumption in the standard model.},

Nine failure states of each component and the performance/capacity degradation in different failure states are incorporated into the modeling approach. The state transitions between nine failure states are modeled as a discrete time Markov process whose transition probabilities are time-varying. In addition, the article proposes a new robustness measure for multistate CPPS, which integrates the information of the local and global topology, the damage state of components, as well as the performance degradation of the CPPS. The system that couples the IEEE 118-bus model with a small-world communication network is used as a testbed to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed modeling approach, and the comparison with existing robustness measures shows the superiority of the proposed measure.},

  abstract     = {This article proposes a decoupled access scheme with enhanced energy efficiency (EE) for cellular networks serving a mix of randomly distributed ground and areal users. While unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) benefit from line-of-sight (LOS) dominant channels with their serving base-stations (BSs), their omnidirectional antennas could cause high interference to ground users (GUEs). To overcome this, a downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) decoupled (DUDe) access scheme is proposed in which the UAVs’ control and nonpayload communication links are separated from the high-capacity data links by connecting to different BSs and transmitting over different frequency bands in the UL and DL directions. The GUE-BS channels are also decoupled in tandem to minimize interference. Moreover, as battery life is a major constraint for UL transmissions, an optimal low-complexity power allocation algorithm—based on fractional programming and successive convex approximation—is proposed for optimizing the EE of this DUDe scheme. Our numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can achieve several times higher sum-rates in both UL and DL directions than its coupled benchmark counterparts. Moreover, it will be shown that in addition to improving the GUE sum-rate by 15\%, the devised power allocation algorithm achieves twice higher GUE EE than conventional fractional power control.},

Our article aims to detect, as soon as possible and online, attacks that can occur on wireless networks, to be able to react very quickly. In this article, we present some results of data analysis methods, on Wi-Fi signals, to differentiate the ones with attacks from the ones without. This study focuses on low-power jamming attacks with a slight or even no impact on Wi-Fi communications. This is more challenging than detecting high-power jamming attacks, which have already been addressed in the literature. Being able to detect a low-impact attack is a crucial issue in a global security strategy, making it possible to launch countermeasures before the interruption of the communication. The Wi-Fi bands are also in the Industrial, Scientific and Medical (ISM) frequencies, making the environment complicated to analyze. Clustering methods such as agglomerative hierarchical clustering are used to identify some clusters and then to map them to the real classes (with or without attacks). A deep analysis of the clusters obtained in a dataset acquired in uncontrolled conditions is carried out. This is done in order to understand what is responsible of the clustering assignment of the different points and to extract the clusters, which can be used to design a detection attack strategy.},

  abstract     = {To improve the radio throughput, novel radio access techniques need to be designed. With exploiting the multiuser diversity at power domain, nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is one promising candidate technique for sixth-generation (6G). In this article, a downlink joint device assignment and power allocation problem is investigated in multihoming heterogeneous multicarrier NOMA networks. The joint device assignment and power allocation problem maximizes the network throughput with total power constraint at each base station, required minimum transmission rate for each device, and maximum number of accessed devices at each subchannel. Since the joint device assignment and power allocation problem is a mixed-integer nonlinear problem, the original optimization problem is divided into a device assignment subproblem and a power allocation subproblem. Then, the greedy method is applied to propose a device assignment algorithm, and successive convex approximation theory is adopted to design a power allocation algorithm. Finally, an iterative joint device assignment and power allocation algorithm is proposed. Numerical simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can improve the throughput and the average satisfactory of devices compared with other algorithms significantly.},

  abstract     = {This article addresses the resilient relative pose estimation problem for multiple mobile robot systems against abnormal sensor measurements. Motivated by the fact that in real implementations, sensors used for neighboring robot detection, such as stereo camera, laser range finder, etc., may suffer from unpredictable anomalies, a resilient relative pose estimation approach is proposed such that each robot can obtain satisfactory relative pose estimates of its neighbors for further coordination algorithm design. In the proposed approach, the optimal Kalman estimate is decomposed as a weighted sum of local state estimates, based on which a convex optimization problem is formulated to generate the resilient estimation. Unlike most of the existing approaches investigating similar problems, which assume that the statistics or the bound of anomalies is known in advance, our proposed approach is not limited by this assumption. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been validated by numerical simulations and real robot experiments. It has been demonstrated that the proposed approach is comparable to the Kalman filter in the absence of sensor anomalies, while boundedness of the relative pose estimation error can be guaranteed under abnormal observations.},

  abstract     = {This article proposes a peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading framework for wind power producer (WPP) in the retailing layer to increase its revenue and to promote wind power utilization. In this framework, the WPP can provide energy consumption of demand response providers (DRPs) in a competitive environment through both the main grid and rival load-serving entities. Also, based on a P2P pricing mechanism, the WPP can choose if to trade energy in a P2P platform or not. The proposed problem is formulated as a stochastic bilevel optimization model, in which in the upper level, the WPP profit is maximized and in the lower level, the DRPs participate in DR programs and tend to choose the fairest supplier among the WPP and LSEs to minimize their energy procurement costs. The proposed method is applied to a realistic case study and the results demonstrate that with P2P, the WPP can schedule the energy transaction with peers to offset part of the energy deviations. Moreover, different values of P2P prices lead to different values of energy transactions due to the relatively diversity pattern of local generation of rival LSEs and their offering prices and demand and generation of the WPP.},

First, each system input is divided into the equilibrium control input and control compensation, and the distributed variation model around the dynamic equilibrium points is obtained by Taylor expansion in presence of changes of production speed. Then, the problem of tension regulation is transformed into the stabilization of distributed variational system. Next, the interval variables are introduced to denote the changeable desired outputs and the system uncertain or time-varying parameters, and then an interval matrix-based distributed coordinate tension regulation strategy is proposed by choosing appropriate coordinate variables. Subsequently, existence conditions of proposed distributed coordinate tension regulator are obtained via the Lyapunov theory. The designed regulator is obtained by solving the linear matrix inequalities with few adjustable parameters. Finally, the comparison simulation is conducted on a five-motor-driven system to validate the effectiveness and control performance of the proposed method.},

Then, a new community detection algorithm for signed networks has also been devised, and time complexity analysis shows that the time required for the algorithm has a linear relationship with the number of nodes in the sparse networks. Meanwhile, the affinity index that can be used to convert directed signed networks into the corresponding undirected signed networks is come up with. Finally, the current algorithm has been applied into several illustrative and realistic networks. The experimental results indicate that the number of communities given by the proposed algorithm is consistent with that of actual communities, and thus, it can be further conducive to identifying the community structure hidden within the real-world systems.},

Three sequences of Bernoulli-distributed random variables with known probability distributions are employed to describe the characteristics of the random occurrence of the multiple attacks. The raw or corrupted measurements are transmitted to sensors, whose outputs are binary according to engineering practice. A modified likelihood function is constructed to compensate for the influence of the randomly occurring multiple attacks by introducing the random occurrence probability information into the design process. Subsequently, a secure particle filter is proposed based on the constructed likelihood function.

Next, a hierarchical clustering model is applied for product feature classification, and a weighted function of customer sentiment and attention is put forward for requirement ranking. Then, statistical methods are used for requirement preference identification. Finally, the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed approach is examined on 2198 online reviews with 148 527 subsentences about new energy vehicles.},

In the homogeneous case with the same products, we find that the optimal choice probabilities and optimal prices may be different for each product. In the heterogeneous case with different products, there is at most one product that takes the “high” market share while all the other products take “low” market share. In particular, when only the network effects are heterogeneous, the larger the network effect, the lower the optimal pricing and the higher the market share.

Extensive tests are carried out for several fault and stressed conditions on a New England 39-bus system on MATLAB/Simulink platform.

  abstract     = {Robustness and functionality are conflicting requirements in cyber-coupled power systems. In general, a more tightly coupled power and cyber networks provides better functionality, but may degrade the robustness against attacks or failures. The way in which the power network is coupled with the cyber network is thus crucial to the design of robust cyber-coupled power networks while maintaining sufficient functionality. In this article, we classify coupling patterns according to two node-criticality metrics of the cyber network, i.e., node degree and node betweenness, and two node-criticality metrics of the power network, i.e., node degree and node capability. We use the relative coupling correlation coefficient to quantify the coupling pattern, and show that a coupled system with a lower relative coupling correlation coefficient has better robustness.

  abstract     = {The continuous urbanization with extensive dynamic situations on evolving cities, urban, and suburban areas, it is not feasible to categorize the navigation as fastest route, toll-free, and other variants. Metropolitan areas are more prone to traffic congestion, lane blocking, accidents, etc., due to the overcrowding and dynamic change of commuters’ arrival rates. In the metropolitan areas, most of the commuters’ use Google map to reach their desired destinations. It is quite often that route specified by navigation will not be reliable because sometimes due to the inability to update the sudden occurrence of incidents on the routes. Currently, Google map and GPS provide the time required to cover the distance and shortest route to reach the destination. The main issues with the existing Google map are it does not considers the impact of sudden occurrence of incidents, does not show the type of incidents that occurred, clearance time, and optimal routes. These issues are solved by designing an efficient context-aware vehicle incidents route service management for an intelligent transport system. The proposed system takes the context information of incidents, vehicles, weather conditions, roadside units, roads, and so on. This context information will be collected and shared with the nearby vehicles and roadside units using both mobile agents and dedicated short-range communication protocols. The proposed system suggests alternative routes with minimal delay and traffic clearance time and severity of incidents to the commuters. Also, it provides the incident information to the neighborhood vehicles, roadside units, nearby hospitals, ambulance, and members of the victims. The proposed system is exhaustively simulated in objective modular network testbed in C++, simulation of urban mobility, and Veins with different simulation parameters. The proposed system’s simulation results reduce the travel time (7 min) compared to the without the context information system (25 min), least collision rate (0.785\%) compared to the existing system, minimizes the traffic clearance time in the incident zone, and uniform distribution of vehicle traffic on the estimated routes.},

  abstract     = {Dual-function radar andcommunication (DRC) system has been recently recognized as a promising approach to solve the spectrum scarcity problem. However, when the target exists within a crowded area where pathloss dominating, the performance of radar may be severely degraded. To tackle this issue, this article proposes for the first time the deployment of an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) to help the DRC system to enhance the radar detection performance. The IRS can configure the environment around the radar by adaptively adjusting the phases of its reflecting units to strengthen the signal quality toward specific directions, mostly the target direction, and completely null-out transmissions in other directions, mostly the directions toward the communication system. Specifically, in this article, we investigate the joint optimization of the IRS passive phase-shift matrix (PSM) and precoding matrix of the radar-aided basestation for the DRC system. The optimization is carried-out through maximizing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the radar receiver under both sensing and communication constraints, which turns out to be a nonconvex problem. In order to circumvent this challenging problem, an alternation optimization approach is employed to decouple the optimization variables and split this intractable problem into two subproblems. However, it is still challenging to obtain the optimal PSM due to the high power of the objective function and the unit-modulus constraints. To solve this problem, a majorization–minimization algorithm is conceived to transform the nonconvex problem to an easy to solve quadratic constraint quadratic programming problem. Simulation resultsdemonstrate that the IRS can help improving the performance of the DRC system in terms of the received SNR, and the proposed algorithm shows fast convergence.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous microgrids are potential alternative to grid connectivity for powering remote communities around the globe. A sustainable microgrid with renewables and energy storage having minimum operation and maintenance routines is the most sought option. Batteries are predominantly used to support the stochastic behavior of renewables in such microgrids. However, they are prone to frequent failure and require periodic maintenance, which demands an alternative. Thus, in this article, the renewable powered irrigation system in India was configured to form sustainable pico hydel energy storage (PHES). To enhance the inertia of the microgrid with static sources, virtual inertia capability was induced into PHES by modified synchronverter technology. First, the small-signal modeling approach was presented to derive the closed-loop transfer function of the system. Subsequently, the effect of control parameter variation on system stability and the interaction between the governor and the synchronverter was investigated using eigenvalue analysis. Next, the performance of synchronverter was compared with the established vector control through time-domain simulations in MATLAB/Simulink. The simulation results revealed that the proposed strategy improved the inertial response of PHES and outperformed vector control by reducing peak overshoot, settling time, and steady-state error.},

The innovative hybrid event-triggered strategy associated with an improved threshold function is employed for economizing the network bandwidth resources. It presents an exponential decay term in the threshold function for decreasing the transmission frequency of superfluous data packets, ulteriorly reducing triggering times. The dominating core concentrates on the design of a controller interrelated with the hybrid event-triggered condition, which can be implemented to ensure the leader-following consensus of the considered systems. On the strength of time-dependent and piecewise Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional, several criteria, which are capable of ensuring the leader-following consensus of the multiagent systems, are derived.

Apart from the mentioned control objectives, maximum power extraction from the PV systems and effective power management for seamless operation are also challenging. The shortcoming of the conventional maximum power point tracking technique to track global power under varying environmental conditions is addressed by developing a simple and efficient current reference control technique, which enables faster tracking of the global maximum power. Furthermore, a suitable power management algorithm is formulated to generate reference currents for all the power converters in the proposed system, considering various system dynamics.

This article presents a novel comprehensive ac cascading failure model particularly designed for resilience analysis in power networks. The model is capable to deal with large contingency sizes, it is computationally efficient in large networks and integrates seamlessly with established resilience metrics. It incorporates dynamic phenomena and protection mechanisms using static representations. The model is verified following the recommendations by the IEEE PES working group on cascading failures using internal validation, sensitivity analysis, and comparison to historical outage data. Furthermore, an analysis of the impact of different contingency sizes and the dependency of cascades on network loading level, are given to illustrate some applications of the model and to highlight its capabilities.},

For the poor dynamic performance in the primary control, coordinated compensation terms are added to the traditional droop control-loop to reduce the transient fluctuation in frequency/voltage under load change. In the secondary control, an event-triggered consensus protocol is applied to restore frequency/voltage, obtain equal per-unit power sharing, and relieve communication pressure. Also, the communication network is viewed as an unreliable switching graph under communication channel interruption. To this end, a data prediction compensation mechanism is proposed to ensure the secondary control on the right track. Furthermore, to predict the lost data caused by communication channel interruption, an improved exponential smoothing model based on time series is proposed.

  abstract     = {Advances in automotive industry as well as computing technology are making autonomous vehicle (AV) an appealing means of transportation. Vehicles are beyond the traditional source of commute, and leveled up to smart devices with computing capability. As one of the compelling features of AVs, the autonomous valet parking (AVP) allows for navigating and parking the car automatically without human interventions. Within this realm, long-range AVP (LAVP) extends auto-parking to a much larger scale compared to its short-range counterparts. It is worth noting that AV mobility is a pivotal concern with LAVP, involving dynamic patterns related to spatial-temporal features, such as varied parking and drop-off (or pick-up) demands with diverse customer journey planning. We herein target such critical decision-making on where to park and where to drop/pick-up upon customer requirements during their journeys. Concerning in practice that car parks are equipped with limited parking space, we thus introduce parking reservations and enable accurate estimations on future parking states. An efficient LAVP service framework enhanced with parking reservations is then proposed. Benefited from the intelligent predictions, parking load can be accurately predicted and greatly alleviated at individual car parks, thereby avoiding overcrowding effectively. Results show that significant performance gains can be achieved under the proposed scheme by comparing to other benchmarks, with respect to greatly reduced waiting duration for available parking space, as well as enhanced customer experiences in terms of reduced traveling period, etc. In particular, the number of parked vehicles across the network can be effectively balanced.},

  abstract     = {For a downlink communication system, we propose a nonorthogonal multiple access scheme with two energy harvesting relays. The base station (BS) transmits the data of both near and far users simultaneously using the superposition coding technique. Two relays alternately amplify and forward the data to the far-user. Each relay can harvest wireless energy from the signals of both the BS and the other transmitting relay, so each relay can achieve more opportunities to accumulate more energy for a higher-quality cooperative relaying. The near-user performs adaptive interference cancelation to retrieve its desired data. Numerical results show that the nonorthogonal scheme greatly outperforms the orthogonal scheme in terms of throughput.},

A waveform design approach is applied to obtain novel UWB pulses with strict spectral emission compliance and improved multiaccess capability. WH codeword sequences are then combined with optimally shaped DS-UWB signals, yielding orthogonal modulation formats that can be scaled to variable order while retaining the desired spectral characteristics and achieving robust performance in multiuser, multipath-impaired environments. Interference analysis with a random spreading model is used to derive decision statistics with MRC over frequency-selective Nakagami fading channels, and analytical expressions are obtained for outage and bit error probabilities. Comparative numerical results and sensitivity analysis with respect to waveform selection, modulation order, and channel parameters are given to demonstrate the merits of the proposed orthogonal WH-based DS-UWB schemes in terms of improved outage and error performance, and increased multiuser capacity.},

We minimize the total energy consumption of the system by jointly considering energy beamforming, time-slot assignment, computation-task allocation, and the optimization of central processing unit (CPU) frequencies for computing. We transform the original nonconvex problem to a convex model via utilizing the variable substitution and the semidefinite relaxation methods, and then derive the optimal solution in a semiclosed form via exploiting the Lagrangian method. The extensive numerical results show that the proposed joint communication and computation cooperation scheme can reduce the total energy consumption considerably compared to the state of the art.

  abstract     = {With the proliferation of smart mobile devices, there is now an ever increasing craving for higher bandwidth for end user satisfaction. Increasing mobile traffic leads to congestion of backhaul networks. One promising solution to this problem is the mobile edge network and consequently mobile edge caching. There is an emerging paradigm shift toward the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to assist the traditional cellular networks and also to provide connectivity in places where there are no small base stations or faulty ones as a result of some natural disaster such as flooding. Hence, UAVs can be used to assist in content caching as well. This work proposes the use of human centric features, random waypoint user mobility model, and deep reinforcement learning to predict the location of the UAVs and the contents to cache at the UAVs. We formulated our problem as a Markov decision problem (MDP) and proposed a dueling reinforcement learning-based algorithm to solve the MDP problem. Our simulation results prove that our algorithm converges to an optimal solution and performs better than other baseline reinforcement learning algorithms in terms of quality of experience satisfaction, transmit power, and cache resource utilization},

Previous TB-aware motion estimation designs with CBR-control capability in video coding have focused on algorithm development with precise CBR models, which require a complicated algorithmic derivation according to the system on-demand CBR and are difficult to realize in very large scale integration (VLSI) due to their lack of consideration for hardware implementation and modeling. Consequently, we present a hardware-oriented CBR-control algorithm that uses simple CBR control functions instead of requiring root and exponential operations to realize the real-time low-power design objective for HEVC applications within a mobile MPSoC. Then, an adequate hardware architecture with low hardware complexity is exploited to accomplish a low-power and high-speed VLSI design of a CBR controller for our proposed algorithm. Using diverse video-sized sequences under on-demand system coding-bit-rate constraints, the experimental outcomes demonstrate that the introduced design is capable of low power consumption and high speeds and can utilize low-complexity hardware.},

Thus, a modern society that depends on reliable electric supply requires a resilient electric system that can recover from disruptions while integrating emerging smart grid technologies. This article presents a novel approach for service restoration in a modern power distribution system with controllable switches and distributed generation (DG) resources for any kind of outage. The proposed framework supports both the traditional service restoration using feeder reconfiguration and the grid-forming DG-assisted intentional islands that are dynamically sized using algorithms based on the fault scenario, available resources, and priority of loads. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program that incorporates critical system connectivity and operating constraints. Simulations are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach using a large-scale four-feeder 1069-bus three-phase unbalanced distribution test system. It is demonstrated that the framework is effective in utilizing all available resources in quickly restoring the power supply to improve resiliency during extreme events and is scalable for a large-scale unbalanced power distribution system.},

Allocating the limited resources in a cost-effective manner while maximizing the quality of service (QoS) through real-time delivery and the provision of the appropriate representations for all viewers is a challenging problem. In our article, we introduce a machine-learning based predictive resource allocation framework for geo-distributed cloud sites, considering the delay and quality constraints to guarantee the maximum QoS for viewers and the minimum cost for content providers. First, we present an offline optimization that decides the required transcoding resources in distributed regions near the viewers with a tradeoff between the QoS and the overall cost. Second, we use machine learning to build forecasting models that proactively predict the approximate transcoding resources to be reserved at each cloud site ahead of time. Finally, we develop a greedy nearest and cheapest algorithm (GNCA) to perform the resource allocation of real-time broadcasted videos on the rented resources. Extensive simulations have shown that GNCA outperforms the state-of-the-art resource allocation approaches for crowdsourced live streaming by achieving more than 20\% gain in terms of system cost while serving the viewers with relatively lower latency.},

Technology advances have shown the relevance of a smart operation of multienergy cyber-physical systems (ME-CPS) requiring a strong cooperation between all players. However, in practice, the different assets that make up ME-CPS are operated by independent entities with different objectives and perspectives in mind. A new methodology is introduced that puts the stakeholders at the center of the design process by assuming that the system will be correctly designed and operated if all stakeholders reach a common agreement using formal contracts, which can be simulated for verification and validation before signature. Models are used to structure the relationships between stakeholders at all stages of the systems lifecycle: formal contracts are derived from high-level goals and are verified using “digital twins” that include requirement models and behavioral models. This new method was applied within a research project at EDF Lab to coordinate stakeholders for the renovation of a district to make it greener and smarter. Two scenarios were simulated revealing disagreements between stakeholders, and that satisfying ambitious key performance indicators (KPIs) is not an easy task requiring careful cooperation between actors.},

Zonal isolation of faults is necessary to prevent any misopertation of the dc breakers that can lead to a shutdown of the network. Existing techniques require fast-communication or data synchronization methods have their own disadvantages. This article proposes a method for efficient fault zone isolation without the need of a communication link that prevents any misoperation of the dc breakers in a radial MTdc. This method provides individual local measurement-based control to the hybrid dc circuit breakers (dcCB). Faults created outside the zone of protection for a breaker create a change in the rate of change of current or voltage leading to misoperation. To avoid detection using a fixed threshold, an adaptive threshold based approach is suggested that updates the threshold based on the present operating status. Sensitivity analysis by varying the current limiting inductance and fault location is performed. A three terminal radial model of an MTdc is used for zonal isolation using power system computer aided design/electromagnetic transients including dc.},

  abstract     = {Fault diagnosis is important to stable operation of power systems, and the machine-learning-based fault-diagnosis models were widely studied because of their strong generalization ability. However, the model structures are generally designed according to the topology of power systems. Once there are changes in topology, the system fault characteristics might change, and the models structure and parameters are often required to be adjusted for applying to the new systems. To avoid frequent adjustment work of fault-diagnosis models when system topology changes, we propose a novel fault-diagnosis model for power systems. First, a new data preprocessing using gradient calculation and similarity assessment is presented, and the gradient similarities among the multichannel electrical signals are converted to the visualized similarity images, which are fed to the neural network for further processing. Second, the spatial pyramid pooling (SPP) and hashing classifier (HC) are used in the convolution neural network. With the aid of the SPP and HC techniques, the structure of the fault-diagnosis model can maintain unchanged even though there are topological changes in the power systems. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, several state-of-the-art fault-diagnosis models are used for comparison. The results show that the proposed model with unchanged structure is well performed in accuracy and noise immunity, and friendly to the parameters setting.},

  abstract     = {This article proposes a distributed voltage control strategy for multiterminal high-voltage dc (MTdc) systems with fair power sharing among converters. A mathematical model for representing the dynamics of converters in MTdc systems is proposed. A distributed cooperative voltage control scheme is developed in which each converter only needs to communicate with the neighboring converters to regulate the voltage of the pilot bus of MTdc systems. The associated graph to the communication topology of the network is assumed to be a general time-varying graph. The proposed adaptive nonlinear protocol is scale-free and does not need any information about the communication graph and the number of agents and operates properly for time-varying graph. These features enhance the resilience of the proposed method against communication systems failures, multiplicative noise in communication network, and degradations. The performance of the proposed controller is demonstrated though the simulation of CIGRE MTdc test system.},

  abstract     = {Integration of RE sources to the utility grid offers technical and operational challenges causing problems of PQ, stability, identification of operational events, etc. This article presents an algorithm to identify events including islanding, grid integration, and outage of the solar PV and WG plants in grid using a ST. Islanding event may occur in the presence of any kind of plant. Processing of negative sequence component of voltage is performed by utilizing ST based multiresolution analysis at the test node and the output matrix is evaluated. The features (F1–F4), VI and STD indexes are obtained from this matrix. These features are utilized for identifying the events and transient phenomenon. The VI and STD indexes are used to recognize the type of RE source present during the islanding and outage events. Moreover, for recognizing the type of RE source at the time of synchronization event, an SI is proposed. This is computed by the ST depended processing of voltage signals. Performance of the algorithm is found satisfactory for all incidence angles and complete voltage cycle under the noisy conditions of 10 dB SNR. As compared to the time–frequency transform based coefficients of the voltage signal, the proposed technique is found to be superior in terms of small NDZ and low computation time and least affected by noise. Further, the developed technique is also efficient to detect various events stated above and the type of RE source. Study is performed using MATLAB/Simulink software and validated in real time using RTDS.},

  abstract     = {In a multibus dc microgrid, both the constant power loads (CPLs) and the discrete-time (DT) sampling of digital controllers tend to destabilize the system. To address these issues, a novel distributed DT control scheme is presented in this article to achieve proportional load current sharing and weighted average bus voltage regulation in dc microgrids with constant impedance loads, constant current loads, and CPLs (ZIP loads). First, a dc microgrid model with ZIP loads is established in the DT domain, based on which the distributed DT controller is developed. A sparse communication network is then exploited to achieve the proportional load current sharing by exchanging sampled current information between neighbors. Specifically, a distributed voltage observer utilizing the neighbors’ current information and local voltage information is designed to estimate and regulate the weighted average bus voltage. To alleviate the destabilizing effect induced by the DT sampling of digital controllers, a constrained condition on control gains is established. Additionally, a sufficient condition on CPLs that guarantees their negative impact on stability being locally counteracted is proposed. Through Lyapunov synthesis, the objectives of current sharing and voltage regulation are proved to be achieved simultaneously. Simulation studies on a detailed switch-level model validate the control scheme and demonstrate its robustness against communication network imperfections and the capability of accommodating plug-and-play operations.},

A home energy management model with comprehensive modeling of home appliances together with distributed storage and dispatchable generation is considered for testing the impact of the proposed pricing scheme and compared to existing RTP and TOU. The privacy and comfort of users are taken care of in the system modeling. An aggregative game approach is used to capture the interaction between users and utility. The conditions for the existence of Nash equilibrium and convergence of the proposed algorithm is investigated for all three pricing schemes considering residential users. The analysis shows the effectiveness of the proposed pricing scheme compare to the existing pricing schemes in terms of consumers energy bill and system peak reduction, complexity, and incentive to active consumers to participate in demand-side management programs.},

  abstract     = {Smart agriculture enables the efficiency and intelligence of production in physical farm management. Though promising, due to the limitation of the existing data collection methods, it still encounters few challenges required to be considered. Mobile crowd sensing (MCS) embeds three beneficial characteristics: 1) cost-effectiveness; 2) scalability; and 3) mobility and robustness. With the Internet of Things becoming a reality, smartphones are widely becoming available even in remote areas. Hence, both the MCS characteristics and the plug-and-play widely available infrastructure provide huge opportunities for MCS-enabled smart agriculture, opening up several new opportunities at the application level. In this article, we extensively evaluate agriculture mobile crowd sensing (AMCS) and provide insights for agricultural data collection schemes. In addition, we offer a comparative study with the existing agriculture data collection solutions and conclude that AMCS has significant benefits in terms of flexibility, collecting implicit data, and low-cost requirements. However, we note that AMCSs may still possess limitations regarding data integrity and quality to be considered a future work. To this end, we perform a detailed analysis of the challenges and opportunities that concerns MCS-enabled agriculture by putting forward seven potential applications of AMCS-enabled agriculture. Finally, we propose general research based on agricultural characteristics and discuss a special case based on the solar insecticidal lamp maintenance problem.},

The static equilibrium strategies and the factors that affect the equilibrium behavior of each player are analyzed by evolutionary game theory. Finally, to study the behaviors of three subjects, a simulation system is established on MATLAB GUI that quantitatively indicates the effect of initial conditions and related parameter changes on the evolution results, and then the corresponding management strategies are provided. It is demonstrated that the behaviors of each party will evolve in a favorable direction by adjusting the model parameters.

  abstract     = {This article presents a novel attempt to fine-tune all proportional-integral (PI) controllers of all power electronic circuits based on the salp swarm algorithm (SSA) to enhance both dynamic and transient stability of grid-tied wave energy conversion systems (WECSs). The WECS is based on the Archimedes wave swing unit that is connected with a permanent magnet synchronous generator. It is connected to the grid through a generator side converter (GSC) and a grid-side inverter (GSI). The GSC is controlled to minimize the generator power loss and maximize its power output. The GSI is controlled to maintain the terminal voltage and dc-link voltage via a cascaded control approach. Optimal PI controllers by using the SSA are implemented in these converters. The integral square error criterion is selected as a multiobjective function. The validity of SSA-based-PI controllers is verified by comparing their results with that achieved by genetic algorithm-based-PI controllers at severe disturbance of the power grid. To achieve a realistic study, measured wave pressure data extracted from a Portugal wave power plant are implemented in the dynamic analyses. The effectiveness of SSA-based PI controllers is tested under uncertainty of the real wave pressure of such WECSs. The dynamic studies are extensively performed using PSCAD/EMTDC program.},

Usually, most of the physical parts in control systems such as controllers and actuators are subjected to saturation. On the other hand, uncertainties are ubiquitous in the physical systems, which demand some necessities in the design of the control system. Additionally, unreliability in communication networks is another practical constraint in multiagent systems, which is required to be considered. In this article, based on the mentioned issues, a distributed robust algorithm is proposed for the semiglobal stabilization of the voltage and frequency of isolated (islanded) ac microgrids considering parameters uncertainties, static nonlinearity of actuators, and unreliability in the communication network. In this regard, by employing an adaptive low-gain feedback protocol, the robust performance of the closed-loop system is guaranteed. Finally, to evaluate the proposed control strategy’s performance, digital time-domain simulations are carried out on a test microgrid system in MATLAB/Simulink environment, and the results are compared with several previously reported methods. Simulation results and comparison with previous works reveal the proposed method’s effectiveness and accuracy in regulating the microgrid voltage/frequency and providing accurate proportional active power sharing.},

To safeguard the power grid, it is crucial to ensure information confidentiality in the communication networks. Quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols help in generating, and distributing secret keys between communication parties, and such secret keys are required in symmetric cryptography. The combination of QKD protocols, and symmetric cryptography are known to be unconditionally secure, which means information confidentiality can be guaranteed even against an eavesdropper, who has unlimited resources. This article provides a concise review of existing works on QKD protocols, and their applications in smart grid communications. Deploying QKD protocols in smart grid is challenging because distance between the control center, and control devices can be larger than the limits of existing protocols. Also, QKD protocols require an expensive quantum channel between each pair of sender, and receiver nodes, and there is large number of control devices with diverse capabilities in smart grid. We have classified existing works based on the challenges they have dealt with. Compared to the rich literature on QKD protocols in general, there are significantly fewer works in the specific context of smart grid. This can be an indication for opportunity to make a significant contribution. We have also identified a few research challenges that can be potential future works.},

  abstract     = {This article considers a one-way full-duplex decode-and-forward relay network consisting of a source, a relay, and a destination. Due to the self-interference (SI) channel estimation error at the relay, SI cannot be completely canceled. In the presence of the residual SI, there is a tradeoff between the achievable rate of the relay–destination link in a given time slot and that of the source–relay link in the next time slot depending on the relay transmit power in that time slot. As the relay transmit power increases, the achievable rate from the relay to destination increases, whereas the achievable rate from the source to the relay in the next time slot decreases. Motivated by this observation, relay power control schemes for maximizing achievable rates over static and time-varying channels are proposed in this article. Next, a closed-form expression for the relay transmit power in each time slot is derived.
