  abstract     = {It is of great significance for safe driving to study drivers&#39; eye movement and driving operation behavior when they encounter other road users violating traffic rules. The underlying reason is that most drivers are unable to process the unexpected visual stimulation, which is more likely to lead to driving accidents, especially in a hybrid situation. In this study, a driving simulator is used to design driving scenarios and study the driving performance of drivers with different driving experiences when other road users violate traffic rules. The experimental results show that some novice drivers ignore the position of their own vehicle when they encounter traffic violations which will lead to the collision with other road users. Moreover, some novice drivers can only perform one of the operations between steering and braking to avoid collision in these emergent situations. They cannot reasonably combine braking and steering to complete emergency driving operations like experienced drivers. Finally, when the driving difficulty increases, experienced drivers spend less time looking and more time scanning their surroundings to ensure that they can cope with the more complex driving environment while novice drivers do the opposite. This study reveals the difference between novices and experienced drivers, which paves a useful reference for the future advanced driving assistance system.},

  abstract     = {We present a novel method for vehicle-pedestrian path prediction that takes into account the awareness of the driver and the pedestrian towards each other. The method jointly models the paths of vehicle and pedestrian within a single Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN). In this DBN, sub-graphs model the environment and entity-specific context cues of the vehicle and pedestrian (incl. awareness), which affect their future motion and allow to increase the prediction horizon. These sub-graphs share a latent state which models whether vehicle and pedestrian are on collision course; this accounts for a certain degree of motion coupling. The method was validated with real-world data obtained by on-board vehicle sensing (stereo vision, GNSS and proprioceptive). Data consist of 93 vehicle and pedestrian encounters, spanning various awareness conditions and dynamic characteristics of the participants. In ablation studies, we quantify the benefits of various components of our proposed DBN model for path prediction and collision risk estimation. Results show that at a prediction horizon of 1.5 s, context-aware models outperform context-agnostic models in path prediction for scenarios with a dynamics change, while performing similarly otherwise. Results further indicate that driver attention-aware models improve collision risk estimation compared to driver-agnostic models.},

These algorithms and platforms are usually designed for different tasks in specific scenarios, which makes them incompatible with each other. To solve the problem, we propose a ubiquitous operating system named Parallel Driving Operating System (PDOS) based on the parallel driving theory. Specifically, the PDOS architecture includes the hardware layer, the kernel layer, the functional layer, and the application layer, which can realize heterogeneous hardware support, ubiquitous resource management, algorithm optimization, and ubiquitous application development, respectively. Moreover, we derive the PDOS into specific operating systems in four application scenarios, i.e., intelligent mining, intelligent warehousing, intelligent logistics, and intelligent port. To validate the PDOS, we test its usability, reliability, and efficiency in these scenarios. Evaluation results demonstrate the high performance of PDOS in multiple autonomous driving, and indicate that PDOS is an efficient operating system for parallel driving.},

Current technologies composing such a system include stand-alone and augmented global navigation satellite systems (GNSS), as well as visual, inertial, and signals-of-opportunity (SOPs) approaches. However, as it is well understood that no single alternative can meet the requirements for full autonomy, a combination of technologies is required to address alternative application scenarios. In this work, an online technique for relative positioning of autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is proposed that capitalizes on SOPs in conjunction with inertial measurements for localization and navigation when GNSS signals are not readily available. The proposed system uses the signals’ characteristics over a large part of the frequency spectrum, in conjunction with an optimal learning (OL) technique, to adaptively choose a sequence of frequencies that provide location estimates in real-time. Subsequently, inertial measurements, which are provided by an onboard unit, are employed to improve on the tracking accuracy. Field experiments, using an autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution under various parameter settings.},

A novel human-oriented online driving authority optimization shared steering framework is proposed to solve the problem of allocating driving authority between automation and human driver, in which the model predictive control(MPC) method is used to online optimize the driving authority. The merits of this framework is that, on the one hand, human driver workload can be alleviated in the case that the driver and the automation have similar driving intentions. On the other hand, the human driver has absolute control authority over an intelligent vehicle when the automation intention is inconsistent with that of the human driver. To illustrate the characteristics of the designed online driving authority optimization framework, simulations are carried out in the case of driver-automation cooperation and driver-automation non-cooperation. The results show that the proposed online driving authority optimization shared steering framework can not only restrict vehicles to safe areas but also lessen the driver’s workload.},

  abstract     = {Motion prediction is the fundamental input for decision-making in autonomous vehicles. The current motion prediction solutions are designed with a strong reliance on black box predictions based on neural networks (NNs), which is unacceptable for safety-critical applications. Motion prediction with high uncertainty can cause conflicting decisions and even catastrophic results. To address this issue, an uncertainty estimation approach based on the deep ensemble technique is proposed for motion prediction in this paper. Subsequently, the estimated uncertainty is considered in the decision-making module to improve driving safety. Firstly, a motion prediction model based on long short-term memory (LSTM) is built and the deep ensemble technique is utilized to obtain both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty of the prediction model. Besides, an uncertainty-aware potential field is developed to process the prediction uncertainty. Furthermore, a decision-making framework is proposed based on the model predictive control algorithm that considers the uncertainty-aware potential field, road boundaries, and multiple constraints of vehicle dynamics. Finally, the public available NGSIM , HighD and INTERACTION datasets are used to evaluate the proposed motion prediction model. More importantly, two traffic scenarios are also extracted from NGSIM and INTERACTION datasets to verify the effectiveness of the proposed decision-making method and in particular, its real-time performance is shown by employing a hardware-in-the-loop (HiL) experiment bench.},

The proposed method is based on model predictive control (MPC), where alternative predictions of the surrounding traffic are determined automatically such that they are intentionally adversarial to the ego vehicle. This provides robustness against the inherent uncertainty in traffic predictions. To reduce conservatism, an assumption that other agents are of no ill intent is formalized. Simulation results from highway driving scenarios show that the proposed method in real-time negotiates traffic situations out of scope for a nominal MPC approach and performs favorably to state-of-the-art reinforcement-learning approaches without requiring prior training. The results also show that the proposed method performs effectively, with the ability to prune disturbance sequences with a lower risk for the ego vehicle.},

With such a consideration, this survey summarizes and reviews the existing results on attack/anomaly detection and resilience of CAVs in control frameworks. This paper reviews the results according to the positions at which the attacks/anomalies occur. These positions are divided into three categories, namely, intra-vehicle communication network, perception sensors and inter-vehicle communication network.

We use this framework to enhance the Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) model and models based on it, which fail to cover situations where the ego vehicle has a higher decelerating capacity than its preceding vehicle. For arbitrary ego vehicle control policies, we show how our framework can be applied by substituting real (possibly computationally intractable) controllers with upper bounding functions.

In addition, MEC fills the gap between cloud computing and terminals in vehicular networks. In the MEC system, to reduce the load on MEC servers with large-scale vehicle deployment and promote the efficient use of network resources, vehicles can also transfer tasks to neighboring resource-rich vehicles using cooperative computation offloading. However, cooperative computation offloading between vehicles faces the challenges of security and insufficient information about the server vehicle. Therefore, this paper proposes using blockchain technology to achieve efficient data sharing between vehicles and service providers (i.e., server vehicles) and ensure the security of computation offloading between vehicles. First, we design a secure data sharing architecture in blockchain-based vehicular edge computing networks. Then, a new consensus mechanism in this architecture is proposed to improve the efficiency of data sharing and prevent malicious attacks. Furthermore, we present a cooperative offloading decision-making method using an offloading game, and the Nash equilibrium of the offloading strategy is achieved using this method. The results of numerical experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method.},

We then introduce a novel local descriptor, i.e. , Histogram of Orientations of Principal Normals (HOPN), to perform matching. The HOPN descriptor encodes the point normals of the clouds, and is more effective in matching BV images than the common image descriptors. In addition, we present the consensus set maximization algorithm to robustly estimate a rigid pose from the HOPN matches in the case of the low inlier ratio.

  abstract     = {Lane change (LC) is one of the safety-critical manoeuvres in highway driving according to various road accident records. Thus, reliably predicting such manoeuvre in advance is critical for the safe and comfortable operation of automated driving systems. The majority of previous studies rely on detecting a manoeuvre that has been already started, rather than predicting the manoeuvre in advance. Furthermore, most of the previous works do not estimate the key timings of the manoeuvre (e.g., crossing time), which can actually yield more useful information for the decision making in the ego vehicle. To address these shortcomings, this paper proposes a novel multi-task model to simultaneously estimate the likelihood of LC manoeuvres and the time-to-lane-change (TTLC). In both tasks, an attention-based convolutional neural network (CNN) is used as a shared feature extractor from a bird’s eye view representation of the driving environment. The spatial attention used in the CNN model improves the feature extraction process by focusing on the most relevant areas of the surrounding environment. In addition, two novel curriculum learning schemes are employed to train the proposed approach. The extensive evaluation and comparative analysis of the proposed method in existing benchmark datasets show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art LC prediction models, particularly considering long-term prediction performance.},

  abstract     = {Trajectory planning for automated parking has been widely known as more challenging than that for on-road driving due to the nonconvex kinematics, high-dimensional collision-avoidance constraints, and difficulty to determine the global optimum among many local optima. Changes in a dynamic environment easily make a previously planned parking trajectory invalid. Compared with the on-road planners which evade newly emerged obstacles via a nudge or side pass, a parking planner has to replan a completely different trajectory for evasion. A qualified online trajectory replanner should run fast, ensure trajectory continuity, and avoid extra halfway stops. This paper proposes a parallel stitching strategy to fulfill these demands. When the ego vehicle tracks an originally planned parking trajectory online, an evasive trajectory begins to be replanned once a new obstacle is found to block the way. Thereafter, a connective trajectory is planned, the two ends of which are future poses along the original trajectory and the evasive trajectory, respectively. The two ends of the connective trajectory are chosen by greedily evaluating various candidates via parallel computation, which ensures that our replanner runs fast with high solution quality. According to our real-world experiments and simulations, the proposed replanner outperforms the existing ones w.r.t. solution speed and quality. As an interesting feature, our proposed replanner also supports switching to a better homotopy class online.},

Static and partially dynamic charging are currently in use, but such types of charging reduce vehicles’ ability to stand charge, contributing to range anxiety. Dynamic charging of electric vehicles will be a promising technology in the near future, allowing an electric vehicle to charge by itself while in motion. However, assessing the security risks before enabling dynamic charging is mandatory, with authentication being a necessary step. Hence, a protocol suite EV-Auth is proposed for communicating entities in a dynamic charging system capable of mutual authentication and session key computation. To achieve practical capabilities, EV-Auth is built using lightweight cryptographic primitives. Additionally, it includes a unique feature known as seamless electric vehicle handover. The security of the proposed protocol suite is assessed both informally and formally using random oracle model and scyther tool. The performance analysis demonstrates that the proposed protocol suite satisfies the communication and computation time requirements.},

The planner should be smart enough to guide the AGV to move safely and smoothly. Besides, the efficiency of the planner is essential for real-time response. Risk-based motion planning algorithms consider the risk of collision with dynamic and static obstacles to deal with planning problems in human-AGV coexisting environments. However, their performance needs to be further improved. The bidirectional search sampling strategy is widely used to obtain real-time response capability. However, when considering kinodynamic constraints, the bidirectional search sampling strategy needs to solve the two-point boundary value problem (TBVP), which is not always solvable for all kinds of kinodynamic constraints. To achieve efficient AGV navigation in the environment with pedestrians, we propose a risk-based algorithm with a bidirectional search sampling strategy, namely bidirectional Risk-RRT (Bi-Risk-RRT). Additionally, by using the other direction as a heuristic, Bi-Risk-RRT bypasses TBVP and retains the advantages of the bidirectional search sampling strategy. The simulation experiments are conducted in various challenging environments, and the results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.},

The aim of this paper is to increase safety when using neural networks, by proposing a monitoring framework based on novelty estimation of incoming driving data. The idea is to use unsupervised instance discrimination to learn a similarity measure across ego-vehicle camera images. By estimating a von Mises-Fisher distribution of expected ego-camera images they can be compared with unexpected novel images. A novelty measurement is inferred through the likelihood of test frames belonging to the expected distribution. The suggested method provides competitive results to several other novelty or anomaly detection algorithms on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets. It also shows promising results on real world driving scenarios by distinguishing novel driving scenes from the training data of BDD100 k. Applied on the identical training-test data split, the method is also able to predict the performance profile of a segmentation network. Finally, examples are provided on how this method can be extended to find novel segments in images.},

The learning of such a policy requires a state representation that can encode the entire environment. Mid-level representations that encode a vehicle’s environment as images have become a popular choice. Still, they are quite high-dimensional, limiting their use in data-hungry approaches such as reinforcement learning. In this article, we propose to learn a low-dimensional and rich latent representation of the environment by leveraging the knowledge of relevant semantic factors. To do this, we train an encoder-decoder deep neural network to predict multiple application-relevant factors such as the trajectories of other agents and the ego car. Furthermore, we propose a hazard signal based on other vehicles’ future trajectories and the planned route which is used in conjunction with the learned latent representation as input to a down-stream policy. We demonstrate that using the multi-head encoder-decoder neural network results in a more informative representation than a standard single-head model. In particular, the proposed representation learning and the hazard signal help reinforcement learning to learn faster, with increased performance and less data than baseline methods.},

Conventional sampling-based algorithms have gained tremendous success in the path planning field, but they usually take much time to find the optimal solution so that the planning quality (evaluated with time cost and path length) cannot be guaranteed. In this paper, based on Gaussian Mixture Regression (GMR) and the family of Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) schemes, we propose the GMR-RRT* algorithm to achieve fast path planning for mobile robots. The proposed GMR-RRT* consists of learning navigation behaviors from human demonstrations and planning a high-quality path for the robot. Using the GMR, the key features of human demonstrations are captured to form a probability density distribution of the human trajectory in the current environment. This distribution is further utilized to guide the RRT scheme’s sampling process to generate a feasible path in the current environment quickly. We test the proposed GMR-RRT* in different environments, comparing it with three state-of-the-art sampling-based algorithms. The experimental results demonstrate that the GMR-RRT* algorithm can achieve better performance in terms of time cost, memory usage, and path length.},

We experimentally demonstrate that ISAR images of automotive targets provide rich features such as the dimensions, trajectory, and the number of wheels of the vehicles for classification. Additionally, we present a simulation framework for generating large volumes of realistic ISAR images of automotive targets at millimeter-wave frequencies for training classifiers. The model incorporates radar scattering phenomenology of commonly found vehicles along with range-Doppler-based clutter and receiver noise. The model is experimentally validated with measurement data gathered from an automotive radar. The images from the simulation database are subsequently classified using traditional machine learning techniques and deep neural networks based on transfer learning. We show that the ISAR images offer a classification accuracy above 90% and are robust to both noise and clutter.},

Is a more significant number of sampled scenarios guaranteeing a more accurate safety assessment of the ADS? Despite the various empirical success of ADS safety evaluation with scenario sampling in practice, some of the fundamental properties are largely unknown. This paper seeks to remedy this gap by formulating and tackling the scenario sampling safety assurance problem from a set invariance perspective. First, a novel conceptual equivalence is drawn between the scenario sampling safety assurance problem and the data-driven robustly controlled forward invariant set validation and quantification problem . This paper then provides a series of complete solutions with finite-sampling analyses for the safety validation problem that authenticates a given ODD. On the other hand, the quantification problem escalates the validation challenge and starts looking for a safe sub-domain of a particular property. This inspires various algorithms that are provably probabilistic incomplete, probabilistic complete but sub-optimal, and asymptotically optimal. Finally, the proposed asymptotically optimal scenario sampling safety quantification algorithm is also empirically demonstrated through simulation experiments.},

A general safety-certified cooperative control architecture capable of achieving various collective behaviors such as consensus, containment, enclosing, and flocking, is proposed. Specifically, a distributed motion generator is used to generate desired reference signals for each ISV. Robust-exact-differentiators-based (RED-based) extended state observers (ESOs) are designed for recovering unknown total disturbances in finite time. With the aid of control Lyapunov functions, input-to-state safe high order control barrier functions and RED-based ESOs, constrained quadratic optimization problems are formulated to generate optimal surge force and yaw moment without violating the input, stability, safety constraints. In order to facilitate real-time implementations, a one-layer recurrent neural network is employed to solve the constrained quadratic optimization problem on board. It is proved that all tracking errors of the closed-loop system are uniformly ultimately bounded and the multi-ISV system is input-to-state safe. An example is given to substantiate the effectiveness of the proposed general safety-certified cooperative control architecture.},

In this paper, we therefore present Risk Maps (RM) for online warning support in situations with forced lane changes, due to the end of roads. For this purpose, we first unify sensor data in a Relational Local Dynamic Map (R-LDM). RM is afterwards able to be run in real-time and efficiently probes a range of situations in order to determine risk-minimizing behaviors. Hereby, we focus on the improvement of uncertainty-awareness and transparency of the system. Risk, utility and comfort costs are included in a single formula and are intuitively visualized to the driver. In the conducted experiments, a low-cost sensor setup with a GNSS receiver for localization and multiple cameras for object detection are leveraged. The final system is successfully applied on two-lane roads and recommends lane change advices, which are separated in gap and no-gap indications. These results are promising and present an important step towards interpretable safety.},

  abstract     = {Supervised object detection models based on deep learning technologies cannot perform well in domain shift scenarios where annotated data for training is always insufficient. To this end, domain adaptation technologies for knowledge transfer have emerged to handle the domain shift problems. A stepwise domain adaptive YOLO (S-DAYOLO) framework is developed which constructs an auxiliary domain to bridge the domain gap and uses a new domain adaptive YOLO (DAYOLO) in cross-domain object detection tasks. Different from the previous solutions, the auxiliary domain is composed of original source images and synthetic images that are translated from source images to the similar ones in the target domain. DAYOLO based on YOLOv5s is designed with a category-consistent regularization module and adaptation modules for image-level and instance-level features to generate domain invariant representations. Our proposed method is trained and evaluated by using five public driving datasets including Cityscapes, Foggy Cityscapes, BDD100K, KITTI, and KAIST.

The central goal is to develop a resource-efficient communication and active suspension control co-design approach such that the limited in-vehicle network resources are occupied in an efficient manner, while simultaneously achieving the desired suspension system performance. For this purpose, a networked data transmission framework, incorporating a dynamic event-triggered communication mechanism and a logarithmic quantizer, is developed to accommodate the intermittent and digitalized packet-based transmissions over the in-vehicle controller area network channels. Specifically, the event triggering mechanism sporadically selects the sampled sensor data packets to be transmitted, which are then quantized before sending over the network channels. Then, formal stability and suspension performance analysis is carried out, and a co-design criterion on the existence of the desired triggering mechanism and event-triggered output feedback controller is further derived. Finally, the effectiveness and merits of the derived results are substantiated via several numerical case studies.},

First, a general platoon-based control framework is constructed, which simultaneously accounts for unknown leader control input, external disturbances, intermittent data samplings and transmissions, various spacing policies, and different vehicle-to-vehicle communication topologies. To alleviate excessive occupancy of the limited communication resources, an adaptive Zeno-free event-triggered communication mechanism is developed to determine when the sampling and transmission actions of vehicular data should be performed among interacting vehicles. Then, a scalable co-design approach for the desired adaptive platoon controller as well as event triggering condition is developed. One promising feature of the proposed platooning control strategy is that it is independent on the platoon scale or any global knowledge of the associated communication topology, and thus implementable on each vehicle in a scalable manner. Finally, several numerical case studies are conducted to verify the efficacy of the derived approach.},

Autonomous vehicles must anticipate these situations at an early stage too, to increase their safety and efficiency. In this work, lane-change recognition and prediction tasks are posed as video action recognition problems. Up to four different two-stream-based approaches, that have been successfully applied to address human action recognition, are adapted here by stacking visual cues from forward-looking video cameras to recognize and anticipate lane-changes of target vehicles. We study the influence of context and observation horizons on performance, and different prediction horizons are analyzed. The different models are trained and evaluated using the PREVENTION dataset. The obtained results clearly demonstrate the potential of these methodologies to serve as robust predictors of future lane-changes of surrounding vehicles proving an accuracy higher than 90% in time horizons of between 1-2 seconds.},

  abstract     = {Kinodynamic motion planning is critical for autonomous vehicles with high maneuverability in dynamic environments. However, obtaining near-optimal motion planning solutions with low computational costs and inaccurate prior model information is challenging. To address this issue, this paper proposes a receding-horizon reinforcement learning approach for kinodynamic motion planning (RHRL-KDP) of autonomous vehicles in the presence of inaccurate dynamics information and moving obstacles. Specifically, a receding-horizon actor-critic reinforcement learning algorithm is presented, resulting in a neural network-based planning strategy that can be learned both offline and online. A neural network-based model is built and learned online to approximate the modeling uncertainty of the prior nominal model in order to improve planning performance. Furthermore, active collision avoidance in dynamic environments is realized by constructing safety-related terms in actor and critic networks using potential fields. In theory, the uniformly ultimate boundedness property of the modeling uncertainty’s approximation error is proven, and the convergence of the proposed RHRL-KDP is analyzed. Simulation tests show that our approach outperforms the previously developed motion planners based on model predictive control (MPC), safe RL, and RRT &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;${^\star }$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; in terms of planning performance.

In addition, we analyze the specific requirements for the implementation process when applying intelligent tires to autonomous driving.

  abstract     = {Distraction, misjudgement and driving mistakes can significantly affect a driver, resulting in an increased risk of accidents. There are diverse factors that can cause mistakes in driving such as unfamiliarity with the road, situation unawareness, fatigue, stress, and drowsiness. In emerging smart cars, sensing, actuation, advanced signal processing and machine learning are deployed to reduce the impact of driving errors by monitoring the state of the driver in real-time, detecting the mistakes, and deploying necessary actions to counteract them. Such strategies are collectively known as human-machine shared driving. Towards a better understanding of the developments taken place in this domain, as well as identifying gaps and trends in this discipline, a systematic review of the major studies and developments reported in the literature is conducted. The study is based on 155 papers of human-machine shared driving, selected through a thorough and comprehensive search of the literature. The review demonstrates that shared control approaches are mostly dependent on vehicle and environmental data obtained through various sensors. The majority of methods deploy active shared control by leveraging longitudinal and lateral dynamics. However, the precise recognition of driver’s intent and actions, accurate estimation of situation awareness, and modelling the trust between driver and automation are still major challenges preventing timely transition of control from the driver to machine or vice-versa, and resulting in fatal accidents. Major challenges in human-machine shared driving are identified and potential future directions of the work are explored.},

Further, scenario-based testing is categorized into fundamental and advanced approaches based on the interaction between road users in generated scenarios. In this paper, six criteria are proposed to compare and evaluate the characteristics of V&amp;V approaches, which could help researchers gain insight into the benefits and limitations of the reviewed approaches and assist with approach choices. Next, the DMP system is broken down into a hierarchy of modules, and the functional requirements of each module are deduced.

  abstract     = {Material transportation is an essential process in mining operations and accounts for a large portion of total energy consumption. With the development of automation technology, autonomous mining trucks have been deployed in open-pit mines to reduce transportation costs. Compared to manned mining trucks, autonomous trucks are more appropriate for automatic scheduling techniques due to their high informatization, high-precision perception, and sophisticated control. However, the existing truck scheduling research does not exploit autonomous trucks’ strengths to perform more delicate control, but still takes a traditional approach toward autonomous trucks. In this paper, we propose a mixed-integer programming model for joint optimization of autonomous trucks trips and speeds to minimize energy consumption. To solve the proposed scheduling model, a novel tabu search algorithm is proposed, which consists of two parts: an improved flow allocation model with matching factor is formulated in the upper part to determine the optimal truck flow, and in the lower part a tabu search procedure guided with the optimal flow is developed. Based on the mathematical model and solution technique, we also propose a real-time scheduling system of autonomous trucks for the stochastic and dynamic mining environment. A coal mine in Inner Mongolia, China, for example, we verified the effectiveness of the proposed truck scheduling model and real-time scheduling approach. We demonstrate that the proposed allocation model effectively accelerates the tabu search procedure, and for short-term decisions, the proposed solution technique satisfies the computational requirements of the real-time scheduling system.},

  abstract     = {Digital Twin (DT) is an emerging technology and has been introduced into intelligent driving and transportation systems to digitize and synergize connected automated vehicles. However, existing studies focus on the design of the automated vehicle, whereas the digitization of the human driver, who plays an important role in driving, is largely ignored. Furthermore, previous driver-related tasks are limited to specific scenarios and have limited applicability. Thus, a novel concept of a driver digital twin (DDT) is proposed in this study to bridge the gap between existing automated driving systems and fully digitized ones and aid in the development of a complete driving human cyber-physical system (H-CPS). This concept is essential for constructing a harmonious human-centric intelligent driving system that considers the proactivity and sensitivity of the human driver. The primary characteristics of the DDT include multimodal state fusion, personalized modeling, and time variance. Compared with the original DT, the proposed DDT emphasizes on internal personality and capability with respect to the external physiological-level state. This study systematically illustrates the DDT and outlines its key enabling aspects. The related technologies are comprehensively reviewed and discussed with a view to improving them by leveraging the DDT. In addition, the potential applications and unsettled challenges are considered. This study aims to provide fundamental theoretical support to researchers in determining the future scope of the DDT system},

  abstract     = {In face of the safety risk and ageing workforce in traditional mining industry, smart mining is becoming the new trend, especially the autonomous mining, which could completely address the safety issue while boosting efficiency. However, the lack of specific standards for the smart mining has led to the various types of equipment and high development costs. Therefore, we present the effort by Chinese mining research organizations and industrial enterprises in creating standards for automation and autonomy. Besides, we introduce a few key intelligent technologies for the autonomous mining transportation, and several current applications of autonomous trucks in mines around the world. These key intelligent technologies are likely to be further improved with following standards and become more affordable for mines.},

This paper presents an experimental proof of concept, with a 1/5th scale car platform, of a maneuver selection scheme for low adhesion conditions.

  abstract     = {Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has recently been applied to eco-driving to intelligently reduce fuel consumption and travel time. While previous studies synthesize simulators and model-free DRL (MFDRL), this work proposes a Safe Off-policy Model-Based Reinforcement Learning (SMORL) algorithm for eco-driving. SMORL integrates three key components, namely a computationally efficient model-based trajectory optimizer, a value function learned off-policy and a learned safe set. The advantages over the existing literature are three-fold. First, the combination of off-policy learning and the use of a physics-based model improves the sample efficiency. Second, the training does not require any extrinsic rewarding mechanism for constraint satisfaction. Third, the feasibility of trajectory is guaranteed by using a safe set approximated by deep generative models. The performance of SMORL is benchmarked over 100 trips against a baseline controller representing human drivers, a non-learning-based optimal controller, a previously designed MFDRL strategy, and the wait-and-see optimal solution. In simulation, SMORL reduces the fuel consumption by more than 21% while keeping the average speed comparable while compared to the baseline controller and demonstrates a better fuel economy while driving faster compared to the MFDRL agent and the non-learning-based optimal controller.},

  abstract     = {A driver’s gaze is critical for determining theirattention, state, situational awareness, and readiness to take over control from partially automated vehicles. Estimating the gaze direction is the most obvious way to gauge a driver’s state under ideal conditions when limited to using non-intrusive imaging sensors. Unfortunately, the vehicular environment introduces a variety of challenges that are usually unaccounted for - harsh illumination, nighttime conditions, and reflective eyeglasses. Relying on head pose alone under such conditions can prove to be unreliable and erroneous. In this study, we offer solutions to address these problems encountered in the real world. To solve issues with lighting, we demonstrate that using an infrared camera with suitable equalization and normalization suffices. To handle eyeglasses and their corresponding artifacts, we adopt image-to-image translation using generative adversarial networks to pre-process images prior to gaze estimation. Our proposed Gaze Preserving CycleGAN (GPCycleGAN) is trained to preserve the driver’s gaze while removing potential eyeglasses from face images. GPCycleGAN is based on the well-known CycleGAN approach - with the addition of a gaze classifier and a gaze consistency loss for additional supervision. Our approach exhibits improved performance, interpretability, robustness and superior qualitative results on challenging real-world datasets.},

Constraints for safety are designed carefully in the optimization problem formulation to prevent potential collisions during intersection crossings. A novel vehicle-to-intersection (V2I) interaction mechanism is designed to handle imperfect communication characteristics such as packet delivery delay and loss. The proposed intersection management framework is evaluated by running extensive simulations using an open source vehicular network and microscopic traffic simulation software, Veins. The results show that the overall traffic control performance of the proposed framework is substantially better than conventional traffic light control framework, in particular when traffic volume is light and medium, even in situations with a realistic wireless vehicular network setting where packet delivery delays and drops occasionally occur.},

In this paper, for simplicity, distributed coordinating the motions of Vertical TakeOff and Landing (VTOL) UAVs to pass an airway is focused. This is formulated as a tube passing problem , which includes passing a virtual tube, inter-agent collision avoidance and keeping within the virtual tube. Lyapunov-like functions are designed elaborately, and formal analysis based on invariant set theorem is made to show that all UAVs can pass the virtual tube without getting trapped, avoid collision and keep within the virtual tube. What is more, by the proposed distributed control, a VTOL UAV can keep away from another VTOL UAV or return back to the virtual tube as soon as possible, once it enters into the safety area of another or has a collision with the virtual tube during it is passing the virtual tube.

ADAS involves several technologies such as automotive electronics, vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication, RADAR, LIDAR, computer vision, and machine learning. Of these, computer vision and machine learning based solutions have mainly been effective that have allowed real-time vehicle control, driver aided systems, etc. However, most of the existing works deal with the deployment of ADAS and autonomous driving functionality in countries with well-disciplined lane traffic. Nevertheless, these solutions and frameworks do not work in countries and cities with less-disciplined/chaotic traffic. This paper identifies the research gaps, reviews the state-of-the-art looking at the different functionalities of ADAS and its levels of autonomy. Importantly, it provides a detailed description of vision intelligence and computational intelligence for ADAS. The eye-gaze and head pose estimation in vision intelligence is detailed. Notably, the learning algorithms such as supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement learning and deep learning solutions for ADAS are considered and discussed. Significantly, this would enable developing a real-time recommendation system for system-assisted/autonomous vehicular environments with less-disciplined road traffic.},

This paper pioneers to employ an adaptive inverse controller to offset the dynamics of the steering system&#39;s backlash. Overall, the path-following objective is accomplished via a novel trio-loop control architecture, which decomposes the tracking objectives into kinematic, vehicular lateral dynamics, and steering backlash compensation sub-levels. All adaptive control laws are robustified by means of sigma modification. Hardware-in-the-loop experimental results are presented to demonstrate the superiorities of the proposed solution.},

One contributing method is scenario-based assessment in which test cases are derived from real-world road traffic scenarios obtained from driving data. Given the complexity of the reality that is being modeled in these scenarios, it is a challenge to define a structure for capturing these scenarios. An intensional definition that provides a set of characteristics that are deemed to be both necessary and sufficient to qualify as a scenario assures that the scenarios constructed are both complete and intercomparable. In this article, we develop a comprehensive and operable definition of the notion of scenario while considering existing definitions in the literature. This is achieved by proposing an object-oriented framework in which scenarios and their building blocks are defined as classes of objects having attributes, methods, and relationships with other objects. The object-oriented approach promotes clarity, modularity, reusability, and encapsulation of the objects. We provide definitions and justifications of each of the terms. Furthermore, the framework is used to translate the terms in a coding language that is publicly available.},

  abstract     = {Long-tail effect, characterized by highly frequent occurrence of normal scenarios and the scarce appearance of extreme “long-tail” scenarios, ubiquitously exists in the vision-related problems in the real-world applications. Though many computer vision methods to date have already achieved feasible performance for most of the normal scenarios, it is still challenging for existing vision systems to accurately perceive the long-tail scenarios. This deficiency largely hinders the practical application of computer vision systems, since long-tail problems may incur fatal consequences, such as traffic accidents, taking the vision systems of autonomous vehicles as an example. In this paper, we firstly propose a theoretical framework named Long-tail Regularization (LoTR), for analyzing and tackling the long-tail problems in the vision perception of autonomous driving. LoTR is able to regularize the scarcely occurred long-tail scenarios to be frequently encountered. Then we present a Parallel Vision Actualization System (PVAS), which consists of closed-loop optimization and virtual-real interaction, to search for challenging long-tail scenarios and produce large-scale long-tail driving scenarios for autonomous vehicles. In addition, we introduce how to perform PVAS in Intelligent Vehicle Future Challenge of China (IVFC), the most durable autonomous driving competition around the world. Results over the past decade demonstrate that PVAS can effectively guide the collection of long-tail data to diminish the cost in the real world, and thus promote the capability of vision systems to adapt to complex environments, alleviating the impact of long-tail effect.},

This paper considers the problem of planning a continuous-curvature-rate trajectory between fixed start and goal states that minimizes a tunable trade-off between passenger comfort and travel time. The problem is an instance of infinite dimensional optimization over two continuous functions: a path and a velocity profile. We propose a simplification of this problem that facilitates the discretization of both functions. This paper also proposes a method to quickly generate minimal-length paths between start and goal states based on a single tuning parameter: the second derivative of curvature. Further, we discretize the set of velocity profiles along a given path into a selection of longitudinal jerk way-points along the path. Finally, we repeatedly solve the path and velocity profiles in an iterative fashion. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the benefits of the proposed methods.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of autonomous driving technology, collision avoidance has become a research hotspot since it has the potential to increase safety. To obtain a collision-free path, the artificial potential field (APF) is widely used as a path planning method. APF is capable of establishing functional relationships between the vehicle and surrounding objects. However, the function features of the traditional APF method can cause autonomous vehicles to fall into the local minimum, and the generated zigzag path may be difficult to follow. Motivated by these challenges, this paper proposes a real-time path planning method for autonomous vehicles using the dynamic enhanced firework algorithm-APF. Firstly, to improve the safety and smoothness of the planned path by the traditional APF method, the constraints of the vehicle dynamics and different types of obstacles are taken into consideration. Secondly, an optimization problem is formulated to find an optimal path with the least cost in the driving area. Finally, the proposed method is verified with both a simulation and a hardware-in-loop test environment. The results show that the studied autonomous vehicle successfully avoids obstacles and arrives at the goal position by using the proposed path-planning method, and the path smoothness is improved.},

Fault tolerance regimes such as these are widely used in recent publications related to automated driving, yet without definitions. This largely holds true for automotive safety standards, too. We show that fault tolerance regimes defined in scientific publications related to the automotive domain are partially ambiguous as well as taxonomically unrelated. The presented taxonomy is based on terminology stemming from ISO 26262 as well as from systems engineering. It uses four criteria to distinguish fault tolerance regimes. In addition to fail-operational , fail-degraded , and fail-safe , the core terminology consists of operational and fail-unsafe . These terms are supported by definitions of available performance , nominal performance , functionality , and a concise definition of the safe state . For verification, we show by means of two examples from the automotive domain that the taxonomy can be applied to hierarchical systems of different complexity.},

  abstract     = {Monocular 3D object detection, with the aim of predicting the geometric properties of on-road objects, is a promising research topic for the intelligent perception systems of autonomous driving. Most state-of-the-art methods follow a keypoint-based paradigm, where the keypoints of objects are predicted and employed as the basis for regressing the other geometric properties. In this work, a unified network named as FADNet is presented to address the task of monocular 3D object detection. In contrast to previous keypoint-based methods, we propose to divide the output modalities into different groups according to the estimation difficulty of object properties. Different groups are treated differently and sequentially associated by a convolutional Gated Recurrent Unit. Another contribution of this work is the strategy of depth hint augmentation. To provide characterized depth patterns as hints for depth estimation, a dedicated depth hint module is designed to generate row-wise features named as depth hints, which are explicitly supervised in a bin-wise manner. The contributions of this work are validated by conducting experiments and ablation study on the KITTI benchmark. Without utilizing depth priors, post optimization, or other refinement modules, our network performs competitively against state-of-the-art methods while maintaining a decent running speed.},

  abstract     = {Predicting vulnerableroad user behavior is an essential prerequisite for deploying Automated Driving Systems (ADS) in the real-world. Pedestrian crossing intention should be recognized in real-time, especially for urban driving. Recent works have shown the potential of using vision-based deep neural network models for this task. However, these models are not robust and certain issues still need to be resolved. First, the global spatio-temporal context that accounts for the interaction between the target pedestrian and the scene has not been properly utilized. Second, the optimal strategy for fusing different sensor data has not been thoroughly investigated. This work addresses the above limitations by introducing a novel neural network architecture to fuse inherently different spatio-temporal features for pedestrian crossing intention prediction. We fuse different phenomena such as sequences of RGB imagery, semantic segmentation masks, and ego-vehicle speed in an optimal way using attention mechanisms and a stack of recurrent neural networks. The optimal architecture was obtained through exhaustive ablation and comparison studies. Extensive comparative experiments on the JAAD and PIE pedestrian action prediction benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, where state-of-the-art performance was achieved.

To advance the development of visual guidance systems, we introduce a novel vision-cloud data fusion methodology, integrating camera image and Digital Twin information from the cloud to help intelligent vehicles make better decisions. Target vehicle bounding box is drawn and matched with the help of the object detector (running on the ego-vehicle) and position information (received from the cloud). The best matching result, a 79.2% accuracy under 0.7 intersection over union threshold, is obtained with depth images served as an additional feature source. A case study on lane change prediction is conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed data fusion methodology. In the case study, a multi-layer perceptron algorithm is proposed with modified lane change prediction approaches. Human-in-the-loop simulation results obtained from the Unity game engine reveal that the proposed model can improve highway driving performance significantly in terms of safety, comfort, and environmental sustainability.},

Within the proposed Digital Twin framework, we developed an enhanced first-in-first-out (FIFO) slot reservation algorithm to schedule the sequence of crossing vehicles, a consensus motion control algorithm to calculate vehicles’ referenced longitudinal motion, and a model-based motion estimation algorithm to tackle communication delay and packet loss. Additionally, an augmented reality (AR) human-machine-interface (HMI) is designed to provide the guidance to drivers to cooperate with other connected vehicles. Agent-based modeling and simulation of the proposed system is conducted in Unity game engine based on a real-world map in San Francisco, and the human-in-the-loop (HITL) simulation results prove the benefits of the proposed algorithms with 20% reduction in travel time and 23.7% reduction in energy consumption, respectively, when compared with traditional signalized intersections.},

We propose the novel geometry-aware DynaFill architecture that follows a coarse-to-fine topology and incorporates our gated reccurrent feedback mechanism to adaptively fuse information from previous timesteps. We optimize our architecture using adversarial training to synthesize fine realistic textures which enables it to hallucinate color and depth structure in occluded regions online in a spatially and temporally coherent manner, without relying on future frame information. Casting our inpainting problem as an image-to-image translation task, our model also corrects regions correlated with the presence of dynamic objects in the scene, such as shadows or reflections. We introduce a large-scale hyperrealistic dataset with RGB-D images, semantic segmentation labels, camera poses as well as groundtruth RGB-D information of occluded regions. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, even in challenging weather conditions. Furthermore, we present results for retrieval-based visual localization with the synthesized images that demonstrate the utility of our approach.},

However, many of these techniques make assumptions that will almost certainly be questionable in the real world, namely: 1) relative positioning between vehicles will be sufficiently accurate at all times; 2) the merging application-equipped vehicles will not change lanes before reaching the merge point, nor will other vehicles change lanes into their lane; and 3) vehicles with merging-assist technology will not mix with vehicles without the technology. This paper proposes a cooperative merging application which is capable of functioning even when the vehicle&#39;s positioning accuracy is severely degraded and all vehicles are free to change lanes into and out of the merging traffic streams. Furthermore, our strategy demonstrates safety, efficiency, and environmental benefits for the overall traffic stream even with technology penetration rates as low as 20%.},

  abstract     = {The autonomous vehicle studiesrecently have been accelerated to ensure more secure, efficient, and comfortable transportation. Non-linearity in the power-train makes longitudinal control of autonomous vehicles difficult at low speeds. Additionally, rapid acceleration and deceleration (due to the behavior of the surrounding vehicles) increase complexity in control of such systems. In this study, we designed a novel longitudinal controller including the reverse plant model of the vehicle to overcome these problems. The complete controller is designed using parameters known to OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturer) with vehicle CAN bus signals. The longitudinal controller consists of two parts: The outer controller which determines the target speed according to lead vehicle’s speed and the inner controller which determines the accelerator pedal percentage and brake requests. The inner controller includes PI followed by the reverse plant model with a virtual load sensor. This model enables control of a vehicle with non-linear power-train. The designed controller performance was tested on a city bus with a diesel engine and automatic transmission. Vehicle test results proved, that the designed controller is capable of controlling an autonomous vehicle with nonlinear power-train dynamics with onboard computational capacity even at low speeds.},

  abstract     = {In this paper a learning-based optimization method for online gear shift and velocity control is presented to reduce the fuel consumption and improve the driving comfort in a car-following process. The continuous traction force and the discrete gear shift are optimized jointly to improve both the powertrain operation and the longitudinal motion. The problem is formulated as a nonlinear mixed-integer optimization problem and solved based on adaptive dynamic programming. A major difference compared to existing approaches is that the developed control method is model-free, i.e. it does not rely on vehicle models. It can address system nonlinearities and adapt to changes in engine characteristics (e.g. consumption map) during vehicle driving. The computation is efficient and enables possible real-time implementation. The proposed control method is studied for an urban driving cycle to evaluate the control performance with respect to the fuel economy and the driving comfort. Simulations indicate that the host vehicle can reduce the fuel consumption by 5.03% and 1.12% for two consumption maps in comparison to the preceding while keeping a desired inter-vehicle distance. The results further show a decrease of 1.59% and 2.32% in fuel consumption compared to a linear quadratic controller with the same gear shift schedule.},

  abstract     = {Semantic scene segmentation has primarily been addressed by forming high-level visual representations of single images. The problem of semantic segmentation in dynamic scenes has begun to receive attention with the video object segmentation and tracking problem. While there has been some recent work attempt to use deep learning models on the video level, what is not known is how the temporal dynamics information is contributing to the full scene segmentation. Moreover, most existing datasets only provide full scene annotation on non-consecutive images to ensure the variability of scenes, making it even harder to explore novel methods on video-level modeling. To address the above issues, our work takes steps to explore the behavior of modern spatiotemporal modeling approaches by: 1) constructing the MIT DriveSeg dataset, a large-scale video driving scene segmentation dataset, densely annotated for pixel-level semantic classes with 5000 consecutive video frames, and 2) proposing a joint-learning framework that reveals the contribution of temporal dynamics information in regard to different semantic classes in the driving scene. This work is intended to help assess current methods and support further exploration of the value of temporal dynamics information in video-level scene segmentation.},

This paper presents a task-driven approach to input fusion that minimizes the utilization of resource-heavy sensors and demonstrates its application to Visual-Lidar fusion for object tracking and path planning. The proposed spatiotemporal sampling algorithm activates Lidar only at regions-of-interest identified by analyzing visual input and reduces the Lidar ‘base frame rate’ according to the kinematic state of the system. This significantly reduces Lidar usage, in terms of data sensed/transferred and potentially power consumed, without a severe reduction in performance compared to both a baseline decision-level fusion and state-of-the-art deep multi-modal fusion.},

This paper takes advantages of the uneven range distribution of different LiDAR laser beams to propose a range aware instance segmentation network, RangeSeg. RangeSeg uses a shared encoder backbone with two range dependent decoders. A heavy decoder only computes top of a range image where the far and small objects locate to improve small object detection accuracy, and a light decoder computes whole range image for low computational cost. The results are further clustered by the DBSCAN method with a resolution weighted distance function to get instance-level segmentation results. Experiments on the KITTI dataset show that RangeSeg outperforms the state-of-the-art semantic segmentation methods with enormous speedup and improves the instance-level segmentation performance on small and far objects. The whole RangeSeg pipeline meets the real time requirement on NVIDIA JETSON AGX Xavier with 19 frames per second in average.},

In this work, we have shown that lowering down radar range in dense traffic scenario provides twofold advantages; (a) it reduces radar-to-radar interference and, (b) it provides resources to support the vehicular communication. We propose a joint Radar-Communication (R-Comm) algorithm which enables connected vehicles to use a fraction of radar resources for vehicular communication based on the traffic density. Also, two different schemes have been proposed for R-Comm transmission in the sparse and dense traffic scenarios. Further, through simulation results, it is shown that R-Comm benefits both radar and communication systems.},

The workspace limitations are determined based on the displacement, velocity and acceleration limitations of the actuators. The motion cueing algorithms (MCAs) are introduced to reproduce the motion sensation for the driver of the SBMP same as the real vehicle&#39;s driver while keeping the SBMP inside the actuators&#39; limitations. The optimal MCA was developed to decrease the human motion sensation error between the real vehicle&#39;s driver and the SBMP&#39;s user based on the human vestibular system model using the linear quadratic regulator method. However, the inverse acceleration kinematics model of the SBMPs are not considered in developing optimal MCA to control the displacement, velocity and acceleration of actuators. The lack of inverse acceleration kinematics consideration inside the optimal MCA causes the poor consumption of the SBMP&#39;s workspace, as the optimal MCA only considers the boundaries of the SBMP in the Cartesian coordinate system. In this paper, the new optimal MCA based on the inverse acceleration kinematic solution of the SBMP is designed and developed to regenerate the more realistic motion sensation. The validation of the new optimal MCA is performed using Simulink/MATLAB. The outcomes demonstrate that using the new optimal MCA will reach a better motion sensation with less false motion signals in contrast with the existing optimal MCAs.},

The parameters required to construct and calibrate the simulation are extracted from real measurements done on a test area and highway covering different water film thicknesses and vehicle speeds. The simulation is validated in different stages, first by comparing the trajectories of the particles with a regular solver and secondly, by the spatial distribution of the virtual and real point clouds with the measurement results. The resulting framework can be easily expanded to cover scenarios that are more complex and other phenomena counterproductive to the performance of a LIDAR sensor like dirt, exhaust gases, snow, rain and fog. The virtually generated point clouds can be used to validate the performance of the software required for the segmentation, classification and tracking of objects generated by the LIDAR sensor, thereby reducing development costs and increasing software quality.},

However, they do not explicitly differentiate instances within the same semantic class. We investigate several ways to augment single-frame stixels with instance information, which can be extracted by a CNN from the RGB image input. As a result, our novel Instance Stixels method efficiently computes stixels that account for boundaries of individual objects, and represents instances as grouped stixels that express connectivity. Experiments on the Cityscapes dataset demonstrate that including instance information into the stixel computation itself, rather than as a post-processing step, increases the segmentation performance (i.e., Intersection over Union and Average Precision). This holds especially for overlapping objects of the same class. Furthermore, we show the superiority of our approach in terms of segmentation performance and computational efficiency compared to combining the separate outputs of Semantic Stixels and a state-of-the-art pixel-level CNN. We achieve processing throughput of 28 frames per second on average for 8 pixel wide stixels on images from the Cityscapes dataset at 1792 × 784 pixels.

Here the dynamics of the vehicle is approximated by a first order system. The lower level time-lag is referred to the lag associated with the vehicle dynamics to attain the desired condition computed by the adaptive cruise controller. Inclusion of such dynamics reduces the performance of an adaptive cruise control system, both locally and collectively. The solutions presented here can be applied to design a new adaptive cruise control model or to extend any model with velocity dependent spacing function. The derived design method fulfills the over-damped string stability condition in presence of a time-lag in the plant, irrespective of the choice of the equilibrium operating point of linearization. The over-damped characteristic improves both safety and performance. To demonstrate the application of the presented method, two existing models are extended using the derived strategy, viz. the variable time gap and the quadratic range policy. Later the extended models are simulated with rigorous driving conditions, in order to illustrate the improvements in comparison with the respective original models as well as with the extended models using an existing compensation strategy.},
