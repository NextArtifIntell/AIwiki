  abstract     = {Networked multiagent systems use network technology to realize the interconnection, intercommunication, and mutual control of things. The coordinated control problem of networked nonlinear multiagent systems via cloud edge computing is investigated in this article. A mist–fog–cloud predictive control scheme is proposed for the coordinated control of complex large-scale networked multiagent systems by making use of the advantages of cloud edge computing. This scheme actively compensates for communication delays and achieves desired coordination performance of individual agents. Variable horizon learning predictors are presented to predict the outputs of the unknown nonlinear dynamical agents within different horizons. The design of coordinated control optimizes a performance index function presented to measure the coordination between agents. The analysis on a networked nonlinear multiagent system using the mist–fog–cloud predictive control scheme results in the conditions of simultaneous consensus and stability of the entire closed-loop system. An example demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we consider a hierarchical control-based dc microgrid (DCmG) equipped with unknown input observer (UIO)-based detectors, where the potential false data injection (FDI) attacks and the distributed countermeasure are investigated. First, we find that the vulnerability of the UIO-based detector originates from the lack of knowledge of true inputs. Zero trace stealthy (ZTS) attacks can be launched by secretly faking the unknown inputs, under which the detection residual will not be altered, and the impact on the DCmG in terms of voltage balancing and current sharing is theoretically analyzed. Then, to mitigate the ZTS attack, we propose an automatic and timely countermeasure based on the average point of common coupling voltage obtained from the dynamic average consensus (DAC) estimator. The integrity of the communicated data utilized in DAC estimators is guaranteed via UIO-based detectors, where the DAC parameters are perturbed in a fixed period to be concealed from attackers. Finally, the detection and mitigation performance of the proposed countermeasure is rigorously investigated, and extensive simulations are conducted in Simulink/PLECS to validate the theoretical results.},

We propose a change in control paradigm to a universal dual-port GFM control strategy that simultaneously forms the converter ac and dc voltage (i.e., dual-port GFM), unifies standard functions of grid-following (GFL) and GFM (e.g., primary frequency control, maximal power point (MPP) tracking) in a single universal controller, and is backward compatible with conventional machine-based generation. Notably, in contrast to state-of-the-art control architectures that use a mix of grid-forming and grid-following control, dual-port GFM control can be used independently of the converter power source or network configuration. Our main contributions are stability conditions that cover emerging hybrid ac/dc networks as well as machines and converters with and without controlled power source, which only require partial knowledge of the network topology. Finally, a detailed case study is used to illustrate and validate the results.},

In this article, we analyze a simple version of the best experienced payoff (BEP) algorithm, a revision protocol that has recently been proposed in the evolutionary game theory literature. This revision protocol is simple, completely decentralized, and has minimum information requirements. Here, we prove that adding some noise to this protocol can lead to efficient results in single-optimum coordination problems in little time, even in large populations of agents. We also test the algorithm under a wide range of different conditions using computer simulation. In particular, we consider different numbers of agents and strategies, and we analyze the robustness of the algorithm to different updating schemes (e.g., synchronous versus asynchronous) and to different types of interaction networks (e.g., ring, preferential attachment, small world, and complete). In all the cases, using the noisy version of BEP, the agents quickly approach a small neighborhood of the optimal state from every initial condition and spend most of the time in that neighborhood.},

An augmented system composed of both the estimation error dynamics and the tracking error dynamics is introduced for the distributed estimation and target tracking control problem. We integrate estimation and control to simultaneously minimize infinite-horizon estimation and tracking errors in sensor networks with disturbances. A Minmax strategy as an alternative goal to Nash equilibrium is proposed to compute the sensor’s optimal motion controls in the presence of worst-case neighbor controls and disturbances. In contrast to Nash, Minmax yields a distributed algebraic Riccati equation that is easily solved locally by each sensor. A method based on reinforcement learning is given to compute sensor motion inputs so that all sensors estimate and track the target states. Value function approximation using neural networks is used to solve the distributed Bellman equations online based on the real-time observed data. Proofs are given to guarantee the performance of the combined distributed estimation and tracking algorithms. Finally, the simulation examples show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

A nonlinear reference model system captures an ideal behavior of the agents for the leader-following consensus problem. We design a modified nonlinear reference model system and propose a distributed model reference adaptive control architecture to suppress the effects of system uncertainties without a strict knowledge of their magnitude and rate upper bounds. Consequently, each agent evolves within a (possibly different) prescribed distance from the corresponding modified reference system trajectories. Based on an input-to-state stability analysis, it is shown that the trajectories of the modified reference model system can get arbitrarily close to the trajectories of the ideal reference model system. As a result, the trajectories of the agents evolve within a user-specified prescribed distance from their ideal system trajectories, satisfying the safety constraints. The key feature of the presented control architecture in this article is the elimination of the ad hoc tuning process for the adaptation rate that is conventionally required in model reference adaptive control systems to ensure safety. An illustrative numerical example finally demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed distributed adaptive control architecture.},

We consider Gramian-based performance metrics and propose a novel notion of edge centrality that encodes the first-order variation in the metric with respect to the modification of the corresponding edge weight, including for those edges not present in the network. The proposed edge centrality matrix (ECM) is additive over the set of inputs, i.e., it captures the specific contribution to each edge’s centrality of the presence of any given actuator. We provide a full characterization of the ECM structure for the class of directed stem-bud networks, showing that nonzero entries are only possible at specific sub/super-diagonals determined by the network size and the length of its bud. We also provide bounds on the value of the trace, trace inverse, and log-det of the Gramian before and after single-edge modifications, and on the edge-modification weight to ensure the modified network retains stability. Simulations show the utility of the proposed edge centrality notion and validate our results.},

The main challenges are to control both the relative positions and angles between the target and the UAVs to within desired values, and to guarantee that the generated control inputs to the UAVs are feasible (i.e., within their motion capabilities). Moreover, the UAVs are controlled to ensure that the target always remains within the fields of view of their onboard cameras. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to apply multiple UAVs to cooperatively track a dynamic target while ensuring that the UAVs remain connected and that both occlusion and collisions are avoided. To achieve these control objectives, a designed controller solved based on the aforementioned tracking controller using quadratic programming can generate minimally invasive control actions to achieve occlusion avoidance and collision avoidance. Furthermore, control barrier functions (CBFs) with a distributed design are developed in order to reduce the amount of inter-UAV communication.

Chief among the relevant concepts is a 2-partition; this underlies the classical Cheeger inequality and highlights a “constriction” (bottleneck) that limits accessibility between the respective parts of the network. In a similar spirit, we explore a notion of global circulation which necessitates a concept of a 3-partition that exposes this macroscopic feature of network flows. Graph circulation is often present in transportation networks as well as in certain biological networks. We introduce a notion of circulation for general graphs and then focus on planar graphs. For the case of the latter, we explain that a scalar potential characterizes circulation in complete analogy with the curl of planar vector fields and we present an algorithm for determining values of the potential and, hence, quantify circulation. We then discuss alternative notions of circulation, explain how these may depend on graph embedding, draw parallels between networks and Helmholtz–Hodge decomposition of vector fields, and conclude with a suggestive application of the framework in detecting abnormalities in cardiac circulatory physiology.},

We consider dynamic networks modeled as linear time-invariant systems subject to perturbations of bounded energy satisfying specific sparsity and entry-wise constraints. Given an energy level, the structured pseudospectral abscissa captures the worst-possible perturbation an adversary could employ to destabilize the network, and the structured stability radius is the maximum energy in the structured perturbation that the network can withstand without becoming unstable. Building on a novel characterization of the worst-case structured perturbation, we propose iterative algorithms that efficiently compute the structured pseudospectral abscissa and structured stability radius. We provide theoretical guarantees of the local convergence of the algorithms and illustrate their efficacy and accuracy on several network examples.},

The system is capable to autonomously modulate the street lamps’ brightness in specific areas or segments of the urban roads of interest to reduce the energy consumption at the minimum allowed by regulations. To this end, a hybrid traffic model is proposed in this article to estimate in each segment of the roads the number of vehicles on which basis the lamps’ brightness minimization is accomplished. The traffic model represents a digital twin of the smart architecture that acts by orchestrating local dimmers, traffic lights, video cameras, and acoustic sensors. A bank of robust switching observers is used to estimate and classify the traffic in all segments. One agent at a time is selected from the bank and put in order. The agent selection is based on a distributed reputation mechanism recently developed for a class of networked systems. As one of its main merits, this methodology is capable to reveal those sensors that have the highest informative contents (Quality of Service) on the basis of their reputation (trust) shared among the agents. Finally, the proposed approach has been evaluated by considering a highly structured road network and, as one of its main results, the simulations show energy savings up to 70% with respect to the traditional street lamps management.},

However, the current pervasive deployment of distributed renewable energy sources and the increasing growth of active players, providing ancillary services to the grid, have made these centralized frameworks no longer appropriate. In this context, we propose a novel noncooperative control mechanism for optimally regulating the operation of power distribution networks equipped with traditional loads, distributed generation, and active users. The latter, also known as prosumers, contribute to the grid optimization process by leveraging their flexible demand, dispatchable generation capability, and/or energy storage potential. Active users participate in a noncooperative liberalized market designed to increase the penetration of renewable generation and improve the predictability of power injection from the high-voltage grid. The novelty of our game-theoretical approach consists in incorporating economic factors as well as physical constraints and grid stability aspects. Finally, by integrating the proposed framework into a rolling-horizon approach, we show its effectiveness and resiliency through numerical experiments.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we consider a specific scenario, where multiple connected automated vehicles (CAVs) entering one road link from different upstream links are required to form a platoon first, then cross the junction at the end of the link safely, and fuel economically. Each CAV may experience a reaction-time delay and follow a specific nonlinear car-following model. To address this problem, we design a two-stage distributed platoon control strategy. In the first stage, we present a sufficient condition about the length of a platoon that ensures a subsequent safe junction crossing, upon which a distributed cooperative control protocol is designed and an iteration algorithm is proposed to ensure the fast formation of the platoon in a finite time. Once the platoon is formed, in the second stage, we design a method to estimate the leader vehicle’s acceleration adjustment by developing distributed observers that ensure a safe junction crossing of the entire CAV platoon, taking into account follower-vehicle dynamics and an upcoming traffic signal schedule while minimizing the overall platoon fuel consumption. If a platoon has already been formed at the entrance of the link with the appropriate platoon size, then only the second-stage design is needed. Thus, our proposed two-stage CAV link control strategy may potentially become part of a broader fuel-economic solution for the effective management of CAV platoons in a large urban traffic network.},

In this study, we propose a novel smart-parking system that allocates parking lots based on the matching theory, considering both the drivers’ and parking managers’ preferences. Some drivers may be unable to be allocated to parking lots because of the high traffic volume in urban areas that causes many parking lots to be full. Therefore, we propose a prior reservation system that can reallocate parking lots considering the waiting time until vacant parking spaces appear. The driver’s preference is redetermined considering the waiting time obtained by both the parked drivers’ and reallocated drivers’ information. We also present a parking lot allocation algorithm, including rematching, and discuss stability and strategy-proofness, which are important properties of matching. Furthermore, we propose a dynamic parking fee design, considering different parking statuses (“full,” “congested,” and “available”). By combining the “price increase” with the “price decrease” based on parking status, the proposed dynamic parking fee aims not only to level out parking utilization but also to secure the parking managers’ profit. Finally, numerical simulations confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method using rematching and dynamic parking fee design.},

We study three versions of the problem: the case when no interruption of an appliance is possible after admission, the case in which it is possible, and the case in which the overall energy can be delivered at an arbitrary rate over time. We show that these three versions of the problem can be faced in the proposed framework by suitably choosing the cost function. We then propose some relaxations to derive lower bounds for the cost.

  abstract     = {Mobility will surely be at the core of the smart cities of the future. As such, it must be planned based on novel mobility models, smart enough to answer the multifaceted needs of users, while being sustainable and energy efficient. In this evolution, electric vehicles (EVs) will be crucial, as confirmed by the fact that many governments are already actively sustaining their spread in place of common internal combustion engine (ICE) ones. Nonetheless, for their adoption to be actually widespread, one must be able to govern the mass adoption mechanisms, by designing policies that are cost-effective and successful in making the mobility transition a reality in due time. In this work, we propose a novel framework that can represent a valuable control-oriented tool to serve this ambitious goal. Our framework lays its foundation on a quantitative description of the inclination of traditional car owners toward EVs, which is retrieved by relying on data-driven insights on their mobility habits only. This information is further exploited to construct a proximity-based network, that is combined with the individual characterization into a cascade model describing the adoption dynamics. To show the potential of the introduced framework, we exploit it to assess the unforced spread of EVs starting from a set of known EV owners, and to test and quantitatively evaluate the cost and benefits of policies enacted to foster adoption.},

  abstract     = {This article proposes a control algorithm for one-waycar sharing. The problem with one-way car sharing is that the origin and the destination parking lots tend to be biased because of user traffic demands, and the cost of relocating the vehicle to increase the operating rate is high. To solve this problem, we propose providing incentives to users in the form of discounts and changing the parking lots and departure times to prevent bias in the number of vehicles in the parking lots. In this study, the optimum parking lot was determined using a queue to incorporate the user traffic demand distribution. Furthermore, based on the Vickrey–Clarke–Groves mechanism design, an incentive design was created to satisfy desirable properties, such as strategy-proofness, individual rationality, and coalition rationality. In the proposed one-way car-sharing system, the system manager decides the proposal based on the information reported by the users. Therefore, satisfying these properties not only guarantees that the users will benefit from agreeing to the proposal, but also that even in case of a false declaration or shill bidding, the discount will not be unreasonably profitable. Finally, the increase in demand acceptance by applying the proposed method is confirmed by numerical simulation.},

  abstract     = {Based on machine learning (ML) technique, the data-driven power system dynamic security assessment (DSA) has received significant research interest. Yet, the well-trained ML-based models with high training and testing accuracy may be vulnerable to the adversarial example, which is a modified version of the original sample that is intentionally perturbed but retains being very close to the original one. Such adversarial examples can mislead the DSA results and lead to catastrophic consequences. Thus, the accuracy index alone is not enough to represent the performance of the ML-based DSA models. To evaluate the ML-based DSA models and provide formal robustness guarantee for real-time DSA, this article proposes an adversarial robustness verification method to quantify the ability of ML-based DSA models against all kinds of adversarial examples. A model-free and attack-independent robust index is defined for both differentiable and nondifferentiable attack scenarios. Simulation results have verified the effectiveness of the proposed adversarial robustness verification method and the superiority of robust index compared with the upper bound of the adversarial perturbations computed by existing adversarial attack methods.},

This approach does not require detailed knowledge of the grid model and enables real-time tracking of the optimal generation configuration. Moreover, the communication burden is minimal: only a broadcast from a central entity, called the Network Supervisor (NS), to the agents in the network is needed. Agents do not have to share local information that can be sensitive, e.g., their power injections or the value of the local costs. Our approach is used to solve a particular OPF problem targeting DNs with high penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs) in which the energy cost is given by the remuneration that the DERs’ owners receive for the service they provide.},

The proposed method combines the conventional DRL framework with quantum machine learning, and can adaptively obtain the optimal cooperative control strategy. The microgrid secondary frequency control is organized in a distributed manner in which each agent performs the control action only based on the local and neighboring information. To solve the DRL problem, the deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm is derived to tune the agents’ parameters. Simulation tests are performed on an islanded microgrid with four distributed generators and a 13-bus microgrid. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively regulate the frequency with better time-delay tolerance, and displays the quantum advantage in parameter reduction.},

We compare five such information provision strategies—optimal routing, no information available, all information available, public signaling, and personal itinerary recommendation—using a competitive ratio reminiscent of the celebrated price of an anarchy metric, but adapted to stochastic networks. We also define a partial order between information provision policies by saying that a policy is maximally more efficient than another if it is more efficient on all networks and if there are instances for which the inefficiency ratio approaches the deterministic price of anarchy. With these tools, we show that a strict hierarchy exists between all policies, excluding the case of uninformed drivers. The latter is on some networks maximally better than having drivers completely informed, yet arbitrarily inefficient in other instances.},

The inputs to this model, besides the network topology, are the origin–destination (OD) demand matrix and travel latency cost functions. It has been observed that small perturbations to these inputs have a large impact on the solution. However, most efforts on estimating these using data do so separately and are typically based on parametric models or surveys. In this article, we present a kernel-based framework that jointly estimates the OD demand matrix and the travel latency function in single- and multiclass vehicle networks. To that end, we formulate a bilevel optimization problem, and then, we transform it to a quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP). To solve this QCQP, we propose a trust-region feasible direction algorithm that sequentially solves a quadratic program. In addition, we also provide an alternating optimization method. Our results show that the QCQP method achieves better estimates when compared with disjoint and sequential methods. We show the applicability of the method by performing case studies using data for the transportation networks of Eastern Massachusetts Area and New York City.},

The intermittent nature of renewable sources affects the pricing of energy sold or purchased.

These economic and technical constraints, coupled with intermittent renewable injection, may pose a threat to system stability and performance. In this article, we propose a novel holistic approach to energy trading composed of a distributed predictive control framework to handle physical interactions, i.e., voltage constraints and power dispatch, together with a negotiation framework to determine pricing policies for energy transactions. We study the effect of forecasting generation and consumption on the overall network’s performance and market behaviors.

  abstract     = {Phasor measurement units (PMUs) have become instrumental in modern power systems for enabling real time, wide-area monitoring and control. Accordingly, many studies have investigated efficient and robust dynamic state estimation (DSE) methods in order to accurately compute the dynamic states of generation units. Nonetheless, most of them forego the dynamic-algebraic nature of power networks and only consider their nonlinear dynamic representations. Motivated by the lack of DSE methods based on power network’s differential-algebraic equations (DAEs), this article develops a novel observer-based DSE framework in order to perform simultaneous estimation of the dynamic and algebraic states of multimachine power networks. Specifically, we leverage the DAE dynamics of a power network around an operating point and combine them with a PMU-based measurement model capable of capturing bus voltages and line currents. The proposed &lt;inline-formula&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\mathcal {H}_{\infty }$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; observer, which only requires detectability and impulse observability conditions that are satisfied for various power networks, is designed to handle various noise, unknown inputs, and input sensor failures. The results obtained from performing extensive numerical simulations on IEEE 9-bus and 39-bus systems showcase the effectiveness of the proposed approach for DSE purposes.},

  abstract     = {We consider the problem where a robot navigates from a start position to a destination and needs to sense some sites along the way. The robot collects data when sensing each site and needs to transmit all collected data to a remote station by the end of its trip, as it moves along its path, under time/energy constraints, and while operating in real wireless fading environments. Our goal is to minimize the robot&#39;s total motion and communication energy costs by co-optimizing its path, data transmission along the path, and sensing decisions, under given constraints and while considering the stochastic wireless channel. In this paper, we show how to solve this co-optimization problem efficiently and with performance guarantees. More specifically, we formulate a specially-designed Markov Decision Process (MDP) and utilize Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to efficiently and optimally solve it. While the co-dependence of communication, sensing, and motion decisions makes this joint optimization challenging, we show that by considering the transmission optimization in the terminal reward and motion actions in the state transitions, we can iteratively optimize the sensing/motion and the communication parts in different stages of MCTS, in a way that allows us to equivalently solve the original co-optimization problem efficiently. We mathematically prove the convergence of our approach, characterize its convergence speed, and derive key properties of the optimum solution. We extensively evaluate our approach in realistic wireless environments where the channel experiences path loss, shadowing, and multi-path fading and is unknown to the robot.},

  abstract     = {Average consensus is a major operation in distributed Kalman filtering. It requires neighboring nodes to exchange state information with each other, which may result in undesirable private data leakage. Since distributed Kalman filtering requires that the estimate at each time instant is accurate, it brings more challenges to design privacy-preserving scheme for operation. In this article, we design a privacy-preserving scheme for distributed Kalman filtering without the loss of estimation performance, which is also suitable for average consensus or dynamic average consensus of multiagent systems. We first build a secure multihop communication based on an encryption scheme. We then calculate the sum of the states of neighboring nodes with secure summation, which ensures that the state update will not reveal the state of the node to its neighboring nodes. We employ different methods to calculate the sum of the states of neighboring nodes against noncollusive and collusive adversaries. For the noncollusive case, the privacy of the honest nodes is preserved. For the collusive case, if there are too many adversaries, the privacy of the honest nodes could be exposed when accurate distributed Kalman filtering is accomplished. Therefore, we measure the risk of the global system suffering privacy leakage as the privacy index and improve the ability of the system to defend the collusive adversaries by using a group-based method. Some numerical examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.},

We leverage the expectation–maximization framework and develop an algorithm that optimizes the measurement likelihood and has favorable complexity for large models. In contrast to prior work, we directly consider GMDPs with significantly large discrete state spaces, arbitrary coupling structure, and long measurement sequences. We also consider a special structural property called Anonymous Influence, which we use to test hypotheses and gain insights into the data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our learning algorithm by considering two real-world data sets on the 2020 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in California and on user interactions on Twitter.

This strategic multilevel price offering of each generator is modeled as a standard stochastic bilevel program which is then reformulated as its equivalent MCP. The merger concept is employed and formulated to model multilevel price-offer functions. We then propose the BNE-MCP model which solves the stochastic MCP models of all generators together. A scenario reduction technique is also developed to accurately model the wind and demand uncertainty in the proposed BNE-MCP model. The proposed BNE-MCP model is carefully studied on two illustrative examples. The modified IEEE 14-, 30-, and 57-node systems are also examined in our article.},

Each robot is required to perform an independent sequence of tasks, subject to a chance of failing and getting stuck in a fault state at every task. If and when required, a human operator can assist or teleoperate a robot. Conventional dynamic programming-based techniques used to solve such problems face scalability issues due to an exponential growth of state and action spaces with the number of robots and operators. In this article, we derive conditions under which the operator allocation problem satisfies a technical condition called indexability, thereby enabling the use of the Whittle index heuristic. The conditions are easy to check, and we show that they hold for a wide range of problems of interest. Our key insight is to leverage the structure of the value function of individual robots, resulting in conditions that can be verified separately for each state of each robot. We apply these conditions to two types of transitions commonly seen in remote robot supervision systems. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate the efficacy of Whittle index policy as a near-optimal and scalable approach that outperforms existing scalable methods.},

To achieve the desired angle rigid formation, a stabilization control law is proposed using only local velocity and direction measurements. We show that the closed-loop dynamics of the formation, when each agent is modeled by a double-integrator, are closely related to the corresponding one in single-integrator agent dynamics. Sufficient conditions are constructed to guarantee the closed-loop stability for identical and distinct velocity damping gains, respectively. To guide an angle rigid formation to move with the desired translational velocity, orientation, and scale, formation maneuvering laws are then proposed.

In this article, we first introduce a newfangled event-triggered control with a linear diffusive term and discontinuous sign term. Then, a class of event-triggered conditions, whose threshold contains a constant term and a sampled state term, is provided for guaranteeing the stability of a disturbed linear system. The event could be directly triggered to change the control information by violating the event-triggered condition when packet losses during control information transmission are defaulting. This means that event-triggered control can markedly economize on resource waste and communication cost. In addition, the interexecution time, which is determined by the event-triggered condition, is proved to have a uniform positive lower bound to guarantee that Zeno behavior does not occur. In the presence of packet losses, we estimate the maximum allowable number of successive packet losses to maintain the desired performance of the system. Finally, the validity of the theoretical results is substantiated by an example.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we study the problem of minimizing the resource capacity of autonomous agents that cooperate to achieve a shared task. More specifically, we consider high-level planning for a team of homogeneous agents that operate under resource constraints in stochastic environments and share a common goal: given a set of target locations, ensure that each location is visited infinitely often by some agents almost surely. We formalize the dynamics of agents by the so-called consumption Markov decision processes. In a consumption Markov decision process, the agent has a resource of limited capacity. Each action of the agent may consume some amount of the resource. To avoid exhaustion, the agent can replenish its resource to full capacity in designated reload states. The resource capacity restricts the capabilities of the agent. The objective is to assign target locations to agents, and each agent is only responsible for visiting the assigned subset of target locations repeatedly. Moreover, the assignment must ensure that the agents can carry out their tasks with minimal resource capacity. We reduce the problem to an equivalent graph-theoretical problem. We develop an algorithm that solves this graph problem in time that is polynomial in the number of agents, target locations, and size of the consumption Markov decision process. We demonstrate the applicability and scalability of the algorithm in a scenario where hundreds of unmanned underwater vehicles monitor hundreds of locations in environments with stochastic ocean currents.},

However, such data are not always available and may be time-variant. To address this challenge, we consider a class of model data-independent (MDI) control policies that only rely on traffic state observation and network topology. In this article, we focus on the MDI control policies that can stabilize multiclass Markovian queuing networks under centralized and decentralized policies. Control actions include routing, sequencing, and holding. By expanding the routes and constructing piecewise-linear test functions, we derive an easy-to-use criterion to check the stability of a multiclass network under a given MDI policy. For stabilizable multiclass networks, we show that a centralized, stabilizing MDI policy exists. For stabilizable single-class networks, we further show that a decentralized, stabilizing MDI policy exists. In addition, for both settings, we construct explicit policies that attain maximal throughput and present numerical examples to illustrate the results.},

The straightforward approach for optimal guidance laws synthesis for the scenario participants is to adopt objectives from the single agent target–missile–defender engagement analysis. This leads to a multiobjective optimization problem in which the cost function consists out of the squared miss distance and the control effort. In this article, we suggest to alter the aforementioned cost function in order to address the need to control the proximity level between the agents, a concept that is usually not accounted for in guidance law development. This approach utilizes the same quadratic framework, making it easy to add/include into traditional systems. Defensive (defenders collision avoidance) and offensive (missiles collision encouragement) cooperative distance control laws are developed for the end game phase using the same information used to implement the guidance law. Simulation results show that the desired distance control behavior can be achieved via the proposed method.},

In view of this, we focus on the linear plants without unknown parameters and investigate the stabilization problem of networked control systems with noisy sampling intervals and stochastic time-varying delays. First, a closed-loop discrete-time stochastic system, whose system matrices are characterized by high nonlinearity and randomness, is obtained by considering the noisy sampling intervals and stochastic time-varying delays in a unified framework. Second, an equivalent yet tractable stochastic-augmented model is established with the aid of matrix exponential computation. With a confluent Vandermonde matrix associated with the minimal polynomial and Kronecker product operation, the mathematical expectation of a product of three matrices, including the system matrix of the stochastic-augmented model and its transpose, is calculated. Based on this, a stabilization controller is designed such that the stochastic stability of the original discrete-time stochastic system is guaranteed. Finally, an illustrative example with four different cases is provided to verify the effectiveness of the designed method.},

It is shown that if there is a mode-dependent pinning control that can asymptotically stabilize the PBN, then there must exist an MIPC that can do the same with fewer pinned nodes and control inputs. A necessary and sufficient condition is given to verify the feasibility of a set of pinned nodes based on an auxiliary digraph. Three algorithms are proposed to find a feasible set of pinned nodes with the minimum cardinality. The main results are extended to the case where the target is a limit cycle. Compared with the existing results, the total computational complexity of these algorithms is strongly reduced. The obtained results are applied to a numerical example and a cell apoptosis network.},

However, these methods often have defects, especially in a very complex networked system with noises. By investigating the tolerance to the uncertainty in the residual detection method and properties of noises, the attack magnitude planning has been presented to hide the attack behind noises, which can bypass the residual detection method. As to the Kalman-filter-based detector, this article designs a specific attack strategy that can successfully deceive the Kalman-filter-based detector.

We suppose that one strategic agent must identify &lt;inline-formula&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$k_+$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; target agents in the network to maximally spread his/her own opinion and alter the average opinion that eventually emerges.

Our main contribution is to exploit the underlying graph structure to build more refined heuristics. First, we provide the analytical solution for the optimal targeting problem over complete graphs. This result provides a rule to understand whether it is convenient or not to block the opponent.s influence by targeting the same nodes. The argument is then extended to generic graphs, leading to more effective solutions compared to the greedy approach. Second, we derive some useful properties of the objective function for trees by an electrical analogy. Inspired by these findings, we define a new algorithm, which selects the optimal solution on trees in a much faster way with respect to a brute-force approach and works well also over tree-like/sparse graphs. The proposed heuristics are then compared to zero-cost heuristics on randomly generated graphs and real social networks.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we study a social learning model in which agents iteratively update their beliefs about the true state of the world using private signals and the beliefs of other agents in a non-Bayesian manner. Some agents are stubborn, meaning they attempt to convince others of an erroneous true state (modeling fake news). We show that while agents learn the true state on short timescales, they “forget” it and believe the erroneous state to be true on longer timescales. Using these results, we devise strategies for seeding stubborn agents so as to disrupt learning, which outperforms intuitive heuristics and gives novel insights regarding vulnerabilities in social learning.},

For controllability metrics, we employ the minimum eigenvalue and the determinant of the controllability Gramian. Unlike the previous problem setting based on the trace of the Gramian, these metrics are not the linear functions of decision variables and are difficult to deal with. To circumvent this issue, we adopt a parallelepiped approximation of the metrics based on their geometric properties. Since these modified optimization problems are highly nonconvex, we introduce a convex relaxation problem for its computational tractability. After a reformulation of the problem into an optimal control problem to which Pontryagin’s maximum principle is applicable, we give a sufficient condition under which the relaxed problem gives a solution of the main problem.},

We propose an opinion-dependent reproduction number to characterize the mutual influence between epidemic spreading and opinion dissemination over the networks. Through stability analysis of the equilibria, we explore the impact of opinions on both epidemic outbreak and eradication, characterized by bounds on the opinion-dependent reproduction number.

  abstract     = {In this article, we consider a population composed of a continuum of agents that seek to maximize a payoff function by moving on a network. The nodes in the network may represent physical locations or abstract choices. The population is stratified, i.e., agents opting for the same choice may not get the same payoff. In particular, we assume payoff functions with diminishing returns, i.e., agents in “newer” strata of a node receive a smaller payoff compared to “older” strata. In this first part of this two-part work, we model the population dynamics under three choice revision policies, having varying levels of coordination: 1) no coordination and the agents are selfish; 2) coordination among agents in each node; and 3) coordination across the entire population. For the case with selfish agents, we generalize the Smith dynamics to our setting, where we have a stratified population and network constraints. To model nodal coordination, we allow the fraction of population in a node, as a whole, to take the “best response” to the state of the population in the node’s neighborhood. For the case of population-wide coordination, we explore a dynamics where the population evolves according to centralized gradient ascent of the social utility, though constrained by the network. In each case, we show that the dynamics has existence and uniqueness of solutions and also show that the solutions from any initial condition asymptotically converge to the set of Nash equilibria.},

  abstract     = {In online platforms, recommender systems are responsible for directing users to relevant content. In order to enhance the users’ engagement, recommender systems adapt their output to the reactions of the users, who are, in turn, affected by the recommended content. In this article, we study a tractable analytical model of a user that interacts with an online news aggregator, with the purpose of making explicit the feedback loop between the evolution of the user’s opinion and the personalized recommendation of content. More specifically, we assume that the user is endowed with a scalar opinion about a certain issue and receives news about it from a news aggregator: her opinion is influenced by all received pieces of news, which are characterized by a binary position on the issue at hand. The user is affected by a confirmation bias, that is, a preference for news that confirms her current opinion. The news aggregator recommends items with the goal of maximizing the number of user’s clicks (as a measure of her engagement): in order to fulfill its goal, the recommender has to compromise between exploring the user’s preferences and exploiting what it has learned so far. After defining suitable metrics for the effectiveness of the recommender systems (such as the click-through rate) and for its impact on the opinion, we perform both extensive numerical simulations and a mathematical analysis of the model. We find that personalized recommendations markedly affect the evolution of opinions and favor the emergence of more extreme ones: the intensity of these effects is inherently related to the effectiveness of the recommender. We also show that by tuning the amount of randomness in the recommendation algorithm, one can seek a balance between the effectiveness of the recommendation system and its impact on the opinions.},

Moreover, his or her adaptation algorithm is stopped if there is a minimal number of agents within his or her similarity interval. The heterogeneity of the model could lead to an interesting scenarios, e.g., steady-state oscillatory behaviors and practical clustering. Sufficient conditions for reaching in finite time a practical consensus are proposed.

We consider a two-party election, whose voters, modeled as heterogeneous agents, are connected in a social network with an arbitrary topology. The equations describing the variance of the vote share, both in transient and steady state, are derived. The key is the solution of the second-order marginalization problem under the form of a numerically tractable characterization of pairwise joint probabilities of the voters’ opinions. In particular, these probabilities are computed by means of a Lyapunov-like matrix differential equation driven by first-order moments. This result is used to answer some important questions, like the possible nonmonotonic effect of the influence intensity on the vote volatility and the interplay of topology and individuals’ stubbornness to determine the electoral balance between two parties.},

Of particular interest are the classes of network attacks capable of affecting the control systems’ performance while remaining undetectable. In this article, under some conditions, we show the existence of a novel class of finite-time undetectable attacks against constrained CPSs. The proposed finite-time attack has the peculiar capability of not producing anomalies after its termination. This is particularly dangerous because it enables a malicious entity to repeatedly or intermittently affect the CPS without raising alarms. Such an attack is here designed by resorting to a set-theoretic approach that leverages robust reachability arguments. Moreover, given the desired attack duration, the set of initial states from which the attack is feasible is characterized. A numerical simulation example involving an industrial continuous-stirred tank reactor system is presented to support the theoretical results.},

For a system with packet losses, according to whether the packet losses can be observed by the filter, the system is divided into two types: 1) a system with observable packet losses (an OPL system) and 2) a system with unobservable packet losses (a UPL system). We first obtain the OLF for UPL systems over Gilbert–Elliott channels, and then analyze how the loss of packet-loss-status observability affects the estimation stability and performance. Unlike the OLF for OPL systems, which may remain stable for an unstable OPL system when the packet loss rate is less than a threshold value, we show that the OLF for UPL systems is stable if and only if the system is stable. We prove that from a mean sense perspective, the unobservability of packet losses will degrade the estimation performance, and an upper bound of the performance degradation is obtained. Furthermore, we analytically characterize how the packet recovery/failure rate affects the estimation performance for the two special cases. Finally, numerical examples are provided to illustrate the obtained results.},

With a novel scaling function strategy, a distributed protocol based on the sampled and quantized data is designed to solve this problem. Compared with the existing works on quantized control of MASs, not only the boundedness assumption on initial conditions is removed, but also the communication graph is not restricted to be balanced or strongly connected. Moreover, the proposed quantized cooperative output regulation protocol does not rely on any global information of the communication graph.

Depending on whether the bound of disturbances is known or not, two impulsive controllers that ensure ISS are designed. Leveraging the disturbance bound, the first controller can counteract the disturbances and guarantee that the quantizer never saturates at successful transmission instants. The second controller, which though cannot prevent the quantizer from saturation, is able to stabilize the system under disturbances whose bound is unknown, if the quantizer’s saturation duration is small enough. Moreover, analysis shows that with appropriate control parameter design, the resultant saturation duration always remains small.

We identify a suitable time-scale decomposition for the inverter dynamics, and using singular perturbation theory, obtain an analytic sufficient condition to verify small-signal stability. Compared to the alternative of performing an eigenvalue analysis of the full-order network dynamics, our analytic sufficient condition reduces computational complexity and yields insights on the role of network topology and constitution as well as inverter-filter and control parameters in small-signal stability. Numerical simulations for a radial network validate the approach and illustrate the efficiency of our analytic conditions for designing and monitoring grid-tied inverter networks.},

The stochasticity in the system is introduced by randomness of network uncertainties, i.e., losses and delays of data packets. The proposed design has three parts. The first part derives an event-triggering condition for control input updates of each agent in the system. The second part guarantees desired formation in finite time by deriving an upper bound on reaching time to the designed sliding surface of each agent. The third part ensures admissibility of event-based control updates of the agents such that they achieve stable desired formation. The proposed stochastic design has been validated on Pioneer P3-DX mobile robots. The results show the three-fold effectiveness of stochastic design.

To this end, a centralized coverage control method is developed to switch agents between an optimal coverage formation and an optimal charging formation. We design a controller for agent trajectories that include dwell times at the optimal coverage locations, and charging times at the charging station to maximize a coverage metric over a finite time interval. Our controller guarantees that at any time there is at most one agent leaving the team for energy repletion.

The communication network is strongly connected but not required to be weight balanced. A framework of distributed estimator-based algorithm design without any initialization requirement is presented. For agents with nominal first-order (FO) dynamics, a class of distributed estimators is proposed to estimate the average of local reference signals within fixed time, with which each agent finally achieves the DAT within fixed time. For agents with second-order dynamics subject to modeling uncertainty, unmodeled dynamics, as well as external disturbances, a class of distributed estimator is proposed to estimate the average of local reference signals within fixed time, and then a local disturbance-observer-based control protocol is proposed for each agent to achieve DAT asymptotically. Different from most of the existing DAT results under general directed networks that DAT error can only be made globally ultimately bounded, the exact DAT can be achieved within fixed time or asymptotically here. Further, the idea of distributed estimator is applied to solve a class of distributed optimization problems within finite time.

In particular, two typical settings encountered in several applications are considered: multiagent reinforcement learning (RL) and parallel RL , where frequent information exchanges between the learners and the controller are required. For many practical distributed systems, however, the overhead caused by these frequent communication exchanges is considerable, and becomes the bottleneck of the overall performance. To address this challenge, a novel policy gradient approach is developed for solving distributed RL. The novel approach adaptively skips the policy gradient communication during iterations, and can reduce the communication overhead without degrading learning performance. It is established analytically that: i) the novel algorithm has a convergence rate identical to that of the plain-vanilla policy gradient; while ii) if the distributed learners are heterogeneous in terms of their reward functions, the number of communication rounds needed to achieve a desirable learning accuracy is markedly reduced. Numerical experiments corroborate the communication reduction attained by the novel algorithm compared to alternatives.},

In contrast, this article studies a DN-OPF formulation, which considers both stability and operational constraint satisfaction under uncertainty. The need to account for a range of uncertainty realizations in this article’s robust optimization formulation results in a challenging semi-infinite program (SIP). The proposed solution algorithm reformulates this SIP into a computationally tractable problem by constructing a tight convex inner approximation of the feasible region using sufficient conditions for the existence of a feasible and stable power flow solution. Optimal generator setpoints are obtained by optimizing over the proposed convex stability set. The validity and value of the proposed algorithm are demonstrated through various dc networks adapted from IEEE test cases.},

A structured network is a family of heterogeneous structured systems (called node systems) that are interconnected by means of a structured interconnection law, all given by pattern matrices. Here, we consider structured networks with single-input–single-output node systems. It is shown that such a structured network is strongly structurally controllable if and only if an associated structured system is. This structured system will, in general, have a very large state space dimension and, therefore, existing tests for verifying strong structural controllability are not tractable. The main result of this article circumvents this problem. We show that controllability can be tested by replacing the original network by a new network in which all original node systems have been replaced by (auxiliary) node systems with state space dimensions either 1 or 2. Hence, controllability of the original network can be verified by testing controllability of a structured system with state space dimension at most twice the number of node systems, regardless of the state space dimensions of the original node systems.},

  abstract     = {Accurate parameter values are essential for the secure and stable operation of power systems. Parameters may be erroneous in real power systems, while existing methods may provide false results in the case of multiple interacting parameter errors. This article proposes an LME-HTI method for the simultaneous identification of multiple parameter errors based on a linear mixed-effects (LME) model and hypothesis testing identification (HTI). The residual equations from multiple-snapshot state estimation are used to formulate the LME model in which the parameter errors are considered as the fixed effects and the measurement errors are considered as the random effects. By solving the LME model, all the parameter errors and the variances of the measurement errors can be simultaneously estimated. Then, hypothesis testing is performed to infer whether each parameter error is zero. An extended state augmentation (ESA) method is proposed to further remove the misidentified but correct parameters from the suspicious parameter set while correcting the left erroneous parameters by constrained nonlinear optimization. In this way, only a limited number of parameters with strong evidence from the data that they are undoubtedly erroneous are selected for estimation, which avoids modifying the existing correct parameters to false values as much as possible. In addition, an analytical result is developed to provide justification for the ESA method. The proposed method is evaluated on IEEE benchmark systems with promising results.},

It is found that the heterogeneous networked systems with nonidentical inner-coupling are controllable, even if the identically inner-coupled counterparts are uncontrollable, and vice versa. The finding also reveals the influence of the heterogeneity of the inner-coupling matrix on the network controllability. Some necessary and sufficient conditions for general linear systems with nonidentical inner-coupling, including some special cases to retain controllability, are derived. For typical structure networks, the controllability conditions depend solely on the specific form of the coupling matrix between a small number of nodes, but are independent of the coupling relationship between the remaining nodes.

  abstract     = {This article addresses the problem of fault-tolerant cooperative output regulation for multiagent networks via observer and adaptive control approach. Three types of actuator failures, consisting of partial loss of effectiveness fault, outage fault, and bias fault, are considered. First, two distributed fixed-time observers are proposed to estimate the information of an exosystem such that observer errors can converge to zero within a desired time independent of the initial conditions. Then, a novel distributed adaptive fault-tolerant control algorithm on the basis of the observer states and relative information of neighbors is presented to ensure that the output regulation problem of multiagent networks is solvable despite the impact of faults. Different from the existing output regulation control protocols, the assumption of which the information of exosystem must be accessible to all agents is removed in this article. Moreover, the presented control scheme can compensate for the influence of three actuator faults effectively. Finally, two examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the developed controller.},

Each agent has a set of local data points, and their goal is to compute a linear model that fits the collective data points. In principle, the agents can apply the decentralized gradient-descent method (DGD). However, when the data matrix is ill-conditioned , DGD requires many iterations to converge and is unstable against system noise. We propose a decentralized preconditioning technique to mitigate the deleterious effects of the data points’ conditioning on the convergence rate of DGD. The proposed algorithm converges linearly , with an improved convergence rate than DGD. Considering the practical scenario where the computations performed by the agents are corrupted, we study the robustness guarantee of the proposed algorithm. In addition, we apply the proposed algorithm for solving decentralized state estimation problems. The empirical results show our proposed state predictor’s favorable convergence rate and robustness against system noise compared to prominent decentralized algorithms.},

For collectively detectable sensor networks under a consensus Kalman filter, a sufficient distributed detectability condition on the transmission probabilities is identified to guarantee that the estimation errors of the sensors are statistically bounded. Furthermore, a necessary and sufficient security condition is obtained to guarantee unboundedness of the eavesdropper’s estimation error.

This article discusses statistical structure estimation in power grids in the “underexcited” regime, where a subset of internal nodes has zero injection fluctuations. Prior estimation algorithms based on nodal voltages fail for such grids as the voltage covariance matrix is not invertible. We propose a novel topology learning algorithm for learning underexcited general networks. Our algorithm uses physics-informed conservation laws to first identify the zero-injection buses and their neighbors, and then estimates the remaining edges in the grid. We prove the asymptotic correctness of our algorithm for grids with nonadjacent internal zero-injection nodes. More important, we theoretically analyze our algorithm’s efficacy under noisy measurements, and determine bounds on maximum noise under which asymptotically correct recovery is guaranteed. Our approach is validated through simulations with voltage samples generated on test distribution grids with real injection data and nonlinear power flow models.},

To achieve this goal, a novel distributed information fusion algorithm is designed by embedding a stochastic event-triggered communication mechanism. Based on a new developed mathematics technique, the consistency and stability of the proposed distributed state estimation algorithms are both ensured. Furthermore, compared with the literature, the stability can be guaranteed with a milder collectively uniformly observable condition.

By contrast, the present approach establishes a robust distributed model-predictive control scheme, in which the local subsystem controllers operate under the assumption of a variable communication schedule that is predicted by a network controller. Using appropriate models for the communication network, the network controller applies a predictive network policy for scheduling the communication among the subsystem controllers across the network.

As for the quasiperiodicity condition, which has been widely used in previous works, we obtain that if the decay rate during control activation interval can suppress the increasing rate during the control rest interval in each period, then the input-to-state stability can be guaranteed. As for the average activation time ratio condition, by designing an auxiliary timer to make a compromise between control activation intervals and control rest intervals, we obtain that a larger value of the average activation time length over each unit time interval makes it easier to achieve the input-to-state stability. Moreover, the control gain and event-triggered parameters are jointly designed according to the feasibility of some matrix inequalities.

With high penetration of uncertain renewable resources in power systems, DCOPF needs to be solved repeatedly for a large amount of scenarios, which can be computationally challenging. As an alternative to iterative solvers, neural networks are often trained and used to solve DCOPF. These approaches can offer orders of magnitude reduction in computational time, but they cannot guarantee generalization, and small training error does not imply small testing errors. In this work, we propose a novel algorithm for solving DCOPF that guarantees the generalization performance. First, by utilizing the convexity of the DCOPF problem, we train an input convex neural network. Second, we construct the training loss based on Karush–Kuhn–Tucker optimality conditions. By combining these two techniques, the trained model has provable generalization properties, where small training error implies small testing errors. In experiments, our algorithm significantly outperforms other machine learning methods.},

The proposed attack utilizes the measurements corresponding to a set of boundary buses in each neighboring areas to inject arbitrary errors to the estimated states of those buses. It is demonstrated that the attack not only gets through the robust distributed estimators but also bypasses the convergence-based detection methods. Furthermore, in an illustrative example, the differences in the attack with the conventional FDIA are briefly explained. Then, finding the optimal attack vector to minimize the maximum difference between the per area errors by considering the attacker’s limitations is formulated as a mixed-integer second-order cone programming problem.

  abstract     = {This article analyzes a susceptible–infected–susceptible (SIS) model of epidemic propagation over hypergraphs, and motivated by an important special case, we refer to the model as the simplicial SIS model . Classically, the multigroup SIS model has assumed pairwise interactions of contagion across groups and, thus, has been vastly studied in the literature. It is only recently that renewed special attention has been drawn to the study of contagion dynamics over higher order interactions and over more general graph structures, such as simplexes. Previous work on mean-field approximation scalar models of the simplicial SIS model has indicated that a new dynamical behavior domain, compared to the classical SIS model, appears due to the newly introduced higher order interaction terms: both a disease-free equilibrium and an endemic equilibrium coexist and are both locally asymptotically stable. This article formally establishes that bistability (as a new epidemiological behavior) also appears in the multigroup simplicial SIS model. We give sufficient conditions over the model’s parameters for the appearance of this and the other behavioral domains present in the classical multigroup SIS model. We additionally provide an algorithm to compute the value of the endemic equilibrium and report numerical analysis of the transition from the disease-free domain to the bistable domain.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we consider the dynamical modeling of a class of quantum network systems consisting of qubits, where information extraction is allowed by performing measurement on several selected qubits of the system. For a variety of applications, a state space model is a useful approach to modeling the system dynamics. To construct a state space model for a quantum network system, the major task is to find an accessible set containing all of the operators coupled to the measurement operators. This article focuses on the generation of a proper accessible set for a given system and measurement scheme. We provide analytic results on simplifying the process of generating accessible sets for systems with a time-independent Hamiltonian. Since the order of elements in the accessible set determines the form of state space matrices, guidance is provided to effectively arrange the ordering of elements in the state vector. Defining a system state according to the accessible set, one can develop a state space model with a special pattern inherited from the system structure. As a demonstration, we specifically consider a typical 1-D-chain system with several common measurements and employ the proposed method to determine its accessible set.},

We assume that the city comprises multiple nodes with directed edges connecting the nodes. At each node, passengers arrive according to a Poisson distribution. Based on the arrival processes of the passengers and the operational cost of moving a vehicle from one node to another, we devise a fair pricing scheme for the passengers using the Shapley value. We show that at certain nodes, as the arrival rate or the valuation distribution of the passengers increases, the fair pricing policy increases up to a threshold, and then decreases after a different threshold.

  abstract     = {In this article, we investigate the optimal control of network-coupled subsystems with coupled dynamics and costs. The dynamics coupling may be represented by the adjacency matrix, the Laplacian matrix, or any other symmetric matrix corresponding to an underlying weighted undirected graph. Cost couplings are represented by two coupling matrices which have the same eigenvectors as the coupling matrix in the dynamics. We use the spectral decomposition of these three coupling matrices to decompose the overall system into &lt;inline-formula&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$({L+1})$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; systems with decoupled dynamics and cost, where &lt;inline-formula&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$L$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; is the number of linearly independent eigendirections associated with nonzero eigenvalue triples of the three coupling matrices.

A salient feature of the result is that, given the spectral decompositions of the couplings, the solution complexity does not directly depend on the number of subsystems. Therefore, the proposed solution framework provides a scalable method for synthesizing and implementing optimal control laws for large-scale network-coupled subsystems.},

To address this problem, an event-triggered mechanism is adopted in the existing works. However, it is pointed out in this article that this mechanism is not so effective for this problem. The reason is that the discontinuity of event-triggered controller can cause the algebraic subsystem to malfunction at the triggering instants. To avoid this phenomenon, a hybrid control strategy is adopted. The main characteristic of this strategy is that it is organized by an event-triggered controller and an impulsive controller.

Linear state-feedback control laws are obtained via the introduction of a distributed differential game , namely, the combination of local non-cooperative differential games , which are solved in a decentralized fashion. Conditions for stability of the MAS are provided for the special cases of acyclic and strongly connected communication graph topologies. These results are then exploited to provide stability conditions for general graph topologies.

  abstract     = {We consider a routing game among nonatomic agents where link latency functions are conditional on an uncertain state of the network. The agents have the same prior belief about the state, but only a fixed fraction receive private route recommendations or a common message, which are generated by a known randomization, referred to as private or public signaling policy , respectively. The remaining agents choose route according to Bayes Nash flow with respect to the prior. In this article, we develop a computational approach to solve the optimal information design problem, i.e., to minimize expected social latency over all public or obedient private signaling policies. For a fixed flow induced by nonparticipating agents, the design of an optimal private signaling policy has been shown to be a generalized problem of moments for polynomial link latency functions, and to admit an atomic solution with a provable upper bound on the number of atoms. This implies that, for polynomial link latency functions, information design can be equivalently cast as a polynomial optimization problem. This, in turn, can be arbitrarily lower bounded by a known hierarchy of semidefinite relaxations. The first level of this hierarchy is shown to be exact for the basic two link case with affine latency functions. We also identify a class of private signaling policies over which the optimal social cost is nonincreasing with an increasing fraction of participating agents for parallel networks. This is in contrast to existing results where the cost of participating agents under a fixed signaling policy may increase with their increasing fraction.},

A key issue is that the TVD-PDSPJ-NCSs do not specify the jumping sequence of working processing modes. First, the TVD-PDSPJ-NCSs are modeled for the first time by considering the non-negative total amount of data, work processing modes jumping, and data transmission channel switching of the NCSs. Then, a proper finite-time state feedback controller is designed for the TVD-PDSPJ-NCSs so that the closed-loop dual-switching Poisson jump NCSs are positive, stochastically finite-time bounded, and fulfill the specified &lt;inline-formula&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$L_{2}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; disturbance attenuation performance simultaneously.

The main contribution of the article is the characterization of the tradeoff between the tolerable DoS attack levels for leaderless and leader–follower consensus and the required data rates for the quantizers during the communication attempts among the agents.

It provides fairness among file transmissions, taking into account their sizes and the congestion on the links they use. The proposed approach is based on network utility maximization (NUM), but with utility functions that vary in time depending on the remaining file size. A parameterized family of utility functions is proposed. For each value of the parameter, there is a threshold load such that an arbitrary network will be stable, provided that no link load exceeds that threshold. This is in contrast with SRPT, for which any nonzero load becomes unstable for topologies with sufficiently long paths. The method can be implemented by a distributed algorithm analogous to that of traditional NUM.},

  abstract     = {The optimal decentralized control (ODC) is an NP-hard problem with many applications in real-world systems. There is a recent trend of using local search algorithms for solving optimal control problems. However, the effectiveness of these methods depends on the connectivity property of the feasible region of the underlying optimization problem. In this article, for ODC problems with static controllers, we develop a novel criterion for certifying the connectivity of the feasible region in the case where the input and output matrices of the system dynamics are identity matrices. This criterion can be checked via an efficient algorithm, and it is used to prove that the number of communication networks leading to connected feasible regions is greater than a square root of the exponential number of possible communication networks (named patterns). For ODC problems with dynamic controllers, we prove that under certain mild conditions, the closure of the feasible region is always connected after some parameterization, for general communication networks and system dynamics.},

  abstract     = {The effective resistance (ER) between a pair of nodes in a weighted undirected graph is defined as the potential difference induced when a unit current is injected at one node and extracted from the other, treating edge weights as the conductance values of edges. The ER is a key quantity of interest in many applications, e.g., solving linear systems, Markov chains, and continuous-time averaging networks. In this article, we consider ERs in the context of designing randomized gossiping methods for the consensus problem, where the aim is to compute the average of node values in a distributed manner through iteratively computing weighted averages among randomly chosen neighbors. For barbell graphs, we prove that choosing wake-up and communication probabilities proportional to ER weights improves the averaging time corresponding to the traditional choice of uniform weights. For &lt;inline-formula&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$c$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -barbell graphs, we show that ER weights admit lower and upper bounds on the averaging time that improves upon the lower and upper bounds available for uniform weights. Furthermore, for graphs with a small diameter, we can show that ER weights can improve upon the existing bounds for Metropolis weights by a constant factor under some assumptions. We illustrate these results through numerical experiments, where we showcase the efficiency of our approach on several graph topologies, including barbell and small-world graphs. We also present an application of ER gossiping to distributed optimization: we numerically verify that using ER gossiping within EXTRA and DPGA-W methods improves their practical performance in terms of communication efficiency.},

Then, an asynchronous distributed event-triggered scheme is further developed. The sampled-based event-triggered communication scheme is exempt from Zeno behavior as the minimum interevent time is lower bounded by the sampling period.

The attack objective is to corrupt the least numbers of sensors so that the state estimate error approaches a target bias while avoiding being detected and high attacking is lost. First, with precise knowledge of the measurement model and applying a sparsity projection operation with average linear complexity rather than the popular brute force search and approximation techniques, a distributed optimization scheme is proposed which provides an exact and low-complexity algorithmic solution to finding the optimal attack strategy. Furthermore, by introducing “dead-zone” type projection and region projection operators, a distributed optimization algorithm for robust sparse undetectable attacks is proposed with imprecise model knowledge. A distinguishing point of the proposed algorithms is that a tradeoff between computational complexity and an attack’s impact can be achieved by properly designing a cost function. Simulation results on an unmanned ground vehicle are presented to substantiate the algorithm.},

This optimization ensures the real-time gas flow feasibility and a minimal variation in the network state up to specified feasibility and variance criteria. Furthermore, the chance-constrained optimization provides the foundation of a stochastic pricing scheme for natural gas networks, which improves on a deterministic market settlement by offering the compensations to network assets for their contribution to uncertainty and variance control.

In this problem, each individual agent is only able to access partial information of time-varying global loss functions, thus requiring local information exchanges between neighboring agents. Motivated by many applications in reality, the considered local loss functions depend not only on their own decision variables, but also on an aggregative variable, such as the average of all decision variables. To handle this problem, an online distributed gradient tracking algorithm (O-DGT) is proposed with exact gradient information and it is shown that the dynamic regret is upper bounded by three terms: 1) a sublinear term; 2) a path variation term; and 3) a gradient variation term. Meanwhile, the O-DGT algorithm is also analyzed with stochastic/noisy gradients, showing that the expected dynamic regret has the same upper bound as the exact gradient case. To our best knowledge, this article is the first to study online convex optimization in the presence of an aggregative variable, which enjoys new characteristics in comparison with the conventional scenario without the aggregative variable.

However, the influence of degenerate noise on synchronization has not been studied properly. Here, we tackle this challenging problem by introducing a network of nonlinear units with a deterministic communication digraph and a noisy communication digraph. The communication links in the noisy communication digraph are affected by degenerate noise in a relative-dependent manner. Two types of deterministic communication digraphs are considered: 1) the case of strongly connected graphs and 2) the case of graphs containing a spanning tree. By using the algebraic graph theory and the stability theory of stochastic differential equations, algebraic sufficient conditions for both cases are derived, which depend on node dynamics, network structure, and coupling strengths. These criteria demonstrate that strong deterministic communication can compensate for the detrimental effect of degenerate noise, thus ensuring the stochastic synchronization in the almost sure sense. Numerical simulations support and illustrate the proposed theoretical results.},

Compared with the existing literature, the design of pinning control is not based on the state transition matrix of BNs. Hence, the computational complexity in this article is reduced from &lt;inline-formula&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$O(2^{2n})$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; to &lt;inline-formula&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$O(n^2+n2^K)$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; , where &lt;inline-formula&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$n$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; is the number of nodes and &lt;inline-formula&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$K\leq n$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; is the largest number of in-neighbors of nodes. In addition, without using the state transition matrix, global state information is no longer needed; the design of pinning control is just based on neighbors’ local information, which is easier to implement. The proposed method is well demonstrated by several biological networks with different sizes. The results are shown to be simple and concise, while the traditional pinning control cannot be applied for BNs with such a large dimension.},

For stability analysis, a novel looped-functional is constructed by introducing additional integrals. An asymptotic stability criterion is further derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities. For direct comparison between different transmission schemes, we also demonstrate the criterion by applying it to systems under time-trigger, discrete SET, SET, discrete ET, and continuous ET. The looped-functional is then employed to the robust stabilization of the systems with transmission delays and external disturbance. Finally, numerical simulations corroborate that the proposed MSET leads to (often considerably) fewer transmissions than other schemes.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we derive conditions for structural controllability of temporal networks that change topology and edge weights with time. The existing results for structural controllability of directed networks assume that all edge weights are chosen independently of each other. The undirected case is challenging due to the constraints on the edge weights. We show that even with this additional restriction, the structural controllability results for the directed case are applicable to the undirected case. We further address two important issues. The first is optimizing the number of driver nodes to ensure the structural controllability of the temporal network. The second is to characterize the maximum reachable subspace when there are constraints on the number of driver nodes. Using the max-flow min-cut theorem, we show that the dimension of the reachable subspace is a submodular function of a set of driver nodes. Hence, we propose greedy algorithms with approximation guarantees to solve the above NP-hard problems. The results of the two case studies illustrate that the proposed greedy algorithm efficiently computes the optimum driver node set for both directed and undirected temporal networks.},

  abstract     = {This article addresses the problem of time-constrained leader-follower multiagent task scheduling and control synthesis. The leader-follower multiagent system is subject to a set of dynamically activated tasks, each of which is associated with a relative deadline and can be completed at different quality-of-satisfaction (QoSa) levels. By taking into account the reward and cost of satisfying these tasks, a novel scheduling problem is formulated and a dynamic scheduling strategy is proposed. Based on the dynamic plan, distributed control laws are designed accordingly for the leader and follower agents. Under the condition that the information of the target regions is available only to the leader agents, it is shown that the proposed control laws guarantee the satisfaction of each task at its desired QoSa level. A simulation example is given to verify the theoretical results.},

Heterogeneous plants generally have different costs when they produce water and power; thus, an optimization method should be employed to allocate the production tasks of the plants to reduce the total cost of the power–water network. This study investigates a continuous-time distributed algorithm for the economic dispatch problem of the power–water network. A conceptual model is first presented to illustrate the logical relationships within the power–water network, and then, a constrained nonlinear programming model is developed to describe the economic dispatch problem of the power–water network. The model not only includes the generation capacity constraints and supply–demand constraints but also considers the constraints on the power–water production ratios of the coproduction plants. A novel distributed algorithm is developed for the economic dispatch problem, which can guarantee a plug-and-play operation and preserve the privacy information of the plants in the power–water network.

  abstract     = {We study a homotopy continuation method for the design of an optimal static or dynamic decentralized controller to minimize a quadratic cost functional. The proposed method involves a combination of the classical local search technique in the space of control policies, a gradual damping of the system dynamics, and a gradual variation of a parameterized cost functional. A series of optimal decentralized control (ODC) problems is generated via a continuous variation of parameters. Unlike the classical homotopy literature, which focuses on tracking a specific trajectory, we study the ensemble of critical controller trajectories and show how the properties of the ensemble can be leveraged to find a globally optimal solution of the ODC problem. After guaranteeing the continuity and asymptotic properties of the proposed method, we prove that with enough damping, there is no spurious locally optimal controller for a block-diagonal control structure. This leads to a sufficient condition under which an iterative algorithm can find a global solution to a class of optimal decentralized control problems. The “damping property” introduced in this analysis is shown to be unique for general system matrices. Empirical observations are presented for instances with an exponential number of locally optimal decentralized controllers, where the developed method could find the global solution even when initialized at a poor local solution.},

First, an adaptive strategy is designed to update coupling weights and gains for ensuring cluster synchronization, even if the control channels of complex networks suffer from DoS attacks. This security strategy is developed in a distributed framework, in which only local information is utilized instead of any global information, such as the network topology and the number of nodes. Then, the security cluster synchronization analysis against DoS attacks is extended to the case where only partial coupling weights on edges are updated. By constructing suitable Lyapunov functions with exponential terms, the corresponding security cluster synchronization conditions are presented, and the DoS attack duration ratio that the system can tolerate is also obtained. Finally, a network composed of Chua’s circuits is employed to validate the efficiency of the derived methods.},

  abstract     = {Several specific low-bitrate coding strategies are examined through their effect on linear–quadratic (LQ) control performance. By limiting the subject to these methods, we are able to identify principles underlying coding for control, a subject of significant recent interest but few tangible, i.e., implementable, results. In particular, we consider coding the quantized output signal deploying period-two codes of differing delay-versus-accuracy tradeoff. The quantification of coding performance is via the LQ control cost over a long but finite horizon up to a specified average escape time . Infinite-horizon stabilization is replaced by a mean-time-before-failure property, which is a new viewpoint but allows contact with uncoded controllers. The feedback control system comprises the coder–decoder in the path between the output and the state estimator, which is followed by linear state-variable feedback, as is optimal in the memoryless case. The static quantizer is treated as the functional composition of an infinitely long linear staircase function and saturation. This permits the analysis to subdivide into estimator computations, seemingly independent of the control performance criterion, and an escape time evaluation, which ties the control back into the choice of quantizer saturation bound. An example is studied, which illustrates the role of the control objective in determining the efficacy of coding using these schemes. The results mesh well with those observed in signal coding. However, the introduction of a realization-based escape time is a novelty departing significantly from mean square computations and from adaptive techniques.},

Then, in order to study the benefits of introducing competition in the market, we derive universal theoretical bounds on the ratio of prices for rides, aggregate demand served, profits of the firms, and consumer surplus between the monopolistic and the duopolistic setting. We discuss how consumers’ firm loyalty affects each of the aforementioned metrics.

When coordination among sensors via a local communication network is available, the online learning of possibly unknown parameters of the probabilistic model is possible, enabling each sensor to optimize its own threshold autonomously. We propose two strategies for remote estimation with local communication: 1) one strategy swiftly reaches the performance of the optimal decentralized threshold policy and 2) the second strategy approaches the performance of the optimal centralized scheme with a slower convergence rate. A hybrid scheme that combines the best of both approaches is proposed, offering fast convergence and excellent performance.},

For nonconvex problems, we show that two simple algorithms return the essential set when the scenario problem is nondegenerate. Finally, we illustrate the theoretical results and computational algorithms on security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC) in power systems.

New tasks enter the queue according to a Bernoulli process with a prespecified arrival rate. At each instant, the server is either working on a task or is available. The scheduler implements a task-assignment control policy that we seek to design. When the server is available and the queue is nonempty, the policy either assigns a new task to the server or allows it to remain available (to rest ). In addition to the aforementioned availability state, we assume that the server has an integer-valued activity state . The activity state is nondecreasing during work periods, and is nonincreasing otherwise. In a typical application of our framework, the server performance (understood as task completion probability) worsens as the activity state increases. In this article, we build on and transcend recent stabilizability results obtained for the same framework. Specifically, we establish methods to design task-assignment control policies, which we call scheduler policies for short, which not only stabilize the queue but also reduce the utilization rate —understood as the infinite-horizon time-averaged portion of time the server is working. This article has a main theorem leading to two key results: 1) We put forth a tractable method to determine, using a finite-dimensional linear program (LP), the infimum of all utilization rates that can be achieved by scheduler policies that are stabilizing, for a given arrival rate. 2) We propose a design method, also based on finite-dimensional LPs, to obtain stabilizing scheduler policies that can attain a utilization rate arbitrarily close to the aforementioned infimum. We also establish structural and distributional convergence properties, which are used throughout this article, and are significant in their own right.},

Using the distributed flexible ac transmission system (D-FACTS), MTD works by actively perturbing the branch parameters that are needed to construct the false data injection (FDI) attacks. Although there are many pioneer works on MTD, the relationship between the construction of MTD and detection of FDI attacks has not been revealed. In this article, we reveal the correlation between MTD design and FDI detection and optimize MTD’s performance in terms of detecting FDI attacks. We provide a sufficient condition for a specially designed MTD to detect and identify the FDI attack and a necessary condition for general MTDs to protect the state estimates from being independently modified. With the aim to reduce the number of measurements that can be manipulated by the attacker after MTD, we develop a heuristic algorithm to compute a near-optimal solution for the deployment of D-FACTS devices. Moreover, we prove that the coordinated design of consecutive perturbation schemes within an MTD cycle can improve the performance of MTD in terms of detecting FDI attacks. Finally, we conduct extensive simulations with the IEEE power system test cases to validate our findings.},

Previous works identified vulnerability conditions when targeted PMUs measure a single phasor. Yet, PMUs are capable of measuring several quantities. We present novel vulnerability conditions in the general case, where PMUs measure any number of phasors and can share the same time reference. One is a sufficient condition that does not depend on the measurement values. We propose a security requirement that prevents it and provide a greedy offline algorithm that enforces it. If this security requirement is satisfied, there is still a possibility that the grid can be attacked, although we conjecture that it is very unlikely. We identify two sufficient and necessary vulnerability conditions, which depend on the measurement values. For each, we provide a metric that shows the distance between the observed and vulnerability conditions. We recommend their monitoring for security.

  abstract     = {As large amounts of data are circulated both from users to a cloud server and between users, privately aggregating the shared data is critical. This article considers the problem of private weighted sum aggregation with secret weights , where an aggregator wants to compute the weighted sum of the local data of some agents. Based on the privacy requirements posed on the weights, there are different secure multiparty computation schemes exploiting the knowledge structure. First, we review schemes for when each agent has a local private value and local private weight, and when agents have a local private value, but the aggregator holds the corresponding weights. Our main focus is the more general case, where the weights are known neither by the agents nor by the aggregator—they are generated and kept private by a system operator, and the aggregator has to compute the weighted sum without learning the agents’ data or the weights. We give solutions that achieve aggregator obliviousness and design more efficient communication and computation strategies for multidimensional data by batching the data into fewer ciphertexts. Finally, we implement our schemes and discuss the numerical results.},

Moreover, the agents form a regular polygon formation and avoid collision during the entire evolution. In the control scheme, the agents are not necessarily labeled and the nearest angle rules are applied. Each controller is composed of the functionalities of estimation of the target’s velocity, regulation of distance between the agents and the target, and angle repulsion among agents resulting in an equal distribution. The latter two also guarantee collision avoidance. The asymptotical behavior of the closed-loop system is rigorously analyzed, especially subject to the velocity estimation error. The effectiveness of the controller is also demonstrated by numerical simulation.},

Although diagnosability has been extensively investigated in the literature, weak diagnosability is a new concept introduced in this article. While diagnosability requires that a fault can be diagnosed along all trajectories after its occurrence, weak diagnosability requires that there always exists at least one trajectory along which the fault can be diagnosed at any time after its occurrence. Weak diagnosability ensures that any fault can be diagnosed eventually (with probability 1) but requires less sensors. We develop algorithms to check weak diagnosability. We further investigate weak diagnosability under communication delays and packet losses. We show that while packet losses may impact negatively on weak diagnosability, communication delays will not. We illustrate the results using a practical example.},

These two elements give rise to resource allocation structures and traffic dynamics that transcend the state of the art of the corresponding theory and challenge our current understandings and insights for these dynamics and their effective management. We provide: 1) a systematic introduction of the considered problems and of the elements that differentiate them from similar task allocation and traffic scheduling problems already studied in the literature; 2) complete analytical characterizations of these problems in the form of mathematical programming formulations; and 3) a formal analysis of the worst-case computational complexity of these problems and of certain factors that determine this complexity. Furthermore, the presented results define a base for the development of solution approaches to the considered problems able to effectively and systematically manage the identified tradeoff between the operational efficiency of the derived solutions and their computational cost.},

As for this article, we first transform the set stabilization problem of KVLCNs into the shortest path problem in graph theory and then construct a weighted directed hypergraph. Next, an improved heap-optimized Dijkstra algorithm is designed for the optimal asynchronous event-triggered controller. Furthermore, we study set stabilization of KVLCNs with time delays. In terms of applications, how to flexibly adapt the AETCM to specific models is a difficult problem. In this article, as applications, the consensus of finite-field networks with arbitrary communication delays and synchronization of KVLCNs is investigated.

Our approach leverages connections to the theory of discrete optimal transport to convert the problem into a tractable linear program. We simultaneously solve for the optimal assignment and the control of the individual agents. As a result, we can account for dynamics and capabilities of a heterogeneous set of agents and targets. In contrast to existing assignment schemes, this approach considers cost metrics informed by the underlying agent dynamics and capabilities rather than just distance. We show that the minimizer of the dynamic assignment problem is equivalent to the minimizer of the associated Monge problem from optimal transport. We prove that the resulting approach only requires a single assignment computation over the operating lifetime, rather than periodic reassignment. Furthermore, we demonstrate cost benefits that increase as the network size increases, achieving almost 50% cost reduction compared with distance-based metrics. We demonstrate our approach through simulation on several multiagent and multitarget tracking problems.},

We exploit the cascaded structure of the kinematics and dynamics of generic vessel models to develop structured reduced-order error dynamics for group cooperation. By incorporating graph theory, the supertwisting control technique, and persistence of excitation concept, a distributed robust formation control scheme is developed without requiring global position measurements, where agents in the network may possess completely different dynamic models. It is shown that the stabilization of the reduced-order error dynamics guarantees the stability of the entire vessel error system subject to modeling uncertainties and bounded disturbances. Distributed obstacle avoidance is achieved by surrounding obstacles with stable elliptical limit cycles. During the obstacle avoidance stage, a part of the formation deforms to allow vessels to follow transient trajectories around static and dynamic obstacles. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate that the proposed cooperative control scheme can prevent obstacle and interagent collisions while achieving robust formation in heterogeneous underactuated vessel networks.},

In this article, we prove that there are instances of networks for which any method is susceptible to inferring false negative edges or false positive edges. Borrowing a terminology from the theory of graphical models, we say those systems are unfaithful to their networks. We formalize a variant of faithfulness for dynamic systems, called Granger-faithfulness, and for a large class of dynamic networks, we show that Granger-unfaithful systems constitute a Lebesgue zero-measure set. For the same class of networks, under the Granger-faithfulness assumption, we provide an algorithm that reconstructs the network topology, which guarantees for no false positive and no false negative edges in its output. We augment the topology reconstruction algorithm with orientation rules for some of the inferred edges, and we prove the rules are consistent under the Granger-faithfulness assumption.},

Our results are based on the existing notion of maximal girth and our new notion of maximal eye. Moreover, we develop a series–parallel reduction method and search-based algorithms for computing the maximal eye and the maximal girth, which are necessary for the uniqueness analysis. Reduction to a single line using the proposed reduction method is guaranteed for 2-vertex-connected series–parallel graphs. The relations between the parameters of the network before and after reduction are obtained. It is verified on real-world networks that the computation of the maximal eye can be reduced to the analysis of a much smaller power network, while the maximal girth is computed during the reduction process.},

To reduce unnecessary transmission, an adaptive event-triggered mechanism (AETM) is introduced to fully employ the limited network resources and alleviate the pressure of network communication. The considered cyberattacks are described by a stochastic function with stochastic distribution. Then, a novel IT2 fuzzy closed-loop system is efficiently built under the AETM and the cyberattacks model, in which the asynchronous phenomenon of the plant and controller are described by the hidden Markov model. By utilizing the Lyapunov stability approach, sufficient conditions are established for the IT2 fuzzy closed-loop systems with strictly dissipative performance. Two examples are given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {An appropriate control structure is the prerequisite to guarantee the controllability and the observability of a system. This article addresses the issue of fault-tolerant control structure selection (CSS) problem for a class of network nonlinear systems (NNSs) with multidimensional nodes. First, based on differential algebra theory, necessary and sufficient accessibility/observability conditions are established, respectively, for NNSs, which fully reveal the relations between the accessibility/observability and the network structure as well as external inputs/outputs. Second, a fault-tolerant CSS-based recovering strategy is provided that adds minimal inputs/outputs/edges to recover the accessibility and observability of the faulty NNS. Finally, the new strategy is applied to examples of chemical reaction and multiple aircrafts to illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.},

The contributions of this article are three-fold. First, the small-gain theorem is extended to fuzzy systems, and input-to-output stability (IOS) and output-Lagrange input-to-output stability (OL-IOS) fuzzy small-gain theorem are proposed for fuzzy systems. Second, the OL-IOS small-gain theorem of fuzzy systems with multiple loop is given. Third, based on fuzzy small-gain theorem, the fuzzy distributed control law is composed of a purely fuzzy distributed control law and a distributed observer for the leader system. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated by using a numerical example and the leader-following consensus problem of the quadrotor.},

  abstract     = {The era of big data has brought with it a richer understanding of user behavior through massive datasets, which can help organizations optimize the quality of their services. In the context of transportation research, mobility data can provide municipal authorities (MAs) with insights on how to operate, regulate, or improve the transportation network. Mobility data, however, may contain sensitive information about end users and trade secrets of mobility providers (MPs). Due to this data privacy concern, MPs may be reluctant to contribute their datasets to MA. Using ideas from cryptography, we propose an interactive protocol between an MA and an MP, in which MA obtains insights from mobility data without MP having to reveal its trade secrets or sensitive data of its users. This is accomplished in two steps: 1) a commitment step and 2) a computation step. In the first step, Merkle commitments and aggregated traffic measurements are used to generate a cryptographic commitment. In the second step, MP extracts insights from the data and sends them to MA. Using the commitment and zero-knowledge proofs, MA can certify that the information received from MP is accurate, without needing to directly inspect the mobility data. We also present a differentially private version of the protocol that is suitable for the large query regime. The protocol is verifiable for both MA and MP in the sense that dishonesty from one party can be detected by the other. The protocol can be readily extended to the more general setting with multiple MPs via secure multiparty computation.},

  abstract     = {This article proposes a novel closed-loop reference model (CRM) architecture for a distributed model reference adaptive control (DMRAC) algorithm, called CRM-DMRAC. The idea of CRM has been recently conceptualized in the literature for a single agent system where the reference model (leader) receives feedback from the plant (follower) while enabling the use of high gain tuners without adding more transients in the parameter estimation. In this article, a CRM formulation is proposed where the leader receives feedback from a subset of follower agents (which are called neighbors of the leader). The external input to the leader is not shared with any of the followers unlike traditional MRAC algorithms. A novel external input estimator is proposed inspired from dynamic surface control in a hierarchical and cooperative manner. Further, the adaptation scheme is based on a newly defined excitation condition, called cooperative initial excitation (C-IE). The C-IE condition is significantly relaxed as compared to cooperative persistence of excitation, which is required for parameter convergence in traditional distributed adaptive controllers. The closed-loop system using the proposed adaptive controller has proven to be globally uniformly ultimately bounded. As a special case, it is shown that the closed-loop error dynamics will be exponentially converging to zero if the external input is available to all the followers. Numerical simulations validate the proof of concept, which illustrates the superiority in terms of transients response, estimation performance, and control effort for the proposed method over conventional open-loop reference model DMRAC and CRM-DMRAC without C-IE.},

By tuning the control gains based only on the neighboring information of agents, an adaptive algorithm is proposed to ensure that the network can achieve the fully distributed control objective without employing any global information of the network. When the rooted subgraph is structurally unbalanced, it is proved that the Laplacian matrix is a nonsingular &lt;inline-formula&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$H$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -matrix, thus making the network stable.

  abstract     = {A market consisting of a generator with thermal and renewable generation capability, a set of nonpreemptive loads (i.e., loads which cannot be interrupted once started), and an independent system operator (ISO) is considered. Loads are characterized by durations, power demand rates, and utility for receiving service, as well as disutility functions giving preferences for time slots in which service is preferred. Given this information, along with the generator’s thermal generation cost function and forecast renewable generation, the social planner solves a mixed-integer program to determine a load activation schedule which maximizes social welfare. Assuming price-taking behavior, we develop a competitive equilibrium concept based on a relaxed version of the social planner’s problem, which includes prices for consumption and incentives for flexibility, and allows for probabilistic allocation of power to loads. Considering each load as representative of a population of identical loads with scaled characteristics, we demonstrate that the relaxed social planner’s problem gives an exact solution to the original mixed integer problem in the large population limit, and give a market mechanism for implementing the competitive equilibrium. Finally, we evaluate via case study the benefit of incorporating load flexibility information into power consumption and generation scheduling in terms of proportion of loads served and overall social welfare.},

At each time stage, local sensors generate binary messages, assumed to be spatially and temporally independent given the hypothesis, and then upload them to the FC for global detection decision-making. We suppose a one-bit memory is available at the FC to store its decision history and focus on developing iterative fusion schemes. We first visit the detection problem of performing the Neyman–Pearson (N–P) test at each stage and give an optimal algorithm, called the oracle algorithm, to solve it. Structural properties and limitation of the fusion performance in the asymptotic regime are explored for the oracle algorithm. We notice the computational inefficiency of the oracle fusion and propose a low-complexity alternative, for which the likelihood ratio test threshold is tuned in connection to the fusion decision history compressed in the one-bit memory. The low-complexity algorithm greatly brings down the computational complexity at each stage from &lt;inline-formula&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$O(4^n)$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; (worst case) to &lt;inline-formula&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$O(n)$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; . We show that the proposed algorithm is capable of converging exponentially to the same detection probability as that of the oracle one. Moreover, the rate of convergence is shown to be asymptotically identical to that of the oracle algorithm. Finally, numerical simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our distributed algorithm.},
