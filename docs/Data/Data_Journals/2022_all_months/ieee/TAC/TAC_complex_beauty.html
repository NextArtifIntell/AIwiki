We also establish sufficient conditions for finite termination of the for a general discrete-time system, which is applicable to Markov chains. In addition to proving that the new initialization of the Kleene iteration algorithm requires no more iterations than the previously considered initialization, we present an example where our method computes the exact maximal invariant set in finitely many iterations and the previous method does not.},

  abstract     = {Extremum seeking systems are powerful methods able to steer the input of a (dynamical) cost function toward an optimizer, without any prior knowledge of the cost function. To achieve their objective, they typically combine time-periodic signals with the online measurement of the cost. However, in some practical applications, the cost can only be measured during some regular time-intervals, and not continuously, contravening the classical extremum seeking framework. In this article, we first analyze how existing Lie-bracket-based extremum seeking systems behave when being fed with intermittent measurements, instead of continuous ones. We then propose two modifications of those schemes to improve both the convergence time and the steady-state accuracy in presence of intermittent measurements. The performances of the different schemes are compared on a case study.},

As a result, the accuracy of the EDD can be improved greatly provided we have known some signal dynamics before signal differentiation. When all the signal dynamics are known, the EDD will reach zero derivative tracking error. When only some boundedness of the signal is known, which is the same as the most existing differentiators, the EDD will turn out to be a high-gain differentiator. When the known signal dynamics are between the two of them, the EDD can do its best in some sense. The EDD well posedness is proved mathematically and the corresponding theoretical results are validated by numerical simulations.},

The one step behind (OSB) smoothed state pdf used for calculating the filtered state pdf of the MDEF is approximated by the ensemble Kalman smoother (EnKS). Then, the particle weights for the EnKS-MDEF remain equal during the filter execution, which indicates that the EnKS-MDEF is a degeneracy-free PF. Since, the MDEF and the EnKS-MDEF, both estimate the OSB smoothed state pdf prior to calculating the filtered state pdf, these filters provide a simultaneous estimation of filtered and OSB smoothed states. The examples of the EnKS-MDEF are the EnKS-extended and unscented Kalman multiple distribution estimation filters, and their filtering and OSB smoothing performances are evaluated and compared with those for the representative filters and smoothers using a benchmark simulation problems.},

Such a controller minimizes the predictability of an agent’s trajectories to an outside observer while guaranteeing the completion of a task expressed by a reward function. Focusing on finite-state controllers (FSCs) with deterministic memory transitions, we show that the maximum entropy of a POMDP is lower bounded by the maximum entropy of the parameteric Markov chain (pMC) induced by such FSCs. This relationship allows us to recast the entropy maximization problem as a so-called parameter synthesis problem for the induced pMC. We then present an algorithm to synthesize an FSC that locally maximizes the entropy of a POMDP over FSCs with the same number of memory states. In a numerical example, we highlight the benefit of using an entropy-maximizing FSC compared with an FSC that simply finds a feasible policy for accomplishing a task.},

Constructing a supermartingale over some $\sigma$ -algebra together with the property of conditional expectation, a necessary and sufficient condition is established to ensure that the equilibrium point of the underlying system is exponentially stable in mean square.

The algorithm assumes a communication topology that allows bidirectional message exchanges between pairs of nodes that are physically connected (i.e., nodes that share a directed edge in the physical topology) and is shown to converge to a feasible and balanced solution as long as the necessary and sufficient circulation conditions are satisfied with strict inequality. In case, the initial flows and flow limits are commensurable (i.e., they are integer multiples of a given constant), then the proposed algorithm reduces to a previously proposed finite-time balancing algorithm, for which we provide an explicit bound on the number of steps required for termination.},

To deal with the unknown control direction, an orientation function is exploited in lieu of the Nussbaum gain technique, the supervisory switching strategy, and the parameter estimation approach. To attain global tracking performance, a tuning function is employed to adjust the tracking error, and a barrier function is used to combat this error. The resulting controller guarantees the prescribed tracking performance and the boundedness of the signals in the closed loop for any initial condition.},

  abstract     = {This article considers minimum time optimal control problems with linear dynamics subject to state equality constraints and control inequality constraints. In the absence of state constraints, there are well-known sufficient conditions to guarantee that optimal controls are at the boundary or extreme points of the control set. With strong observability as the key tool, analogous conditions are derived for problems subject to both extrinsic and intrinsic state constraints. Understanding these geometric properties enables exact convex relaxations. The relaxation technique is used to convert a nonconvex quadratic program to a second-order cone program and a mixed integer linear program to a linear program. The relaxations accelerate numerical solution times by factors of 18 000 and 150, respectively. As such, the theorems and relaxations are seen as important tools for real-time optimization-based control.},

By using a tube-based approach, the overall system state is driven to the target sets while satisfying state and input constraints despite the changes in the controllers’ clustering.

Two types of interactive agents are involved: a major agent and a large number of weakly coupled minor agents. All minor agents are cooperative to minimize the social cost as the sum of their individual costs, whereas such social cost is conflictive to that of the major agent. Thus, the major agent and all minor agents are further competitive to reach some nonzero-sum Nash equilibrium. Applying the mean-field approximations and person-by-person optimality, we obtain auxiliary control problems for the major agent and minor agents, respectively. The decentralized social strategy is derived by a class of new consistency condition (CC) system, which consists of mean-field forward–backward stochastic differential equations. The well-posedness of CC system is obtained by the discounting method. The related asymptotic social optimality for minor agents and Nash equilibrium for major–minor agents are also verified.},

Compared with the existing results where the structure constraints on local gradients or system matrices are required, the considered DOC framework is sufficiently general in the sense that no extra assumption is required except for the convexity/differentiability of local objective functions and the controllability/observability of linear systems. A necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of the solution to the DOC problem is derived in terms of the relationship between the objective function and so-called steady-state reachable set of linear systems. Under this fundamental condition, the original DOC problem is transformed into the one with additive equality constraint, without loss of the optimality, which generates a trackable solution for agent dynamics. By using a new state transformation technique, it is proved that the proposed DOC algorithm guarantees the global asymptotical convergence by utilizing only local interaction. Simulation results on the motion coordination illustrate the proposed algorithm.},

The WSN admits a network topology to formulate a fully distributed sensor scheduling policy, and transmits measured information over a shared wireless channel. Due to the bandwidth limit, at each time only partial sensor nodes can send their measurements to the corresponding remote controller. By introducing a distributed minimum subset extraction mechanism under Q-learning framework, a data-based sensor scheduling algorithm is proposed, which gives an approximate solution to minimizing the $H_\infty$ performance index of the overall closed-loop system, without requiring the knowledge of system parameters. Also, under persistently exciting condition with sufficiently rich enough disturbances, the algorithm converges to the exact optimal solution.

We employ a deterministic DoS attack model constrained in terms of attacks’ frequency and duration, allowing us to cover a large class of potential attacks. To achieve asymptotic stabilization, we propose a resilient dynamic quantizer capable of not saturating even in the presence of packet losses caused by DoS attacks. A sufficient condition for stability is derived by restricting the average DoS frequency and duration. In addition, because of the locality of linearization, we explicitly investigate an estimate of the region of attraction, which may be reduced depending on the strength of DoS attacks.

To obtain an NE, a novel two-time-scale distributed algorithm is designed. This new strategy consists of two parts: one is the fast compensating dynamics, which can rapidly compensate the effect of input dead zone; the other is the optimization dynamics that can distributively drive the players’ decision variables to achieve the NE. Since the proposed algorithm has a two-time-scale structure, singular perturbation techniques are used to prove that the players’ actions semiglobally practically asymptotically converge to the NE.

Then, based on the input-to-state stability method, the asymptotic stability is ensured for the closed-loop systems.

In addition to overcome the difficulty to proceed recursive design of virtual controls with quantized states, the relation between the input signal and error state need be well established to handle the effects due to input quantization.

  abstract     = {This article is concerned with the security issue in the state estimation problem for a networked control system (NCS). A new model of joint false data injection (FDI) attack is established wherein attacks are injected to both the remote estimator and the communication channels. Such a model is general that includes most existing FDI attack models as special cases. The joint FDI attacks are subjected to limited access and/or resource constraints, and this gives rise to a few attack scenarios to be examined one by one. Our objective is to establish the so-called insecurity conditions under which there exists an attack sequence capable of driving the estimation bias to infinity while bypassing the anomaly detector. By resorting to the generalized inverse theory, necessary and sufficient conditions are derived for the insecurity under different attack scenarios. Subsequently, easy-to-implement algorithms are proposed to generate attack sequences on insecure NCSs with respect to different attack scenarios. In particular, by using a matrix splitting technique, the constraint-induced sparsity of the attack vectors is dedicatedly investigated. Finally, several numerical examples are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed FDI attacks.},

Geometric control theory and stability theory of incremental systems are used to design an attack generation scheme with stealthiness properties. An attack model is proposed as a closed-loop dynamical system with an arbitrary input signal. This model is developed based on a controlled invariant subspace that results from geometric control theory and is decoupled with the system outputs and the nonlinear function. The presence of the arbitrary signal in the attack model provides an additional degree of freedom and constitutes a novel component compared with existing results. The stealthiness of the attack model is rigorously investigated based on the incremental stability of the closed-loop control system, and the incremental input-to-state stability of the anomaly detector. As a result, a sufficient condition in terms of the initial condition of the attack model is derived to guarantee stealthiness. Finally, a case study is presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the developed attack generation scheme.},

In this NDS, subsystems may have distinctive dynamics, and subsystem interconnections are arbitrary. It is assumed that system matrices of each subsystem depend on its (pseudo) first principle parameters (FPP) through a linear fractional transformation. It has been proven that if in each subsystem, the transfer function matrix (TFM) from its internal inputs to its external outputs is of full normal column rank, while the TFM from its external inputs to its internal outputs is of full normal row rank, then the structure of the NDS is identifiable. Moreover, under some particular situations like there is no direct information transmission from an internal input to an internal output in each subsystem, a necessary and sufficient condition is established for NDS structure identifiability. A matrix valued polynomial rank-based equivalent condition is further derived, which depends affinely on subsystem (pseudo) FPPs and can be independently verified for each subsystem. From this condition, some necessary conditions are obtained for both subsystem dynamics and its (pseudo) FPPs, using the Kronecker canonical form of a matrix pencil.},

Third, we extend our contraction framework in two directions: we prove equivalences for contraction of continuous vector fields, and we formalize the weaker notion of equilibrium contraction, which ensures exponential convergence to an equilibrium.

In this article, we first consider the stabilization of a chain of two interconnected subsystems, actuated at the in-between boundary. Each subsystem corresponds to coupled hyperbolic partial differential equations. Such in-domain actuation leads to higher complexity, and represents a significant difference with existing results. Then, starting from a classical controllability condition, we design a state feedback control law for the considered class of systems. The proposed approach is based on the backstepping methodology. However, to deal with the complex structure of the system, we use Fredholm integral transforms instead of classical Volterra transforms. We prove the invertibility of such transforms using an original operator framework. The well posedness of the backstepping kernel equations defining the transformations is also shown with the same arguments. By using a similar procedure, we are then able to design a Luenberger-type observer. Finally, we use the state estimation in the stabilizing controller to obtain an output-feedback law. Some test cases complete the paper.},

The change of coordinates induced by Brunovsky’s normal form allows us to remove the restriction of having to work with diagonalizable system dynamics and does not entail a randomization procedure as done in past literature on diffusion equations or waves. Instead, the optimization problem reduces to a minimization of the norm of the inverse of a change of basis matrix and allows for an easy deduction of existence of solutions, and for a clearer picture of some of the problem’s intrinsic symmetries. Numerical experiments help to visualize these properties, indicate further open problems, and also show a possible obstruction of using gradient-based algorithms—this is alleviated by using an evolutionary algorithm.},

Control objectives are expressed using syntactically co-safe linear temporal logic (LTL) specifications and the nonlinear system is subject to state and input constraints. At the highest level of abstraction, we model the system–environment interaction using a discrete mixed observable Markov decision process, where the environment states are partially observed. The high-level control policy is used to update the constraint sets and cost function of a model predictive controller (MPC) which plans a reference trajectory. Afterward, the MPC planned trajectory is fed to a low-level high-frequency tracking controller, which leverages control barrier functions to guarantee bounded tracking errors. Our strategy is based on model abstractions of increasing complexity and layers running at different frequencies. We show that the proposed hierarchical multirate control architecture maximizes the probability of satisfying the high-level specifications, while guaranteeing state and input constraint satisfaction. Finally, we tested the proposed strategy in simulations and experiments on examples inspired by the Mars exploration mission, where only partial environment observations are available.},

  abstract     = {A self-powered control system derives the energy to power its operation entirely from the dynamics of the plant in which it is embedded. Each actuator is a transducer capable of injecting energy into, as well as removing energy from, the plant. Removed energy is stored for reuse in rechargeable energy storage subsystems. Control inputs are physically constrained by the requirement that the system does not exhaust these energy storage subsystems. This article analyzes model-predictive control (MPC) trajectory feasibility for self-powered control systems. Specifically, we examine the case in which the MPC algorithm formulates a discrete-time zero-order-hold control trajectory, for which the energy constraints are approximately enforced by using response information only at discrete sample times. It is shown that continuous-time control feasibility can be ensured by conservatively overbounding the transmission loss model. The analysis is conducted both for the case in which future disturbances are known deterministically and the case in which they are uncertain but bounded. The methodology is demonstrated on an example pertaining to vibration control.},

  abstract     = {This article proposes a novel disturbance rejection model predictive control (DRMPC) framework to improve the robustness of model predictive control (MPC) for a broad class of input-affine nonlinear systems with constraints and state-dependent disturbances. The proposed controller includes two parts—a disturbance compensation input and an optimal MPC control input. The former one is designed to compensate for the matched disturbance actively. This is made possible via a disturbance observer that estimates the disturbance and by adopting a space decomposition method. The residual disturbance is then handled in the MPC optimization problem by appropriate tightening of the constraints and designing the terminal constraint. Under reasonable assumptions, recursive feasibility and regional input-to-state practical stability (regional ISpS) of the closed-loop system are shown. Furthermore, we extend the DRMPC framework toward the tracking problem and apply it to a nonholonomic mobile robot. The performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated by a numerical example of the nonholonomic mobile robot.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we investigate the enforcement of opacity via supervisory control in the context of discrete-event systems. A system is said to be opaque if the intruder, which is modeled as a passive observer, can never infer confidently that the system is at a secret state. The design objective is to synthesize a supervisor such that the closed-loop system is opaque even when the control policy is publicly known. In this article, we propose a new approach for enforcing opacity using nondeterministic supervisors. A nondeterministic supervisor is a decision mechanism that provides a set of control decisions at each instant, and randomly picks a specific control decision from the decision set to actually control the plant. Compared with the standard deterministic control mechanism, such a nondeterministic control mechanism can enhance the plausible deniability of the controlled system as the online control decision is a random realization and cannot be implicitly inferred from the control policy. We provide a sound and complete algorithm for synthesizing a nondeterministic opacity-enforcing supervisor. Furthermore, we show that nondeterministic supervisors are strictly more powerful than deterministic supervisors in the sense that there may exist a nondeterministic opacity-enforcing supervisor even when deterministic supervisors cannot enforce opacity.},

The estimation gains are characterized by two modified algebraic Riccati equations (MAREs), together with a complete and rigorous stability analysis in the mean square (MS) sense. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the MS stability of the corresponding error dynamics are then given in terms of the data arrival rate and unstable poles of the plant, i.e., the Mahler measure of the plant. Moreover, the filtering strategy is expanded into the case of distributed estimation over lossy sensor networks, where each sensor locally constructs an estimate based on its own observation and on those collected from its neighbors, and the solution is again derived by MAREs. The corresponding necessary and sufficient conditions to the MS stability in the distributed case are also characterized by relationships between data arrival rates and the Mahler measure of the plant.

We cast the problem in the contraction framework, and we rely on the common approach of extending the system with an integral action processing the regulation error. We then present sufficient conditions for the design of a state-feedback control law able to make the resulting closed-loop system incrementally stable, uniformly with respect to the references and the disturbances. Such a property ensures uniqueness and attractiveness of an equilibrium on which output regulation is obtained. To this end, we develop an incremental version of the forwarding (mod $\lbrace L_gV\rbrace$ ) approach. Finally, we provide a set of sufficient conditions for the design of a pure (small-gain) integral-feedback control. The proposed approach is also specialized for two classes of systems that are linear systems having a Lipschitz nonlinearity and a class of minimum-phase systems whose zero dynamics are incrementally stable.},

We define risk-sensitive safe sets as sublevel sets of the solution to a nonstandard optimal control problem, where a random maximum cost is assessed via Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR). The objective function represents the maximum extent of constraint violation of the state trajectory, averaged over a given percentage of worst cases. This problem is well-motivated but difficult to solve tractably because the temporal decomposition for CVaR is history-dependent. Our primary theoretical contribution is to derive computationally tractable underapproximations to risk-sensitive safe sets. Our method provides a novel, theoretically guaranteed, parameter-dependent upper bound to the CVaR of a maximum cost without the need to augment the state space. For a fixed parameter value, the solution to only one Markov decision process problem is required to obtain the underapproximations for any family of risk-sensitivity levels. In addition, we propose a second definition for risk-sensitive safe sets and provide a tractable method for their estimation without using a parameter-dependent upper bound. The second definition is expressed in terms of a new coherent risk functional, which is inspired by CVaR. We demonstrate our primary theoretical contribution via numerical examples.},

First, the admissible set of the mode feedback control is investigated, and a sufficient condition is derived to ensure the desired stochastic stability. Second, under the assumption that the concerned system is mode-cost sequential, the original performance index is approximated into a new tractable one and a suboptimal mode feedback controller is then derived within the admissible set. Third, we consider a general situation where no specific requirements are imposed on the Markovian jump linear systems’ dynamics, derive the optimal mode feedback controller via a value-iteration-based algorithm, and prove the convergence of the obtained optimal controller.

A number of works have uncovered that gradient noise plays a critical role in the ability of gradient descent recursions to efficiently escape saddle-points and reach second-order stationary points. Most available works limit the gradient noise component to be bounded with probability one or sub-Gaussian and leverage concentration inequalities to arrive at high-probability results. We present an alternate approach, relying primarily on mean-square arguments and show that a more relaxed relative bound on the gradient noise variance is sufficient to ensure efficient escape from saddle points without the need to inject additional noise, employ alternating step sizes, or rely on a global dispersive noise assumption, as long as a gradient noise component is present in a descent direction for every saddle point.},

Then we establish a verification theorem, which provides a sufficient condition of optimality and characterizes the value function using the (stochastic) solution of the ISHJBE with jump diffusions. Under suitable assumptions, we show the existence and uniqueness of the weak solution to the ISHJBE via the Sobolev space technique.

Using classical, parameter-based techniques for modeling of modern systems, e.g., soft robotics or human–robot interaction, are often challenging or even infeasible due to the complexity of the system dynamics. In contrast, data-driven approaches need only a minimum of prior knowledge and scale with the complexity of the system. In particular, Gaussian process dynamical models (GPDMs) provide very promising results for the modeling of complex dynamics. However, the control properties of these GP models are just sparsely researched, which leads to a “blackbox” treatment in modeling and control scenarios. In addition, the sampling of GPDMs for prediction purpose respecting their nonparametric nature results in non-Markovian dynamics making the theoretical analysis challenging. In this article, we present approximated GPDMs, which are Markov and analyze their control theoretical properties. Among others, the approximated error is analyzed and conditions for boundedness of the trajectories are provided. The outcomes are illustrated with numerical examples that show the power of the approximated models while the computational time is significantly reduced.},

This property is then exploited for developing our distributed deterministic channel access scheme. A framework to verify the stability of the system under the resulting scheme is then proposed. Next, we consider a practical scenario in which the channel statistics are unknown. We propose learning algorithms for learning the parameters of imperfect communication links for estimating the channel quality and, hence, define the local cost as a function of this estimation and control performance. We establish that our learning approach results in collision-free channel access.

ZODPO only requires limited communication and storage even in large-scale systems. Further, we investigate the nonasymptotic performance of ZODPO and show that the sample complexity to approach a stationary point is polynomial with the error tolerance’s inverse and the problem dimensions, demonstrating the scalability of ZODPO.

Next, having access only to the input matrix, we propose the data-guided regulation (DGR) synthesis procedure that—as its name suggests—regulates the underlying state while also generating informative data that can subsequently be used for data-driven stabilization or system identification.

  abstract     = {Adversarial attacks on controllers of dynamic systems have become a serious threat to many real-world systems, making methods for fast identification of attacks an indispensable part of autonomous systems. With the increasing use of model-based controllers, it is valid to exploit model knowledge also for attack identification as long as privacy of individual components is maintained. A scalable, model-based method to reveal generic attacks was introduced in our previous work and is further investigated here. It is designed for coupled systems with nonlinear dynamics and monitors certain coupling states. Based on the exchange of local sensitivity information, it approximates the propagation of an attack through the network and solves a sparse optimization problem to identify the attack. We provide a thorough derivation of the approach and analyze the involved approximation errors to prove rigorous guarantees for successful identification. In an extensive numerical case study with the IEEE 30 bus power system, we prove that not only the guarantees apply for a nonlinear, practically relevant example, but the method also identifies attacked buses with very high success rates.},

The limited existing work on this topic imposes various restrictions either on the observation model or on the sequence of communication graphs. In contrast, we propose a single-time-scale distributed observer that works under mild assumptions. Specifically, our communication model only requires strong-connectivity to be preserved over nonoverlapping, contiguous intervals that are even allowed to grow unbounded over time. We show that under suitable conditions that bound the growth of such intervals, joint observability is sufficient to track the state of any discrete-time LTI system exponentially fast, at any desired rate. We also develop a variant of our algorithm that is provably robust to worst-case adversarial attacks, provided the sequence of graphs is sufficiently connected over time. The key to our approach is the notion of a “freshness-index” that keeps track of the age-of-information being diffused across the network. Such indices enable nodes to reject stale estimates of the state, and, in turn, contribute to stability of the error dynamics.},

  abstract     = {Probabilistic model-checking aims to prove whether a Markov decision process (MDP) satisfies a temporal logic specification. The underlying methods rely on an often unrealistic assumption that the MDP is precisely known. Consequently, parametric MDPs (pMDPs) extend MDPs with transition probabilities that are functions over unspecified parameters. The parameter synthesis problem is to compute an instantiation of these unspecified parameters such that the resulting MDP satisfies the temporal logic specification. We formulate the parameter synthesis problem as a quadratically constrained quadratic program, which is nonconvex and is NP-hard to solve in general. We develop two approaches that iteratively obtain locally optimal solutions. The first approach exploits the so-called convex–concave procedure (CCP), and the second approach utilizes a sequential convex programming (SCP) method. The techniques improve the runtime and scalability by multiple orders of magnitude compared to black-box CCP and SCP by merging ideas from convex optimization and probabilistic model-checking. We demonstrate the approaches on a satellite collision avoidance problem with hundreds of thousands of states and tens of thousands of parameters and their scalability on a wide range of commonly used benchmarks.},

In this article, we focus on the Gaussian noise case and provide an analytic expression of the stationary state distribution as a function of the compensator parameters.

This manuscript focuses on the output consensus problem for heterogeneous MASs with input saturation constraints over the Markovian randomly switching topologies. The main challenge of solving the concerned problem lies in the interplay among the heterogeneous dynamics, input saturation constraints and the Markovian randomly switching topologies. To overcome such a challenge, a class of distributed adaptive observers is first designed for all agents to deal with the uncertainty caused by the randomly switching topologies. Then, a class of local state observers is presented for estimating each agent’s state information. Based on the above steps, a class of antiwindup controllers is constructed and the control gain matrices are selected using only the dynamics information of each node. Finally, the effectiveness of the consensus protocol is demonstrated.},

  abstract     = {Cohesion in networks during transitions from one consensus value to another, i.e., the ability of agents to respond in a similar manner during the transition, can be as important as achieving the new consensus value. Existing decentralized network control strategies mainly concern with the convergence speed to the final consensus value. However, even with increased convergence speed, the level of cohesion loss during transitions can be large. This loss of cohesion during transition (and tracking of varying consensus values) can be alleviated using a recently developed delayed self reinforcement (DSR) approach. However, the current DSR-based approach assumes ideal conditions with agents having instant access to neighbor information—without network delays arising during sensing or communication between neighbors, as well as computation of control actions of each agent, which can cause instability. The main contributions of this article are to use the Rouchè’s theorem to 1) prove the stability of the DSR approach if the network delay is not too large; and 2) compute an estimate of the acceptable network delay margin (DM) for stability. Additionally, a simulation example is used to illustrate the estimation approach for network DMs with DSR, and show that cohesion is maintained with DSR even with network delays when compared to the case without DSR.},

We design a one-step cost function to encompass the entire set of vertices of each mode altogether, while maintaining its quadratic structure and the convexity of the problem. The solution is then obtained recursively and does not require numerical optimization packages. We establish conditions for convergence and stability by extending the matrix structure of the recursive solution.

In these schemes, terminal sets are usually computed offline and used in the MPC online phase to guarantee recursive feasibility and asymptotic stability. Maximal invariant terminal sets do not necessarily respect the distributed structure of the network, hindering the distributed implementation of the controller. On the other hand, ellipsoidal terminal sets respect the distributed structure, but may lead to conservative schemes. In this article, a novel distributed MPC scheme is proposed for reference tracking of networked dynamical systems, where the terminal ingredients are reconfigured online depending on the closed-loop states to alleviate the aforementioned issues. The resulting nonconvex infinite-dimensional problem is approximated using a quadratic program. The proposed scheme is tested in simulation, where the proposed MPC problem is solved using distributed optimization.},

  abstract     = {A probabilistic Boolean network (PBN) is a discrete-time system composed of a collection of Boolean networks between which the PBN switches in a stochastic manner. This article focuses on the study of quotients of PBNs. Given a PBN and an equivalence relation on its state set, we consider a probabilistic transition system that is generated by the PBN; the resulting quotient transition system then automatically captures the quotient behavior of this PBN. We therefore describe a method for obtaining a probabilistic Boolean system that generates the transitions of the quotient transition system. Applications of this quotient description are discussed, and it is shown that for PBNs, controller synthesis can be performed easily by first controlling a quotient system and then lifting the control law back to the original network. A biological example is given to show the usefulness of the developed results.},

The endosystem is assumed to be an unknown system that is interconnected to a known exosystem that generates disturbances and reference signals. The problem is to design a regulator so that the output of the (unknown) endosystem tracks the reference signal, regardless of its initial state and the incoming disturbances. In order to do this, we assume that we have a set of input-state data on a finite time-interval. We introduce the notion of data informativity for regulator design, and establish necessary and sufficient conditions for a given set of data to be informative. Also, formulas for suitable regulators are given in terms of the data. Our results are illustrated by means of two extended examples.},

We then show that a recently proposed time-varying parameters Nesterov algorithm applied to this problem has worse performance assuming one can determine the number of sensors in the network. In order to remove such an assumption, the problem is seen as the solution of a linear equation corresponding to the first optimality condition. Both theoretically and in simulation, we show that using the Gauss–Seidel method improves the speed of convergence, although its performance degrades for large network sizes.

A suitable sliding surface function is proposed and the resulting sliding mode dynamics are a class of linear impulsive systems. Some sufficient conditions coupled with impulse time sequences are proposed to guarantee the reachability of the predesigned sliding surface and the stability of the reduced-order impulsive systems under sliding motion, respectively. We show how restrictions on the structure of the systems and impulses should be imposed to ensure the feasibility of the proposed SMC strategy in comparison with general SMC in continuous space.

Noticing that velocity signals are usually noisy or not available for feedback control in practical engineering systems, this article supposes that the velocity signals are not accessible for the players. To deal with the absence of velocity measurements, two estimators are designed. The first estimator is established by employing an observer, which has the same order as the players’ dynamics, to estimate the unavailable system states (e.g., the players’ velocities). The second estimator is designed based on a high-pass filter and is motivated by the incentive to reduce the order of the estimator, which in turn saves the computation costs of the seeking algorithms. On the basis of the designed observers/filters, distributed Nash equilibrium-seeking strategies are then established through incorporating them with consensus and gradient algorithms. It is analytically proven that the players’ actions can be regulated to the Nash equilibrium point and their velocities can be regulated to zero by utilizing the proposed velocity-free Nash equilibrium-seeking strategies. A numerical example is provided for the verification of the proposed algorithms.},

Then, a distributed control protocol is proposed based on the cooperative output regulation framework, utilizing this virtual exosystem. Based on the estimations of leaders’ dynamics and states and NLIs of leaders on each follower, the solutions of the so-called linear regulator equations are calculated in a distributed manner, and consequently, a distributed control protocol is designed for solving the output containment problem.

In order to achieve finite-time stability and reduce the update frequency of the controller, a novel controller and its event-trigger mechanism is proposed by adding a power integral technique and utilizing sign function. To fulfill the requirement of asymmetric output constraints, an asymmetric barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) is constructed, which is different from tan-type and log-type BLFs. Based on the contradictory idea and finite-time stability theory, it is proved that there is no Zeno phenomenon under this event-trigger mechanism and all state variables of the closed-loop system attenuate to the origin in the finite-time while the output signals never violate the constraint. Furthermore, the result in this article is expanded to fixed-time control. Finally, a simulation example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented strategy.},

The notions of semiglobal asymptotic stabilization and sublevel sets are introduced in the context of time-delay systems. With the aid of Razumikhin theorem, we develop a semiglobal design method for the construction of Lyapunov functions, associated sublevel sets, and delay-free linear state feedback laws, step-by-step, achieving semiglobal asymptotic stabilization for time-delay nonlinear systems in a lower triangular form. In contrast to the global stabilization of nonlinear systems with delays in the state, which is usually achieved by dynamic state feedback (Lin and Zhang, 2020), the significance of this work is to point out that a tradeoff of the control objectives, e.g., semiglobal versus global stabilization, makes it possible to control a class of time-delay nonlinear systems by static linear feedback. Extensions to nonlinear systems with globally asymptotically locally expoentially stable (GALES)-like inverse dynamics are also included in this article.},

The distinguishing feature of the algorithm is that it does not employ agents’ out-degree information, nor does it require the estimation of the left eigenvector, corresponding to the zero eigenvalue, of the Laplacian matrix. Existing approaches for unbalanced networks either demand the knowledge on agents’ out-degrees, which is impractical in applications, where an agent might not be aware of the detection and employment of its information by other agents, or require every agent to be equipped with a network-sized estimator, causing an additional $n^2$ storage and communication cost with $n$ being the network size. The results exhibit an inherent connection between the selection of the scaling factor and the convergence property of the algorithm, among other known factors such as the network topology and the boundedness of the subgradients of the local objective functions.

First, the degree of freedom of the network is reduced to deal with the global constraint. Second, we utilize delay compensation to counteract the delay of asynchronous communication. We prove that the convergence rate is $O(\frac{1}{k})$ and analyze both the communication complexity and the time complexity.

This condition is further shown to be equivalent to containing cluster spanning trees, a commonly used topology for the underlying graph in the literature. Under a designed controller gain, lower bound of the overall coupling strength for achieving group consensus is specified.

This is one of the fundamental bottlenecks that limit the design and implementation of MPC policy approximation.

This article studies existing innovation-based linear attack strategies with relaxed stealthiness and concludes that all of them provided merely suboptimal solutions. The main reason is some oversight in solving the involved optimization problems: some covariance constraints were not perfectly handled. This article provides the corresponding optimal solutions for those stealthy attacks. Both one-step and holistic optimizations of stealthy attacks are studied, and the worst-case attacks with and without zero-mean constraints are derived analytically, without the necessity to numerically solve semidefinite programming problems.},

Whether a hybrid system is observable or not depends on which events can be disabled, which events can be forced, and the connectivity of the discrete states, as well as its continuous dynamics. We model a hybrid system using a hybrid machine that takes into consideration both continuous variables and discrete events. We classify hybrid systems into four classes based on their discrete-event parts. For each class, conditions are derived to check observability. If a hybrid system is not observable, then we check if a weaker version of observability, called $B$ -observability, is satisfied. $B$ -observability requires that a hybrid system become observable after some finite occurrences of events. Conditions are derived to check $B$ -observability. These conditions involve both the discrete-event and continuous-variable parts of hybrid systems. If the continuous-variable part of a system has a constant- $A$ matrix, then the conditions for the continuous-variable part can be simplified. We illustrate the results by an example of a battery management system of an electric vehicle.},

We derive a novel way to compute the weight that avoids this difficulty. In practice, the true optimal weight cannot be calculated because it is a function of the sought covariance matrices. However, our work enables implementation of two novel ALS algorithms that estimate the weight from data. For the purpose of comparison, we also discuss ALS with an arbitrary weight (such as an identity matrix) and present a previously published method for estimating the ALS weight. ALS with an identity weight guarantees unbiased and consistent covariance estimates, but algorithms that estimate the weight from data do not inherit these guarantees. Despite this drawback, we present a numerical example for which the best performing algorithm, iterative estimation of the covariances and the ALS weight, produces covariance estimates with a small amount of bias and a significantly reduced variance compared to all other algorithms.},

Thus, it gives rise to the design of distributed average tracking (DAT) algorithms without using agents’ velocity measurements. These are denoted as velocity-free DAT problems. The existing literature has addressed such problems in the presence of an undirected graph for the reference signals with bounded position, velocity, and acceleration differences. We propose a velocity-free DAT algorithm under a weight-unbalanced strongly-connected digraph that represents the most general network structure for achieving DAT. Additionally, the proposed algorithm works for a broader range of time-varying references, having bounded acceleration differences among themselves. Linear stability theory is used to establish uniform ultimate boundedness of the errors for bounded acceleration differences. Asymptotic convergence of the errors is guaranteed for converging acceleration differences. Unlike the existing works, our DAT algorithm does not need any update law for the gains. Thus, the approach is computationally efficient. Numerical simulations with the comparison with the state-of-the-art demonstrate the performance of our algorithm over a wider range of time-varying references under weight-unbalanced graph.},

A formalism is developed to measure performance based on the transmission of a dynamic perturbation or initial state preparation error to the quantum state error. This makes it possible to apply tools from classical robust control, such as structured singular value analysis. A difficulty arising from the singularity of the closed-loop Bloch equations for the quantum state is overcome by introducing the #-inversion lemma, a specialized version of the matrix inversion lemma. Under some conditions, this guarantees continuity of the structured singular value at $s = 0$ . Additional difficulties occur when symmetry gives rise to multiple open-loop poles, which under symmetry-breaking unfold into single eigenvalues. The concepts are applied to systems subject to pure decoherence and a general dissipative system example of two qubits in a leaky cavity under laser driving fields and spontaneous emission. A nonclassical performance index, steady-state entanglement quantified by the concurrence, a nonlinear function of the system state, is introduced. Simulations confirm a conflict between entanglement, its log-sensitivity and stability margin under decoherence.},

  abstract     = {We study the convergence properties of an overlapping Schwarz decomposition algorithm for solving nonlinear optimal control problems (OCPs). The algorithm decomposes the time domain into a set of overlapping subdomains, and solves all subproblems defined over subdomains in parallel. The convergence is attained by updating primal-dual information at the boundaries of overlapping subdomains. We show that the algorithm exhibits local linear convergence, and that the convergence rate improves exponentially with the overlap size. We also establish global convergence results for a general quadratic programming, which enables the application of the Schwarz scheme inside second-order optimization algorithms (e.g., sequential quadratic programming). The theoretical foundation of our convergence analysis is a sensitivity result of nonlinear OCPs, which we call “exponential decay of sensitivity” (EDS). Intuitively, EDS states that the impact of perturbations at domain boundaries (i.e., initial and terminal time) on the solution decays exponentially as one moves into the domain. Here, we expand a previous analysis available in the literature by showing that EDS holds for both primal and dual solutions of nonlinear OCPs, under uniform second-order sufficient condition, controllability condition, and boundedness condition. We conduct experiments with a quadrotor motion planning problem and a partial differential equations (PDE) control problem to validate our theory, and show that the approach is significantly more efficient than alternating direction method of multipliers and as efficient as the centralized interior-point solver.},

  abstract     = {Model predictive controllers use dynamics models to solve constrained optimal control problems. However, computational requirements for real-time control have limited their use to systems with low-dimensional models. Nevertheless, high-dimensional models arise in many settings, for example, discretization methods for generating finite-dimensional approximations to partial differential equations can result in models with thousands to millions of dimensions. In such cases, reduced-order models (ROMs) can significantly reduce computational requirements, but model approximation error must be considered to guarantee controller performance. In this article, a reduced-order model predictive control (ROMPC) scheme is proposed to solve robust, output feedback, constrained optimal control problems for high-dimensional linear systems. Computational efficiency is obtained by using projection-based ROMs, and guarantees on robust constraint satisfaction and stability are provided. The performance of the approach is demonstrated in simulation for several examples, including an aircraft control problem leveraging an inviscid computational fluid dynamics model with dimension 998 930.},

Based on a specific separation principle and self-learning mechanism, we develop an internal model-based controller that does not require a priori knowledge of reference and disturbance signals and it only assumes that the kernels of these signals are a family of exosystems with unknown parameters (e.g., amplitudes, frequencies, or time periods). The proposed control framework has a self-learning mechanism that extricates itself from requiring absolute position measurement nor precise knowledge of the feedforward kernel signals. By requiring the high-level task/trajectory planner to use the same class of kernels in constraining the trajectories, the proposed low-level controller is able to learn the desired trajectories, to suppress the disturbance signals, and to adapt itself to the uncertain plant parameters. The framework enables a plug-and-play control mechanism in both levels of control.},

In the discounted cost, infinite horizon setting, all of the known bounds can be arbitrarily large, as the discount factor approaches unity. These results seem to imply that a very large number of samples is required to achieve an epsilon-optimal policy. The objective of the present work is to introduce a new class of algorithms that have sample complexity uniformly bounded over all discount factors . One may argue that this is impossible, due to a recent min–max lower bound. The explanation is that these prior bounds concern value function approximation and not policy approximation. We show that the asymptotic covariance of the tabular Q-learning algorithm with an optimized step-size sequence is a quadratic function of a factor that goes to infinity, as discount factor approaches 1; an essentially known result. The new relative Q-learning algorithm proposed here is shown to have asymptotic covariance that is uniformly bounded over all discount factors.},

  abstract     = {This article addresses the problem of consistently identifying a single transfer function in a network of dynamic systems using only observational data. It is assumed that the topology is partially known, the forcing inputs are not measured, and that only a subset of the nodes outputs is accessible. The developed technique is applicable to scenarios encompassing confounding variables and feedback loops, which are complicating factors potentially introducing bias in the estimate of the transfer function. The results are based on the prediction of the output node using the input node along with a set of additional auxiliary variables which are selected only from the observed nodes. Similar prediction error methods provide only sufficient conditions for the appropriate choice of auxiliary variables and assume a priori information about the location of strictly causal operators in the network. In this article, such an a priori knowledge is not required. A most remarkable feature of our approach is that the conditions for the selection of the auxiliary variables are purely graphical. Furthermore, within single-output prediction methods, such conditions are proven to be necessary and sufficient to consistently identify all networks with a given topology. A fundamental consequence of this characterization is to enable the search of a set of auxiliary variables minimizing a suitable cost function for single-output prediction error identification. In the article, we suggest possible approaches to tackle such optimal identification problems.},

The proof is based on the Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional theorem combined with the homogeneous domination philosophy. Using the emulation approach, we design memoryless homogeneous state and output feedback controllers, respectively, achieving GSS of the time-delay closed-loop systems with severe nonlinearity. Extensions to a wider class of time-delay nonlinear systems in the Hessenberg form are also given.

For strongly convex and smooth objective functions, in expectation, DSGD asymptotically achieves the optimal network-independent convergence rate compared to centralized stochastic gradient descent. Our main contribution is to characterize the transient time needed for DSGD to approach the asymptotic convergence rate. Moreover, we construct a “hard” optimization problem that proves the sharpness of the obtained result. Numerical experiments demonstrate the tightness of the theoretical results.},

The feedback gain is selected online, and we provide two selection methods based on minimizing upper bounds on predicted costs. The chance constraint is defined as a discounted sum of violation probabilities on an infinite horizon. By penalizing violation probabilities close to the initial time and assigning violation probabilities in the far future with vanishingly small weights, this form of constraints allows for an MPC law with guarantees of recursive feasibility without a boundedness assumption on the disturbance. A computationally convenient MPC optimization problem is formulated using Chebyshev’s inequality, and we introduce an online constraint-tightening technique to ensure recursive feasibility. The closed-loop system is guaranteed to satisfy the chance constraint and a quadratic stability condition. With dynamic feedback gain selection, the closed-loop cost is reduced and conservativeness of Chebyshev’s inequality is mitigated. Also, a larger feasible set of initial conditions can be obtained. Numerical simulations are given to show these results.},

We model the agent’s behavior as a Markov decision process, express its intrinsic motivation as a reward function, which belongs to a finite set of possible reward functions, and consider the incentives as additional rewards offered to the agent. We first show that the behavior modification problem (BMP), i.e., the problem of synthesizing an incentive sequence that induces a desired agent behavior at minimum total cost to the principal, is PSPACE-hard. We then show that two NP-complete variants of the BMP can be obtained by imposing certain restrictions on the incentive sequences available to the principal. We also provide a sufficient condition on the set of possible reward functions under which the BMP can be solved via linear programming. Finally, we propose two algorithms to compute globally and locally optimal solutions to the NP-complete variants of the BMP.},

In addition, there is a nonpotential Bayesian game whose ex-ante agent game is potential. We also prove that there is one-to-one correspondence between pure Bayesian Nash equilibria (BNE) of Bayesian games (if one exists) and pure Nash equilibria (NE) of the resulting ex-ante agent games. Then, we provide a sufficient and necessary condition for a Bayesian game to have an ex-ante agent potential game. By using these results, one can transform pure BNE seeking in Bayesian games to pure NE seeking in their ex-ante agent games [by using the potential functions of the ex-ante agent games (if one exists)], where previously pure BNE seeking in Bayesian games by using potential functions can only be done in Bayesian potential games (BPGs). Particularly, we prove for two-player games that BPGs are exactly the Bayesian games having ex-ante agent potential games. Furthermore, by using the semi-tensor product of matrices, a potential equation for finite Bayesian games is developed. Based on the potential equation, algorithms for verifying potentiality and for searching pure BNE in finite Bayesian games are designed. Finally, the results are applied to a routing problem with incomplete information.},

  abstract     = {Checking uniform attractivity of a time-varying dynamic system without a strict Lyapunov function is challenging as it requires the characterization of the limiting behavior of a set of trajectories. In the context of hybrid nonlinear time-varying systems, characterizing such limiting or convergent behaviors is even harder due to the complexity stemming from both continuous-time variations as well as discrete-time jumps. In this article, an extension of the standard hybrid time domain is introduced to define limiting behaviors, using set convergence, when time approaches either positive infinity or negative infinity. In particular, it is shown how to characterize limiting behaviors under the condition that an output signal approaches zero. Such limiting behaviors and their associated limiting systems can be used to verify uniform global attractivity. Particularly, a generalization of the classic Krasovskii–LaSalle theorem is obtained for hybrid time-varying systems. Two examples are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the results.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we present a novel approach to reconstruct the topology of networked linear dynamical systems with latent nodes. The network is allowed to have directed loops and bi-directed edges. The main approach relies on the unique decomposition of the inverse of power spectral density matrix (IPSDM) obtained from observed nodes as a sum of sparse and low-rank matrices. We provide conditions and methods for decomposing the IPSDM into sparse and low-rank components. The sparse component yields moral graph (MG) associated with the observed nodes, and the low-rank component retrieves parents, children and spouses (the Markov Blanket) of the hidden nodes. The article provides necessary and sufficient conditions for the unique decomposition of a given skew symmetric matrix into sum of a sparse skew symmetric and a low-rank skew symmetric matrices. For a large class of systems, the unique decomposition of imaginary part of the IPSDM of observed nodes, a skew symmetric matrix, into the sparse and the low-rank components is sufficient to identify the MG of the observed nodes as well as the Markov Blanket of latent nodes. For a large class of systems, all spurious links in the MG formed by the observed nodes can be identified. Assuming conditions on hidden nodes required for identifiability, links between hidden and observed nodes can be reconstructed, thus retrieving the exact topology of the network from the IPSDM. Moreover, for finite data, we provide bounds on entry-wise distance between the true and the estimated IPSDMs.},

Under the nonlinear control scheme, the well-posedness of the nonlinear partial differential equation, which depends continuously on the initial value is investigated by means of the Faedo–Galerkin approximation and priori estimates.

While there exist many controllers that optimize certain criteria, such as energy consumption, comfort, or low wear, they are usually not able to guarantee safety at all times for constrained nonlinear systems affected by disturbances. Many controllers providing safety guarantees, however, have no optimal performance. The idea of this article is, therefore, to synthesize a formally correct controller that serves as a safety net for an unverified, optimal controller. This way, most of the time, the optimal controller is in charge and leads to a desired, optimal control performance. The safety controller constantly monitors the actions of the optimal controller and takes over if the system would become unsafe. The safety controller utilizes a novel concept of backward reachable set computation, where we avoid the need of computing underapproximations of reachable sets. We have further developed a new approach that analytically describes reachable sets, making it possible to efficiently maximize the size of the backward reachable set. We demonstrate our approach by a numerical example from autonomous driving.},

  abstract     = {This article considers a codesign problem for industrial networked control systems to ensure both stability and efficiency properties of such systems. This problem is particularly challenging due to the fact that wireless communications in industrial environments are not only subject to shadow fading, but also stochastically correlated with their surrounding environments. This article first introduces a novel state-dependent Markov channel (SD-MC) model that explicitly captures the state-dependent features of industrial wireless communication systems by defining the proposed model’s transition probabilities as a function of both environments’ states and transmission power. Under the SD-MC model, sufficient conditions on Maximum Allowable Transmission Interval are presented to ensure both asymptotic stability in expectation and almost sure asymptotic stability properties of a nonlinear control system with state-dependent fading channels . Based on these stability conditions, the codesign problem is then formulated as a constrained polynomial optimization problem (CPOP), which can be efficiently solved using semidefinite programming methods for the case of a two-state SD-MC model. The solutions to such a CPOP represent optimal control and power strategies that optimize the average expected joint costs in an infinite time horizon while respecting the stability constraints. For a general SD-MC model, this article further shows that suboptimal solutions can be obtained from linear programming formulations of the considered CPOP. Simulation results are given to illustrate the efficacy of the proposed codesign scheme.},

Our proposed methodology involves decomposition of interconnected systems into smaller subsystems and leverages the notion of control sub-barrier certificates of subsystems, enabling one to construct control barrier certificates of interconnected systems by employing some $\max$ -type small-gain conditions. The main goal is to synthesize hybrid controllers enforcing complex logic properties, including the ones represented by the accepting language of deterministic finite automata, while providing probabilistic guarantees on the satisfaction of given specifications in bounded-time horizons. To do so, we propose a systematic approach to first decompose high-level specifications into simple reachability tasks by utilizing automata corresponding to the complement of specifications. We then construct control sub-barrier certificates and synthesize local controllers for those simpler tasks and combine them to obtain a hybrid controller that ensures satisfaction of the complex specification with some lower bound on the probability of satisfaction. We finally apply our proposed techniques to a fully-interconnected Kuramoto network composed of 100 nonlinear oscillators.},

Due to the stochasticity in gradient observations, distributedness of local functions, and randomness of communication topologies, distributed algorithms with an exact convergence guarantee under fixed step-sizes have not been achieved yet. This work incorporates variance reduction scheme into the distributed stochastic gradient tracking algorithm, where local gradients are estimated by averaging across a variable number of sampled gradients. With an identically and independently distributed random network, we show that all agents’ iterates converge almost surely to the same optimal solution under fixed step-sizes. When the global cost function is strongly convex and the sample size increases at a geometric rate, we prove that the iterates geometrically converge to the unique optimal solution, and establish the iteration, oracle, and communication complexity. The algorithm performance, including rate and complexity analysis, are further investigated with constant step-sizes and a polynomially increasing sample size. Finally, the empirical algorithm performance are illustrated with numerical examples.},

  abstract     = {Communication compression techniques are of growing interests for solving the decentralized optimization problem under limited communication, where the global objective is to minimize the average of local cost functions over a multiagent network using only local computation and peer-to-peer communication. In this article, we propose a novel compressed gradient tracking algorithm (C-GT) that combines gradient tracking technique with communication compression. In particular, C-GT is compatible with a general class of compression operators that unifies both unbiased and biased compressors. We show that C-GT inherits the advantages of gradient tracking-based algorithms and achieves linear convergence rate for strongly convex and smooth objective functions. Numerical examples complement the theoretical findings and demonstrate the efficiency and flexibility of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs) can provide ancillary services to the power network by aiding existing frequency-control mechanisms. TCLs are, however, characterized by an intrinsic limit cycle behavior, which raises the risk that these could synchronize when coupled with the frequency dynamics of the power grid, i.e., simultaneously switch, inducing persistent and possibly catastrophic power oscillations. To address this problem, schemes with a randomized response time in their control policy have been proposed in the literature. However, such schemes introduce delays in the response of TCLs to frequency feedback that may limit their ability to provide fast support at urgencies. In this article, we present a deterministic control mechanism for TCLs such that those switch when prescribed frequency thresholds are exceeded in order to provide ancillary services to the power network. For the considered scheme, we provide analytic conditions, which ensure that synchronization is avoided. In particular, we show that as the number of loads tends to infinity, there exist arbitrarily long time intervals where the frequency deviations are arbitrarily small. Our analytical results are verified with simulations on the Northeast Power Coordinating Council 140-bus system, which demonstrate that the proposed scheme offers improved frequency response compared with existing implementations.},

  abstract     = {In this article, the finite-time stabilization problem is solved for a linear time-varying system with unknown control direction by exploiting a modified version of the classical extremum-seeking algorithm. We propose to use a suitable oscillatory input to modify the system dynamics, at least in an average sense, so as to satisfy a differential linear matrix inequality condition, which in turn guarantees that the system’s state remains inside a prescribed time-varying hyperellipsoid in the state space. The finite-time stability (FTS) of the averaged dynamics implies the FTS of the original system, as the distance between the original and the averaged dynamics can be made arbitrarily small by choosing a sufficiently high value of the dithering frequency used by the extremum-seeking algorithm. The main advantage of the proposed approach resides in its capability of dealing with systems with unknown control direction, and/or with a control direction that changes over time. Being FTS a quantitative approach, this article also gives an estimate of the necessary minimum dithering/mixing frequency provided, and the effectiveness of the proposed finite-time stabilization approach is analyzed by means of numerical examples.},

  abstract     = {Finite-dimensional observer-based controller design for PDEs is a challenging problem. Recently, such controllers were introduced for the one dimensional (1D) heat equation, under the assumption that one of the observation or control operators is bounded. This article suggests a constructive method for such controllers for 1D parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs) with both observation and control operators being unbounded. We consider the Kuramoto–Sivashinsky equation under either boundary or in-domain point measurement and boundary actuation in the presence of disturbances in the PDE and measurement. We employ a modal decomposition approach via dynamic extension, using eigenfunctions of a Sturm–Liouville operator. The controller dimension is defined by the number of unstable modes, whereas the observer dimension $N$ may be larger. We suggest a direct Lyapunov approach to the full-order closed-loop system, which results in a linear matrix inequality (LMI), for input-to-state stabilization (ISS) and guaranteed $L^2$ -gain, whose elements and dimension depend on $N$ . The value of $N$ and the decay rate are obtained from the LMI. We prove that the LMI is always feasible provided $N$ and the $L^2$ or ISS gains are large enough, thereby obtaining guarantees for our approach. Moreover, for the case of stabilization, we show that feasibility of the LMI for some $N$ implies its feasibility for $N+1$ . Numerical examples demonstrate the efficiency of the method.},

To do so, we reformulate the notions of safe diagnosability, prognosability, safe controllability by diagnosis, and safe controllability by prognosis in the context of strings. Moreover, we combine these notions to introduce the concept of safe controllability by diagnosis or prognosis, or simply DP-safe controllability. We show that a language can be DP-safe controllable even if it is not safe controllable either only by diagnosis or only by prognosis. Thus, the DP-safe controllability can be considered a generalization of the safe controllability concept found in the literature. If a DES is DP-safe controllable, to achieve fault tolerance using an active approach, reconfiguration actions could be forced based not only on online fault diagnosis, but also on online fault prognosis. Thus, our approach outperforms the previous ones, since it provides additional control options to keep the system away from forbidden zones and to switch from the nominal supervisor to a postfault-detection supervisor designed to achieve postfault performance objectives. Necessary and sufficient conditions for DP-safe controllability are presented and an example is used to illustrate the introduced concepts.},

As the first step toward this end, we propose a new method, which we show converges faster than other available options. As the second step toward our goal, we complement the proposed method with a fully distributed method for estimating the optimal step size that maximizes the convergence rate. We provide theoretical guarantees for the convergence of the resulting method in a neighborhood of the solution. We present numerical experiments showing that, when using the same step size, our method converges significantly faster than its rivals. Experiments also show that the distributed step-size estimation method achieves an asymptotic convergence rate very close to the theoretical maximum.},

This leads to advantages in terms of computational complexity that may be enormous in certain real applications.

A novel distributed cooperative navigation function based control strategy is proposed, which drives the MAS to a desired formation without any collision while counteracting the presence of unavoidable communication impairments originated by the wireless network. By recasting the formation stabilization problem into a consensus one and by combining the Lyapunov stability theory with Halanay’s lemma, uniformly ultimately bounded stability of the whole delayed closed-loop system is proved. In the special case of an obstacle-free environment, our approach guarantees exponential stability of the closed-loop networked system. The stability analysis also provides an estimation of the delay upper bound and allows to evaluate the stability margins with respect to the latencies that can be observed in practical application scenarios.

The presence of affine terms brings many difficulties on the exclusion of triggering Zeno behavior when ensuring asymptotic stability. We propose an event-triggered control strategy dynamically updated with triggering to solve this problem, in which the triggering condition is associated with the affine terms and given with a time-varying term that is updated at triggering instants. Based on the triggering strategy, the controllers for subsystems and a switching rule are designed to achieve asymptotic stability of the resulting closed-loop system. Moreover, due to the special feature of event-triggered SASs, a new method for proving the exclusion of Zeno behavior is given. Finally, the developed results are illustrated by an electric circuit example.},

It consists of an add-on unit, the feasibility governor (FG), that manipulates the reference command so as to ensure that the optimal control problem that underlies the MPC-feedback law remains feasible. Offline polyhedral projection algorithms based on multiobjective linear programming are employed to compute the set of feasible states and reference commands. Online, the action of the FG is computed by solving a convex quadratic program.

We show that the partial exponential stability of the averaged system implies that of the original one. We then apply the obtained criteria to the study of remote synchronization of Kuramoto–Sakaguchi oscillators coupled by a star network with two peripheral nodes. We show that detuning the natural frequency of the central mediating oscillator increases the robustness of the remote synchronization against phase shifts.

Measurements are affected by bounded errors so that they define feasible sets containing the unknown parameters to be estimated. The proposed algorithm requires each agent to compute a weighted average of its estimate and those of its neighbors and to project it onto a local feasible set.

Each sensor unit, represented by a node in an undirected and connected graph, collects some information about the state and communicates its own estimate with the neighbors. It is stipulated that this communication between sensor nodes connected by an edge is time-sampled randomly and for each edge, the sampling process is an independent Poisson counter. Our proposed filtering algorithm for each sensor node is a stochastic hybrid system: It comprises a continuous-time differential equation, and at random time instants when communication takes place, each sensor node updates its state estimate based on the information received by its neighbors. In this setting, we compute the expectation of the error covariance matrix for each unit which is governed by a matrix differential equation. To study the asymptotic behavior of these covariance matrices, we show that if the gain matrices are appropriately chosen and the mean sampling rate is large enough, then the error covariances practically converge to a constant matrix.},

With the solution of the regularized least-squares problem available in closed-form, the online algorithm is written as a linear dynamical system where the state is updated based on the previous estimate and based on the new available measurements.

The soft measurement technique is exploited in the filter design to overcome the difficulties resulting from the sensor-resolution-induced (SRI) uncertainty. The aim of the presented filtering problem is to construct the distributed filter over a sensor network such that in the presence of SRI uncertainty and stochastic nonlinearity, an upper bound on the filtering error covariance is guaranteed and subsequently minimized by appropriately designing the filer parameters at each time instant. Moreover, a matrix simplification method is utilized to tackle the difficulties stemming from the sparsity of sensor networks.

The notable feature of the proposed algorithm is that it only needs boundedness of the uncertainties, whereas boundedness of the derivatives of uncertainties is not demanded. Under the proposed ASOSM control scheme, the gain can be dynamically tuned, which avoids gain overestimation. The finite-time stability of the closed-loop ASOSM dynamics is proved via the Lyapunov theory. Finally, the simulation results are shown to validate the theoretical analysis.},

Each plant is modeled by a discrete-time stochastic linear system with measurements of each sensor transmitted to the corresponding remote estimator over a shared communication network when their securities are interdependent due to network-induced risks. A dynamic nonzero-sum game with asymmetric information is formulated in which each sensor subject to a resource budget constraint needs to decide whether to invest in security for sending data packets, taking the behaviors of other sensors into account. To overcome the difficulty in characterizing or computing the Nash equilibria (NE), the game with asymmetric information is transformed into another game with symmetric information such that the equilibrium of the original game can be obtained by solving the equilibrium of the new game. Under certain conditions, we devise a backward induction algorithm to obtain a subclass of NE of the original game, known as common information-based Markov perfect equilibria (CIBMPE).

However, under this approach, modeling inaccuracies may degrade the performance of closed-loop systems and cause violation or restriction of safety-critical constraints. This article presents an adaptive QP-CLBF approach for a class of nonlinear systems in the presence of parameter uncertainties with an unknown control coefficient. We begin by presenting a filtering-based concurrent learning (FCL) adaptive technique to guarantee simultaneous exponential convergence of system parameters and control coefficient. The proposed FCL extends and encompasses the baseline concurrent learning technique, which was developed to achieve exponential convergence of either system parameters exclusively or control coefficient while relying on the estimation of state derivatives using numerical smoothing. The proposed FCL adaptive method is then unified with a modified version of QP-CLBF to achieve exponential convergence of system parameters, control coefficient, and control Lyapunov and control barrier functions while establishing safety with the largest safe region. Under this unification, all results are exponential in the presence of modeling error without the need for numerical methods to estimate state derivatives. This is formally proven by employing a Lyapunov argument. Simulations are finally carried out to validate the theoretical results.},

In this article, each agent has a network to communicate with its controller and reference system, and all networks are independent and asynchronous and have local event-triggered mechanisms, which are based on local measurements and determine whether the local measurements need to be transmitted via the corresponding network. To address this scenario, we first implement the emulation-based approach to develop a novel hybrid model for the tracking control of networked multiagent systems.

Among other proposed methodologies, when opacity is violated, it can be enforced using insertion mechanisms, i.e., by inserting symbols before an actual system output (in real time as the system evolves) in order to replace observation sequences that lead to opacity violations with observation sequences that can be generated by system behavior that does not violate opacity. This article focuses on opacity enforcement in discrete-event systems modeled with finite-state automata and proposes an extended insertion mechanism that can enforce opacity in a practical manner to a wide class of systems by inserting symbols before and after an actual system output. This article also introduces event insertion constraints that require only certain specific symbols to be inserted before and after an actual system output.

Unlike STL, ReRiSITL allows to consider uncontrollable propositions that may model humans as well as random environmental events such as sensor failures. Additionally, ReRiSITL allows to incorporate risk measures, such as (but not limited to) the conditional value-at-risk, to measure the risk of violating certain spatial specifications. Second, we propose an algorithm to check if an ReRiSITL specification is satisfiable. For this purpose, we abstract the ReRiSITL specification into a timed signal transducer and devise a game-based approach.

The dynamic equation of the system is assumed to be affected by a bounded process noise. As to the available measurements, they are potentially corrupted by a noise of both dense and impulsive natures. The latter, in addition to being arbitrary in its form, need not be strictly bounded. In this setting, we construct the estimator as the set-valued map, which associates with the measurements the minimizing set of some appropriate performance functions. We consider a family of such performance functions, each of which yielding a specific instance of the proposed general estimation framework. It is then shown that the proposed class of estimators enjoys the property of resilience, i.e., it induces an estimation error, which, under certain conditions, is independent of the extreme values of the (impulsive) measurement noise. Hence, the estimation error may be bounded, while the measurement noise is virtually unbounded. Moreover, we provide several error bounds (in different configurations), whose expressions depend explicitly on the degree of observability of the system being observed and on the considered performance function. Finally, a few simulation results are provided to illustrate the resilience property.},

Agents following this algorithm are “independent learners”: they use only local controls, local cost realizations, and global state information, without access to controls of other agents.

Such problems are motivated by the recent swarm control technique that uses mean-field approximations to represent the collective effect of the swarm, wherein the mean-field density (especially its gradient) is usually used in feedback control design. In the first part, we formulate the density estimation problem as a filtering problem of the associated mean-field partial differential equation (PDE), for which we employ Kernel density estimation to construct noisy observations and use filtering theory of PDE systems to design an optimal (centralized) density filter. It turns out that the covariance operator of observation noise depends on the unknown density. Hence, we use approximations for the covariance operator to obtain a suboptimal density filter, and prove that both the density estimates and their gradient are convergent and remain close to the optimal one using the notion of input-to-state stability (ISS). In the second part, we continue to study how to decentralize the density filter such that each agent can estimate the mean-field density based on only its own position and local information exchange with neighbors. We prove that the local density filter is also convergent and remains close to the centralized one in the sense of ISS. Simulation results suggest that the centralized suboptimal density filter is able to generate convergent density estimates, and the local density filter is able to converge and remain close to the centralized filter.},

  abstract     = {The problem of global output tracking is addressed for stable minimum phase systems, with constant uncertain parameters and constant disturbances belonging to a known compact set, in the presence of input constraints such as amplitude saturation. The relative degree, the system order, and the sign of the high frequency gain are assumed to be known. A hybrid adaptive output feedback control is designed to achieve global asymptotic output tracking, provided that there exists an input within the input constraints capable of tracking exactly the output reference signal. By virtue of the hybrid control approach, the closed-loop system is linear within each time interval between parameter updating. Moreover, no information on input saturation is required by the controller. In addition to the standard assumptions in adaptive control design when inputs are unconstrained, further requirements on the reference signals, on system stability and on parameter bounds, are needed when inputs are constrained.},

The decisions are encoded in the equilibria of the system. The aim is to investigate this multiagent system when the signed graph representing the community is not structurally balanced and in particular as we vary its frustration, i.e., its distance to structural balance. The model exhibits bifurcations, and a “social effort” parameter, added to the model to represent the strength of the interactions between the agents, plays the role of bifurcation parameter in our analysis. We show that, as the social effort increases, the decision-making dynamics exhibit a pitchfork bifurcation behavior where, from a deadlock situation of “no decision” (i.e., the origin is the only globally stable equilibrium point), two possible (alternative) decision states for the community are achieved (corresponding to two nonzero locally stable equilibria). The value of social effort for which the bifurcation is crossed (and a decision is reached) increases with the frustration of the signed network.},

By using the average impulsive interval method, some sufficient Lyapunov-based conditions are established for the stability of impulsive time-delay systems, and the impacts of delay on the stability analysis method are further revealed. It is interesting to show that some unstable impulsive time-delay systems may be stabilized by increasing the time delay in continuous dynamics. More interestingly, it is proved that along with the increase of the delay within a certain range, the convergence rate of such impulsive time-delay systems also increases correspondingly. Further, a strict comparison principle for impulsive control systems with delay is established. Then by utilizing this comparison principle, it can be shown that for some stable impulsive systems with delay, under certain conditions, the stability is robust against any large but bounded delay. Compared with the previous results on delay-free impulsive systems, some potential impacts of delay on the stability are investigated. Particularly, the obtained results are extended to the case of impulsive control systems with hybrid impulses, which contain both stabilizing impulses and destabilizing impulses. Three illustrative examples are presented to reveal the potential impacts of delay on the stability of impulsive control systems.},

To properly account for the infrequent nature of these disturbances, we define a stochastic form of robustness. Under suitable assumptions, we prove that certain closed-loop systems subject to large, infrequent disturbances admit an SISS-Lyapunov function and are robust in this stochastic context. We apply these results to economic model predictive control (MPC) with a strictly dissipative nominal system and stage cost, which includes tracking MPC as a special case, and prove that economic MPC is robust to large, infrequent disturbances. Without dissipativity assumptions, we define and establish robust asymptotic performance for economic MPC. We present a simple tracking problem to illustrate the results of this work, and a production scheduling (economic MPC) problem, to demonstrate the relevance of this analysis to practical applications.},

For general smooth nonconvex problems, we show the almost sure and mean-squared convergence of GT-SAGA to a first-order stationary point and further describe regimes of practical significance, where it outperforms the existing approaches and achieves a network topology-independent iteration complexity, respectively. When the global function satisfies the Polyak–Łojaciewisz condition, we show that GT-SAGA exhibits linear convergence to an optimal solution in expectation and describe regimes of practical interest where the performance is network topology independent and improves upon the existing methods.

We show that while for structurally balanced networks, polarization to an extreme value of the opinion domain (the unit hypercube) always occurs regardless of the value of the bias, for structurally unbalanced networks, a stable state of indecision (corresponding to the centroid of the opinion domain) also appears, at least for small values of the bias.

When applied to a large-scale network, the continuation provides a PDE describing the evolution of a continuous-state approximation that respects the spatial structure of the original ODE. Our method is illustrated by multiple examples, including transport equations, Kuramoto equations, and heat diffusion equations. As a main example, we perform the continuation of a Newtonian system of interacting particles and obtain the Euler equations for compressible fluids, thereby providing an original solution to Hilbert’s sixth problem.

Risk awareness is in our framework captured by objective functions in which the risk neutral expectation is replaced by a risk function, a nonlinear functional of random variables that accounts for the controller&#39;s risk preferences. We state and prove a risk aware minimum principle that gives necessary and sufficient conditions for optimality of generalized control processes taking values on probability measures defined on a given action space. We show that going from the risk neutral to the risk aware case, the minimum principle is modified by the introduction of one additional real-valued stochastic process that acts as a risk adjustment factor. This adjustment process is explicitly given as the expectation, conditional on the filtration at the given time, of an appropriately defined functional derivative of the risk function evaluated at the random total cost. The control model we employ differs from standard relaxed controls, and we elaborate on the differences, and benefits and drawbacks, of the control types; we further give conditions under which the generalized control can be realized using a strict control process. We present an application of the results for a portfolio allocation problem and show that the risk awareness of the objective function gives rise to a risk premium term that is characterized by the risk adjustment process described above. This suggests uses of our results in e.g. pricing of risk modeled by generic risk functions in financial applications.},

The purpose of this article is to design a coherent feedback controller for a class of linear quantum systems suffering from Markovian jumping faults so that the closed-loop quantum system has both fault tolerance and $H^\infty$ disturbance attenuation performance. This article first extends the physical realization conditions from the time-invariant case to the time-varying case for linear stochastic quantum systems. By relating the fault-tolerant $H^\infty$ control problem to the dissipation properties and the solutions of Riccati differential equations, an $H^\infty$ controller for the quantum system is then designed by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities. In particular, an algorithm is employed to introduce additional quantum inputs and to construct the corresponding input matrices to ensure the physical realizability of the quantum controller. Also, we propose a real application of the developed fault-tolerant control strategy to quantum optical systems. A linear quantum system example from quantum optics, where the amplitude of the pumping field randomly jumps among different values due to the fault processes, can be modeled as a linear Markovian jumping system. It is demonstrated that a quantum $H^\infty$ controller can be designed and implemented using some basic optical components to achieve the desired control goal for this class of systems.},

Moreover, for a given transition system and an LTL formula, we prove that there exist both a universal TLT and an existential TLT via minimal and maximal reachability analysis, respectively. We show that the universal TLT is an underapproximation for the LTL formula and the existential TLT is an overapproximation. We provide sufficient conditions and necessary conditions to verify whether a transition system satisfies an LTL formula by using the TLT approximations. As a major contribution of this work, for a controlled transition system and an LTL formula, we prove that a controlled TLT can be constructed from the LTL formula via a control-dependent reachability analysis. Based on the controlled TLT, we design an online control synthesis algorithm, under which a set of feasible control inputs can be generated at each time step. We also prove that this algorithm is recursively feasible.

This article attempts to give an answer with focus on solving linear algebraic equations (LAEs) from the perspective of systems and control. By proposing an iterative method that integrates a learning control mechanism, a class of tracking problems for iterative learning control (ILC) is explored for the problem solving of LAEs. A trackability property of ILC is newly developed, by which analysis and synthesis results are established to disclose the equivalence between the solvability of LAEs and the controllability of discrete control systems. Hence, LAEs can be solved by equivalently achieving the perfect tracking tasks of resulting ILC systems via the classic state feedback-based design and analysis methods. It is shown that the solutions for any solvable LAE can all be calculated with different selections of the initial input. Moreover, the presented ILC method is applicable to determining all the least squares solutions of any unsolvable LAE. In particular, a deadbeat design is incorporated to ILC such that the solving of LAEs can be completed within finite iteration steps. The trackability property is also generalized to conventional two-dimensional ILC systems, which creates feedback-based methods, instead of commonly known contraction mapping-based methods, for the design and convergence analysis of ILC.},

For this time-invariant ESC, we propose a method to prove the closed-loop system has an asymptotically stable limit cycle. The method is based on a perturbation theorem for maps, and, unlike existing techniques that use averaging and singular perturbation tools, it is not limited to weakly nonlinear systems. We use a typical example system to show that our method does indeed establish asymptotic stability of the limit cycle with minimal amplitude. Utilizing the example, we provide a general guide for analytic computations that are required to apply our method. The corresponding Mathematica code is available as supplementary material.},

One reason for the usefulness of 1-contracting systems is that many interconnections of contracting subsystems yield an overall 1-contracting system. Here, we derive a new sufficient condition guaranteeing that the system obtained from the series interconnection of two subsystems is $k$ -contracting. This is based on a new formula for the $k$ th multiplicative and additive compounds of a block-diagonal matrix (BDM), which may be of independent interest.

As a single direction measurement provides a 2-D constraint, it has been widely accepted that at least two nonparallel reference directions should be measured, or the reference direction should change over time, to determine the attitude completely. This article uncovers an intriguing fact that the attitude can actually be estimated by using multiple measurements of a single, fixed reference direction, provided that the angular velocity and the direction measurements are resolved in appropriate frames, respectively. More specifically, after recognizing that the attitude uncertainties propagated over the left-trivialized stochastic kinematics are distinct from those over the right-trivialized one, stochastic attitude observability with single direction measurements is formulated by an information theoretic analysis. These are illustrated by experiments.},

Several methods have been proposed in the literature, and in this article, we propose a novel method based on interactive proofs in which trust between two agents is asserted by one agent demonstrating to the other that both follow the same mission plan. We formally represent the problem as a series of Markov decision processes and demonstrate that the formulation is complete and sound.

This information is randomly overheard by an eavesdropper. To reduce information leakage to the eavesdropper, previous studies have shown that by encoding the estimate with the acknowledgments (Acks), perfect secrecy can be achieved. However, this strategy greatly relies on the accuracy of the Acks and may easily fail if the Acks are compromised by cyberattacks. In this article, we tackle this issue by proposing to switch between sending an encoded state and sending the plain state to stay resilient against fake Acks. Specifically, we assume the Acks to be randomly attacked and derive recursive expressions for the minimum-mean-squared error estimates and error covariance matrices at the legitimate user and at the eavesdropper. Based upon this, we propose a transmission policy that depends on the probability of synchronization. We formulate a partially observable Markov decision process to model the evolution of the synchronization status and derive associated optimal transmission policies.

  abstract     = {Safety for dynamical systems is often posed as an invariance constraint, requiring the system trajectory to remain in some safe subset of the state-space for all time. This note presents new tools for studying reachability and set invariance for nondeterministic systems subject to a disturbance input using the theory of mixed-monotone dynamical systems. The vector field of a mixed-monotone system is characterized as being decomposable into increasing and decreasing components, which allows the dynamics to be embedded in a higher dimensional embedding system. Even though the original system is nondeterministic due to the unknown disturbance input, the embedding system has no disturbance and a single simulation of the embedding system provides bounds for reachable sets of the original dynamics. In this article, we present an efficient method for identifying robustly forward invariant and attractive sets for mixed-monotone systems by studying equilibria and their stability properties of the corresponding embedding system. We show how this approach can be applied to either the backward-time dynamics or a set of linearly transformed dynamics to establish different robustly forward invariant sets for the original dynamics, and we show also how periodic solutions to the embedding system establish invariant regions for the original dynamics as well. The findings of this work are demonstrated through two numerical examples and two case studies, including a five-dimensional planar quadrotor system.},

We consider the case, where both faults may occur simultaneously and through an identical dynamical relationship, a setting that is relevant to several application domains, including automotive driving, aviation, and chemical plants. The proposed filter architecture combines tools from model-based approaches in the control literature and regression techniques from machine learning. To this end, we view the regression operator through a system-theoretic perspective to develop operator bounds that are then utilized to derive performance bounds for the proposed estimation filter. In the case of constant, simultaneously, and identically acting additive and multiplicative faults, it can be shown that the estimation error converges to zero with an exponential rate. The performance of the proposed estimation filter in the presence of incipient faults is validated through an application on the lateral safety systems of SAE level 4 automated vehicles. The numerical results show that the theoretical bounds of this study are indeed close to the actual estimation error.},

The main idea of the proposed strategy is twofold: 1) the terminal constraint set and the corresponding detected-mode-dependent state feedback gain are determined by an offline “min–max” problem and 2) a dynamic perturbation is introduced into the control law to enlarge the feasible region, where estimator gains are derived offline with the aid of the matrix factorization technique, and the dynamic controller state is designed online to steer the system state belonging to the initial feasible region into the terminal constraint set. Finally, a simulation example regarding the dc motor device system is provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

The dynamics of the players are considered to be subject to unknown time-varying disturbances and unmodeled terms. Besides, the communication topology among the players suffers from attacks and time-varying communication delays. To find a Nash equilibrium for such games, a distributed robust Nash equilibrium seeking algorithm is proposed. By utilizing average dwell-time and time-ratio constraints to tackle the attacks, the closed-loop system is modeled as a hybrid system with memory. To analyze the stability of the distributed switched algorithm, a Lyapunov functional is constructed, by which we show the uniform global asymptotic stability of the equilibrium.

A network topology is critical in determining a collective behavior of a network dynamic system. For example, the convergence rate of a consensus behavior in a multiagent system relies on the eigenvalues of the Laplacian associated with the network topology. This article aims to analyze the influence of adding a reverse edge into a DAG on convergence rate. It reveals the existence of the so-called interfering reverse edges; adding one single edge in this category can reduce the so-called dominant convergence rate even for a large network. More specifically, a necessary and sufficient condition of an interfering reverse edge is explicitly constructed. According to the condition, a computationally efficient method is proposed to assess an interfering reverse edge.},

We propose the concept of average sampling interval (ASI), in which the constraint on the lower/upper bound of sampling intervals is removed to handle the sampling intervals from the holistic perspective. Then, in the framework of the input delay method, we transform the addressed system into an equivalent switched time-delay system subject to the impulsive effects that result from the truncated sampled-data control law. Interestingly, it is shown that the truncation of the sampled-data control input, which is an extension of the classical zero-order hold function, can play a stabilizing role in the presence of impulsive effects. Next, based on the ASI concept, the idea of average truncated length is introduced and the corresponding relaxed stability criteria are derived for the truncated sampled-data control systems. Particularly, the potential destabilizing impact of impulsive effects on the stability is theoretically revealed. It is also shown that under certain conditions, a truncated sampled-data system can remain stable if the magnitude of the impulsive effects is sufficiently small. Finally, two illustrative examples are presented to show the validity and also the advantages of the obtained results.},

By considering the influences of noise, packet dropouts, and logarithmic quantization on the channel input, the performance limitations of the networked systems are investigated by applying a two-degree-of-freedom (TDOF) control technique. The results obtained prove that the tracking and regulation performance is dependent not only on the position of the plant’s nonminimum phase zeros and unstable poles, but also on the directions. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that noise and quantization error have a negative influence on the control performance, and the design of the TDOF controller can eliminate the effect of packet dropouts on control performance.

  abstract     = {For linear time-invariant systems, the design of an optimal controller is a commonly encountered problem in many applications. Among all the optimization approaches available, the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) methodology certainly garners much attention and interest. As is well known, standard numerical tools in linear algebra are readily available to determine the optimal static LQR feedback gain matrix when all the system state variables are measurable. However, in various certain scenarios where some of the system state variables are not measurable, and consequent prescribed structural constraints on the controller structure arise, the optimization problem can become intractable due to the nonconvexity characteristics that can then be present. In such cases, some first-order methods have been proposed to cater to these problems, but all of these methods, if at all successful, are limited to linear convergence. To speed up the convergence, a second-order approach in the matrix space is essential, with appropriate methodology to solve the linear equality constrained static output feedback (SOF) problem with a suitably defined linear quadratic cost function. Thus, in this article, an efficient method is proposed in the matrix space to calculate the Hessian matrix by solving several Lyapunov equations. Then, a new optimization technique is applied to deal with the indefiniteness of the Hessian matrix. Subsequently, through Newton’s method with linear equality constraints, a second-order optimization algorithm is developed to effectively solve the constrained SOF LQR problem. Finally, two numerical examples are described, which demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed method.},

In contrast with the settings considered by robust control and fault-tolerant control, we consider undesirable but observable inputs of the same magnitude as controls since they are produced by a faulty actuator belonging to the system. The control inputs can then depend on these undesirable inputs. Building on our previous work, we focus on designing resilient systems able to withstand the loss of one or multiple actuators. Since resilience refers to the existence of a control law driving the state to the target, we naturally continue with the synthesis of such a control law.

The proposed secondary frequency control scheme does not require a priori information about system parameters and can achieve frequency synchronization within an ultimate bound in the presence of dominantly resistive and/or inductive line and load impedances, model parameter uncertainties, and time varying loads and disturbances. First, using Lyapunov theory, a feedback control is formulated based on the unknown dynamics of the microgrid. Next, a performance function is defined based on cumulative costs toward achieving convergence to the nominal frequency. The performance function is approximated by a critic neural network in real-time. An actor network is then simultaneously learning a parameterized approximation of the nonlinear dynamics and optimizing the approximated performance function obtained from the critic network. Furthermore, using the Lyapunov approach, the uniformly ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop frequency error dynamics and the networks&#39; weight estimation errors are shown.},

  abstract     = {It is still an open problem to synthesize control with input and output quantizations for nonlinear systems subject to mismatched parametric uncertainties via backstepping design. This is because 1) the output becomes discontinuous and nondifferentiable after quantization, making the conventional recursive backstepping design method unsuitable as the differentiation of the virtual control signals does not exist, while the existing backstepping-based quantized control method is only applicable to systems modeled in normal form or systems without mismatched uncertainties; 2) it is difficult to deal with the impacts of errors caused by output quantization when the virtual control laws contain time-varying estimates of unknown parameters; and 3) since only the quantized output signal is available, the effects of certain items related to unknown parameters in currently available observers become difficult to be explicitly addressed. In this article, we present a solution to this problem by employing a dynamic filtering technique to avoid differentiating virtual control signals in backstepping design, using the parameter projection technique to design the parameter estimator and proposing a new form of state observer to facilitate the development of output feedback control. It is shown that, with the derived adaptive backstepping control involving both input and output quantizations, all the closed-loop signals are ensured bounded and the control performance in terms of the mean square error is adjustable through properly choosing certain design parameters. The benefits and effectiveness of the proposed scheme are also validated by numerical simulation.},

  abstract     = {The coordinate transformation technique is a traditional method for solving the disturbance decoupling problem (DDP) of Boolean control networks (BCNs). But under this technique, the obtained conditions are not necessary for the solvability of DDP of original systems. Thus, this article investigates the DDP of Boolean networks (BNs) and BCNs in a new perspective. Based on the new definition of disturbance decoupling, the one-step evolutionary dynamic of states of BNs, shown as a table, is presented for solving the DDP. Besides, a matrix discriminant is introduced to use MATLAB to test whether a BN is disturbance decoupled. For discussing the solvability of DDP of BCNs, a truth matrix is constructed to provide a necessary and sufficient condition and find all possible state feedback controllers. It is worth noting that the computation complexity of the main results is lower than that of the existing results. Furthermore, two examples are given to show the validity and advantages of the main results.},

For a class of continuous lower-triangular systems, the linear controllers are designed. By invoking a vector Lyapunov function theory, there is no need to use the usual back-stepping technique and a quite number of inequality computations are avoided. For a class of continuous upper-triangular systems, the nested-saturation controllers are constructed. In this case, the use of a vector Lyapunov function theory also helps to reduce computational burden, and allows us to summarize a same group of parameter conditions guaranteeing both the reduction of saturated terms and the finite-time stability of the reduced system.},

We assume that the control dynamical system model is not available, and the only information about the system dynamics is available in the form of time-series data. We provide a convex formulation for the optimal control problem (OCP) of the nonlinear system. The convex formulation relies on the duality result in the dynamical system’s stability theory involving density function and Perron–Frobenius operator. We formulate the OCP as an infinite-dimensional convex optimization program. The finite-dimensional approximation of the optimization problem relies on the recent advances made in the Koopman operator’s data-driven computation, which is dual to the Perron–Frobenius operator. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the application of the developed framework.},

This case arises when the system’s transfer function matrix is not left-invertible. A special case of this problem can be solved using the constrained generalized continuous algebraic Riccati equation (CGCARE), when a certain condition on the input-cardinality of the Hamiltonian is satisfied. However, this condition is only a special case among many other possible cases. On the other hand, singular LQR problems with autonomous Hamiltonian systems have been well studied in the literature. In this article, we apply behavioral theoretic techniques to show that the general case of the singular LQR problem with nonautonomous Hamiltonian can be solved by a direct sum decomposition of the plant behavior, where one of the direct summands can be solved via CGCARE, while the other gives rise to an autonomous Hamiltonian system.},

The validation of the existing discrete distributed observer depends on the establishment of the communication network. In some practical applications, only the sensor network can be established among all agents. To handle such cases, we propose a sensory feedback-based discrete distributed observer, which depends on the relative output of neighboring agents. In contrast to existing results, the design of the discrete distributed observer and cooperative output regulation analysis should be conducted simultaneously. Resorting to the small-gain theorem, we develop a small-gain condition-based approach and a low-gain-based approach, respectively. By these two approaches, we demonstrate that the discrete distributed observer holds and the cooperative output regulation problem of heterogeneous discrete-time linear multiagent systems can be solved.},

Hence, this article will further consider the above-mentioned issue under the limited coding length. Different coding rules are designed for the quantized states and the adaptive quantizer’s parameters. The minimum bound of coding errors is explicitly given, which are dependent on the coding length and the coding range. Moreover, the relation between the coding length and the control performance is established, that is, the coding length has a direct effect on the convergent upper bound of the system state and the sliding domain around the specified sliding surface.

First, it is shown by a proposition that the moment asymptotic stability of the underlying system is equivalent to that of any regular accurate numerical scheme under simple conditions, which is convenient to be structured specially for SCSwSD. This kind of principle provides a way for inferring moment asymptotic stability of SCSwSD by numerical simulations logically. As the first application of the proposition, the accurate scheme construction procedure is introduced in a general framework and illustrated for the quasi-linear models, the mean square asymptotic stability of linear SCSwSD is investigated. The restriction to the upper bound of the sampling period is confirmed by the way. As the second application of the proposition, the almost sure stability of a kind of controlled system with sampled noise is analyzed via the discrete scheme approach. The concepts of accurate numerical computation and simulation (ANCS) are proposed. A distinctive character, sampled data based control (SDBC) only, for SDBC is reported and studied preliminarily based on ANCS and the equivalence proposition. Some important remarks are given as further analyses on related issues. Finally, numerical examples are given to illustrate the applications of the theoretical results.},

It is shown that sufficient and necessary conditions for consistent identification of a single transfer function based on a multi-input single-output prediction error method, are equivalent to the notion of minimum cut in an augmented graph resulted from systematically manipulating the graphical representation of the network. Then, the optimal set of auxiliary measurements minimizing the cost could be found using different approaches such as algorithms from graph theory (i.e., Ford-Fulkerson), distributed algorithms (i.e., push-relabel algorithm), or purely optimization based procedures (i.e., linear programming).

  abstract     = {This article presents a novel Jacobi-style iteration algorithm for solving the problem of distributed submodular maximization, in which multiple agents determine their strategies from the private sets so that a global, nonseparable submodular objective function is jointly maximized. Building on the multilinear extension of the submodular function, we expect to achieve the solution from a probabilistic, rather than deterministic, perspective, and thus, transfer the considered problem from the discrete domain into the continuous domain. Since it is observed that an unbiased estimation of the gradient of multilinear extension function can be obtained by sampling the agents’ local strategies, a projected stochastic gradient algorithm is proposed to solve the problem. Our algorithm enables simultaneous updates among all individual agents and guarantees to converge asymptotically to a desirable equilibrium solution. Such an equilibrium solution is shown to be at least $1/2$ suboptimal, which is comparable to the state-of-art in the literature. The convergence rate, which is characterized by the running average of gradient mapping, is proved to be $\mathcal {O}(1/T)$ , where $T$ is the number of iterations. Moreover, we further enhance the proposed algorithm by handling the scenario in which agents’ communication delays are present. The enhanced algorithm admits a more realistic distributed implementation of our approach. Finally, a movie recommendation task is conducted on a real-world movie rating dataset to validate the numerical performance of our algorithms.},

This article proposes an efficient global solution method for single-input optimal control problems for nonlinear dynamical systems with a potentially large number of states or complex dynamics via sum-of-squares polynomials and parallel computing. The method approximates the problem for a given arc sequence as a polynomial optimization problem that can be efficiently solved to global optimality via semidefinite programming. It is established that the difference between the cost obtained by the proposed method and the globally optimal cost of the original problem is bounded and depends on the polynomial approximation error.

This article proposes an approach for the online modulation of cyclic motions in robotic applications. For this purpose, we present an integrated programmable central pattern generator (CPG) for the online generation of the reference joint trajectory of a robotic system out of a library of desired periodic motions. The reference trajectory is then followed by the lower level controller of the robot. The proposed CPG generates a smooth reference joint trajectory convergence to the desired one while preserving the position and velocity joint limits of the robot. The proposed CPG consists of one novel bounded output programmable oscillator. We design the programmable oscillator for encoding the desired multidimensional periodic trajectory as a stable limit cycle. We also use the state transformation method to ensure that the oscillator’s output and its first time-derivative preserve the joint position and velocity limits of the robot. With the help of Lyapunov-based arguments, we prove that the proposed CPG provides the global stability and convergence of the desired trajectory. The effectiveness of the proposed CPG for trajectory generation is shown in a passive rehabilitation scenario on the Kuka iiwa robot arm, and also in walking simulation on a seven-link bipedal robot.},

  abstract     = {The $k$ multiplicative and $k$ additive compounds of a matrix play an important role in geometry, multilinear algebra, the asymptotic analysis of nonlinear dynamical systems, and in bounding the Hausdorff dimension of fractal sets. These compounds are defined for the integer values of $k$ . Here, we introduce generalizations called the $\alpha$ multiplicative and $\alpha$ additive compounds of a square matrix, with $\alpha$ real. We study the properties of these new compounds and demonstrate an application in the context of the Douady and Oesterlé theorem. Our results lead to a generalization of contracting systems to $\alpha$ -contracting systems, with $\alpha$ real. Roughly speaking, the dynamics of such systems contracts any set with the Hausdorff dimension larger than $\alpha$ . For $\alpha =1$ , they reduce to standard contracting systems. We demonstrate our theoretical results by designing a state-feedback controller for a classical chaotic system, guaranteeing the well-ordered behavior of the closed-loop system.},

To solve this problem, a novel augmented leader-following information fusion strategy is first proposed to collect measurements and system matrices. Then, a class of distributed state estimators is developed with bounded estimation error covariances. Further, a closed-form relation between the designed distributed estimator and the centralized estimator is established. It is found that the estimation performance of the former converges to that of the latter when the consensus gain tends to infinity. The proposed estimator is further extended to the fully distributed case by introducing an adaptive law for the consensus gain without using any global information. Moreover, it is shown that the designed estimator is applicable for systems with deterministic noise. Finally, several comparative numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the theoretical results.},

Its generalization to port-controlled Hamiltonian dynamics leads to characterize a new power conjugate output so recovering the concept of average passivation. On these bases, energy-management control strategies can be proposed. An energetic interpretation of the approach is confirmed by its formulation in the Dirac formalism.

  abstract     = {This article studies the feedback stabilization problem of the motion of a tank that contains an incompressible, Newtonian, viscous liquid. The control input is the force applied on the tank and the overall system consists of two nonlinear partial differential equations and two ordinary differential equations. Moreover, a spill-free condition is required to hold. By applying the control Lyapunov functional methodology, a set of initial conditions (state space) is determined for which spill-free motion of the liquid is possible by applying an appropriate control input. Semi-global stabilization of the liquid and the tank by means of a simple feedback law is achieved, in the sense that for every closed subset of the state space, it is possible to find appropriate controller gains, so that every solution of the closed-loop system initiated from the given closed subset satisfies specific stability estimates. The closed-loop system exhibits an exponential convergence rate to the desired equilibrium point. The proposed stabilizing feedback law does not require measurement of the liquid level and velocity profiles inside the tank and simply requires measurements of 1) the tank position error and tank velocity, 2) the total momentum of the liquid, and 3) the liquid levels at the tank walls. The obtained results allow an algorithmic solution of the problem of the spill-free movement and slosh-free settlement of a liquid in a vessel of limited height (such as water in a glass) by a robot to a prespecified position, no matter how full the vessel is.},

We illustrate and generalize the (0,1)-matrix completion in the following two scenarios: a demand-response application involving nonnegative integer matrices with different bounds across rows and an edge caching matching problem allowing row and column sums to vary within separately designated bounds. The applications require analytic characterizations of the supply adequacy and cause large-scale matrix completion instances. Remarkably, we derive a structure tensor and use its nonnegativity to establish a necessary and sufficient condition under which the considered matrix class is nonempty. The tensor condition can characterize the adequacy of a supply for a prescribed demand and facilitate identifying the minimum supplement to the supply so that the augmented supply becomes adequate when the adequacy gap is nonzero. Notably, we design a tensor-based combinatorial algorithm to construct a required matrix, representing a feasible resource allocation. Numerical simulations justify the efficiency of our approach.},

First, this article clarifies that a continuously differentiable Lyapunov function whose derivative is nonpositive can deduce asymptotic stability on the whole state space. Second, it is demonstrated that a new idea of rendering the derivative strictly negative allows one to detect a margin proving ISS of the SIR model. The accomplishment is based on the pursuit of a Lyapunov function that is not entirely separable into components. It contrasts with previously studied and popular Lyapunov functions that are proven to be incapable of assessing robustness properties such as ISS. Third, two types of feedback control laws are proposed for mass vaccination of immigrants and inhabitants by making use of the strict Lyapunov functions. One type modifies the other type by focusing on the reduction of peaks of the infected population within the ISS guarantees.},

  abstract     = {This article derives a solution to the appointed-time and attack-free bipartite synchronization problem for generic linear multiagent systems over directed switching networks accommodating cooperative and antagonistic interactions. Herein, appointed-time means that the settling time is independent of any parameters and is preappointed in advance. Attack-free requires that the communication channel is protected, which means that no state and observer information exchange is allowed, and only measured relative output information is available when designing protocols. Firstly, by virtue of Pontryagin’s maximum principle, a distributed appointed-time state-feedback protocol is developed for directed switching networks, which tackles the appointed-time bipartite synchronization problem from a motion-planning approach based on sampling measurements, but takes the risk of facing cyber attacks on information exchange channels. Then, to be free of network attacks, a sampling-based attack-free observer using relative output information is designed to observe bipartite synchronization errors at an appointed time. By combining the appointed-time state-feedback protocol with the sampling-based attack-free observer, an attack-free output-feedback protocol is developed without requiring the state or control input information. The attack-free appointed-time bipartite synchronization problem is thus resolved. Both the state-feedback and attack-free protocols show the ability of disturbance rejection to the nonidentical bounded disturbances. To our knowledge, it is the first time to solve the appointed-time and attack-free bipartite synchronization problem for generic linear multiagents based on state- and output-feedback information, respectively. Finally, simulations verify the effectiveness of the two protocols.},

We propose a new efficient belief propagation type algorithm over tree graphs with polynomial computational complexity as well as a global convergence guarantee. This is in contrast to previous methods that either exhibit prohibitive complexity as the population grows or do not guarantee convergence. Our method is based on optimal transport, or more specifically, multimarginal optimal transport theory. In particular, we consider an inference problem with aggregate observations, that can be seen as a structured multimarginal optimal transport problem where the cost function decomposes according to the underlying graph. Consequently, the celebrated Sinkhorn/iterative scaling algorithm for multi-marginal optimal transport can be leveraged together with the standard belief propagation algorithm to establish an efficient inference scheme which we call Sinkhorn belief propagation (SBP). We further specialize the SBP algorithm to cases associated with hidden Markov models due to their significance in control and estimation. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm on applications such as inferring population flow from aggregate observations. We also show that in the special case where the aggregate observations are in Dirac form, our algorithm naturally reduces to the standard belief propagation algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Reinforcement learning aims to find policies that maximize an expected cumulative reward in Markov decision processes with unknown transition probabilities. Policy gradient (PG)-algorithms use stochastic gradients of the value function to update the policy. A major drawback of PG-algorithms is that they are limited to episodic tasks (multiple finite-horizon trajectories) unless stringent stationarity assumptions are imposed on the trajectories. Hence, they need restarts and cannot be fully implemented online, which is critical for systems need to adapt to new tasks and/or environments in deployment. Moreover, the standard stationary formulation ignores transient behaviors. This motivates our study of discounted MDPs of infinite horizon without restarts. However, it is unknown if in this case following stochastic PG-type estimates would improve the policy. The main result of this work is to establish that when policies belong to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), and the kernel is selected properly, then these PG-estimates are ascent directions for the value function conditioned to any arbitrary initial point. This allows us to prove convergence of our online algorithm to the local optima. A numerical example shows that an agent running our online algorithm learns to navigate and succeeds in a surveillance task that requires looping between two goal locations. This example corroborates our theoretical findings about the ascent directions of subsequent stochastic gradients. It also shows how our online algorithm guides the agent through a continuing cyclic trajectory that does not comply with the standard stationarity assumptions in the literature for non-episodic training.},

  abstract     = {We consider an environmentwhere players need to decide whether to buy a certain product (or adopt a technology) or not. The product is either good or bad, but its true value is unknown to the players. Instead, each player has her own private information on its quality. Each player can observe the previous actions of other players and estimate the quality of the product. A classic result in the literature shows that in similar settings, informational cascades occur, where learning stops for the whole network and players repeat the actions of their predecessors. In contrast to this literature, in this paper, players get more than one opportunity to act. In each turn, a player is chosen uniformly at random from all the players and can decide to buy the product and leave the market or wait. Her utility is the total expected discounted reward, and thus, myopic strategies may not constitute equilibria. We provide a characterization of perfect Bayesian equilibria (PBEs) with forward-looking strategies through a fixed-point equation of dimensionality that grows only quadratically with the number of players. Using this tractable fixed-point equation, we show the existence of a PBE and characterize PBEs with threshold strategies. Based on this characterization, we study informational cascades in two regimes. First, we show that for a discount factor $\delta$ strictly smaller than 1, informational cascades happen with high probability as the number of players $N$ increases. Furthermore, only a small portion of the total information in the system is revealed before a cascade occurs. Second, and more surprisingly, we show that for a fixed $N$ , and for a sufficiently large $\delta &amp;lt; 1$ , when the product is bad, there exists an equilibrium where an informational cascade can happen only after at least half of the players revealed their private information, and consequently, the probability for a “bad cascade” where all the players buy the product vanishes exponentially with $N$ . Finally, when $\delta =1$ and the product is bad, there exists an equilibrium where informational cascades do not happen at all.},

  abstract     = {This article deals with the input–output finite-time stability (IO-FTS) of linear discrete-time systems. In current control science, discrete-time systems play a very important role in many engineering contexts. Moreover, many discrete-time control problems are defined over a finite -interval of time; therefore, the development and application of finite-time control methodologies is of particular relevance. The first contribution of this article is a pair of necessary and sufficient conditions for IO-FTS. The former involves the solution of a set of generalized difference Lyapunov equations; the latter allows one to establish the feasibility of an optimization problem by solving a set of difference linear matrix inequalities (DLMIs). The second contribution of this article is a theorem for IO finite-time stabilization via state feedback, followed by a more general one for stabilization via output feedback. Both conditions are necessary and sufficient, and lead to optimization problems cast in the form of DLMIs. The applicability of the devised results is illustrated through a numerical example.},

We propose a framework based on a notion of stochastic simulation functions , using which one can quantify the probabilistic distance between original interconnected stochastic switched systems and their finite MDPs by leveraging dissipativity-type compositional conditions. We show that the proposed compositionality conditions can enjoy the structure of the interconnection topology and be potentially fulfilled independently of the number or gains of subsystems. We also propose an approach to construct finite MDPs together with their corresponding stochastic simulation functions for nonlinear stochastic switched systems satisfying some incremental passivity property. We show that for a particular class of nonlinear stochastic switched systems whose nonlinearities satisfy an incremental quadratic inequality, the aforementioned property can be readily checked by some linear matrix inequalities. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed results, we apply our approaches to the following two different case studies: a road traffic network, and a fully interconnected network of nonlinear switched systems accepting different dissipativity properties.},

Our scheme relies on the data-driven system parameterization provided by the fundamental lemma of Willems et al. We use new input–output measurements online to update the data, exploiting local linear approximations of the underlying system. We prove that our MPC scheme, which only requires solving strictly convex quadratic programs online, ensures that the closed loop (practically) converges to the (unknown) optimal reachable equilibrium that tracks a desired output reference while satisfying polytopic input constraints. As intermediate results of independent interest, we extend the fundamental lemma to affine systems and we derive novel robustness bounds w.r.t. noisy data for the open-loop optimal control problem, which are directly transferable to other data-driven MPC schemes in the literature. The applicability of our approach is illustrated with a numerical application to a continuous stirred tank reactor.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we develop a tracking model predictive control (MPC) scheme for nonlinear systems using the linearized dynamics at the current state as a prediction model. Under reasonable assumptions on the linearized dynamics, we prove that the proposed MPC scheme exponentially stabilizes the optimal reachable equilibrium w.r.t. a desired target setpoint. Our theoretical results rely on the fact that, close to the steady-state manifold, the prediction error of the linearization is small, and hence, we can slide along the steady-state manifold toward the optimal reachable equilibrium. The closed-loop stability properties mainly depend on a cost matrix, which allows us to trade off performance, robustness, and the size of the region of attraction. In an application to a nonlinear continuous stirred tank reactor, we show that the scheme, which only requires solving a convex quadratic program online, has comparable performance to a nonlinear MPC scheme while being computationally significantly more efficient. Furthermore, our results provide the basis for controlling nonlinear systems based on data-dependent linear prediction models, which we explore in our companion paper.},

When the scaling satisfies certain conditions, we prove its convergence property without assuming strong convexity. Even the convergence rate can become exponential when the scaling grows exponentially.

Aiming at improving communication efficiency and control performance, a novel dynamic-memory event-triggered protocol is proposed, and the resulting system can be transformed into a time-delay system. By considering an asynchronous memory-based output-feedback control law, whose asynchronization can be modeled by a nonhomogeneous hidden semi-Markov model, some parameter-dependent sufficient criteria are forwarded to ensure the mean-square exponential stability of the closed-loop system.

  abstract     = {A linear dynamical system is called $k$ -positive if its dynamics maps the set of vectors with up to $k-1$ sign variations to itself. For $k=1$ , this reduces to the important class of positive linear systems. Since stable positive linear time-invariant systems always admit a diagonal quadratic Lyapunov function, i.e., they are diagonally stable, we may expect that this holds also for stable $k$ -positive systems. We show that, in general, this is not the case both in the continuous-time and discrete-time (DT) case. We then focus on DT $k$ -positive linear systems and introduce the new notion of the DT $k$-diagonal stability . It is shown that this is a necessary condition for the standard DT diagonal stability. We demonstrate an application of this new notion to the analysis of a class of DT nonlinear systems.},

  abstract     = {An unscented Kalman filter (UKF) for matrix Lie groups is proposed where the time propagation of the state is formulated on the Lie algebra. This is done with the kinematic differential equation of the logarithm, where the inverse of the right Jacobian is used. The sigma points can then be expressed as logarithms in vector form, and time propagation of the sigma points and the computation of the mean and the covariance can be done on the Lie algebra. The resulting formulation is to a large extent based on logarithms in vector form and is, therefore, closer to the UKF for systems in $\mathbb {R}^n$ . This gives an elegant and well-structured formulation, which provides additional insight into the problem, and which is computationally efficient. The proposed method is in particular formulated and investigated on the matrix Lie group $SE(3)$ . A discussion on right and left Jacobians is included, and a novel closed-form solution for the inverse of the right Jacobian on $SE(3)$ is derived, which gives a compact representation involving fewer matrix operations.

We show that, by incorporating the recently introduced dynamic regressor extension and mixing procedure to a classical gradient-descent algorithm, improved convergence properties can be achieved. In particular, it is shown that with this modification sufficient conditions for global convergence of all the estimators is that one of the sensors receives enough information to generate a consistent estimate and that this sensor is “well-connected.” The main feature of this result is that the excitation condition imposed on this distinguished sensor is strictly weaker than the classical persistent excitation requirement. The connectivity assumption is also very mild, requiring only that the union of the edges of all connectivity graphs over any time interval with an arbitrary but fixed length contains a spanning tree rooted at the information-rich node. In the case of nonswitching topologies, this assumption is satisfied by strongly connected graphs, and not only by them.},

Most existing approaches for data-driven dissipativity, however, guarantee the dissipativity condition only over a finite-time horizon and provide weak or no guarantees on robustness in the presence of noise. In this article, we present a framework for verifying dissipativity properties from measured data with desirable guarantees. We first consider the case of input-state measurements, where we provide computationally attractive conditions in the presence of process noise. We extend this approach to input–output data, where similar results hold in the noise-free case, and finally provide results for the case of noisy input–output trajectories.},

Successive relaxation is a popular technique that can be applied to solve a fixed point equation. It has been shown in the literature that under a special structure of the MDP, successive overrelaxation technique computes the optimal value function faster than standard value iteration. In this article, we propose a second-order value iteration procedure that is obtained by applying the Newton–Raphson method to the successive relaxation value iteration scheme. We prove the global convergence of our algorithm to the optimal solution asymptotically and show the second-order convergence.

  abstract     = {Although rich collection of research results on event-triggered control exist, no effort has ever been made in integrating state/output triggering and controller triggering simultaneously with backstepping control design. The primary objective of this article is, by using intermittent output signal only, to build a backstepping adaptive event-triggered feedback control for a class of uncertain nonlinear systems. To do so, we need to tackle three technical obstacles. First, the nature of the event triggering makes the transmitted output signal discontinuous, rendering the regular recursive backstepping design method inapplicable as the repetitive differentiation of virtual control signals is literally undefined. Second, the effects arisen from the event-triggering action must be properly accommodated, but the current compensating method only works for systems in normal form, thus a new method needs to be developed in order to handle nonnormal form systems. Third, as only intermittent output signal is available, and at the same time, the impacts of certain terms containing unknown parameters (arising from event triggering) need to be compensated, it is rather challenging to design a suitable state observer. To circumvent these difficulties, we employ the dynamic filtering technique to avoid the differentiation of virtual control signals in the backstepping design, construct a new compensation scheme to deal with the effects of output triggering, and build a new form of state observer to facilitate the development of output feedback control. It is shown that, with the derived adaptive backstepping output-triggered control, all the closed-loop signals are ensured bounded and the transient system performance in the mean square error sense can be adjusted by appropriately adjusting design parameters. The benefits and effectiveness of the proposed scheme are also validated by numerical simulation.},

  abstract     = {This article considers the distributed nonconvex optimization problem of minimizing a global cost function formed by a sum of local cost functions by using local information exchange. We first consider a distributed first-order primal–dual algorithm. We show that it converges sublinearly to a stationary point if each local cost function is smooth and linearly to a global optimum under an additional condition that the global cost function satisfies the Polyak–Łojasiewicz condition. This condition is weaker than strong convexity, which is a standard condition for proving linear convergence of distributed optimization algorithms, and the global minimizer is not necessarily unique. Motivated by the situations where the gradients are unavailable, we then propose a distributed zeroth-order algorithm, derived from the considered first-order algorithm by using a deterministic gradient estimator, and show that it has the same convergence properties as the considered first-order algorithm under the same conditions. The theoretical results are illustrated by numerical simulations.},

The considered class of nonlinear systems is such that an equivalent local polytopic model is obtained. By following the codesign approach, it is performed the simultaneous design of the dynamic event-triggering mechanism (ETM) and the gain-scheduled controller parameterized in terms of state-dependent scheduling functions. As the state information is only available to the controller at specific instants determined by the ETM, the scheduling functions of controller and plant polytopic model are asynchronous. To cope with this drawback, the trigger function of the dynamic ETM is appropriately defined to mitigate the influence of asynchronous scheduling functions in the Lyapunov stability-based analysis, allowing to derive a less conservative codesign condition. A convex optimization problem with linear matrix inequality constraints is proposed to perform the codesign and to enlarge the interevent times. Also, it is shown that there exists a lower bound for the interevent times, which prevents Zeno behavior. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the advantages of the proposed dynamic event-triggered control codesign approach over emulation-based approach and its static counterpart.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and robotics, deploying a large swarm of networked robots has foreseeable applications in the near future. Existing research in swarm robotics has mainly followed a bottom-up philosophy with predefined local coordination and control rules. However, it is arduous to verify the global requirements and analyze their performance. This motivates us to pursue a top–down approach, and develop a provable control strategy for transporting a robotic swarm to achieve a desired global configuration. Specifically, we use mean-field partial differential equations (PDEs) to model the swarm and control its mean-field density (i.e., probability density) over a bounded spatial domain using mean-field feedback. The presented control law uses density estimates as feedback signals and generates corresponding velocity fields that, by acting locally on individual robots, guide their global distribution to a target profile. The design of the velocity field is therefore centralized, but the implementation of the controller can be fully distributed—individual robots sense the velocity field and derive their own velocity control signals accordingly. The key contribution lies in applying the concept of input-to-state stability (ISS) to show that the perturbed closed-loop system (a nonlinear and time-varying PDE) is locally ISS with respect to density estimation errors. The effectiveness of the proposed control laws is verified using agent-based simulations.},

Accordingly, the sensors are constructed, of which the form is consistent with that of state feedback controllers in the designed pinning control. Since this pinning control approach only utilizes node-to-node message communication instead of global state space information, the time complexity is dramatically reduced from $O(2^{2n})$ to $O(n^2+n2^d)$ , where $n\, {\text{and}}\, d$ are respectively the node number of the considered BN and the largest in-degree of vertices in its network structure.

The criterion on the design of optimal input is characterized based on a nonconvex fractional programming problem at each time instant, which is shown to be efficiently solved within a convex optimization framework.

An event-triggered attitude consensus protocol and event-triggered condition are proposed based on the axis–angle attitude representation. The fixed-time attitude consensus is reached if the initial attitudes lie in local regions on the attitude configuration space. The theoretical results reveal that the settling time is related to the interevent interval and the algebraic connectivity of the topology graph.

In this article, we present a simple distributed gradient-based optimization framework and an associated algorithm. Convergence to a minimum of a given objective is shown under mild conditions on the network topology and objective. A key feature of our approach is that we merely assume that the messages sent reach the intended receiver, possibly delayed, with some positive probability. To the best of authors’ knowledge, ours is the first analysis under such weak general network conditions. We also discuss in detail the verifiability of the assumptions involved. This article also makes a technical contribution in terms of the allowed class of objective functions. Specifically, we present an analysis wherein the objective function is such that its sample-gradient is merely locally Lipschitz continuous.

In this article, we develop a composite guiding vector field via the use of smooth bump functions and provide theoretical guarantees that the integral curves of the vector field can follow an arbitrary sufficiently smooth desired path and avoid collision with obstacles of arbitrary shapes. These two behaviors are reactive since path (re)planning and global map construction are not involved.

Unlike the traditional switching signal design with DoS attack, some challenges arise in the joint influence on the constraints of DoS duration/frequency, and the asynchronous behavior caused by the controller and the subsystem mode. To this end, a novel multiple Lyapunov function involving the joint effects of DoS attack and controller mode is constructed. This allows that there are no events between two consecutive switching instants. By incorporating the dwell-time switching signal with the event-triggered scheme, the considered system can be globally exponentially stabilizable when the frequency and duration of DoS attack meet certain requirements. It also shows that apart from the codesign associated with the event-triggered parameters with controller gain, the maximum allowable sampling period can be offline calculated. Moreover, the Zeno behavior is eliminated by calculating a lower bound of the event-triggered interval, over which the DoS attack is inactive. Finally, simulations are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {We develop a second order primal-dual method for optimization problems in which the objective function is given by the sum of a strongly convex twice differentiable term and a possibly nondifferentiable convex regularizer. After introducing an auxiliary variable, we utilize the proximal operator of the nonsmooth regularizer to transform the associated augmented Lagrangian into a function that is once, but not twice, continuously differentiable. The saddle point of this function corresponds to the solution of the original optimization problem. We employ a generalization of the Hessian to define second-order updates on this function and prove global exponential stability of the corresponding differential inclusion. Furthermore, we develop a globally convergent customized algorithm that utilizes the primal-dual augmented Lagrangian as a merit function. We show that the search direction can be computed efficiently and prove quadratic/superlinear asymptotic convergence. We use the $\ell _1$ -regularized model predictive control problem and the problem of designing a distributed controller for a spatially invariant system to demonstrate the merits and the effectiveness of our method.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we propose a new approach to design globally convergent reduced-order observers for nonlinear control systems via contraction analysis and convex optimization. Despite the fact that contraction is a concept naturally suitable for state estimation, the existing solutions are either local or relatively conservative when applying to physical systems. To address this, we show that this problem can be translated into an offline search for a coordinate transformation after which the dynamics is (transversely) contracting. The obtained sufficient condition consists of some easily verifiable differential inequalities, which, on one hand, identify a very general class of “detectable” nonlinear systems, and on the other hand, can be expressed as computationally efficient convex optimization, making the design procedure more systematic. Connections with some well-established approaches and concepts are also clarified in this article. Finally, we illustrate the proposed method with several numerical and physical examples, including polynomial, mechanical, electromechanical, and biochemical systems.},

By representative we mean a control in the time domain that leads by sliding Fourier decomposition to exactly the same harmonic control. Harmonic controls that do not have such representatives lead to erroneous results in practice. The main results of this article are: A one-to-one correspondence between ad hoc functional spaces guaranteeing the existence of a representative, a strict equivalence between the Caratheorody solutions of a differential system and the solutions of the associated harmonic differential model, and as a consequence, a general harmonic framework for linear time periodic systems and bilinear affine systems. The proposed framework allows to design globally stabilizing harmonic control laws. We illustrate the proposed approach on a single-phase rectifier bridge. Through this example, we show how one can design stabilizing control laws that guarantee periodic disturbance rejection and low harmonic content.},

Each of these targets has an internal state that evolves with linear stochastic dynamics. The agents can observe these states, and the observation quality is a function of the distance between the agent and a given target. The goal is then to minimize the mean squared estimation error of these target states. We approach the problem from an infinite horizon perspective, where we prove that, under some natural assumptions, the covariance matrix of each target converges to a limit cycle. The goal, therefore, becomes to minimize the steady-state uncertainty. Assuming that the trajectory is parameterized, we provide tools for computing the steady-state cost gradient. We show that, in 1-D (one dimensional) environments with bounded control and nonoverlapping targets, when an optimal control exists it can be represented using a finite number of parameters. We also propose an efficient parameterization of the agent trajectories for multidimensional settings using Fourier curves. Simulation results show the efficacy of the proposed technique in 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D scenarios.},

We develop a first-order inexact augmented Lagrangian (AL) scheme for computing an optimal solution $x^*$ corresponding to $\theta ^*$ while simultaneously learning $\theta ^*$ . In particular, we derive rate statements for such schemes when the penalty parameter sequence is either constant or increasing and derive bounds on the overall complexity in terms of proximal gradient steps when AL subproblems are inexactly solved via an accelerated proximal gradient scheme.

Specifically, we work on two different frameworks of interval constraints, viz., the first one that the node states are constrained in their own constraint intervals and the second one that the node states are constrained in their neighbors’ constraint intervals. For both of the frameworks, we provide a complete solution to the equilibrium seeking problem by resolving a system of nonlinear equations. It is proved that if the underlying graph is strongly connected and the intersection of constraint intervals is empty, then there exists a unique equilibrium point; and if the intersection is nonempty, then there exist multiple equilibrium points, all of which lead to state consensus. We also establish several conditions for the local stability of the unique equilibrium point (corresponding to the case with empty intersection of constraint intervals) or local constraint consensus (corresponding to the case with nonempty intersection of constraint intervals) by invoking Lyapunov’s indirect method. Characterization of the global behavior of such a second-order multiagent system is technically rather challenging at this stage. As a first step toward this end, we show in two special cases that global convergence to the unique equilibrium point or state consensus can be guaranteed by employing Lyapunov stability theory and robust analysis techniques. Finally, some numerical examples are provided to illustrate the theoretical findings.},

First, the article considers optimization of nonsmooth, nonconvex objective functions. It is shown that DGF converges to critical points in this setting. The article then considers the problem of avoiding saddle points. It is shown that if agents’ objective functions are assumed to be smooth and nonconvex, then DGF can only converge to a saddle point from a zero-measure set of initial conditions. To establish this result, the article proves a stable manifold theorem for DGF, which is a fundamental contribution of independent interest.

  abstract     = {In this article, we stabilize a discrete-time Markov process evolving on a compact subset of $\mathbb {R}^d$ to an arbitrary target distribution that has an $L^\infty (\cdot)$ density and does not necessarily have a connected support on the state space. We address this problem by stabilizing the corresponding Kolmogorov forward equation, the mean-field model of the system, using a density-dependent transition Kernel as the control parameter. Our main application of interest is controlling the distribution of a multiagent system in which each agent evolves according to this discrete-time Markov process. To prevent agent state transitions at the equilibrium distribution, which would potentially waste energy, we show that the Markov process can be constructed in such a way that the operator that pushes forward measures is the identity at the target distribution. In order to achieve this, the transition kernel is defined as a function of the current agent distribution, resulting in a nonlinear Markov process. Moreover, we design the transition kernel to be decentralized in the sense that it depends only on the local density measured by each agent. We prove the existence of such a decentralized control law that globally stabilizes the target distribution. Furthermore, to implement our control approach on a finite $N$ -agent system, we smoothen the mean-field dynamics via the process of mollification . We validate our control law with numerical simulations of multiagent systems with different population sizes. We observe that as $N$ increases, the agent distribution in the $N$ -agent simulations converges to the solution of the mean-field model, and the number of agent state transitions at equilibrium decreases to zero.},

In this context, two DoS-induced challenges emerge in the design of resilient encoding schemes, namely, the coupling between encoding strategies of different signals, and the synchronization between the encoder and decoder. These challenges are addressed by a novel proposed structure based on a deadbeat controller as well as a delicate transmission protocol for the input and output channels, and codesigned leveraging the controllability index. When both input and output channels are subject to DoS attacks and quantization, the proposed structure is shown able to decouple the encoding schemes for input, output, and estimated output signals. This property is further corroborated by designing encoding schemes as well as conditions ensuring exponential stability of the closed-loop system. On the other hand, when only the output channel is subject to network attack phenomena, the proposed structure can achieve exponential stabilization without acknowledgment (ACK) signals, in contrast to existing ACK-based results. Finally, a numerical example is given to demonstrate the practical merits of the proposed theoretical and practical approach.},

  abstract     = {Numerous state-feedback and observer designs for nonlinear dynamic systems (NDS) have been developed in the past three decades. These designs assume that NDS nonlinearities satisfy one of the following function set classifications: bounded Jacobian, Lipschitz continuity, one-sided Lipschitz, quadratic inner-boundedness, and quadratic boundedness. These function sets are characterized by constant scalars or matrices bounding the NDS’ nonlinearities. These constants depend on the NDS’ operating region, topology, and parameters and are utilized to synthesize observer/controller gains. Unfortunately, there is a near-complete absence of algorithms to compute such bounding constants. In this article, we develop analytical and computational methods to compute such constants. First, for every function set classification, we derive analytical expressions for these bounding constants through global maximization formulations. Second, we utilize a derivative-free interval-based global maximization algorithm based on the branch-and-bound framework to numerically obtain the bounding constants. Third, we showcase the effectiveness of our approaches to compute the corresponding parameters on some NDS such as highway traffic networks and synchronous generator models.},

The basis of our results is a new characterization of the lower bound on the minimum total-rate achieved by sequential codes subject to a total (across time) distortion constraint and a computational algorithm that allocates optimally the rate-distortion, for a given distortion level, at each instant of time and any fixed finite-time horizon. The idea behind this characterization facilitates the derivation of analytical , nonasymptotic , and finite-dimensional lower and upper bounds in two control-related scenarios: a) A parallel time-varying Gauss–Markov process with identically distributed spatial components that are quantized and transmitted through a noiseless channel to a minimum mean-squared error decoder; and b) a time-varying quantized linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) closed-loop control system, with identically distributed spatial components and with a random data-rate allocation. Our nonasymptotic lower bound on the quantized LQG control problem reveals the absolute minimum data-rates for (mean square) stability of our time-varying plant for any fixed finite-time horizon.

Consequently, by solving the associated mean-field forward and backward stochastic difference equations, the optimal control is derived in terms of the solution of a modified Riccati equation. Furthermore, for the infinite-horizon case, the stabilization problem for MFSID is studied, and the necessary and sufficient stabilizability conditions are obtained.

In contrast to existing SLS results, we derive an explicit (rather than implicit) parameterization of all achievable stabilized closed-loops. This admits more efficient IIR representations of the temporal part of the closed-loop dynamics, and it allows for the $\mathcal {H}_2$ design problem with closed-loop spatial sparsity constraints to be converted to a standard model matching problem, with the number of transfer function parameters scaling linearly with the closed-loop spatial extent constraint. We illustrate our results with two applications: consensus of first-order subsystems and the vehicular platoons problem. In the case of first-order consensus, we provide analytic solutions and further analyze the architecture of the resulting controller implementation. Results for infinite extent spatially invariant systems are presented to provide insight to the case of a large but finite number of subsystems.},

Using Lyapunov technique, we derive a delay-adaptive predictor feedback controller to ensure the global stability of the closed-loop system in the $L^2$ sense. More precisely, we express the input delay as a 1-D transport PDE with a spatial argument leading to the transformation of the time delay into a spatially distributed shift. For the resulting mixed transport and reaction–advection–diffusion PDE system, we employ a PDE backstepping design and certainty equivalence principle to derive the suitable adaptive control law that compensates for the effect of the unknown time delay. Our controller ensures the global stabilization in the $L^2$ sense. Our result is the first delay-adaptive predictor feedback controller with a PDE plant subject to a delayed distributed input. The feasibility of the proposed approach is illustrated by considering a mobile robot that spread a neutralizer over a polluted surface to achieve efficient decontamination with an unknown actuator delay arising from the noncollocation of the contaminant diffusive process and the moving neutralizer source.

It is proved that the proposed scheme is uniformly prescribed-time stable for unperturbed systems and prescribed-time attractive for perturbed systems as it rejects matched disturbances with unknown upper bounds without disturbance observation.

For the class of systems that admit a symmetric state-space realization, which for the SISO case is equivalent to ZIP, we obtain sufficient conditions under which MIMO systems too have ZIP. We also present new results in the context of “spectral-zero” of a system, a notion that plays a key role in many optimal control and estimation problems. We formulate conditions under which the spectral-zeros of a MIMO system are real, and further conditions that guarantee that the system-zeros, spectral-zeros, and the system-poles are all interlaced for MIMO systems.},

To carry out the primary goal, first, the stabilizability of a linear time-invariant (LTI) system under the decentralized control structure is presented in terms of a BLP. Next, two graph-based criteria are proposed to characterize stabilizing control structures with the required feedback links. Finally, all possible stabilizing control structures with the necessary feedback links are derived via solving a set of BLPs. In addition to the analysis of stabilizing control structures, the proposed graph-theoretic approach offers a versatile set of tools to find the simplest control structures capable of assigning the closed-loop spectrum in a totally arbitrary desired region.

  abstract     = {Although transmission of a data packet containing sensory information in a networked control system improves the quality of regulation, it has indeed a price from the communication perspective. It is, therefore, rational that such a data packet be transmitted only if it is valuable in the sense of a cost-benefit analysis. Yet, the fact is that little is known so far about this valuation of information and its connection with traditional event-triggered communication. In the present article, we study this intrinsic property of networked control systems by formulating a rate-regulation trade-off between the packet rate and the regulation cost with an event trigger and a controller as two distributed decision makers, and show that the valuation of information is conceivable and quantifiable grounded on this trade-off. In particular, we characterize an equilibrium in the rate-regulation trade-off, and quantify the value of information ${\rm{VoI}}_k$ there as the variation in a so-called value function with respect to a piece of sensory information that can be communicated to the controller at each time $k$ . We prove that, for a multi-dimensional Gauss--Markov process, ${\rm{VoI}}_k$ is a symmetric function of the discrepancy between the state estimates at the event trigger and the controller, and that a data packet containing sensory information at time $k$ should be transmitted to the controller only if ${\rm{VoI}}_k$ is nonnegative. Moreover, we discuss that ${\rm{VoI}}_k$ can be computed with arbitrary accuracy, and that it can be approximated by a closed-form quadratic function with a performance guarantee.},

The relationship between the size of this residual set and the switching frequency is established. Moreover, the convergence of the estimated controller parameters to their nominal values can be achieved for a certain subsystem given that this subsystem is activated for infinitely long time. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {This article studies the sensor placement problem in a leader–follower networked control system for improving its security against cyber-physical attacks. In a zero-sum game, the attacker selects $f$ nodes of the network to attack, and the detector places $f$ sensors to detect the presence of the attack signals. In our formulation, the attacker’s objective is to have a large impact on a target node in the network while being as little visible as possible to the detector. The detector, however, seeks to maximize the visibility of the attack signals. The effects of the attack signals on both the target node and the detector node are captured via the system $L_2$ gain from the attack signals to the target node and deployed sensors’ outputs, respectively. The equilibrium strategy of the game determines the optimal locations of the sensors. The existence of Nash equilibrium for the single-attack single-sensor case is studied when the underlying connectivity graph is a directed or an undirected tree. We show that, under the optimal sensor placement strategy, an undirected topology provides a higher security level for a networked control system compared to its corresponding directed topology. For the multiple-attack multiple-sensor case, we show that the game does not necessarily admit a Nash equilibrium and introduce a Stackelberg game approach, where the detector acts as the leader. Finally, these results are used to study the sensor placement problem in a vehicle platooning application in the presence of bias injectionattacks.},

We develop a Dijkstra searching algorithm that is carried out in the basis marking space of a plant net instead of the conventional reachability space. Hence, only a small subset of the reachability set is explored, while the unpromising branches are reduced. Moreover, we propose a transition selecting rule to expose all forbidden trajectories and all first-met target markings during the searching process. The main advantage of the proposed method is wide applicability and low computational effort.},

The problem has been elegantly solved in the case of linear input-affine systems, for which it has been shown that the solution has a remarkable structure: It is given by the sum of two contributions; a state feedback, which coincides with the unperturbed optimal control law, and a purely feedforward term in charge of compensating the effect of the exogenous signal. The objective of this article is to extend the above result to nonlinear input-affine systems. It is shown that, while some of the relevant features of the linear case indeed rely heavily on linearity and are not preserved in the nonlinear setting, several structural claims can be proved also in the nonlinear case.},

The convergent consensus properties of the tracking errors along the iteration axis are rigorously established under the strongly connected iteration-independent and iteration-varying communication topologies.

  abstract     = {We approach the problem of stabilizing a dynamical system while optimizing a cost and satisfying safety constraints and control limitations. For (nonlinear) affine control systems and quadratic costs, it has been shown that control barrier functions (CBFs) guaranteeing safety and control Lyapunov functions (CLFs) enforcing convergence can be used to (conservatively) reduce the optimal control problem to a sequence of quadratic programs (QPs). Existing works in this category have two main limitations. First, with one exception, they are based on the assumption that the relative degree of the system with respect to a function enforcing a safety constraint is one. Second, the QPs can easily become infeasible, in particular for problems with many safety constraints and tight control limitations. We propose high-order CBFs (HOCBFs), which can accommodate systems of arbitrary relative degrees. For each safety constraint, by using Lyapunov-like conditions, we construct a set of controls that renders the intersection of a set of sets forward invariant, which implies the satisfaction of the original constraint. We formulate optimal control problems with constraints given by HOCBF and CLF, and propose two methods—the penalty method and the parameterization method—to address the feasibility problem. Finally, we show how our methodology can be extended for safe navigation in unknown environments with long-term feasibility. We illustrate the proposed framework on adaptive cruise control and robot control problems.},

The design is serial in nature and consists of the design of a distributed event-triggered observer for each follower agent that estimates the desired information of the leader system in the presence of parametric uncertainty and, based on this observer, the design of a distributed event-triggered controller. A salient feature of our observer design is that it obeys the separation principle in the sense that the event-triggered control can be designed after the observer has been designed. As a result, the observer is applicable to different follower agent dynamics and the event-triggered time sequence for the controller is asynchronous of that of the observer. We implement this design scheme on linear heterogeneous multiagent systems and uncertain Euler–Lagrange multiagent systems, and achieve results that significantly extend the existing ones.},

In contrast to them, we study this problem in which the communication topologies of the multiagent system are described by directed graphs each containing a spanning tree, which is a more general and new scenario due to the interplay between the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix and the controller gains. Based on the existing results in spectral graph theory and positive linear systems theory, several necessary, and sufficient conditions on positive consensus of the directed multiagent system are derived through using linear matrix inequality techniques. A primal-dual iterative algorithm is developed for the computation of solutions.

To improve the overall capacity of nonlinear Gaussian filtering techniques, the CPQF is proposed by numerically solving the constrained moment matching equations. By enforcing the positivity of the quadrature weights, the CPQF is numerically as stable as the GHQF. Through exploiting the underlying sparsity while solving the moment matching equations, the CPQF can also achieve the same level of accuracy as the GHQF using far fewer quadrature points. Simulations are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the CPQF, and the numerical results demonstrate its superior performance over conventional Gaussian filters.},

This problem is subject to the “curse of dimensionality” associated with the dynamic programming method. This article proposes a novel decoupled data-based control (D2C) algorithm that addresses this problem using a decoupled, “open-loop–closed-loop,” approach. First, an open-loop deterministic trajectory optimization problem is solved using a black-box simulation model of the dynamical system. Then, closed-loop control is developed around this open-loop trajectory by linearization of the dynamics about this nominal trajectory. By virtue of linearization, a linear quadratic regulator based algorithm can be used for this closed-loop control. We show that the performance of D2C algorithm is approximately optimal. Moreover, simulation performance suggests a significant reduction in training time compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we are interested in the problem of synthesizing a partial observation supervisor for a discrete-event system such that it enforces a desired property. We introduce a compact and uniform approach to the problem of synthesizing state-based property-enforcing supervisors. A state-based property is a property that only depends on the current estimate of the past behavior of the system and does not depend on its future behavior. Previous work has introduced a uniform methodology to solve this problem through the construction of a finite structure called the all enforcement structure (AES), which captures a game between the supervisor and the environment. Although the AES is a powerful structure that includes all possible property-enforcing supervisors, its construction is computationally challenging since the number of states grows exponentially in the number of states and the number of events of the system. Our contribution is the definition of a compact AES that is equivalent to but computationally more efficient than the original AES. Specifically, the compact AES enjoys the same properties as the original AES with respect to synthesizing maximally permissive supervisors under the assumption of incomparable sets of controllable and observable events. We also provide experimental results to show the benefits of the compact AES over the original AES.},

Finally, for time-varying versions of both centralized and distributed primal-dual dynamics, we exploit their contractive nature to establish bounds on their tracking error.

The underlying system is assumed to be perturbed by exogenous unmeasured bounded disturbances, and the control problem is posed as a min–max optimal control wherein the disturbance is the adversary and tries to maximize a cost that the control tries to minimize. Assuming the existence of a saddle point in the problem, we present a version of the Pontryagin maximum principle (PMP) that encapsulates first-order necessary conditions that the optimal control and disturbance trajectories must satisfy. This PMP features a saddle point condition on the Hamiltonian and a set of backward difference equations for the adjoint dynamics. We also present a special case of our result on Euclidean spaces. We conclude with applying the PMP to robust version of single axis rotation of a rigid body.},

By contrast with their continuous-time counterparts and other phase limitations in the literature, they lead to numerically efficient results that can be computed either in closed form or via a linear program. The closed-form phase limitations are tight in the sense that we can construct multipliers that meet them with equality. The numerical results allow us to conclude that the current state-of-the-art in searches for Zames–Falb multipliers is not conservative. Moreover, they allow us to show, by construction, that the set of plants for which a suitable Zames– Falb multiplier exists is nonconvex.},

We assume that the admissible switching signals are generated by a logic dynamical system, referred to as the logic dynamical generator (LDG) of the admissible switching. We demonstrate that switching with minimum dwell-time and restricted successors represent two special cases of this type, by constructing their respective LDGs. First, we transfer the LDG into algebraic form, based on the vector-representation of logic. Next, we merge the logic state of the LDG and the continuous state of the original switched system using the STP and derive the dynamics of the merged state; a switched system without constraints on switching. The stability of the switched system under constrained switching is equivalent to the stability of the merged system under arbitrary switching. Based on this, sufficient conditions for the asymptotical stability of nonlinear switched systems with analytic subsystems under constrained switching are obtained. Specifically, in the case of all subsystems being linear, necessary and sufficient conditions for asymptotical stability under constrained switching are proposed.},

It turns out that the resulting robust filter is characterized by a Riccati-like iteration evolving on the cone of the positive-semidefinite matrices. Moreover, we study the convergence of such iteration in the case that the nominal model is with constant parameters on the basis of the contraction analysis in the same spirit of Bougerol.

  abstract     = {This article develops data-driven methods to identify eigenfunctions of the Koopman operator associated with a dynamical system and subspaces that are invariant under the operator. We build on Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD), a data-driven method that finds a finite-dimensional approximation of the Koopman operator on the span of a predefined dictionary of functions. We propose a necessary and sufficient condition to identify Koopman eigenfunctions based on the application of EDMD forward and backward in time. Moreover, we propose the Symmetric Subspace Decomposition (SSD) algorithm, an iterative method that provably identifies the maximal Koopman-invariant subspace and the Koopman eigenfunctions in the span of the dictionary. We also introduce the Streaming SSD algorithm, an online extension of SSD that only requires a small fixed memory and incorporates new data as is received. Finally, we propose an extension of SSD that approximates Koopman eigenfunctions and invariant subspaces when the dictionary does not contain sufficient informative eigenfunctions.},

  abstract     = {We consider a scenario where a system experiences a disruption, and the states (representing health values) of its components continue to reduce over time, unless they are acted upon by a controller. Given this dynamical setting, we consider the problem of finding an optimal control (or switching) sequence to maximize the sum of the weights of the components, whose states are brought back to the maximum value. We first provide several characteristics of the optimal policy for the general (fully heterogeneous) version of this problem. We then show that under certain conditions on the rates of repair and deterioration, we can explicitly characterize the optimal control policy as a function of the states. When the deterioration rate (when not being repaired) is larger than or equal to the repair rate, and the deterioration and repair rates as well as the weights are homogeneous across all the components, we show that the policy that targets the component with the largest state value at each time step is optimal under certain conditions. On the other hand, if the repair rates are sufficiently larger than the deterioration rates, the optimal control policy is to target the component whose state minus the deterioration rate is least in a particular subset of components at each time step.},

The channel and the process are modeled by an additive white Gaussian noise channel with fading and a partially observable Gauss–Markov process, respectively. Moreover, the feedback control loop is constructed by designing an encoder with a scheduler and a decoder with a controller. The scheduler and the controller are the decision makers deciding about the transmit power and the control input at each time, respectively. Associated with the energy-regulation tradeoff, we characterize an equilibrium at which neither the scheduler nor the controller has a unilateral incentive to deviate from its policy. We argue that this equilibrium is a general one as it attains global optimality without any restrictions on the information structure or the policy structure, despite the presence of signaling and dual effects.},

In many applications, such important state values correspond to events that have low a priori probability to happen (e.g., unsafe situations or conditions that one tries to avoid by design). Provably, Kalman filtering techniques are inadequate to correctly estimate such rare events. In this article, a new state estimation paradigm is introduced to build confidence regions that contain the true state value, whatever this value is, with a user-chosen probability. Among regions having this property, an algorithm is introduced that generates in a Gaussian setup the region that satisfies a minimum-volume condition.},

Both uncertainties are primarily motivated by practical applications in engineering and management. The first uncertainty is connected to a disturbance unknown to the follower but known to the leader. A soft-constraint min-max control is applied by the follower to determine the optimal response, and then an augmented LQ forward-backward stochastic differential equation control is solved by the leader to ensure a robust strategy design. The second uncertainty involves a disturbance, the realization of which can be completely observed by the follower, but only its distribution can be accessed by the leader. Thus, a hard-constraint min-max control on an affine-equality-constraint is studied by the leader to address the exact-optimal robust design. Moreover, based on a weak convergence technique, a minimizing sequence of near-optimal robust designs is constructed, which is more tractable in computation. Some numerical results of the abovementioned robust strategies are also presented.},

A sparsity pattern is structurally controllable if it admits a controllable linear ensemble system.

We show that exponential stability of the latter rules out limit cycles, quasi-periodic solutions, and broad classes of oscillatory behavior. We focus then on nonlinear equations arising in biological interaction networks with general kinetics, and we show that the dynamics of the aforementioned variational system can be embedded in a linear differential inclusion. We then propose algorithms for constructing piecewise linear Lyapunov functions to certify global robust nonoscillatory behavior.

We show that for certain objective functions, DeePC exhibits strong out-of-sample performance, and at the same time respects constraints with high probability.

The investigation is carried out by theoretical analysis plus case studies with the stochastic system models. The stability of systems is the core issue; the explicit involvement of the TDs in the stability criteria is the premise for them being concerned. To these ends, a series of lemmas are established preliminarily, a new type stability theorem with its practical version is established in succession, and a stability criterion with the TDs as explicit parameters is induced. The Lyapunov function method is applied for less restriction and conservativeness. The mechanism and the approach for the emergence of the phenomenon under probe are analyzed. Implementation is considered for the linear system model. Typical variable TDs are constructed for illustrations theoretically.

This dissipation can involve the LKF itself, as in existing iISS characterizations, but can alternatively involve the instantaneous value of the solution’s norm (pointwise dissipation), the supremum norm of the state history (historywise dissipation), or a mix of the two ( ${\mathcal K}{\mathcal L}$ dissipation). We show that all of them guarantee iISS. By relying on a recent converse result by Y. Lin and Y. Wang, we show that most of them are also necessary for iISS. These relaxed dissipation rates simplify the iISS analysis of time-delay systems and contribute to uniforming iISS theory with that of input-free systems. Proofs rely on several results for time-delay systems that may be of interest on their own, including a novel characterization of global asymptotic stability and the fact that iISS is equivalent to global asymptotic stability of the input-free system plus a uniform bounded energy-bounded state property.},

In particular, we consider a scenario where there is an unknown subset of compromised agents that may deliberately share altered information to undermine the team objective. We propose two distributed algorithms where each agent maintains and updates two sets of beliefs (i.e., probability distributions over the hypotheses), namely local and actual beliefs (LB and AB, respectively, for brevity). In both algorithms, at every time step, each agent shares its AB with other agents within its communication range and makes a local observation to update its LB. Then, both algorithms can use the shared information to update ABs under certain conditions. One requires receiving a certain number of shared ABs at each time instant ; the other accumulates shared ABs over time and updates after the number of shared ABs exceeds a prescribed threshold. Otherwise, both algorithms rely on the agent’s current LB and AB to update the new AB. We prove under mild assumptions that the AB for every noncompromised agent converges almost surely to the true hypothesis, without requiring connectivity in the underlying time-varying network topology. Using a simulation of a team of unmanned aerial vehicles aiming to classify adversarial agents among themselves, we illustrate and compare the proposed algorithms. Finally, we show experimentally that the second algorithm consistently outperforms the first algorithm in terms of the speed of convergence.},

This article addresses, first, the case of an autonomous system and, then, the case of a controlled dynamical system under the assumption that the exogenous input is accessible by each node in the network. Based on the designed state estimator, each distributed sensor node can achieve asymptotic estimation of the full state, with an arbitrarily fixed decay rate of the observation error.},

The maximal delay range is defined by the delay consensus margin (DCM), which is a robustness measure within which consensus can be achieved robustly despite the presence of uncertain and time-varying delays. We apply an $H_\infty$ -type small-gain analysis to multiagent systems, which results in explicit lower bounds on the DCM for both undirected and directed graphs. The results provide sufficient conditions for robust consensus for all time-varying delays that may vary within the range. It is seen that the agent dynamics and the graph connectivity may fundamentally limit the range of tolerable delays. It is also found that the DCM can be increased beyond that achieved by the P protocol by incorporating the delay variation rate in the design of the PD control protocol.},

First, the relationship between two adjacent update times of zero-order hold is established. Then, by discrete-time approach, an equivalent discrete-time stochastic system is introduced. By the law of total expectation, together with confluent Vandermonde matrix, convolution formula, and Kronecker product operation, the mathematical expectation of a product of three matrices, including the system matrix and its transpose, is calculated. Based on this, a stabilization controller is designed such that the closed-loop system is stochastically stable. Finally, an illustrative example is provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed design approach.},

In this article, we derive strong structural properties on the time-invariant multidimensional Gauss–Markov processes that allow for an optimization problem that can be computed optimally via a reverse-waterfilling algorithm. Moreover, we propose an elegant optimal iterative scheme that computes this reverse-waterfilling algorithm. We show that the specific scheme operates much faster than any existing algorithmic approach that solves the same problem optimally and is also scalable.

In this regard, it is shown that for a strongly connected two-channel system having each subsystem of equal sizes, there exists a relation to compute the decentralized periodic controller gains in terms of the gains of a given centralized LTI controller if the latter is minimum-phase, stable, and satisfies some relative degree conditions.

A suitable example is considered to show that the proposed decentralized periodic controller can mimic a centralized LTI controller in averaged sense.

In the traditional QLC literature, SL has been thoroughly applied to systems having nonlinearities with only a single input.

More specifically, the formulas for the SL gains and bias are derived for multivariate functions and then employed to explore SL of a trivariate saturation nonlinearity and study the SL of control systems with feedback loops. The developed theory is then applied to the analysis and optimal controller design of stochastic systems having randomly varying parameters or state-multiplicative noise.

It requires a control protocol, which 1) is not enforced on all individuals in the society, and 2) does not exclusively rely on specific opinion values shared by the social system. Thanks to the recent studies on noise-induced consensus in opinion dynamics, the noise-based intervention strategy has emerged as the only one meeting both of the above requirements, yet its underlying general theory is still lacking. In this article, we perform rigorous theoretical analysis and simulations of a noise-based control strategy for opinion formation, in which only a fraction of individuals is affected by randomly generated noise. We develop a new approach to prove the existence of a feasible noise protocol when it is difficult to be explicitly constructed and prove that irrespective of the number of noise-driven individuals, including the case of only one single noise-affected individual, the system can be controlled to achieve quasi-consensus in finite time, and the critical noise strength can be obtained. Our results highlight the efficiency of noise-driven mechanisms for the control of complex social dynamics.},

  abstract     = {Vibrational control seeks to stabilize an unstable system by judiciously injecting a state-free high-frequency dither. This article presents some robustness properties of vibrational control with respect to additive disturbances in a nonlinear system. We assume that, without disturbances, the appropriately averaged system is regionally asymptotically stable. Using perturbation techniques, our first result shows that the stabilization realized through vibrational control is robust with respect to additive disturbances of sufficiently small amplitude. Indeed, the perturbed system of vibrational control has a robustness feature similar to input-to-state stability in a local region. In the case of periodic disturbances, our second result indicates that vibrational control naturally dampens disturbances of sufficiently high frequency, which allows for relatively high amplitude disturbances. A tight bound for the effect of such periodic disturbances on the ultimate deviation of states from the desired equilibrium is presented. Simulation results from a planar manipulator support the theoretic analysis.},

The first one is to prove a precise estimate for radius of convergence and the errors of local approximate stable manifolds. The second one is to extend the local approximate stable manifolds to larger ones by symplectic algorithms, which have better long-time behaviors than general-purpose schemes. Our approach avoids the case of divergence of the iterative sequence of approximate stable manifolds and reduces the computation cost.

This leads to the hope of investigating systems of conservation laws in 1-D, where the classical Lax–Hopf formula no more holds. Moreover, numerical illustrations are presented using as a target, a function optimized for minimum pressure rise in the context of sonic-boom minimization problems.

Subsequently, the explicit characterization of controller gains is obtained in terms of the solvability of linear matrix inequalities.

We consider a scenario, where each vehicle follows a trajectory imposed by a local planner and where each unmanned vehicle can have different linear dynamics as well as different constraints and disturbances. In this contest, we design a novel control architecture, where a centralized traffic manager, in conjunction with ad-hoc designed local vehicle controllers, is capable of ensuring the absence of collisions. The proposed solution is obtained by exploiting, for the local vehicles’ controllers, a dual-mode model-predictive controller and, for the traffic manager, set-theoretic and controllability properties. Moreover, after modeling the potential vehicle collisions with a graph, connectivity arguments are used to obtain an optimal collision resolution, which minimizes the number of vehicles that need to be stopped. The resulting control scheme ensures collision-free signal tracking. Results of the simulation conducted on an MUV system are shown to provide tangible evidence of the features of the proposed framework.},

Moreover, agents do not have prior knowledge of their future objective functions. Different from existing works on online distributed optimization, we consider the scenario, where objective functions at each time step are nonconvex. To handle this challenge, we propose an online distributed algorithm based on the consensus algorithm and the mirror descent algorithm. Of particular interest is that regrets involving first-order optimality condition are used to measure the performance of the proposed algorithm. Under mild assumptions on the communication graph and objective functions, we prove that regrets grow sublinearly.

Compared with the analysis of general saturated linear systems, one remarkable difference is that only the domain of attraction inside the first orthant is of interest. Hence, we tackle this problem by exploiting different shapes of invariant sets confined in the first orthant, including hyperpyramids and hyperrectangles, which are, respectively, the level sets of sum-separable and max-separable Lyapunov functions. For an open-loop positive system, a sufficient condition is given to ensure that a pyramid (or a hyperrectangle) is contractively invariant for the closed loop. This condition is nonconservative for the single-input case. Moreover, for a system without open-loop positivity, we establish conditions such that the closed loop has a hyperrectangular invariant set. Examples show the superiority of the results, in comparison with those existing ones using invariant ellipsoids.},

Given elliptically bounded inputs, the set of reachable states in $N$ time steps is the Minkowski sum of a finite number of ellipsoids. We formulate the inclusion verification problem as a chain of constraints in the form of linear matrix inequalities. As the time horizon grows, the number of constraints becomes unwieldy, and we present a technique to achieve a similar level of accuracy with far fewer terms, significantly reducing the computational cost of the method. Numerical examples presented in this article show that the method is highly adaptable.},

The presence of unknown time-varying parameters and uncertain disturbances makes the systems in question essentially different from those in the related works. By skillfully combining adaptive technique and command filter-based backstepping, a novel command filter adaptive tracking controller is successfully designed to achieve asymptotic tracking. The typical feature of the proposed controller lies in the introduction of a smooth function with positive integrable time-varying function, which makes the controller powerful enough to compensate the unknown time-varying parameters and uncertain disturbances. Remarkably, a novel Lyapunov function by incorporating the lower bounds of control gains is used to prove the stability of the closed-loop system. Compared with some existing command filter-based backstepping, the conditions on the virtual control coefficients and disturbances are relaxed.

  abstract     = {We introduce a new hybrid control strategy, which is conceptually different from the commonly used synergistic hybrid approaches, to efficiently deal with the problem of the undesired equilibria that precludes smooth vectors fields on $SO(3)$ from achieving global stability. The key idea consists in constructing a suitable potential function on $SO(3)\times \mathbb {R}$ involving an auxiliary scalar variable, with flow and jump dynamics, which keeps the state away from the undesired critical points while, at the same time, guarantees a decrease of the potential function over the flows and jumps. Based on this new hybrid mechanism, a hybrid feedback control scheme for the attitude tracking problem on $SO(3)$ , endowed with global asymptotic stability and semiglobal exponential stability guarantees, is proposed. This control scheme is further improved through a smoothing mechanism that removes the discontinuities in the input torque. The third hybrid control scheme, proposed in this article, removes the requirement of the angular velocity measurements, while preserving the strong stability guarantees of the first hybrid control scheme. This approach has also been applied to the tracking problem on $SE(3)$ to illustrate its advantages with respect to the existing synergistic hybrid approaches. Finally, some simulation results are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed hybrid controllers.},

We provide explicit expressions of feedback controllers satisfying such conditions. We also consider the case of only $z$ -type measurements and multiple control Hamiltonians. We show that local stability in probability holds true, however due to the absence of random displacements generated by $x$ -type measurements, the reachability of a neighborhood of a predetermined GHZ state is not clear.

In this article, we study decentralized online convex optimization over a multiagent network in the presence of feedback delays. Each agent is associated with a time-varying local loss function, which is revealed to the agent sequentially with delays. The goal of every agent is to minimize the accumulated total loss function (the sum of the local loss functions of all agents) by choosing appropriate local actions. We first develop an online decentralized gradient descent algorithm for the delayed full information case, in which the delayed local loss function is fully disclosed to each agent. The (static) regret of each agent is upper bounded in terms of the delays for both convex and strongly convex loss functions. We show that, as long as the average delay among all agents is sublinear, so is the regret of every agent. Further, we extend the algorithm and analysis to the scenario of bandit feedback, where only the values of the delayed loss functions at two random points close to the local action are revealed. We demonstrate that the two-point bandit feedback does not entail regret degradation in order sense compared to the full information scenario. Finally, numerical results are presented to corroborate the efficacy of the proposed algorithms.},

We consider this problem from the attacker’s viewpoint and investigate the synthesis of an attack strategy for systems modeled as probabilistic automata. Specifically, we investigate the synthesis of attack functions constrained by multiple objectives. We proceed in two steps. First, we quantify each attack strategy based on the likelihood of successfully reaching an unsafe state. Based on this quantification, we study the problem of synthesizing attack functions with the maximum likelihood of successfully reaching an unsafe state. Second, we consider the problem of synthesizing attack functions that have the maximum likelihood of successfully reaching an unsafe state while minimizing a cost function, i.e., the synthesis of attack functions is constrained by multiple objectives.

  abstract     = {In this article, we study how to secure distributed filters for linear time-invariant systems with bounded noise under false-data injection attacks. A malicious attacker is able to arbitrarily manipulate the observations for a time-varying and unknown subset of the sensors. We first propose a recursive distributed filter consisting of two steps at each update. The first step employs a saturation-like scheme, which gives a small gain if the innovation is large corresponding to a potential attack. The second step is a consensus operation of state estimates among neighboring sensors. We prove the estimation error is upper bounded if the filter parameters satisfy a condition. We further analyze the feasibility of the condition and connect it to sparse observability in the centralized case. When the attacked sensor set is known to be time-invariant, the secured filter is modified by adding an online local attack detector. The detector is able to identify the attacked sensors whose observation innovations are larger than the detection thresholds. Also, with more attacked sensors being detected, the thresholds will adaptively adjust to reduce the space of the stealthy attack signals. The resilience of the secured filter with detection is verified by an explicit relationship between the upper bound of the estimation error and the number of detected attacked sensors. Moreover, for the noise-free case, we prove that the state estimate of each sensor asymptotically converges to the system state under certain conditions. Numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the developed results.},

In this context, our results can be used to bound the rate of change of the optimizer.

We consider two criteria of optimality on protecting policies: 1) disruptiveness, i.e., protecting policies with a minimum degree of disturbance to legal users’ normal operations; and 2) cost, i.e., protecting policies with a minimal cost. For the optimality on disruptiveness, we prove that a minimally disruptive protecting policy is obtained by using the classical supervisory control theory in the security automaton. For the optimality on cost, we develop a method to obtain a protecting policy with minimal cost by finding a min-cut in the security automaton.},

The method encompasses both logical (markings to reach or avoid) and temporal specifications (arrival and departure times in specific markings). It relies on the construction of a partial forward reachability graph of the modified state class graph type and the formulation of integer linear programming problems to establish suitable firing time intervals (FTIs) for the controllable transitions. For each enabled controllable transition, the SC algorithm provides the largest FTI that that the specifications are met, irrespectively of the firing times of the uncontrollable transitions.},

  abstract     = {This article first deals with the problem of prescribed-time stability of linear systems without delay. The analysis and design involve the Bell polynomials , the generalized Laguerre polynomials , the Lah numbers , and a suitable polynomial-based Vandermonde matrix . The results can be used to design a new controller—with time-varying gains—ensuring prescribed-time stabilization of controllable linear time-invariant (LTI) systems. The approach leads to similar results compared to Holloway et al. 2019, but offers an alternative and compact control design (especially for the choice of the time-varying gains). Based on the preliminary results for the delay-free case, we then study controllable LTI systems with single input and subject to a constant input delay. We design a predictor feedback with time-varying gains. To achieve this, we model the input delay as a transport partial differential equation (PDE) and build on the cascade PDE–ordinary differential equation setting (inspired by Krstic 2009) so as the design of the prescribed-time predictor feedback is carried out based on the backstepping approach, which makes use of time-varying kernels . We guarantee the bounded invertibility of the backstepping transformation, and we prove that the closed-loop solution converges to the equilibrium in a prescribed time. A simulation example illustrates the results.},

The fundamental objective of network identification for dynamic systems is to identify causal influence pathways. However, dynamically related data streams that originate from different sources are prone to corruption caused by asynchronous time-stamps, packet drops, and noise. In this article, we show that identifying causal structure using corrupt measurements results in the inference of spurious links. A necessary and sufficient condition that delineates the effects of corruption on a set of nodes is obtained. Our theory applies to nonlinear systems, and systems with feedback loops. Our results are obtained by the analysis of conditional directed information (DI) in dynamic Bayesian networks.

Often for linear MPC problems, the optimization problem in question is a quadratic program (QP) that depends on parameters such as system states and reference signals. A popular class of methods for solving such QPs is active-set methods, where a sequence of linear systems of equations is solved. We propose an algorithm for computing which sequence of subproblems an active-set algorithm will solve, for every parameter of interest. These sequences can be used to set worst-case bounds on how many iterations, floating-point operations, and, ultimately, the maximum solution time the active-set algorithm requires to converge. The usefulness of the proposed method is illustrated on a set of QPs originating from MPC problems, by computing the exact worst-case number of iterations primal and dual active-set algorithms require to reach optimality.},

A smart sensor forwards its local state estimate to a remote estimator over a time-correlated multistate Markov fading channel, where the packet drop probability is time-varying and depends on the current fading channel state. We establish a necessary and sufficient condition for mean-square stability of the remote estimation error covariance in terms of the state transition matrix of the LTI system, the packet drop probabilities in different channel states, and the transition probability matrix of the Markov channel states. To derive this result, we propose a novel estimation-cycle based approach and provide new elementwise bounds of matrix powers. The stability condition is verified by numerical results and is shown more effective than existing sufficient conditions in the literature. We observe that the stability region in terms of the packet drop probabilities in different channel states can either be convex or nonconvex depending on the transition probability matrix of the Markov channel states. Our numerical results suggest that the stability conditions for remote estimation may coincide for setups with a smart sensor and with a conventional one (which sends raw measurements to the remote estimator) though the smart sensor setup achieves a better estimation performance.},

Another conceivable method to accomplish the same goal is to subsidize the users’ actions that are preferable from a system-level perspective. We show that, when users behave similarly and predictably, subsidies offer superior performance guarantees to tolls under similar budgetary constraints; however, in the presence of unknown player heterogeneity, subsidies fail to offer the same robustness as tolls.},

  abstract     = {This article considers the problem of bilinearization and optimal control of a control-affine nonlinear system by projecting the system dynamics onto the Koopman eigenspace. Although there are linearization techniques like Carleman linearization for embedding a finite-dimensional nonlinear system into an infinite-dimensional space, they depend on the analytic property of the vector fields and work only on polynomial space. The proposed method utilizes the Koopman canonical transform, specifically the Koopman eigenfunctions of the drift vector field, to transform the dynamics into a bilinear system under certain assumptions. While the bilinearization is exact, if there exists a Koopman-invariant finite-dimensional subspace for the drift vector field, sometimes this condition is too conservative. An approximate approach is to minimize an $\mathcal {L}^2$ norm on the truncated state-space. The approximation can be carried out from time-series data without explicit knowledge of the drift vector field. Controllability of the bilinear system is analyzed using the Myhill semigroup method and Lie algebraic structures. Pontryagin’s principle is applied to the bilinear system to yield a two-point boundary-value problem for the optimal control design. A single shooting method solves the boundary value problem in order to determine the control signal. Alternatively, a gradient-based method is also outlined to find the optimal control which exploits the bilinear structure. Several examples of control-affine nonlinear systems numerically illustrate the bilinearization and optimal control design, assuming a cost function quadratic in the states and control input.},

Given an initial and a target set, we develop algorithms to verify the existence of IMPL system trajectories that, starting from the initial set, eventually reach the target set. We show that RA can be solved by encoding the IMPL system, as well as initial and target sets, into linear real arithmetic expressions, and then checking the satisfaction of a resulting logical formula via a satisfiability modulo theory (SMT) solver. The performance and scalability of the developed SMT-based algorithms are shown to drastically outperform state-of-the-art RA algorithms applied to IMPL systems, which promises to usher their use in practical, industrial-sized IMPL models.},

However, existing results provide solutions that can only ensure stability with bounded tracking errors, as asymptotic tracking is difficult to be achieved mainly due to the errors caused by event-triggering mechanisms and system uncertainties. In this article, with the aim of overcoming such difficulty, we propose a new methodology. The subsystems in MASs are divided into two groups, in which the first group consists of the subsystems that can access partial output of the reference system and the second one contains all the remaining subsystems. To estimate the state of the reference system, a new distributed event-triggered observer is first designed for the first group based on a combined output observable condition. Then, a distributed event-triggered observer is proposed for the second group by employing the observer state of the first group. Based on the designed observers, adaptive controllers are derived for all subsystems. It is established that global stability of the closed loop system is ensured and asymptotic convergence of all the tracking errors is achieved. Moreover, a simulation example is provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

By taking advantage of the periodic property of the system, linear inequalities are employed to characterize the $L_{1}$ -gain, and an unweighted upper bound of the $L_{1}$ -gain of the system is given.},

The novel contributions, as opposed to the state-of-the-art, of this study lie in the following twofold: to relax the conditional inequality regarding the derivative of Lyapunov function, a novel Nussbaum function with changing frequency is constructed, based on which an improved Nussbaum gain technical lemma is first designed such that closed-loop boundedness can be established for all time, rather than the forward completeness property (boundedness up to any finite time); to further handle nonaffine terms, the concept named separable characteristic is put forward, making the controlled systems more compatible with several general frameworks derived from backstepping-like technique. Thanks to abovementioned benefits, a prescribed performance control methodology is presented without involving any approximation techniques.

  abstract     = {This article is concerned with the state estimation of linear dynamic systems when some sensors are corrupted by attackers. This problem is known as resilient state estimation (RSE), and aims to achieve, under some conditions, the estimation of the true state despite the malicious attacks on sensors. The state-of-art RSE methods provides a bound on estimation errors when external disturbance exists. However, it is shown in this article that the effect of the disturbance on estimation error may be larger than that for conventional observers, or even worse, resiliency may be lost for the disturbance that exceeds the bound. To resolve this issue, unknown input observer (UIO) mechanism is adopted in RSE for the purpose of estimating true plant state under both sensor attacks and external disturbance. Also achieved in this work is the method of partial state UIO synthesis, which relaxes the design requirement for full state UIO. In relation to resiliency, it is shown that 2 $q$ redundant detectability is a necessary condition for robust and resilient state estimator in order to tolerate up to $q$ sensor attacks. Numerical examples are given to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Further, it is shown that the closed-loop stability of TDO-based MPC can be guaranteed using multiple mechanisms, including increasing the number of solver iterations, preconditioning the optimal control problem, adjusting the MPC cost matrices, and reducing the length of the receding horizon.

Moreover, event-triggered conditions with heterogeneous parameters are well-designed to improve the flexibility of parameters selection. By employing Lyapunov analysis method and SMC theory, new sufficient conditions for ensuring the reachability of sliding manifold is deduced to remove the conservatism. In light of EB-SMC technique, attractive features containing fast response, good transient performance, and robustness with respect to uncertainties can be inherited. Also, resource consumption and network occupation can be greatly reduced via event-triggered control with exclusion of Zeno phenomena. At last, a numerical example is shown to support our results.},

In this article, we prove that, for the class of controls consisting of the sum of a time-varying feedforward term and a time-varying feedback term linear in the state, existence of a suboptimal solution can be guaranteed.

  abstract     = {Set-membership filter (SMF) has been extensively studied for state estimation in the presence of bounded noises with unknown statistics. Since it was first introduced in the 1960s, the studies on SMF have used the set-based description as its mathematical framework. One important issue that has been overlooked is the optimality of SMF. In this article, we put forward a new mathematical framework for SMF using concepts of uncertain variables. We first establish two basic properties of uncertain variables, namely, the law of total range (a nonstochastic version of the law of total probability) and the equivalent Bayes’ rule. This enables us to put forward a general SMFing framework with established optimality. Furthermore, we obtain the optimal SMF under a nonstochastic Markov condition, which is shown to be fundamentally equivalent to the Bayes filter. Note that the classical SMF in the literature is only equivalent to the optimal SMF we obtained under the nonstochastic Markov condition. When this condition is violated, we show that the classical SMF is not optimal and it only gives an outer bound on the optimal estimate.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates a parameterization of all output-rectifying retrofit controllers for distributed design of a structured controller. It has been discovered that all retrofit controllers can be characterized as a constrained Youla parameterization, which is difficult to solve analytically. For synthesis, a tractable and insightful class of retrofit controllers, referred to as output-rectifying retrofit controllers, has been introduced. An unconstrained parameterization of all output-rectifying retrofit controllers can be derived under a technical assumption on measurability of the interaction signal. The aim of this article is to reveal the structure of all output-rectifying retrofit controllers in the general output-feedback case without interaction measurement. It is found out that the existing developments can be generalized based on system inversion. The result leads to the conclusion that output-rectifying retrofit controllers can readily be designed even in the general case.},

Similar to VDC, the combined controller–observer design is passivity based, and we show that it achieves semiglobal exponential convergence of the tracking error. The convergence analysis is carried out using Lyapunov functions based on the observer and controller error dynamics.

Instead, we use the Dulmage–Mendelsohn decomposition. Moreover, we prove that the results for MCP1 are different from those for usual LTI systems.

  abstract     = {The continuum deformation leader–follower cooperative control strategy models vehicles in a multiagent system as particles of a deformable body. A desired continuum deformation is defined based on leaders’ trajectories and acquired by followers in real time through local communication. The existing continuum deformation theory requires followers to be placed inside the convex simplex defined by leaders. This constraint is relaxed in this article. We prove that, under suitable assumptions, any $n+1$ ( $n=1,2,3$ ) vehicles forming an $n$ -D simplex can be selected as leaders while followers, arbitrarily positioned inside or outside the leading simplex, can acquire a desired continuum deformation in a decentralized fashion. The article’s second contribution is to assign a one-to-one mapping between leaders’ smooth trajectories and homogeneous deformation features obtained by continuum deformation eigendecomposition. Therefore, a safe and smooth continuum deformation coordination can be planned either by shaping homogeneous transformation features or by choosing appropriate leader trajectories. This is beneficial to efficiently plan and guarantee collision avoidance in a large-scale group. A simulation case study is reported in which a virtual convex simplex contains a quadcopter vehicle team at any time $t$ ; A* search is applied to optimize quadcopter team continuum deformation in an obstacle-laden environment.},

By introducing a pining control strategy, a novel class of distributed error estimation algorithms is proposed for solving the quasi-synchronization problem of heterogeneous dynamical networks with a static coupling law by exploring the local information among the neighboring nodes. By removing the assumption that the smallest real part of the nonzero eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix associated with the communication graph must be known, we also address the case of the quasi-synchronization of heterogeneous dynamical networks with nonidentical nonlinear dynamics and an adaptive coupling law. It is proved, in the sense of Lyapunov function, that the distributed error estimation for the quasi-synchronization problem of heterogeneous dynamical networks with static and adaptive coupling laws will be achieved with a bounded synchronization error level.

This body frame is used to design a distributed control law where each agent modulates its motion based only on its instantaneous field measurement.

As there is no central authority to provide the aggregate information required by each player to update their actions, a dynamic average consensus protocol is employed to estimate it. To protect the players’ privacy, we perturb the transmitted information among the players by independent random noises drawn from Laplace distributions. By synthesizing the perturbed average consensus protocol with a gradient algorithm, a distributed privacy-preserving Nash equilibrium seeking strategy is established for the aggregative games under both fixed and time-varying communication topologies. With explicit quantifications of the mean square errors, the convergence results of the proposed methods are presented. Moreover, it is analytically proven that the proposed algorithm is $\epsilon$ -differentially private.

We establish exponential stability for the ordinary differential equation (ODE) that governs the gradient-flow dynamics over the set of stabilizing feedback gains and show that a similar result holds for the gradient descent method that arises from the forward Euler discretization of the corresponding ODE. We also provide theoretical bounds on the convergence rate and sample complexity of the random search method with two-point gradient estimates.

In particular, the proposed formulation simply minimizes the predicted output error, possibly with some input regularization. Instead of using terminal cost/sets or a positive-definite stage cost as is standard in MPC theory, we build on the theoretical results by Grimm et al. using a detectability notion. The proposed formulation is applicable if the constrained nonlinear regulation problem is (strictly) feasible; the plant is incrementally stabilizable and incrementally input–output to state stable (i-IOSS, detectable). We show that for minimum phase systems, such a design ensures exponential stability of the regulator manifold. We also provide a design procedure in case of unstable zero dynamics using an incremental input regularization and a nonresonance condition.

  abstract     = {In this article, we propose a dual set membership filter for nonlinear dynamic systems with additive unknown but bounded noises, and it has three distinct advantages. First, the nonlinear system is translated into the linear system by leveraging a semi-infinite programming, rather than linearizing the nonlinear function. The semi-infinite programming is to find an ellipsoid bounding the nonlinear transformation of an ellipsoid, which aims to compute a tight ellipsoid to cover the state. Second, the duality result of the semi-infinite programming is derived by rigorous analysis; then, a first-order Frank–Wolfe method is developed to efficiently solve it with a lower computation complexity. Third, the proposed filter enjoys stability for some special nonlinear dynamic systems and succeeds the advantages of the classic linear set membership filter. Finally, two illustrative examples in the simulations reveal the effectiveness of the dual set membership filter.},

Using folding transforms the parabolic PDE into a $2 \times 2$ coupled PDE system with coupling through compatibility conditions. We apply a two-tiered backstepping approach, where the invertibility of the transformations guarantees the state-feedback controllers exponentially stabilize the trivial solution of the PDE system. A state observer is also designed for two collocated measurements at an arbitrary interior point, generating exponentially stable state estimates. The output feedback control law is formulated by composing the independently designed state-feedback controller with the observer, and the resulting dynamic feedback is shown to stabilize the trivial solution. Some numerical analysis on how the selection of these points affect the responses of the controller and observer are discussed, with simulations illustrating various choices of folding points and their effect on the stabilization in different performance indexes.},

In this article, two FSID methods, the leave-out sign-dominant correlation region (LSCR) and sign-perturbed sums (SPS) methods are extended to errors-in-variables (EIV) systems. In EIV systems, both the measured input and the measured output are corrupted by noise, and they are not noise invertible in the sense that the noise signals cannot be recovered from the measured signals given the true system. Hence, standard FSID methods are not applicable. The present article deals with FSID of EIV systems where the input and noise on input are i.i.d. Gaussian processes and the signal-to-noise ratio is known. By utilizing an alternative regression model and swapping the role of the input and the prediction error in the FSID methods, new LSCR and SPS confidence regions are constructed, which include the true model parameter with a guaranteed user-chosen probability. It is shown that the confidence regions are asymptotically included in an $\epsilon$ -neighborhood of the true parameter. An ellipsoidal approximation which can be computed at low computational cost is proposed for the SPS confidence region. The methods and their properties are illustrated in numerical experiments.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we consider cooperative multiagent systems, where independent agents need to minimize a collective social cost. Given the coupling in the cost, the optimal strategy requires interaction and communications among all the agents in general. In this article, we unveil important classes of social costs which are optimized by decentralized and selfish solutions, hence eliminating the need for an interagent communication network. In particular, we focus on a set of $n$ independent agents coupled only through an overall cost that penalizes the divergence of each agent from the average collective behavior. Adopting input–output methods, we show that optimal decentralized and selfish solutions are possible in a variety of standard input–output cost criteria. These include the cases of $\ell _1$ , $\ell _2$ , $\ell _\infty$ induced, and ${\mathcal H}_2$ norms for any finite $n$ . Moreover, if the cost includes nondeviation from average variables, the above results hold true as well for $\ell _1$ , $\ell _2$ , $\ell _\infty$ induced norms, and any $n$ , while they hold true for the normalized, per-agent square ${\mathcal H}_2$ norm, cost as $n\rightarrow \infty$ . The results of the article demonstrate that selfish behavior can be socially optimal in nontrivial cases. We further expand our analysis to more general controller structures that induce collective tracking of exogenous common signals.},

Each risk is modeled as the expectation of some loss function with unknown probability distribution, while the regularizers are assumed deterministic, but are not required to be differentiable or even continuous. The individual, regularized, cost functions are distributed across a strongly connected network of agents, and the Pareto optimal solution is sought by appealing to a multiagent diffusion strategy. To this end, the regularizers are smoothed by means of infimal convolution, and it is shown that the Pareto solution of the approximate smooth problem can be made arbitrarily close to the solution of the original nonsmooth problem. Performance bounds are established under conditions that are weaker than assumed before in the literature and, hence, applicable to a broader class of adaptation and learning problems.},

Complexity is then controlled using a regularizer, e.g., the RKHS norm, able to encode smoothness and stability information. Examples are RKHSs induced by the so-called stable spline or tuned-correlated kernels, which contain a parameter that regulates impulse response exponential decay. In this article, we derive nonasymptotic upper bounds on the $\ell _2$ error of these regularized schemes and study their optimality in order (in the minimax sense). Under white noise inputs and Gaussian measurement noises, we obtain conditions which ensure the optimal convergence rate for all the class of stable spline estimators and several generalizations.

In this article, we propose a new approach for online estimation and control of networked DES with control delays. We first propose a new state estimation algorithm for the closed-loop system utilizing the information of control decision history. The proposed state estimation algorithm can be implemented recursively upon the occurrence of each new observable event. Then we investigate how to predict the effect of control delays in order to calculate a control decision online at each instant. We show that the proposed online supervisor can be updated effectively and the resulting closed-loop behavior is safe. Furthermore, we compare the proposed online supervisor with the predictive supervisor proposed in the literature and show that our proposed online supervisor is more permissive than predictive supervisor in the sense of language inclusion.},

This technique is, therefore, relevant for the near-optimal control of nonlinear switched systems for which the switching signal is the control, and no continuous input is present. However, OP exhibits several limitations, which prevent its desired application in a standard control engineering context, as it requires, for instance, that the stage cost takes values in $[0, 1]$ , an unnatural prerequisite, and that the cost function is discounted. In this article, we modify OP to overcome these limitations, and we call the new algorithm ${\rm OP}_{\text{min}}$ . We then analyze ${\rm OP}_{\text{min}}$ under general stabilizability and detectability assumptions on the system and the stage cost. New near-optimality and performance guarantees for ${\rm OP}_{\text{min}}$ are derived, which have major advantages compared to those originally given for OP. We also prove that a system whose inputs are generated by ${\rm OP}_{\text{min}}$ in a receding-horizon fashion exhibits stability properties. As a result, ${\rm OP}_{\text{min}}$ provides a new tool for the near-optimal, stable control of nonlinear switched discrete-time systems for generic cost functions.},

Weight flows are generated as new events occur, which are required to satisfy some quantitative conditions. We focus on mean weights (payoffs) over a finite number of events, which serve as a measure for the stability or robustness of weight flows. The range of events to evaluate the mean payoff is termed a window, which slides as new events occur. Qualitative requirements such as safety and liveness are also necessary along with quantitative requirements. Supervisory control is employed to manipulate the operation of the system so that the requirements are satisfied. We consider two different scenarios based on whether the window size is fixed or not. Correspondingly, we formulate two supervisory control problems, both of which are solved sequentially by first tackling the qualitative issues and then the quantitative ones. The automaton model is then transformed to a two-player game between the supervisor and the environment, where safety and liveness are enforced. Based on the intermediate results, several quantitative objectives are defined to formulate two games, which correspond to the two proposed supervisory control problems. Finally, we synthesize provably correct supervisors by solving the games and completely resolve both problems.},

In this article, we introduce adaptive CBFs (aCBFs) that can accommodate time-varying control bounds and noise in the system dynamics while also guaranteeing the feasibility of the QPs if the original quadratic cost optimization problem itself is feasible, which is a challenging problem in current approaches. We propose two different types of aCBFs: parameter-adaptive CBF (PACBF) and relaxation-adaptive CBF (RACBF). Central to aCBFs is the introduction of appropriate time-varying functions to modify the definition of a common CBF. These time-varying functions are treated as high-order CBFs with their own auxiliary dynamics, which are stabilized by CLFs. We demonstrate the advantages of using aCBFs over the existing CBF techniques by applying both the PACBF-based method and the RACBF-based method to a cruise control problem with time-varying road conditions and noise in the system dynamics, and compare their relative performance.},

The objective is to design an optimal estimator of the public random variable such that the leakage of private information, via the estimation process, is kept below a certain level. The privacy metric is defined as the discrete conditional entropy of the private variable given the output of the estimator. We show that the optimal privacy-aware estimator is the solution of a (possibly infinite-dimensional) convex optimization problem when the estimator has access to either the measurement or the measurement together with the private information. We study the optimal perfect-privacy estimation problem that ensures the estimate of the public variable is independent of the private information. A necessary and sufficient condition is derived guaranteeing that an estimator satisfies the perfect-privacy requirement. It is shown that the optimal perfect-privacy estimator is the solution of a linear optimization problem. A sufficient condition for its existence is derived. The impact of the distribution mismatch on the perfect-privacy condition is studied. Numerical examples are used to illustrate the privacy-accuracy tradeoff.},

We deal with stochastic optimization problem with the setting that utility functions are disturbed by some nonadditive stochastic process. We consider a more challenging situation where the learning method has to be performed only based on a scalar approximation of the utility function, rather than its closed-form expression, so that the typical gradient descent method cannot be applied. This setting is quite realistic when the network is affected by some stochastic and time-varying process, and that each node cannot have the full knowledge of the network states.

  abstract     = {Consider a network of $N$ providers that each has a certain supply of energy and $B$ consumers that each has a certain demand. The efficiency of transmitting energy between providers and consumers is modeled using a weighted bipartite graph $G$ . Our goal is to maximize the amount of utilized energy using a distributed algorithm that each provider runs locally. We propose a noncooperative energy-allocation game and adopt the best-response dynamics for this game as our distributed algorithm. We prove that the best-response dynamics converge in no more than $N$ steps to one of at most $N!$ pure Nash equilibria (NE) of our game. However, we show that these NE can be very inefficient. Remarkably, our algorithm avoids the inefficient NE and achieves asymptotically (in $B$ ) optimal performance in “almost all” games. The traditional game-theoretic analysis using a potential function does not explain this encouraging finding. To fill this gap, we analyze the best-response dynamics in a random game, where the network is generated using a random model for the graph $G$ . We prove that the ratio between the utilized energy of our algorithm and that of the optimal solution converges to one in probability as $B$ increases (and $N$ is any function of $B$ ). Numerical simulations demonstrate that our asymptotic analysis is valid even for $B=10$ consumers. Our novel random games approach analytically explains why the performance of our algorithm is asymptotically optimal almost always despite the fact that bad NE may exist.},

  abstract     = {This article is concerned with the distributed estimation and control problem for time-varying large-scale interconnected systems (LISs). A novel decoupling strategy with sequential-structure is developed to deal with the interconnected terms in large-scale systems. Then, by using the idea of bounded recursive optimization, the local estimator gain for each subsystem is designed by solving self-relative convex optimization problem that is constructed based on each subsystem’s own information and its neighboring information. In this case, such design scheme of each local estimator can realize fully distributed estimation. Based on the distributed estimator, fully distributed estimator-based control method is also designed by constructing self-relative convex optimization problems. Notice that the solutions to the above-constructed convex optimization problems can be easily obtained by the standard software packages, and the computational complexity of each optimization problem is low even though the scale of interconnected systems is large. Furthermore, stability conditions are derived such that the designed distributed estimator and controller for time-varying LISs are asymptotically bounded. Finally, two illustrative examples are employed to show the effectiveness of the proposed methods.},

  abstract     = {In this article, a new probability distribution, referred to as the matrix Fisher–Gaussian distribution, is proposed on the product manifold of three-dimensional special orthogonal group and Euclidean space. It is constructed by conditioning a multivariate Gaussian distribution from the ambient Euclidean space into the manifold, while imposing a certain geometric constraint on the correlation term to avoid over parameterization. The unique feature is that it may represent large uncertainties in attitudes, linear variables of an arbitrary dimension, and angular–linear correlations between them in a global fashion without singularities. Various stochastic properties and an approximate maximum likelihood estimator are developed. Furthermore, two methods are developed to propagate uncertainties through a stochastic differential equation representing attitude kinematics. Based on these, a Bayesian estimator is proposed to estimate the attitude and time-varying gyro bias concurrently. Numerical studies indicate that the proposed estimator provides more accurate estimates against the multiplicative extended Kalman filter and unscented Kalman filter for challenging cases.},

It should be stressed that we impose the average dwell-time (ADT) condition for destabilizing impulses and reverse average dwell-time (RADT) condition for stabilizing impulses to restrain the occurrence of impulses, which extends the fixed dwell-time condition in recent literature. Moreover, the ADT and RADT conditions in this article correspond to the average impulsive interval method in most existing results under the exponential ISS-Lyapunov condition. As a subsequent result, the ISS and SISS of impulsive stochastic interconnected systems on networks are also studied by the Lyapunov method and graph-theoretic technique.

  abstract     = {In this article a novel nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) scheme is derived, which is tailored to the underlying structure of the intrinsic description of geometrically exact nonlinear beams (in which velocities and strains are primary variables). This is an important class of partial differential equation (PDE) models whose behavior is fundamental to the performance of flexible structural systems (e.g., wind turbines, high-altitude long-endurance aircraft). Furthermore, this class contains the much-studied Euler–Bernoulli and Timoshenko beam models, but has significant additional complexity (to capture 3-D effects and arbitrarily large displacements) and requires explicit computation of rotations in the PDE dynamics to account for orientation-dependent forces. A challenge presented by this formulation is that uncontrollable modes necessarily appear in any finite dimensional approximation to the PDE dynamics. We show, however, that an NMPC scheme can be constructed in which the error introduced by the uncontrollable modes can be explicitly controlled. It is demonstrated that the asymptotic error can be made insignificant (from a practical perspective) using our NMPC scheme and excellent performance is obtained even when applied to a highly resolved numerical simulation of the PDEs. We also present a generalization of Kelvin–Voigt damping to the intrinsic description of geometrically exact beams. Finally, special emphasis is placed on constructing a framework suitable for real-time NMPC control, where the particular structure of the underlying PDEs is exploited to obtain both efficient finite-dimensional models and numerical schemes.},

This is physically important since the covariance matrix $\tau I/2$ , $\tau &amp;gt; 1$ , corresponds to a quantum thermal state.

An extension to the case where $V=S\operatorname{diag}(\Lambda,\Lambda ) S^{\top }/2$ with $\Lambda &amp;gt; I$ being a diagonal matrix and $S$ being a symplectic matrix will also be considered.

  abstract     = {The problem of effective use of phasor measurement units (PMUs) to enhance power systems awareness and security is a topic of key interest. The central question to solve is how to use these new measurements to reconstruct the state of the system. In this article, we provide the first solution to the problem of (globally convergent) state estimation of multimachine power systems equipped with PMUs and described by the fourth-order flux-decay model. This article is a significant extension of our previous result, where this problem was solved for the simpler third-order model, for which it is possible to recover algebraically part of the unknown state. Unfortunately, this property is lost in the more accurate fourth-order model, and we are confronted with the problem of estimating the full state vector. The design of the observer relies on two recent developments proposed by the authors, a parameter estimation based approach to the problem of state estimation and the use of the dynamic regressor extension and mixing (DREM) technique to estimate these parameters. The use of DREM allows us to overcome the problem of lack of persistent excitation that stymies the application of standard parameter estimation designs. Simulation results illustrate the latter fact and show the improved performance of the proposed observer with respect to a locally stable gradient-descent-based observer.},

Based on the proposed ETM, some sufficient conditions are derived to ensure the robust stabilization of the LTI systems and to exclude Zeno phenomenon. It is shown that the system states are ultimately bounded under the ETIC, and the ultimate bound can be arbitrarily small by selecting the appropriate parameter of ETM. More interestingly, it is proved that our obtained results can well deal with the case of unknown bounded external disturbances, which is often addressed by the adaptive control in the previous results. Then, the theoretical results are applied to the motor servo systems in the presence of external disturbances. Finally, two illustrative examples are presented to show the validity of the results.},

In particular, we determine locations that optimize scalar measures of observability and controllability using greedy matrix QR pivoting on the dominant modes of the direct and adjoint balancing transformations. Pivoting runtime scales linearly with the state dimension, making this method tractable for high-dimensional systems.

Furthermore, whereas strict QSR-dissipativity is only sufficient for SOF asymptotic stabilization, it is proved to be necessary and sufficient for full state feedback control.

However, in the existing works, the independence and the distribution function limitation are imposed on the sojourn time of semi-Markov jump systems. In this article, without additional constraints for the sojourn time, the problem of almost surely exponential stability is investigated for semi-Markov jump stochastic nonlinear systems by developing a new stochastic analysis method. In addition, mode-dependent linear comparable relationships are assumed among Lyapunov like functions, which can effectively reduce the conservatism caused by mode-independent case.

In this NCSs model, the controller 2 (C2) shares its observations and part of its historical control inputs with the controller 1 (C1), whereas C2 cannot obtain the information of C1 due to network constraints. Under the linear control strategies assumption, we present the optimal estimators for C1 and C2 respectively based on asymmetric observations. Since the information for C1 and C2 are asymmetric, the estimation error covariance (EEC) is coupled with the controller which means that the classical separation principle fails. By applying the Pontryagin’s maximum principle, we obtain a solution to the forward and backward stochastic difference equations. Based on this solution, we derive the optimal controllers to minimize a quadratic cost function. Combining the linear optimal controllers with the EEC, the controller C1 is decoupled from the EEC. It should be emphasized that the control gain is dependent on the estimation gain. What is more, the estimation gain satisfies the forward Riccati equation and the control gain satisfies the backward Riccati equation which makes the problem more challenging. We propose iterative solutions to the Riccati equations and give a suboptimal solution to the optimal decentralized control problem.},

The difficulty in solving such problem lies in that the continuity property of the well-used linear sliding function is lost under the intermittent impulsive action. In order to overcome this difficulty, a piecewise linear sliding function considering the dynamics properties of impulses is introduced, which turns out to be continuous along the trajectories of the impulsive system. Then, a suitable integral SMC law with switching feedback gains is constructed to guarantee the reachability of the designed sliding surface in a finite time. The resulting sliding-mode dynamics is modeled by an impulsive switched system whose stability is analyzed by applying a piecewise discontinuous Lyapunov function. Next, a sufficient condition for the existence of integral SMC law is derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities. Finally, a numerical example with several different types of impulses is provided to validate the theoretical results, which shows that the switching gain-based design contributes to the robustness of the sliding-mode controller.},

The state of the environment evolves with a dynamics that is affected by the strategies of players as an input to the model. The players of NAG are modeled as myopic selfish agents who observe the decision value of their neighbors and the state of the environment with some time delay and, then, adjust their decisions using a projected subgradient rule. The main contribution of this article is to provide conditions in which the strategies of myopic agents converge to the unique fixed-point Nash equilibrium point of the proposed dynamic NAG. Furthermore, as a case study, the framework is applied to a wireless network by modeling the service providers as the agents and evolution of service selection by users as the dynamics of the environment.},

Then, two special cases are considered and the main results are extended to MIMO systems. Finally, a simulation example confirms the validity of the results.

We model this problem in a multiperiod single-product setting.We propose a model that incorporates the randomness of product sales and failures to explicitly characterize the time-varying behavior of the warranty demand, which allows the firm to dynamically manage the reserve fund. Since the firm will eventually discontinue the product, we investigate a multiperiod dynamic reserve planning model to optimize warranty reserve levels over a finite horizon. We derive a closed-form expression of time-dependent warranty demand with general product sales and failure distributions. From the perspective of after-sales service, this result can be used to explain the dynamics involved in demand for warranty service. With the objective of minimizing the discounted total loss, we obtain the optimal reserve-setting policy and prove that the firm should set the reserve fund at either zero or a warranty-demand-dependent base stock level. To show the applicability and flexibility of our model, numerical experiments are conducted for some typical sales patterns and the Weibull lifetime distribution.},

Particularly, a sufficient and necessary condition that guarantees the existence of equilibria is determined. Then, the conditions to guarantee that the system has at least one stable equilibrium are determined. First, a sufficient condition for power-flow solvability of the dc-distribution networks is obtained based on the monotone convergence theorem. Then, the sufficient and necessary condition is obtained based on the successive approximations. When the system has multiple equilibria, it is proved that only the high-voltage equilibrium is stabilizable and all the low-voltage equilibria are inherently unstable and unstabilizable under droop control. Moreover, the robust stability condition for the high-voltage equilibrium is obtained by analyzing the eigenvalues of the linearized system dynamics. Overall, the obtained conditions provide references for building reliable dc-distribution networks.},

The second theorem allows the system to include perturbations such as unmodeled dynamics, slope-restricted nonlinearities, and time delay, using integral quadratic constraint (IQCs) to capture their input/output behavior. This in turn allows for off-by-one IQCs to refine the description of activation functions by capturing their slope restrictions. Both results rely on semidefinite programming to approximate the ROA.

Accordingly, a relevant sufficient condition is proposed for SATO convergence. Based on this formulation of SATO convergence, the classical and norm-normalized (NN) sign functions are revisited. Their differences are studied with applications in sliding-mode control design. Both functions (expectedly when properly invoked) contribute to system stability, while the NN sign function enables the system to accomplish SATO convergence. This finding shows the distinctive merit of the NN sign function in achieving more than finite-time stability for a sliding-mode control system. Extensions to the scenario with a networked system are studied, where, using the NN sign function, the networked system (now with the SATO convergence property) drives all the agents to reach consensus simultaneously. Additionally, for double integrator systems and Euler–Lagrange systems, singularity-free sliding-mode control laws are designed and demonstrated to achieve SATO convergence.},

It makes the power converter behave as a virtual synchronous machine (VSM). The three channels are designed to, respectively, generate the frequency and the flux of the VSM and a third quantity that is necessary for forming the lossless interconnection. It is proven that the closed-loop system is passive without the need of assuming constant frequency, constant voltage, and/or constant loads. It is sufficient to only assume that the load can be described as a passive pH model. Hence, the proposed control framework is very generic.},

Although TERMDPs are generally formulated as nonconvex optimization problems, an analytical necessary optimality condition can be expressed as a finite set of nonlinear equations, based on which an iterative forward–backward computational procedure similar to the Arimoto–Blahut algorithm is developed. It is shown that every limit point of the sequence generated by the proposed algorithm is a stationary point of the TERMDP. Applications of TERMDPs are discussed in the context of networked control systems theory and nonequilibrium thermodynamics.

The proposed nonlinear control law is composed of two nonlinear adaptive gains. Such adaptive gains allow the control to counteract the effects of some perturbations and nonlinear unmodeled dynamics ensuring asymptotic convergence of the tracking error to zero, and the boundedness of the adaptive gains. The nonlinear controller synthesis is given by a constructive method based on the solution of linear matrix inequalities. Besides, the simulation results show that, due to the nonlinearities, the rate of convergence of the proposed algorithm is faster than that provided by a classic MRAC.},

Different from existing literature, this article extends the case to general partition graphs, including both acyclic and cyclic partition cases. New analysis methods are put forward. It is proved that, under some basic assumptions, the multiagent systems can achieve CCRCS if and only if the interaction topology satisfies the nonvicious circle condition, which is proposed for the first time. An algorithm is presented which can check whether a given interaction topology satisfies the nonvicious circle condition.

  abstract     = {Multiagent policy evaluation and seeking are long-standing challenges in developing theories for multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL), due to multidimensional learning goals, nonstationary environment, and scalability issues in the joint policy space. This article introduces two metrics grounded on a game-theoretic solution concept called sink equilibrium, for the evaluation, ranking, and computation of policies in multiagent learning. We adopt strict best response dynamics (SBRDs) to model selfish behaviors at a meta-level for MARL. Our approach can deal with dynamical cyclical behaviors (unlike approaches based on Nash equilibria and Elo ratings), and is more compatible with single-agent reinforcement learning than $\alpha$ -rank, which relies on weakly better responses. We first consider settings where the difference between the largest and second largest equilibrium metric has a known lower bound. With this knowledge, we propose a class of perturbed SBRD with the following property: only policies with maximum metric are observed with nonzero probability for a broad class of stochastic games with finite memory. We then consider settings where the lower bound for the difference is unknown. For this setting, we propose a class of perturbed SBRD such that the metrics of the policies observed with nonzero probability differ from the optimal by any given tolerance. The proposed perturbed SBRD addresses the scalability issue and opponent-induced nonstationarity by fixing the strategies of others for the learning agent, and uses empirical game-theoretic analysis to estimate payoffs for each strategy profile obtained due to the perturbation.},

This formulation is a generalization of the formulation in the Chernoff–Stein lemma to an active setting. The second problem is a symmetric formulation in which the objective is to minimize the misclassification probability while ensuring that the true hypothesis is declared conclusively with moderately high probability. For these problems, lower and upper bounds on the optimal misclassification probabilities are derived and these bounds are shown to be asymptotically tight. Novel experiment selection strategies are provided. It is shown that these strategies are asymptotically optimal and using numerical experiments, it is demonstrated that these strategies have a significantly better performance in the nonasymptotic regime.},

Global stabilization of rigid formation in arbitrary dimensional spaces still remains open and challenging. This article provides a general solution to this open problem based on the sliding mode control idea. The control law design consists of two parts: the main control force regulates the trajectories of all agents to reach a sliding surface defined by an affine formation space in finite time and remain in it thereafter; the extra control force governs certain chosen leader agents towards the desired formation in the sliding surface. The article then presents in detail two approaches for designing the extra control force, one based on distance constraints and the other based on relative position constraints. For the first time, the proposed sliding mode formation control laws solve the open problem of (almost) global and finite-time stabilization of affine, rigid, and translational formations in any dimensional space.

We utilize the notion of conditional mutual information to evaluate the information being shared among the agents. The challenges that arise due to the interdependence of agents’ information structure and decision making are exhibited. For the finite horizon game, we prove that agents do not have incentive to share information. In contrast, we show that cooperation can be sustained in the infinite-horizon case by devising appropriate punishment strategies, which are defined over the agents’ beliefs on the system state. We show that these strategies are closed under the best-response mapping and that cooperation can be the optimal choice in some subsets of the state belief simplex. We characterize these equilibrium regions , prove uniqueness of a maximal equilibrium region, and devise an algorithm for its approximate computation.},

Using these subsets, it is shown that, if initially the pursuer is distant enough from the evader, then the feedback saddle point strategies for both the pursuer and the evader are coincident with one of the common tangents from the minimum radius turning circles of the pursuer to the minimum radius turning circles of the evader. Using geometry, four feasible tangents are identified and the feedback $\min -\max$ strategy for the pursuer and the $\max \text{--}\min$ strategy for the evader are derived by solving a $2\times 2$ matrix game at each instant.

  abstract     = {We consider the following communication scenario. An encoder causally observes the Wiener process and decides when and what to transmit about it. A decoder estimates the process using causally received codewords in real time. We determine the causal encoding and decoding policies that jointly minimize the mean-square estimation error, under the long-term communication rate constraint of $R$ bits per second. We show that an optimal encoding policy can be implemented as a causal sampling policy followed by a causal compressing policy. We prove that the optimal encoding policy samples the Wiener process once the innovation passes either $\sqrt{\frac{1}{R}}$ or $-\sqrt{\frac{1}{R}}$ and compresses the sign of innovation (SOI) using a 1-bit codeword. The SOI coding scheme achieves the operational distortion-rate function, which is equal to $D^{\mathrm{op}}(R)=\frac{1}{6R}$ . Surprisingly, this is significantly better than the distortion-rate tradeoff achieved in the limit of infinite delay by the best noncausal code. This is because the SOI coding scheme leverages the free timing information supplied by the zero-delay channel between the encoder and the decoder. The key to unlocking that gain is the event-triggered nature of the SOI sampling policy. In contrast, the distortion-rate tradeoffs achieved with deterministic sampling policies are much worse: we prove that the causal informational distortion-rate function in that scenario is as high as $D_{\mathrm{DET}}(R) = \frac{5}{6R}$ . It is achieved by the uniform sampling policy with the sampling interval $\frac{1}{R}$ . In either case, the optimal strategy is to sample the process as fast as possible and to transmit 1-bit codewords to the decoder without delay. We show that the SOI coding scheme also minimizes the mean-square cost of a continuous-time control system driven by the Wiener process and controlled via rate-constrained impulses.},

  abstract     = {Through the combination of contraction mapping and pseudospectral method, we propose a successive approximation technique to approximate the solution of a class of regulator equations with periodic exosystems and hyperbolic zero dynamics. In this scheme, the initial points of flows on the zero-error constrained manifolds are approximated successively as the fixed point of a contractive integral mapping. Accordingly, flows are obtained by utilizing the scaled Fourier–Gauss–Radau collocation method. Appropriate error analysis, in association with both regulation error and the error resulting from the approximate solution of the center manifold equation, is provided. Our analysis shows that the regulation error becomes negligible as we start the approximation process at an adequately large order and maintain it for a proper number of iterations.},

A classical sufficient condition was obtained in this journal in 1973, which, unfortunately, is not algebraically verifiable, and the required control inputs to achieve state transition are unknown. However, based on a recently established notion, near-controllability, we propose a seeking nonzero entries approach to derive fully algebraically verifiable controllability criteria for discrete-time bilinear systems. More specifically, by our approach, the verification of controllability of the systems is transformed into the problem of seeking nonzero entries of a sequence of matrices generated by the two system matrices. In addition, the control inputs steering the controllable systems between any given pair of states can be easily computed by proposing two algorithms based on near-controllability. As applications, the seeking nonzero entries approach is generalized to construct arbitrary-finite-dimensional controllable discrete-time bilinear systems and also to prove positive-controllability of discrete-time bilinear systems, where algebraic criteria are obtained by the root locus theory and positive-near-controllability that is a new notion introduced in this article. Examples are provided to illustrate the obtained algebraic controllability criteria and algorithms.},

A characterization of the problem solvability is deduced. We point out that the ideal problems cannot be solved in practice because they unrealistically require that the Brownian motion affecting the system is available for feedback. Drawing from the ideal solution, we formulate and solve approximate versions of the full-information and output-feedback problems, which do not yield perfect asymptotic tracking but can be solved in a realistic scenario. These solutions rely on two key ideas: First, we introduce a discrete-time a posteriori estimator of the variations of the Brownian motion obtained causally by sampling the system state or output; second, we introduce a hybrid state observer and a hybrid regulator scheme which employ the estimated Brownian variations. The approximate solution tends to the ideal as the sampling period tends to zero. The proposed theory is validated by the regulation of a circuit subject to electromagnetic noise.},

  abstract     = {We address the problem of synthesizing provably correct controllers for linear systems with reach-avoid specifications. Discrete abstraction-based controller synthesis techniques have been developed for linear and nonlinear systems with various types of specifications. However, these methods typically suffer from the state space explosion problem. Our solution decomposes the overall synthesis problem into two smaller, and more tractable problems: one synthesis problem for an open-loop controller, which can produce a reference trajectory, and a second for synthesizing a tracking controller, which can enforce the other trajectories to follow the reference trajectory. As a key building-block result, we show that, once a tracking controller is fixed, the reachable states from an initial neighborhood, subject to any disturbance, can be overapproximated by a sequence of ellipsoids, with shapes that are independent of the open-loop controller. Hence, the open-loop controller can be synthesized independently to meet the reach-avoid specification for an initial neighborhood. Moreover, we are able to reduce the problem of synthesizing open-loop controllers to satisfiability problems over quantifier-free linear real arithmetic. The number of linear constraints in the satisfiability problem is linear to the number of hyperplanes as the surfaces of the polytopic obstacles and goal sets. The overall synthesis algorithm, computes a tracking controller, and then iteratively covers the entire initial set to find open-loop controllers for initial neighborhoods. The algorithm is sound and, for a class of robust systems, is also complete. We implement this synthesis algorithm in a tool RealSyn ver 2.0 and use it on several benchmarks with up to 20 dimensions. Experiment results are very promising: RealSyn ver 2.0 can find controllers for most of the benchmarks in seconds.},

The distinction between these two performance metrics centers on the equilibria that they focus on: the price of anarchy characterizes the quality of the worst-performing equilibria, while the price of the stability characterizes the quality of the best-performing equilibria. While much of the literature focuses on these metrics from an analysis perspective, in this article, we consider these performance metrics from a design perspective. Specifically, we focus on the setting where a system operator is tasked with designing local agent utility functions to optimize these performance metrics in a class of games termed covering games. Our main result characterizes a fundamental tradeoff between the price of anarchy and price of the stability in the form of a fully explicit Pareto frontier. Within this setup, we observe that optimizing the price of anarchy comes directly at the expense of the price of stability (and vice versa). Our second result demonstrates how a system operator could incorporate an additional piece of system-level information into the design of the agents’ utility functions to breach these limitations and improve the efficiency guarantees associated with the resulting equilibria. Informally, this valuable piece of system-level information pertains to the value of the largest uncovered resource in our covering game.},

We consider a communication protocol described by a strictly stationary, ergodic, sequentially primitive sequence of nonnegative matrices, applied iteratively to a pair of fixed initial vectors, the components of which are called values and weights defined at the nodes of a network. The subject of ratio consensus problems is to study the asymptotic properties of ratios of values and weights at each node, expecting convergence to the same limit for all nodes. The main results of this article provide upper bounds for the rate of the almost sure exponential convergence in terms of the spectral gap associated with the given sequence of random matrices. It will be shown that these upper bounds are sharp. Our results complement previous results of Picci and Taylor in 2013 and Iutzeler et al. in 2013.},

The desired formation shape is specified by a set of interior angle constraints. To realize the maneuver of translation, rotation, and scaling of the formation as a whole, we intentionally force the agents to maintain mismatched desired angles by introducing a pair of mismatch parameters for each angle constraint. To allow different information requirements in the design and implementation stages, we consider both measurement-dependent and measurement-independent mismatches. Starting from a triangular formation, we consider generically angle rigid formations that can be constructed from the triangular formation by adding new agents in sequence, each having two angle constraints associated with some existing three agents. The control law for each newly added agent arises naturally from the angle constraints and makes full use of the angle mismatch parameters. We show that the control can effectively stabilize the formations while simultaneously realizing maneuvering. Simulations are conducted to validate the theoretical results.},

We prove that a class of decentralized monotone flow-dependent tolls allows for globally stabilizing the transportation network around a generalized Wardrop equilibrium. In particular, our results imply that using decentralized marginal cost tolls, stability of the dynamic transportation network is guaranteed around the social optimum traffic assignment. This is particularly remarkable as such dynamic feedback tolls can be computed in a fully local way without the need for any global information about the network structure, its state, or the exogenous network loads. Through numerical simulations, we also compare the performance of such decentralized dynamic feedback marginal cost tolls with constant offline (and centrally) optimized tolls both in the asymptotic and in the transient regime, and we investigate their robustness to information delays.},

The condition involves the Jacobian of the system at possible equilibria and ensures that the system is in fact locally exponentially stable. We apply this result to the susceptible–infected–susceptible (SIS) networked epidemic model, and a generalized Lotka–Volterra system. We use the result further to extend the SIS model via the introduction of decentralized feedback controllers, which significantly change the system dynamics, rendering existing Lyapunov-based approaches invalid. Using the Poincaré–Hopf approach, we identify a necessary and sufficient condition, under which the controlled SIS system has a unique nonzero equilibrium (a diseased steady state), and monotone systems theory is used to show that this nonzero equilibrium is attractive for all nonzero initial conditions. A counterpart condition for the existence of a unique equilibrium for a nonlinear discrete-time dynamical system is also presented.},

  abstract     = {The optimal linear estimation problem is studied for multirate sampling systems with multiple random measurement time delays (TDs). The considered multirate sampling scheme is that the sensor uniformly samples at a slow rate and the state uniformly updates at a fast rate. Known stochastic variable sequences obeying Bernoulli distributions are adopted to depict random measurement TDs, including missing measurements as a special case. First, using a state iterating method, the original system with multirate sampling and delayed measurements is transformed into a state-space model with single-rate sampling and delay-free measurements at measurement sampling (MS) instants. Then, by utilizing projection theory, a nonaugmented recursive optimal linear state filter is presented based on the established model in the linear minimum variance sense, where the estimators for the process noise are involved. Furthermore, the state estimator at state update instants is achieved through filtering or prediction based on the filter at MS instants. Finally, the centralized fusion estimator and the distributed covariance intersection fusion estimator are proposed for the multisensor case. Simulation research on a vehicle suspension system verifies the effectiveness of the algorithms.},

For a given MPA, a formal procedure is first proposed for constructing its observer by extending our previous concept of observer for unambiguous MPAs to polynomially ambiguous MPAs. As an application, we present a necessary and sufficient condition based on the constructed observer to check the critical observability of MPAs. The state set of an MPA is divided into two disjoint subsets, i.e., the set of critical states and the set of noncritical states. A system is critically observable if the set of all states that are consistent with any observation is either a subset of the critical states set or a subset of the noncritical states set.},

In this article, a pinning control intervention is studied for global stabilization of Boolean networks (BNs) under knock-out perturbation. Knock-out perturbation means that logical variables of some nodes of a BN remain 0 s. In order to reduce the impact of perturbation on stability, a pinning control approach is proposed to maintain global stabilization for the rest nodes other than those knocked out nodes, based on the network structure (the connection rule among nodes). Compared with the existing references, the proposed pinning control dramatically reduces the high computational complexity. In addition, the design of pinning controllers is based on local neighbors’ information. Finally, the proposed method is well demonstrated by a mammalian cell cycle network and a network with 30 nodes.},

However, the convergence time, although finite, grows unboundedly with the norm of the initial differentiation error, making it uncertain when the estimated derivative is exact. In this article, we propose an extension of Levant’s differentiator so that the worst-case convergence time can be arbitrarily assigned independently of the initial condition, i.e., the estimation converges in fixed time .

To overcome these disadvantages, a new transformation for dynamic probability density function is given by kernel density estimation using interpolation. Based upon this transformation, a representative model has been developed while the stochastic distribution control problem has been transformed into an optimization problem. Then, data-based direct optimization and identification-based indirect optimization have been proposed. In addition, the convergences of the presented algorithms are analysed and the effectiveness of these algorithms has been evaluated by numerical examples. In summary, the contributions of this article are as follows: 1) a new data-based probability density function transformation is given; 2) the optimization algorithms are given based on the presented model; and 3) a new research framework is demonstrated as the potential extensions to the existing stochastic distribution control.},

Under the proposed design, we address the problem of restoring the classical separation principle for the event-based design. We show that fast enough sampling at the sensor-to-observer channel suffices to ensure a separation principle. In contrast, under fast sampling at the controller-to-actuator channel, a separation principle can be obtained provided that an additional mild assumption is imposed on the stability matrices.

Second, we forward-engineer the system by applying a corresponding faster algorithm to solve this optimization problem. Finally, by comparing the original and accelerated dynamics, we obtain the implementation of the redesigned part (the extra dynamics). As a result, the convergence rate/speed or transient behavior of the given system can be improved, while the system control structure is maintained.

  abstract     = {A robust adaptive control allocation algorithm with actuator failure compensation is presented in this article for a class of cascade ODE-string systems depicted by ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and partial differential equations. The proposed control scheme including actuator fault compensation and allocation algorithm uniformly stabilizes the cascade ODE-string system in the presence of actuator faults, parameter uncertainties and environmental perturbations, and effectively reduces the controller complexity by adaptively grouping redundant actuators. Since this control method needs full-state measurement of the ODE system, it can be regarded as a state-feedback control instead of an output-feedback control. Control design and proof of the closed-loop system stability are implemented by Lyapunov’s direct method. Numerical simulations are finally analyzed to illustrate the feasibility of the proposed control scheme.},

In particular, we assume that this is done by tampering with the sensor-readings in the sensor communication channel. Specifically, we use Petri nets as the reference formalism to model the plant and assume a control specification in terms of a generalized mutual exclusion constraint. We propose three different methods to derive a control policy that is robust to the possible replacement attacks. The first two methods lead to an optimal (i.e., maximally permissive) policy but are computationally inefficient when applied to large-size systems. On the contrary, the third method computes a policy more efficiently and reveals more easily implementable in practice. However, this is done at the expense of optimality.},

For this purpose, an iterative procedure based on robust (parameter-dependent) linear matrix inequalities (LMI) is proposed. Unlike most approaches, where the controller is obtained by means of a change of variables, the synthesis conditions deal with the control gain directly as an optimization variable, which is specially appealing to cope with closed-loop positivity or structural constraints. The existence of feasible initial conditions for the iterative procedure and some relaxation strategies adopted to reduce the conservativeness of the method are also discussed. Numerical examples borrowed from the literature and statistical comparisons show that the proposed technique is in general less conservative than other approaches, providing solutions and handling cases where traditional design techniques for positive systems cannot be applied.},

A hybrid system model is introduced to incorporate the aforementioned communication imperfections and facilitate the analysis on internal stability and $\mathcal {L}_2$ ( $\mathcal {L}_\infty$ ) performance of closed-loop systems. A novel Lyapunov functional candidate is proposed to establish the stability condition in terms of maximally allowable transmission intervals (MATIs) and maximally allowable delays (MADs).

While the systems are physically independent, their optimal controller design problems may, in general, become coupled, due to network contention, if the schedulers trigger transmissions based on state-dependent events. In this article, we propose a class of probabilistic admissible schedulers for which the optimal controllers, with respect to local standard linear-quardatic Gaussian (LQG) costs, have the certainty equivalence property and can still be determined decentrally. Then, two subclasses of scheduling policies within this class are introduced; a nonevent-based subclass, so called purely stochastic transmission (PST) policy, and an event-based subclass, both with easily adjustable triggering probabilities at every time step. We then prove that, given a PST policy with given triggering probabilities and an associated closed-loop performance with optimal control law, we can find an event-based scheduler from the proposed subclass and with the same triggering probabilities for which the associated closed-loop performance with optimal control law is strictly superior. Moreover, we show that, for each closed-loop system, the optimal state estimators for both scheduling policies follows a linear iteration. Finally, we provide a method to regulate the triggering probabilities of the schedulers by maximizing a network utility function.},

Second, on the basis of such an output, a nonlinear generalization of the robust coordinated PSS-AVR is designed with the aim of enlarging the stability region and improving the transients about the unpredictable operating conditions determined by the faults. Its linear action coincides with the one provided by the robust coordinated PSS-AVR: the compelling simplicity of control structure (just one integrator is involved) and robust tuning procedure of the linear design are definitely inherited, with, additionally, no use of the mechanical input power.

  abstract     = {Control scheduling refers to the problem of assigning agents or actuators to act upon a dynamical system at specific times so as to minimize a quadratic control cost, such as the objectives of the linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) or linear quadratic regulator problems. When budget or operational constraints are imposed on the schedule, this problem is in general NP-hard and its solution can therefore only be approximated even for moderately sized systems. The quality of this approximation depends on the structure of both the constraints and the objective. This article shows that greedy control scheduling is near-optimal when the constraints can be written as an intersection of matroids, algebraic structures that encode requirements such as limits on the number of agents deployed per time slot, total number of actuator uses, and duty cycle restrictions. To do so, it proves that the LQG cost function is $\alpha$ -supermodular and provides new $\alpha /(\alpha + P)$ -optimality certificates for the greedy minimization of such functions over an intersection of $P$ matroids. These certificates are shown to approach the $1/(1+P)$ guarantee of supermodular functions in relevant settings. These results support the use of greedy algorithms in nonsupermodular quadratic control problems as opposed to typical heuristics such as convex relaxations and surrogate figures of merit, e.g., the $\log \det$ of the controllability Gramian.},

First, a method is proposed to reduce continuous path constraints of the switched systems into discrete abstract constraints in terms of the switch time vector and the input. Second, differentiability of the optimal value function, i.e., the cost function optimized over the input, is analyzed by using perturbation analysis theory. For a given switch time vector, the derivative of the optimal value function is proved equal to the derivative of the cost function evaluated at the optimal input provided that there is a unique optimal input in the optimal set of the cost function for continuous inputs. Third, a bilevel algorithm is proposed to find optimal switch times and the optimal input with guaranteed satisfaction of path constraints over the entire time horizon. At the inner level, the input is optimized by iteratively solving dynamic optimization problems of path-constrained switched systems with fixed switch time vector, and at the outer level, the fixed switch time vector is optimized by sequentially solving quadratic programs related to the optimal value function of switch time vectors. Fourth, it is rigorously proven that the bilevel algorithm terminates within a finite number of iterations.

  abstract     = {This article proposes a novel system identification method based on the notion of invariant subspace. It is shown that when the system input and output asymptotically converge onto an invariant subspace, a new form of regression can be obtained. New identification algorithms are then developed based on the obtained regression. The proposed method has several distinctive advantages originating from both time-domain and frequency-domain approaches. They include: 1) linear continuous-time models can be identified from slowly sampled input/output data; 2) consistency of the model parameters can be established in an error-in-variables framework; 3) the global optimum can be found by solving two linear least-square problems; and 4) the identification algorithms can be implemented online with explicit convergence rates. The theoretic results are tested by numerical examples to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {This article addresses sampled-data control of 2-D Kuramoto–Sivashinsky equation over a rectangular domain $\Omega$ . We suggest to divide the 2-D rectangular $\Omega$ into $N$ subdomains, where sensors provide spatially averaged or point state measurements to be transmitted through communication network to the controller. Note that, differently from 2-D heat equation, here, we manage with sampled-data control under point measurements. We design a regionally stabilizing sampled-data controller applied through distributed in space characteristic functions. Sufficient conditions ensuring regional stability of the closed-loop system are established in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). By solving these LMIs, we find an estimate on the set of initial conditions starting from which the state trajectories of the system are exponentially converging to zero. A numerical example demonstrates the efficiency of the results.},

First, using the notion of seminorm, we propose a geometric framework for semi-contraction theory. We introduce matrix semimeasures and characterize their properties. We show that the spectral abscissa of a matrix is the infimum over weighted semimeasures. For dynamical systems, we use the semimeasure of their Jacobian to characterize the contractivity properties of their trajectories. Second, for weakly contracting systems, we prove a dichotomy for the asymptotic behavior of their trajectories and novel sufficient conditions for convergence to an equilibrium. Third, we show that every trajectory of a doubly contracting system, i.e., a system that is both weakly and semi-contracting, converges to an equilibrium point. Finally, we apply our results to various important network systems, including affine averaging and affine flow systems, continuous-time distributed primal-dual algorithms, and networks of diffusively coupled dynamical systems. For diffusively coupled systems, the semi-contraction theory leads to a sufficient condition for synchronization that is sharper, in general, than previously known tests.},

The objective of the DETAT problem is to develop a group of distributed cooperative control algorithms with event-triggered strategies for agents to track the average of multiple time-varying reference signals. First, for homogeneous linear multiagent systems, based on sampling measurements and model-relied holding techniques, a class of static-gain DETAT algorithms is proposed with a couple of local event-triggered functions for estimators and controllers, respectively. Compared with the existing distributed average tracking (DAT) algorithms, the static-gain DETAT algorithms greatly reduce the cost over communication networks and the frequency of control protocol updates. Second, to reduce the chattering phenomenon caused by nonsmooth items in static-gain algorithms and requirements of the global information of networks, smooth dynamic-gain DETAT algorithms are introduced based on boundary layer approximation methods and self-adaptive principles. Third, for heterogeneous linear multiagent systems, a new algorithm is established by using the output regulation techniques for the heterogeneous DETAT problem. The outputs of heterogeneous agents can ultimately track the average of multiple time-varying reference signals. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time to study the DETAT problem for heterogeneous multiagent systems. Finally, some examples are presented to show the validity of theoretical results.},

The system model consists of a differential equation coupled with a set-valued relation that introduces discontinuities in the vector field at the boundaries of the constraint set. In particular, the set-valued relation is described by the subdifferential of the indicator function of a closed convex cone, which results in a cone-complementarity system. The question of analyzing the stability of such systems is addressed by constructing cone-copositive Lyapunov functions. As a first analytical result, we show that exponentially stable complementarity systems always admit a continuously differentiable cone-copositive Lyapunov function. Putting some more structure on the system vector field, such as homogeneity, we can show that the aforementioned functions can be approximated by a rational function of cone-copositive homogeneous polynomials. This latter class of functions is seen to be particularly amenable for numerical computation as we provide two types of algorithms for precisely that purpose. These algorithms consist of a hierarchy of either linear or semidefinite optimization problems for computing the desired cone-copositive Lyapunov function.

The receiver seeks to make mean-square-error estimate of a state based on a signal sent by the sender while the sender signals strategically in order to control the receiver’s estimate in a certain way. Such a scheme could model, e.g., deception and privacy, problems in multiagent systems. Existing solution concepts are not viable since here the receiver has continuous action space. We show that for finite state spaces, optimal signaling strategies can be computed through an equivalent linear optimization problem over the cone of completely positive matrices. We then establish its strong duality to a copositive program. To exemplify the effectiveness of this equivalence result, we adopt sequential polyhedral approximation of completely positive cones and analyze its performance numerically. We also quantify the approximation error for a quantized version of a continuous distribution and show that a semi-definite program relaxation of the equivalent problem could be a benchmark lower bound for the sender’s cost for large state spaces.},

Some approaches are illustrated for the searching of the initial feasible pairs, and an iterative procedure is proposed for the optimization of the feasible pairs. The usage and superiority of the obtained result are exhibited by numerical examples with simulations. As a base, the comparison principle for the functional differential inequalities and equations with arbitrary time-varying delays is studied first. As an application of the main result, the stability and control of the stochastic systems with time-varying coefficients and delays are investigated, with the main concern to the time variance. An asymptotic stability theorem and a criterion are established, and an interesting control strategy with unbounded time delay, namely the pantograph delay sampled data based feedback, is proposed.

We consider second-order systems and seek analytical characterization and exact computation of the PID delay margin, where by PID delay margin we mean the maximal range of delay values within which the system can be robustly stabilized by a PID controller. Our primary contribution is threefold. First, we show that the delay margin achieved by PID control coincides with that by PD controllers. Second, we show that the PID delay margin can be computed efficiently by solving a pseudoconcave unimodal problem, i.e., a univariate optimization problem that admits a unique maximum and, hence, is a convex optimization problem in one variable. Finally, we demonstrate analytically the tradeoff between achieving delay margin and tracking performance, showing that for several canonical performance criteria, integral control reduces the delay margin. These results lend useful insights into the PID control of delay systems, and useful guidelines in the tuning and analytical design of PID controllers.},

The advantage of this approach is that a simpler controller results and the control effort is reduced. By using this method, we design a new controller to guarantee that the equilibrium at the origin of the closed-loop system is prescribed-time mean-square stable.

  abstract     = {In this article, we study the Schrödinger bridge problem (SBP) with nonlinear prior dynamics. In control-theoretic language, this is a problem of minimum effort steering of a given joint state probability density function (PDF) to another over a finite-time horizon, subject to a controlled stochastic differential evolution of the state vector. As such, it can be seen as a stochastic optimal control problem in continuous time with endpoint density constraints—A topic that originated in the physics literature in 1930s, and in the recent years, has garnered burgeoning interest in the systems-control community. For generic nonlinear drift, we reduce the SBP to solving a system of forward and backward Kolmogorov partial differential equations (PDEs) that are coupled through the boundary conditions, with unknowns being the “Schrödinger factors”—so named since their product at any time yields the optimal controlled joint state PDF at that time. We show that if the drift is a gradient vector field, or is of mixed conservative–dissipative nature, then it is possible to transform these PDEs into a pair of initial value problems (IVPs) involving the same forward Kolmogorov operator. Combined with a recently proposed fixed point recursion that is contractive in the Hilbert metric, this opens up the possibility to numerically solve the SBPs in these cases by computing the Schrödinger factors via a single IVP solver for the corresponding (uncontrolled) forward Kolmogorov PDE. The flows generated by such forward Kolmogorov PDEs, for the two aforementioned types of drift, in turn, enjoy gradient descent structures on the manifold of joint PDFs with respect to suitable distance functionals. We employ a proximal algorithm developed in our prior work that exploits this geometric viewpoint, to solve these IVPs and compute the Schrödinger factors via weighted scattered point cloud evolution in the state space. We provide the algorithmic details and illustrate the proposed framework of solving the SBPs with nonlinear prior dynamics by numerical examples.},

  abstract     = {This article presents a method to synchronize a network of spatially distributed nonlinear oscillators that can only interact with each other intermittently and at very close range. This problem arises in applications where semipassive sensors drift along patterns of ambient geophysical flows that bring them close periodically and have to establish periodic rendezvous in order to efficiently exchange information or be retrieved. The problem is challenging because cooperative control action can only be applied over the short time window that agents are in rendezvous, and different subgroups that share some members meet asynchronously at different locations. In such cases, the ambient geophysical dynamics that drive the motion of the agents need to be directly incorporated into control design. This article presents a decentralized, intermittently activated, pairwise interacting control law for the agents, which, under certain conditions on overall network connectivity, brings the whole system into a steady state, where all agents synchronize their periodic rendezvous around configurations determined by the surrounding geophysical field.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we consider robust output tracking for a Schrödinger equation with external disturbances in all possible channels. The challenge of the problem comes from the fact that the observation operator is unbounded and the regulated output and the control are noncollocated. An observer-based approach is adopted in investigation. We first select specially some coefficients of the disturbances to obtain a nominal system, which is a coupled PDE+ODE system. For this nominal system, we design a feedforward control by solving related regulator equation. An observer is then designed for the nominal system in terms of the tracking error only. As a result, an error feedback control is, thus, designed by replacing the state and disturbances in the feedforward control with their estimates obtained from the observer. We show that this observer based error feedback control is robust to disturbances in all possible channels and system uncertainty. The stability of the closed loop and convergence are established by the Riesz basis approach. Some numerical simulations are presented to validate the results.},

When agents are nonstrategic, an agent’s strategy is known to the other agents. Nevertheless, the agents’ strategy choices and beliefs are interdependent over times, a phenomenon known as signaling . We introduce the notion of sufficient information that effectively compresses the agents’ information in a mutually consistent manner. Based on the notion of sufficient information, we propose an information state for each agent that is sufficient for decision-making purposes. We present instances of dynamic multiagent decision problems where we can determine an information state with a time-invariant domain for each agent. Furthermore, we present a generalization of the policy-independence property of belief in partially observed Markov decision processes (POMDP) to dynamic multiagent decision problems. Within the context of dynamic teams with asymmetric information, the proposed set of information states leads to a sequential decomposition that decouples the interdependence between the agents’ strategies and beliefs over time and enables us to formulate a dynamic program to determine a globally optimal policy via backward induction.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we consider distributed online convex optimization problems, where the distributed system consists of various computing units connected through a time-varying communication graph. In each time step, each computing unit selects a constrained vector, experiences a loss equal to an arbitrary convex function evaluated at this vector, and may communicate to its neighbors in the graph. The objective is to minimize the system-wide loss accumulated over time. We propose a decentralized algorithm with regret and cumulative constraint violation in ${\mathcal O}(T^{\max \lbrace c,1-c\rbrace })$ and ${\mathcal O}(T^{1-c/2})$ , respectively, for any $c\in (0,1)$ , where $T$ is the time horizon. When the loss functions are strongly convex, we establish improved regret and constraint violation upper bounds in ${\mathcal O}(\log (T))$ and ${\mathcal O}(\sqrt{T\log (T)})$ . These regret scalings match those obtained by state-of-the-art algorithms and fundamental limits in the corresponding centralized online optimization problem (for both convex and strongly convex loss functions). In the case of bandit feedback, the proposed algorithms achieve a regret and constraint violation in ${\mathcal O}(T^{\max \lbrace c,1-c/3 \rbrace })$ and ${\mathcal O}(T^{1-c/2})$ for any $c\in (0,1)$ .

In this case, the nonexistence of the asymptotic flocking has been frequently observed in numerical simulations, however, the theoretical results are far from perfect. In this note, we first point out that the nonexistence of the asymptotic flocking is equivalent to the unboundedness of the second order space moment, i.e., $\sup _t\sum |x_i(t)-x_j(t)|^2=\infty$ . Furthermore, by taking the second derivative and then integrating, we establish a new and key equality about this moment. At last, we use this equality and relevant technical lemmas to deduce a general sufficient condition to the nonexistence of the asymptotic flocking.},

The maximal robust invariant set of interest is a set of all states such that every possible trajectory starting from it never violates a specified state constraint, regardless of actual disturbances. The maximal robust invariant set is shown to be the zero level set of the unique bounded solution to a Bellman type equation, which is a functional equation being widely used in discrete-time optimal control. Consequently, the maximal robust invariant set estimation problem is reduced to a problem of solving a Bellman type equation. This is the main contribution of this article. The uniqueness of bounded solutions enables us to solve the derived Bellman type equation using numerical methods such as the value iteration and policy iteration, which provide an approximation of the maximal robust invariant set. Finally, two examples demonstrate the performance of our Bellman equation based method.},

The discussed reaching law is relatively more general than some others in the literature, because it contains a wider range of decay factors, which could be positive or negative. First, a sufficient and necessary condition is obtained ensuring that the generalized reaching law satisfies the reaching condition. Then, the dependence between the ultimate bounding of sliding variables (i.e., the range of steady-state chattering) and parameters in the generalized reaching law is discussed. The discussions are stated in three different cases, i.e., negative decay factors, adjustable negative decay factors, and adjustable positive decay factors. The obtained results of the generalized reaching law are further applied to the discrete control system with unmatched uncertainties to demonstrate the usefulness of this generalized discrete reaching law in sliding-mode control theory.

Then, it is shown that DOSDFs, no matter whether continuous or not, are stabilizers in the sample-and-hold sense. The main advantage of the proposed methodology is that all kinds of discontinuities, in the function describing the DOSDF, are here accommodated. This fact greatly enlarges the possibilities of designing sampled-data dynamic output feedback stabilizers for nonlinear systems with state-delays. The intersampling system behavior as well as time-varying sampling intervals are taken into account. The stabilization in the sample-and-hold sense theory is used to prove the results.

Subsequently, the concepts of asymptotic synchronization with probability one (asymptotic SPO), finite-time SPO, and fixed-time SPO of SFFNs are, respectively, introduced. Moreover, a series of necessary and sufficient conditions is, respectively, derived for asymptotic SPO and fixed-time SPO on the basis of transition graph and network matrix. Compared with the existing results in logical networks and real-valued networks, several interesting characteristics of a synchronous SFFN are revealed.

Without a predefined stand-off distance or formation, two local cooperative controllers are proposed using only the relative position information from the target and its neighbors within its local frame of reference. The controllers consist of three functionalities. The repulsive term between a vehicle and its neighbors is used to avoid collision. The attractive term between a vehicle and the target drives the vehicle toward the target. The adaptive term amounts to estimate the target&#39;s velocity. Specifically, with the first controller, the vehicles follow the target&#39;s velocity in the average sense resulting in rotation about the target; with the second controller, each vehicle is able to follow the target&#39;s velocity resulting in a rigid formation. Furthermore, a decentralized estimator is applied to handle the case where only a portion of vehicles can access the target&#39;s position. Both controllers assure target fencing. The results are proved by rigorous theoretical analysis and verified by extensive numerical simulation.},

  abstract     = {Current resilient consensus algorithms deal with multiagent networks with lower order nodal dynamics where each agent excludes certain extreme values from its neighbors. This does not scale well in general networks. In this article, a new type of resilient consensus algorithm based on distributed attack isolation (DAI-RC) is proposed for general higher order networks. In the DAI-RC algorithm, the evolution of each normal agent can avoid the influence from those neighbors which are isolated as victims of attack. To characterize a feasible communication topology to isolate attacked agents, a notion of graph isolability is proposed based on which a sufficient condition to isolate the attacked agents is presented. Simulations are finally provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

First, in order to avoid the unwinding phenomenon when the system states are restricted to the switching surface, a novel switching function is designed by a hyperbolic sine function such that the switching surface contains the two equilibriums. Then, a sliding mode attitude maneuver controller is developed based on the proposed switching function to ensure the robustness of the closed-loop system to disturbance and inertia uncertainty. Another important feature of the presented attitude control law is that a dynamic parameter is constructed to guarantee the unwinding-free performance before the system states reach the switching surface. Furthermore, a boundary layer is introduced for the designed controller to avoid the chattering phenomenon. Moreover, the convergence property and unwinding-free performance when the system states within the boundary layer are proven. The simulation results demonstrate that the unwinding problem is settled during attitude maneuver for rigid spacecraft by adopting the newly developed switching function and the presented attitude control scheme.},

Such a framework allows us to fully reveal the property of the bidirectional interaction, based on which a distributed optimal FE and FTC scheme is developed. Moreover, a new concept named interactive Stackelberg equilibrium is proposed, where, to reach this equilibrium, an auxiliary controller is suitably designed for each subobserver.

For a trader, this is an important indicator of the “duration” of a trend. For processes with “large” $T_k$ , there is an incentive to try and capitalize by buying stock when a temporary trend is “up” and selling when it is “down.” The extent to which this is possible is determined by a model parameter $p_e$ , called the probability of efficiency , which indicates the likelihood that the bid, ask, and current price are such that one can seamlessly enter or exit the market without slippage. The degree to which a trader can exploit trending behavior is quantified in our main result, which provides the expected value of the trading gain resulting from a strategically constructed feedforward switching controller.

  abstract     = {A key challenge in the synthesis and subsequent analysis of supervisory controllers is the impact of state-space explosion caused by concurrency. The main bottleneck is often the memory needed to store the composition of plant and requirement automata and the resulting supervisor. Partial-order reduction (POR) is a well-established technique that alleviates this issue in the field of model checking. It does so by exploiting redundancy in the model with respect to the properties of interest. For controller synthesis, the functional properties of interest are nonblockingness, controllability, and least-restrictiveness, but also performance properties, such as throughput and latency are of interest. We propose an on-the-fly POR on the input model that preserves both functional and performance properties in the synthesized supervisory controller. This improves the scalability of the synthesis (and any subsequent performance analysis). Synthesis experiments show the effectiveness of the POR on a set of realistic manufacturing system models.},

At each iteration of the control task, the closed-loop state, input, and cost are stored and used in the controller design. This article first illustrates how to construct robust control invariant sets and safe control policies exploiting historical data. Then, we propose an iterative LMPC design procedure, where data generated by a robust controller at iteration $j$ are used to design a robust LMPC at the next iteration $j+1$ . We show that this procedure allows us to iteratively enlarge the domain of the control policy, and it guarantees recursive constraints satisfaction, input-to-state stability, and performance bounds for the certainty equivalent closed-loop system. The use of different feedback policies along the horizon is the key element of the proposed design.

First, it is shown that a framework with a nondegenerate bilateration ordering must be angle fixable, implying that it can be uniquely determined by angles between edges up to translations, rotations, reflections, and uniform scaling. Then, ASNL is proved to have a unique solution if and only if the grounded framework is angle fixable and anchors are not all collinear. Subsequently, ASNL is solved in centralized and distributed settings, respectively. The centralized ASNL is formulated as a rank-constrained semidefinite program (SDP) in either a noise-free or a noisy scenario, with a decomposition approach proposed to deal with large-scale ASNL. The distributed protocol for ASNL is designed based on intersensor communications. Graphical conditions for equivalence of the formulated rank-constrained SDP and a linear SDP, decomposition of the SDP, as well as the effectiveness of the distributed protocol, are proposed, respectively. Finally, simulation examples demonstrate our theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {Multiagent navigation systems present opportunities for many applications due to their agility and cooperation. In any multiagent navigation system, it is critical that actual interagent collisions are strictly prevented. In this article, we present a solution to the 2-D multiagent navigation problem with collision avoidance. Our solution to this problem is based on a novel extension to Gauss&#39;s principle of least constraint (GPLC), in which a fixed set of strict equality constraints is replaced by time-varying sets of active inequality constraints. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first instance that extends GPLC with dynamic incorporation and stabilization of active inequality constraints and with actuator delay and saturation. Herein, the dynamics of a collision-free multiagent system satisfies the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. Active inequality constraints enforce collision avoidance, leader following, and agglomeration behaviors, and they are stabilized using Baumgarte&#39;s error stabilization approach. We show that in dense configurations, the positional arrangement of the agents can lead to linearly dependent constraints, and we propose specialized solutions involving QR decomposition and regularization. The efficacy and efficiency of the proposed method are demonstrated by a dimensional analysis of a worst-case scenario and numerical studies of up to 100 agents tracking a prescribed virtual leader.},

Much recent progress toward this goal has been made through an automatic controller synthesis from temporal logic specifications. Existing approaches, however, have been limited to relatively short and simple specifications. Furthermore, existing methods either consider some prior discretization of the state space, deal only with a convex fragment of temporal logic, or are not provably complete. We propose a scalable, provably complete algorithm that synthesizes continuous trajectories to satisfy nonconvex temporal logic over reals (RTL) specifications. We separate discrete task planning and continuous motion planning on-the-fly and harness highly efficient Boolean satisfiability and linear programming solvers to find dynamically feasible trajectories that satisfy nonconvex RTL specifications for high-dimensional systems. The proposed design algorithms are proven sound and complete, and simulation results demonstrate our approach&#39;s scalability.},

Furthermore, by allowing for additional experiments, the conservatism of the upper bound can be reduced via iterative sampling schemes. The introduced scheme is based on the assumption of passive systems, which we relax by discussing different methods for estimating the systems’ passivity shortage, as well as applying transformations passivizing them.

Under the requirement of security, each agent needs to keep its objective function private from other agents and potential eavesdroppers. We first prove the impossibility of guaranteeing convergence and differential privacy simultaneously by perturbing states in exact distributed optimization algorithms. Motivated by this result, we design a completely distributed algorithm, Distributed algorithm via Direction and State Perturbation (DiaDSP), that achieves differential privacy by perturbing both states and directions with decaying Laplace noise. Different from most of the existing works that require decaying stepsizes to ensure convergence, we show that our DiaDSP algorithm converges in mean and almost surely even with a constant stepsize. In particular, we prove linear convergence in mean by only assuming that the sum of all cost functions is strongly convex. The R-linear convergence is proved under the assumption of Lipschitz gradients instead of that of bounded gradients. The optimal stepsize for the fastest convergence rate is also established. Moreover, we describe the privacy properties and characterize the tradeoff between differential privacy and convergence accuracy. Simulations are conducted on a typical sensor fusion problem to validate the theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {In multivehicle autonomous systems that operate under unknown or adversarial environments, it is a challenging task to simultaneously achieve source seeking and obstacle avoidance. Indeed, even for single-vehicle systems, smooth time-invariant feedback controllers based on navigation or barrier functions have been shown to be highly susceptible to arbitrarily small jamming signals that can induce instability in the closed-loop system, or that are able to stabilize spurious equilibria in the operational space. When the location of the source is further unknown, adaptive smooth source seeking dynamics based on averaging theory may suffer from similar limitations. In this article, we address this problem by introducing a class of novel distributed hybrid model-free controllers, that achieve robust source seeking and obstacle avoidance in multivehicle autonomous systems, with vehicles characterized by nonlinear continuous-time dynamics stabilizable by hybrid feedback. The hybrid source seeking law switches between a family of cooperative gradient-free controllers, derived from potential fields that satisfy mild invexity assumptions. The stability and robustness properties of the closed-loop system are analyzed using Lyapunov tools and singular perturbation theory for set-valued hybrid dynamical systems. The theoretical results are validated via numerical and experimental tests.},

The major question addressed in this article is where to allocate external excitation signals such that a network model set becomes generically identifiable when measuring all vertex signals. To tackle this synthesis problem, a novel graph structure, referred to as directed pseudotree , is introduced, and the generic identifiability of a network model set can be featured by a set of disjoint directed pseudotrees that cover all the parameterized edges of an extended graph , which includes the correlation structure of the process noises. Thereby, an algorithmic procedure is devised, aiming to decompose the extended graph into a minimal number of disjoint pseudotrees, whose roots then provide the appropriate locations for excitation signals. Furthermore, the proposed approach can be adapted using the notion of antipseudotrees to solve a dual problem, which is to select a minimal number of measurement signals for generic identifiability of the overall network, under the assumption that all the vertices are excited.},

  abstract     = {The stochastic subgradient method is a widely used algorithm for solving large-scale optimization problems arising in machine learning. Often, these problems are neither smooth nor convex. Recently, Davis et al. , 2018 characterized the convergence of the stochastic subgradient method for the weakly convex case, which encompasses many important applications (e.g., robust phase retrieval, blind deconvolution, biconvex compressive sensing, and dictionary learning). In practice, distributed implementations of the projected stochastic subgradient method (stoDPSM) are used to speed up risk minimization. In this article, we propose a distributed implementation of the stochastic subgradient method with a theoretical guarantee. Specifically, we show the global convergence of stoDPSM using the Moreau envelope stationarity measure. Furthermore, under a so-called sharpness condition, we show that deterministic DPSM (with a proper initialization) converges linearly to the sharp minima, using geometrically diminishing step size. We provide numerical experiments to support our theoretical analysis.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we present a unified framework for distributed convex optimization using an algorithm called proximal atomic coordination (PAC). PAC is based on the prox-linear approach and we prove that it achieves convergence in both objective values and distance to feasibility with rate o(1/ $\tau$ ), where $\tau$ is the number of algorithmic iterations. We further prove that linear convergence is achieved when the objective functions are strongly convex and strongly smooth with condition number $\kappa _{f}$ , with the number of iterations on the order of square-root of $\kappa _{f}$ . We demonstrate how various decomposition strategies and coordination graphs relate to the convergence rate of PAC. We then compare this convergence rate with that of a distributed algorithm based on the popular alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMMs) method. We further compare the algorithmic complexities of PAC to ADMM and enumerate the ensuing advantages. Finally, we demonstrate yet another advantage of PAC related to privacy. All theoretical results are validated using a power distribution grid model in the context of the optimal power flow problem.},

  abstract     = {Due to the rise of distributed energy resources, the control of networks of grid-forming inverters is now a pressing issue for the power system operation. Droop control is a popular control strategy in the literature for frequency control of these inverters. In this article, we analyze transient stability in droop-controlled inverter networks that are subject to multiple operating constraints. Using a physically meaningful Lyapunov-like function, we provide two sets of criteria (one mathematical and one computational) to certify that a postfault trajectory achieves frequency synchronization while respecting operating constraints. We show how to obtain less-conservative transient stability conditions by incorporating information from loop flows, i.e., net flows of active power around cycles in the network. Finally, we use these conditions to quantify the scale of parameter disturbances to which the network is robust. We illustrate our results with numerical case studies of the IEEE 24-bus system.},

The purpose of this article is to specialize these results to the case of submodular, covering, and supermodular problems. In all these cases, we obtain tight expressions for the price of anarchy that often match or improve the guarantees associated with state-of-the-art approximation algorithms.

The problem is to estimate the state vector in the case when the auxiliary process in the TMM can be eliminated. Sufficient conditions for this elimination to be feasible are established and we give a selection of illustrative real-life TMM examples, where these conditions are satisfied. We subsequently show that the original TMM boils down to a pairwise Markov model (PMM) of second order. Then, we derive a new optimal Kalman filter applicable to any linear PMM of second order. Our numerical results confirm that the proposed estimator can provide substantial complexity reduction with either no or minor accuracy loss, depending on the use of model approximation.},

We then investigate the rate of convergence to the steady state, and provide bounds on the maximum $\epsilon$ -convergence time in terms of the properties of the physical connectivity graph. We extend this discussion and observe that for almost all $n$ , there exists an $n$ -vertex physical connectivity graph on which social HK dynamics may not even $\epsilon$ -converge to the steady state within a bounded time frame.

We formulate two models grounded on the Friedkin–Johnsen opinion dynamics and the reflected appraisal mechanism; the models are defined over issue sequences and over a single issue, respectively. The key advance over the original DeGroot–Friedkin dynamics is that the proposed models include the empirically observed phenomenon of stubbornness and are, therefore, more realistic. We obtain various results about the existence of equilibria, their uniqueness, and their global attractivity. For example, we show that the single-issue and issue-sequence models have the same equilibrium social power. We also show that the equilibrium social power depends only upon interpersonal accorded influence and individuals’ stubbornness in several cases. Roughly speaking, a more stubborn individual has more equilibrium social power. In comparison with the original DeGroot–Friedkin model, the introduction of stubbornness leads to fundamental sociological differences: Full autocracy can never be achieved, whereas democracy can be achieved under all network topologies.},

It is shown that such a problem is not solvable if the prescribed convergence time $T_{\tau }$ is smaller than $2\tau$ . For $T_{\tau }\geq 3\tau$ , a solution based on linear periodic delayed feedback (PDF) without any distributed delay is established. For $T_{\tau }&amp;gt;2\tau$ , a solution based on linear predictor-based PDF containing a distributed delay is proposed. For both cases, the gains of the PDF can be chosen as continuous, continuously differentiable, and even smooth, in the sense of infinitely many times differentiable. If only an output signal is available for feedback, two classes of linear observers with periodic coefficients are designed, so that their states converge to the current and future states of the system at a prescribed finite time, respectively. With the observed current and future states, FxTS can also be achieved by using, respectively, the PDF and observer-based PDF. A linear periodic feedback (without delay) is also established to solve the FxTS problem of linear systems with both instantaneous and delayed controls, which cannot be stabilized by any constant instantaneous feedback in certain cases. Two numerical examples verify the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.},

First, we note that this is equivalent to cyclo-passivity at the mechanical port of the thermodynamic system, while the temperature at the thermal port of the system is kept constant. This leads to the question, which general systems with two power ports have similar behavior: when is a system cyclo-passive at one of its ports, while the output variable at the other port (such as the temperature in the thermodynamic case) is kept constant? This property is called “one-port cyclo-passivity,” and entails, whenever it holds, a fundamental limitation to energy transfer from one port to the other. Sufficient conditions for one-port cyclo-passivity are derived for general multiphysics systems formulated in port-Hamiltonian form. This is illustrated by a variety of examples from different (multi-)physical domains; from coupled inductors and capacitor microphones to synchronous machines.},

While the use of a Lyapunov function as a barrier function is straightforward, the existence of a converse Lyapunov function as a barrier function for a given safety set is not. We establish this link by a robustness argument. We show that the closure of the forward reachable set of a robustly safe set must be robustly asymptotically stable under mild technical assumptions. As a result, all robustly safe dynamical systems must admit a robust barrier function in the form of a Lyapunov function for set stability. We present the results in both continuous-time and discrete-time settings and remark on connections with various barrier function conditions.},

Unlike the straightforward extension of the well-known Kalman-rank-based controllability criteria, the conditions presented in this article can be verified in polynomial time. The verification complexity of our conditions is independent of the sparsity level. Our results also provide a closed-form expression for the minimum number of control nodes to be activated at every time instant to ensure controllability of the system using nonnegative controls.

The objective is to steer each EL agent to achieve the optimization task while avoiding collisions with other agents. The main challenge focuses on the co-design of optimal coordination strategy and collision avoidance mechanism. The safety barrier certificates in the closed form of path integrals are constructed, which generate provably collisions-free behaviors. With convex optimization and adaptive nonlinear control, a fully distributed protocol is proposed.

The class of plant outputs considered includes, for example, the quantity to be regulated. This class of outputs allows us to use the classical Luenberger observer to estimate the exosystem states.

A structure-preserving discrete-time kinematic model of the system is obtained in terms of the local form of a discrete connection. An adapted version of the discrete maximum principle on matrix Lie groups is then employed to come up with the necessary optimality conditions for an optimal transfer from a given initial state while minimizing the mechanical energy expended in the presence of constraints on the controls. These necessary conditions appear as a two-point boundary value problem and are solved using a numerical technique.

To optimize the linear quadratic response and the final consensus state simultaneously, a nonseparable multiobjective optimization problem with coupled constraints on decision variables is formulated. The main difficulty in solving the optimization problem lies in the nonlinear coupling of objectives, which is overcome by separating the problem into two independent and solvable single-objective optimization subproblems using the alternating direction method of multipliers. The proximal gradient decent scheme is then introduced to approximate the precise optimal solutions of the subproblems so as to improve the computing efficiency. Convergence analysis is performed to estimate the convergence rate and derive the convergence condition, which is independent of any global information of the system and, therefore, is fully distributed. Furthermore, the solution of each subproblem is obtained in a distributed form, allowing the multiagent system to achieve optimal consensus.

Agents of a network aim to minimize the sum of local linear cost functions subject to both individual constraints and a linear coupling constraint involving all the decision variables. A key, challenging feature of the considered setup is that some components of the decision variables must assume integer values. The addressed MILPs are NP-hard, nonconvex, and large-scale. Moreover, several additional challenges arise in a distributed framework due to the coupling constraint, so that feasible solutions with guaranteed suboptimality bounds are of interest. We propose a fully distributed algorithm based on a primal decomposition approach and an appropriate tightening of the coupling constraint. The algorithm is guaranteed to provide feasible solutions in finite time. Moreover, asymptotic and finite-time suboptimality bounds are established for the computed solution. Monte Carlo simulations highlight the extremely low suboptimality bounds achieved by the algorithm.},

Due to financial, topology, and bandwidth limitations, only a subset of SaAs can be selected for placement. Different from existing literature, which successively iterates partial selection to reach a suboptimal solution, this article focuses on a joint placement and encounters fundamental difficulty in the sense that joint SaA placement introduces a term in the LQG cost that is difficult to be convexified. A branch-and-bound algorithm is introduced to search for solutions to an approximate problem obtained by relaxing the Boolean constraints. By deriving a compact search space where any optimal solution belongs to or resides, we derive lower and upper bounds to the optimal solution in each subregion of the search space, and subsequently refine the search space. A suboptimal solution to the original problem is obtained from integer rounding and the optimality gap is further analyzed. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. This algorithm has significant reduction of iteration numbers compared with the brute-force enumeration especially when the number of states is not large but the number of placement choices is large. In addition, an improvement of LQG cost is obtained compared with the successively iterating partial selection methods, a canonical algorithm for SaA placement in the literature.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we consider optimal controller synthesis of a quantized-feedback linear-quadratic-Gaussian (QF-LQG) system, where the measurements are to be quantized before being transmitted to the controller. The system is presented with several choices of quantizers, along with the cost of operating each quantizer. The objective is to jointly select the quantizers and the controller that would maintain an optimal balance between the control performance and quantization cost. Under certain assumptions, this problem can be decoupled into two optimization problems: one for optimal controller synthesis and the other for the optimal quantizer selection. We show that, similarly to the classical LQG problem, the optimal controller synthesis subproblem is characterized by Riccati equations. On the other hand, the optimal quantizer selection policy is found by solving a certain Markov decision process.},

These new methods are grounded in the commonly used singular value decomposition (SVD), that is, they propagate not the covariance matrix itself but its SVD factors instead. The SVD based on orthogonal transforms is applicable to any UKF with only nonnegative weights, whereas the remaining ones, which can enjoy negative weights as well, are treated by means of the hyperbolic SVD based on $J$ -orthogonal transforms. The filters constructed are presented in a concise algorithmic form, which is convenient for practical utilization. Their two particular versions grounded in the classical and cubature UKF parameterizations and derived with use of the It $\hat{\rm o}$ -Taylor discretization are examined in severe conditions of tackling a seven-dimensional radar tracking problem, where an aircraft executes a coordinated turn, in the presence of ill-conditioned measurements.},

For this purpose, we construct a simple model using a finite state automaton that describes the dynamic behavior of progress and regression in a democracy. We represent a network of agents as a directed graph where each agent has its own objective. Each agent may be a citizen or a group of people sharing a common objective, and it makes decisions on enabling or disabling events upon the observation of states of a system. Agents may have different decisions on the same event, and the final decision follows the majority rule. Upon this framework, we derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for a democratic system controlled by networked agents to be progressive or regressive, where a progressive one implies that it reaches a more equal state at which a larger number of agents meet their objectives. Finally, we obtain some convergence results for special graph topologies.},

The goal then is to use the resources at their maximal capacity, reduce the production time, and be flexible to adapt to the customers requests. The closed-loop behavior of a system under the supervisory control theory (SCT) guarantees nonblockingness and safety requirements and, thus, it can be used as the search universe for a planning problem. SCT suffers with the “curse of dimensionality” when systems become bigger and more complex. This article presents a set of sufficient conditions that allow to work with abstractions of the closed-loop behavior (supremal controllable sublanguage), instead of the closed-loop behavior itself, as the search universe to solve a planning problem. Such abstraction is the natural projection of the supervisor into the set of controllable events satisfying the observer property. This process leads to a reduction of the search space.},

For the implementation of the proposed scheme, the time-integrals of the output are required to express as functions of the state of the system. Such functions are called directional antiderivatives; in the article, conditions to guarantee their existence and methods for their computation, in closed-form or by approximation, are resumed.

The considered IMOs are modeled by a sequence of impulsive signals with certain known minimum norm (i.e., the minimum of the norms of all impulsive signals). In order to characterize the occasional occurrence of IMOs, a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables is introduced to depict the interval lengths (i.e., the durations between two adjacent IMOs) of the outliers. In order to achieve satisfactory filtering performance, a novel parameter-dependent filtering approach is proposed to protect the filtering performance from IMOs by using a special outlier detection scheme, which is developed based on a particular input–output model. First, the ultimate boundedness (in mean square) of the filtering error is investigated by using the stochastic analysis technique and the Lyapunov-functional-like method. Then, the desired filter gain matrix is derived through solving a constrained optimization problem. Furthermore, the designed filtering scheme is applied to the case where the statistical properties about the interval lengths of outliers are completely unknown. Finally, a simulation example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed filtering strategy.},

Although a DT-PLN can predict the long-term behavior of a GRN, using it to describe the transient kinetics at the microtimescale level remains inconvenient. In this article, we investigate the problems associated with the stability and stabilization of continuous-time probabilistic logic networks (CT-PLNs). First, we demonstrate that the concept of finite-time stability for DT-PLNs cannot be extended to CT-PLNs owing to the nonsingularity of transitional probability matrices. Thus, we introduce the concept of asymptotical stability, which is defined as the convergence in distribution of the network state. Second, by developing the theory of invariant subsets for CT-PLNs, a necessary and sufficient condition for asymptotical stability with respect to a subset is proposed, which is expressed in terms of the transition rate matrix of probability. Third, for a CT-PLN with input nodes, termed a continuous-time probabilistic logic control network, we discuss the subsets that are invariant under piece-wise constant input. Based thereupon, we propose a necessary and sufficient condition under which asymptotically stabilizing sampled-data feedback exists. A method for designing sampled-data feedback is proposed. Last, Monte Carlo simulation algorithms are proposed to efficiently simulate a CT-PLN in the time domain. Examples are provided to demonstrate the methods proposed in this article.},

The novelty of our approach is that, at each iteration, we aim to compute an approximate value function that maximizes the point-wise maximum taken with the family of approximate value functions computed thus far. This leads to a nonconvex objective, and we propose a gradient ascent algorithm to find stationary points by solving a sequence of convex optimization problems. We provide convergence guarantees for our algorithm and an interpretation for how the gradient computation relates to the state-relevance weighting parameter appearing in related ADP approaches.

Relaxing the scheduling problem into multiple independent single-arm scheduling problems, we define the Lagrangian priority value as the greatest tax under which it is optimal to activate the arm. We propose a Lagrangian priority policy that processes jobs in the order of their Lagrangian priority values, and establish its asymptotic optimality as the system scales.

  abstract     = {In this article, we consider the problem of tracking for a discrete-time plant with unknown plant parameters; we assume knowledge of an upper bound on the plant order, and for each admissible order we assume knowledge of a compact set in which the plant parameters lie. We carry out parameter estimation of an associated auxiliary model; indeed, for each admissible dimension, we cover the set of admissible parameters by a finite number of compact and convex sets and use an original-projection-algorithm-based estimator for each set. At each point in time, we employ a switching algorithm to determine which model and parameter estimates are used in the pole-placement-based control law. We prove that this adaptive controller guarantees desirable linear-like closed-loop behavior: exponential stability, a bounded noise gain in every $p$ -norm, a convolution bound on the effect of the exogenous inputs, as well as exponential tracking for certain classes of reference and noise signals; this linear-like behavior is leveraged to immediately show tolerance to a degree of plant time-variations and unmodeled dynamics.},

Most existing literature on optimization algorithms does not consider systems that involve unknown system parameters. This article studies a class of stochastic adaptive optimization problems in which identification of unknown parameters and search for the optimal solutions must be performed simultaneously. Due to a fundamental conflict between parameter identifiability and optimality in such problems, we introduce a method of adding stochastic dither signals into the system, which provide sufficient excitation for estimating the unknown parameters, leading to convergent adaptive optimization algorithms. Joint identification and optimization algorithms are developed and their simultaneous convergence properties of parameter estimation and optimization variable updates are proved. Under both noise-free and noisy observations, the corresponding convergence rates are established. The main results of this article reveal certain fundamental relationships and tradeoff among updating step sizes, dither magnitudes, parameter estimation errors, optimization accuracy, and convergence rates. Simulation case studies are used to illustrate the adaptive optimization algorithms and their main properties.},

  abstract     = {Reinforcement learning (RL) methods have demonstrated their efficiency in simulation. However, many of the applications for which RL offers great potential, such as autonomous driving, are also safety critical and require a certified closed-loop behavior in order to meet the safety specifications in the presence of physical constraints. This article introduces a concept called probabilistic model predictive safety certification (PMPSC), which can be combined with any RL algorithm and provides provable safety certificates in terms of state and input chance constraints for potentially large-scale systems. The certificate is realized through a stochastic tube that safely connects the current system state with a terminal set of states that is known to be safe. A novel formulation allows a recursively feasible real-time computation of such probabilistic tubes, despite the presence of possibly unbounded disturbances. A design procedure for PMPSC relying on Bayesian inference and recent advances in probabilistic set invariance is presented. Using a numerical car simulation, the method and its design procedure are illustrated by enhancing an RL algorithm with safety certificates.},

We illustrate, by means of theoretic and practical examples, some fundamental limitations including: 1) A globally exponentially stabilizable (GES) nonlinear system may not guarantee global asymptotic stabilizability (GAS) of the nonlinear system even with an arbitrarily small input delay; 2) GAS cannot even ensure semiglobal asymptotic stabilizability of the nonlinear system with a small input delay. To overcome these obstacles, we introduce the notion of semiglobal input delay tolerance (SGIDT) and present a semiglobal control framework for the asymptotic analysis/synthesis of input delay tolerance of multi-input–multi-output (MIMO) nonlinear systems under smooth feedback. With the aid of Razumikhin theorem and the converse Lyapunov theorem on global asymptotic local exponential stability (GALES), it is proved that in the case of state feedback, GALES does ensure the SGIDT of a MIMO nonlinear system. In the case of output feedback, it is further proved that GALES and uniform observability imply the SGIDT of the nonlinear system.},

Furthermore, the observer is extended to systems with parametric uncertainties appearing in the dynamics of the unmeasured part of the state. While required to be linear in the uncertain parameter, the uncertain term may be nonlinear in the state, even in the unmeasured part of the state. Terms of this type appear often in applications and cover, for instance, viscous drag in fluid flow systems.

We introduce the notion of strong $\mathcal {H}_2$ norm of semi-explicit DDAEs, a robustified measure that considers delay perturbations, and we analyze its properties. We derive necessary and sufficient finiteness criteria for the strong $\mathcal {H}_2$ norm in terms of a finite number of equalities involving multidimensional powers of a finite set of matrices. As the main contribution, we present a strengthened, sufficient, condition for finiteness of the strong $\mathcal {H}_2$ norm, along with an algorithm for checking it, which has significantly better scalability properties in terms of both the system dimension and the number of delays. We show that the satisfaction of the novel condition is equivalent to the existence of a simultaneous block triangularization of the matrices of the delay difference equation associated with the DDAE. The latter is instrumental to a novel regularization procedure that allows us to transform the DDAE to a neutral-type system with the same transfer matrix, without any need for differentiation of inputs or outputs. This transformation enables computing of the strong $\mathcal {H}_2$ norm using Lyapunov matrices. Finally, we show by a counterexample that the strengthened condition is, in general, not necessary, inducing open problems, but we also list several classes of DDAEs for which it is necessary and sufficient.},

  abstract     = {Emerging applications of control, estimation, and machine learning, from target tracking to decentralized model fitting, pose resource constraints that limit which of the available sensors, actuators, or data can be simultaneously used across time. Therefore, many researchers have proposed solutions within discrete optimization frameworks where the optimization is performed over finite sets. By exploiting notions of discrete convexity, such as submodularity, the researchers have been able to provide scalable algorithms with provable suboptimality bounds. In this article, we consider such problems but in adversarial environments, where in every step a number of the chosen elements in the optimization is removed due to failures/attacks. Specifically, we consider for the first time a sequential version of the problem that allows us to observe the failures and adapt, while the attacker also adapts to our response. We call the novel problem robust sequential submodular maximization (RSM). Generally, the problem is computationally hard and no scalable algorithm is known for its solution. However, in this article, we propose robust and adaptive maximization (RAM), the first scalable algorithm. RAM runs in an online fashion, adapting in every step to the history of failures. Also, it guarantees a near-optimal performance, even against any number of failures among the used elements. Particularly, RAM has both provable per-instance a priori bounds and tight and/or optimal a posteriori bounds. Finally, we demonstrate RAM&#39;s near-optimality in simulations across various application scenarios, along with its robustness against several failure types, from worst-case to random.},

The most general problem we study then consists in synthesizing both a controller and values for the parameters such that some control location of the automaton is reachable. It is, however, well-known that most nontrivial problems on parametric timed automata are undecidable and the classical techniques for the verification (and a fortiori for the control) of timed systems do not terminate in that setting. We, therefore, provide a restriction on the use of parameters to ensure the decidability of the control problems. Since in classical timed automata, real-valued clocks are always compared to integers for all practical purposes, we search for parameter values as bounded integers. Hence, we solve undecidability and termination issues, we provide terminating symbolic synthesis procedures, and our method retains most of the practical usefulness of PTA for the modeling of real-time systems.},

Stabilizing predictive controllers based on terminal ingredients may exhibit stability and feasibility issues in the event of a reference change for small to moderate prediction horizons. In the MPC for tracking formulation, these issues are solved by the addition of an artificial equilibrium point as a new decision variable, providing a significantly enlarged domain of attraction and guaranteeing recursive feasibility for any reference change. However, it may suffer from performance issues if the prediction horizon is not large enough. This article presents an extension of this formulation where a harmonic artificial reference is used in place of the equilibrium point. The proposed formulation achieves even greater domains of attraction and can significantly outperform other MPC formulations when the prediction horizon is small. We prove the asymptotic stability and recursive feasibility of the proposed controller, as well as provide guidelines for the design of its main ingredients.

In the considered framework, traffic flows along the links of a transportation network—modeled as a capacited multigraph—and queues up at the nodes, whereby control policies determine which incoming queues are to be allocated service simultaneously, within some predetermined scheduling constraints. We first prove fundamental performance limitations on the system performance by showing that for a dynamical flow network to be stabilizable by some control policy, it is necessary that the exogenous inflows belong to a certain stability region, that is determined by the network topology, the link capacities, and the scheduling constraints. Then, we introduce a family of distributed controls, referred to as generalized proportional allocation (GPA) policies, and prove that they stabilize a dynamical transportation network whenever the exogenous inflows belong to such stability region. The proposed GPA control policies are decentralized and fully scalable as they rely on local feedback information only. Differently from previously studied maximally stabilizing control strategies, the GPA control policies do not require any global information about the network topology, the exogenous inflows, or the routing, which makes them robust to unpredicted network load variations and changes in the link capacities or the routing decisions. Moreover, the proposed GPA control policies also take into account the overhead time while switching between services. Our theoretical results find one application in the control of urban traffic networks with signalized intersections, where vehicles have to queue up at junctions and the traffic signal controls determine the green light allocation to the different incoming lanes.},

We derive a lower bound on the minimum average feedback data rate that guarantees achieving a certain level of average quadratic performance over all possible realizations of the random delay. For the special case of a constant channel delay, we obtain an upper bound by proposing linear source-coding schemes that attain desired performance levels with rates that are at most 1.254 b per sample greater than the lower bound. We supplement our results with a numerical experiment demonstrating that the obtained bounds and operational rates are increasing functions of the constant delay.},

  abstract     = {Certifying the safety or robustness of neural networks against input uncertainties and adversarial attacks is an emerging challenge in the area of safe machine learning and control. To provide such a guarantee, one must be able to bound the output of neural networks when their input changes within a bounded set. In this article, we propose a semidefinite programming (SDP) framework to address this problem for feed-forward neural networks with general activation functions and input uncertainty sets. Our main idea is to abstract various properties of activation functions (e.g., monotonicity, bounded slope, bounded values, and repetition across layers) with the formalism of quadratic constraints. We then analyze the safety properties of the abstracted network via the S -procedure and SDP. Our framework spans the tradeoff between conservatism and computational efficiency and applies to problems beyond safety verification. We evaluate the performance of our approach via numerical problem instances of various sizes.},
