  abstract     = {Inclusion of game elements in health education has proved to be effective in helping student training. Commonly termed as “serious games” these gamified systems can be an alternative to empower and motivate students during the learning process. The literature contains serious games for professional training in many health-related areas, including several motivating and playful gamification elements, and a variety of evaluation techniques used. Some review studies have compiled articles that present serious games for health-related areas analyzing aspects such as development methodologies and assessment techniques. However, the playful aspects that contribute to the health education process have not yet been compiled. This article focuses on a systematic review that analyzes the state of the art regarding serious games for health-related education, and evaluates the following: 1) game elements; 2) platforms, evaluation methods; and 3) requirements analysis methods. The findings indicate that “Tasks,” “Score,” and “Level Progression” were the most used gamification elements. Physiotherapy, psychology, and physical education were the areas most covered by the included articles. Pre and posttest questionnaires were identified as the main methods used to evaluate the serious games. The article contributes with an overview of the serious games design process, abstracted from the performed review and depicted in a diagram showing the phases commonly found in our study. The article also proposes a categorization for the most used game elements and evaluation methods.},

  abstract     = {For the offshore energy industry, virtual environment technology can enhance conventional training by teaching basic offshore safety protocols such as onboard familiarization and emergency evacuation. Virtual environments have the added benefit of being used to investigate the impact of different training approaches on competence. This pilot study uses decision tree modeling to examine the efficacy of two pedagogical approaches, simulation-based mastery learning (SBML) and lecture-based training (LBT), in a virtual environment. Decision trees are an inductive reasoning approach that can be used to identify learners’ egress strategies in offshore emergencies after training. The efficacy of the virtual training is evaluated in three ways: 1) analyzing participants’ performance scores in test scenarios; 2) comparing the decision tree depiction of participant&#39;s understanding of emergency egress to the intended learning objectives; and 3) comparing the decision strategies developed under a different pedagogical approach. A comparison of the resulting decision trees from the SBML training with trees generated from the LBT showed that the different training methods influenced the participants’ egress strategies. The SBML approach resulted in concise decision trees and better route selection strategies when compared to the LBT training. This pilot study demonstrates the diagnostic capabilities of decision trees as training assessment tools and recommends integrating decision trees into virtual training to better support the learning needs of individuals and deliver adaptive training scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) face milestones in understanding other&#39;s preferences and intentions that in turn affect their reciprocity and interaction skills during a collaborative partnership. Investigators are advocating the use of digital-medium-based multiuser platforms to encourage learning of collaborative interaction skills among these children. Although currently available platforms encourage interaction, these do not consider aspects, e.g., anticipating and understanding the partner&#39;s preference (or intentions) along with spontaneous reciprocation through turn-taking, important for nurturing effective interaction. In this article, we have developed a multiuser virtual-reality-based interaction skill learning platform (M-VISP) in which the users can interact with each other through turn-taking using the digital platform. Successful execution of the task (quantified in terms of performance) needs them to understand each other&#39;s preferences before reciprocating. A usability study was designed in which individuals with ASD ( n = 18) and typical development ( n = 18) volunteered. Results indicated that the multiuser interaction facility offered by M-VISP could quantify one&#39;s ability to understand the preference of a partner in terms of their performance in a task and the spontaneity with which one reciprocated. Additionally, we observed an improving trend in the ability to understand a partner&#39;s preference along with exhibiting spontaneity in reciprocation among individuals with ASD.},

  abstract     = {With the onset of online education via technology-enhanced learning platforms, large amount of educational data is being generated in the form of logs, clickstreams, performance, etc. These Virtual Learning Environments provide an opportunity to the researchers for the application of educational data mining and learning analytics, for mining the students learning behavior. This further helps them in data-driven decision making through timely intervention via early warning systems (EWS), reflecting and optimizing educational environments, and refining pedagogical designs. In this, the role of EWS is to timely identify the at-risk students. This study proposes a modeling methodology deploying interpretable Hidden Markov Model for mining of the sequential learning behavior built upon derived performance features from light-weight assessments. The public OULA dataset having diversified courses and 32 593 student records is used for validation. The results on the unseen test data achieve a classification accuracy ranging from 87.67% to 94.83% and AUC from 0.927 to 0.989, and outperforms other baseline models. For implementation of EWS, the study also predicts the optimal time-period, during the first and second quarter of the course with sufficient number of light-weight assessments in place. With the outcomes, this study tries to establish an efficient generalized modeling framework that may lead the higher educational institutes toward sustainable development.},

  abstract     = {This article addresses the problem of traffic congestion through a learning perspective, highlighting the capabilities of information, and communication technologies to transform society. Recent physical and mathematical analysis of congestion reveals that training drivers to keep a safe distance systematically contributes to the emergence and maintenance of interference congestion (so-called phantom traffic jam). This article presents the WaveDriving Course (WDC), a simulated learning environment designed to help drivers progress from the traditional drive-to-keep-distance (DD) technique to a new car-following (CF) principle better suited for wave-like traffic, drive-to-keep-inertia (DI). The WDC is based on the ordinary knowledge of the driver (e.g., going through a series of traffic lights) and presents this situation in terms of two possible simultaneous behavioral strategies. The driver has the opportunity to verify that it is possible to achieve the same objective with different consequences. Finally, the WDC checks to what extent this learning generates transfer patterns in the analogous case of CF. This article focuses on results concerning the first WDC module: the traffic-light analogy. Forty-two participants followed the whole learning procedure for about 30 min. An evaluative CF test was administered before and after visioning the tutorial and practicing on the simulator. Overall, transference from this traffic-light analog to the CF situation (posttest) was successful. Results confirm the adoption of the expected DI strategies (speed variability decreased, distance and distance variability to leader increased, fuel consumption decreased, platoon elongation decreased, etc.). The need to improve the WDC teaching of the appropriate CF distance is discussed.},

The latter case, in particular, poses significant challenges that are specific to the educational domain. Indeed, teaming students aims to accomplish far more than the successful completion of a specific task. It needs to ensure that all the members in the team benefit from the collaborative work, while also ensuring that the participants are not discriminated against with respect to their protected attributes, such as race and gender. Toward achieving these goals, this article introduces FERN , a fair team formation approach that promotes mutually beneficial peer learning, dictated by protected group fairness as equality of opportunity in collaborative learning. We formulate the problem as a multi-objective discrete optimization problem. We show this problem to be NP-hard and propose a heuristic hill-climbing algorithm. Extensive experiments on both the synthetic and real-world datasets against well-known team formation techniques show the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Now, the main challenge for the educationists is to identify how these attributes are utilized by the learners. In this article, we have represented any online class as a social network where students are connected through learning platforms. We have mined the network based on several network measuring parameters to recognize the maneuvering pattern of these digital resources or attributes by the students. We have also proposed a community detection method that would form different groups among the students based on their comfortable learning patterns. As a case study, we have scrutinized the accessing patterns of different digital learning resources by some particular students. The experimental results show the significant relationship between the digital resource accessing patterns of the students with their immediate performance in the test.

Ensuring that the appropriate accommodations were selected requires an intelligent support tool to track their effectiveness. In this article, we regard the effectiveness of such accommodations in terms of their quality and reliability. High-quality accommodations allow students with LIs equal access and equal opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge compared to their peers who do not have LIs. Highly reliable accommodations mean a significant performance difference between students with LIs who actually use the accommodations compared with students with LIs who do not use the accommodations, given similar student characteristics. Previous literature is inconclusive regarding the evidence of the effectiveness of such accommodations since different accommodations may have a different effect on different subgroups of exams and students. This article proposes a methodology, based on ordinal interpretable models, that produce practical insights to professionals who are responsible for students with LIs, to address the problem of exploring the effectiveness of learning accommodations. The suggested models use the ordinal information of the target variables for evaluating student performance and yield practical insights for designing the most suitable accommodation for a student with LIs based on their characteristics. The ordinal interpretable models are evaluated using a database of tens of thousands of engineering students. The results demonstrate that the suggested interpretable models perform significantly better than the compared algorithms on all measures.},

  abstract     = {Due to the unprecedented growth in available data collected by e-learning platforms, including platforms used by massive open online course (MOOC) providers, important opportunities arise to structurally use these data for decision making and improvement of the educational offering. Student retention is a strategic task that can be supported by means of automated data-driven dropout prediction. Given the time-based nature of the collected data (user activity), these data can be viewed as sequences, and thus, sequence mining presents itself as a fitting set of techniques to automatically extract valuable insights. However, there is a lack of general guidelines for using sequence mining in specific educational settings, as well as little information on how different techniques perform in comparison to each other. We address these limitations with two main contributions. First, we propose a framework for applying sequence classification for dropout prediction in MOOCs. This framework includes two data-driven dropout definitions, the specification of data formatting and preparation tasks, and a blackprint on how to train dropout prediction models at suitable time points in the run of the course. Second, we conduct a benchmarking study of recent and well-performing sequence classification techniques, tested with different parametrizations on 47 real-life datasets from MOOCs, resulting in a comparative assessment of over 18 000 models. Our results provide insight into the performance differences between the techniques and allow us to formulate concrete recommendations toward the choice of suitable hyperparameters that have a significant influence on the predictive performance.},

  abstract     = {Educational process mining is now a promising method to provide decision-support information for the teaching–learning process via finding useful educational guidance from the event logs recorded in the learning management system. Existing studies mainly focus on mining students&#39; problem-solving skills or behavior patterns and intervening in students&#39; learning processes according to this information in the late course. However, educators often expect to improve the learning outcome in a proactive manner through dynamically designing instructional strategies prior to a course that are more appropriate to students&#39; average ability. Therefore, in this article, we propose a two-stage problem-solving ability modeling approach to obtain students&#39; ability in different learning stages, including the pre-problem-solving ability model and the post-problem-solving ability model. The models are trained with Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) on the historical event logs of the prerequisite course and the target course, respectively. With the premodel, we establish the students&#39; pre-problem-solving ability profiles that reflect their average knowledge level before starting a course. Then, the instructional design is dynamically chosen according to the profiles. After a course completes, the post-problem-solving ability profiles are generated by the postmodel to analyze the learning outcome and prompt the learning feedback, in order to complete the closed-loop teaching process. We study the modeling of coding ability in computer programming education to show our teaching strategy. The experimental results show that the generalizable problem-solving ability models yield high classification precision, while most students&#39; abilities have been significantly improved by the proposed approach at the end of the course.},

  abstract     = {Conventional e-learning platforms require a high self-regulatory learning (SRL) ability to ensure learning effectiveness. However, because not everyone has high autonomy and a high SRL ability, many students quit during the online learning period. To enhance the SRL ability, many studies have developed e-learning platforms based on Zimmerman&#39;s SRL training model. However, these platforms still require learners to complete a series of provided learning tasks independently and autonomously. This article developed an e-learning platform based on Zimmerman&#39;s SRL training model by using role-model group awareness tools to visualize the learning context and activities of the group of role models in each SRL training phase for learners’ observation, self-reflection, and emulation. To test the model, the learning outcomes of the two groups of students enrolled in the same course were measured experimentally. The experimental class consisted of 36 students using the proposed system, whereas the control class consisted of 35 students using a traditional e-learning platform. The experimental class spent more learning time on the platform and achieved better learning results than did the control class. Moreover, the experimental class had gradually improved assessment scores and SRL-related behaviors. The final section presents explanations, discussion, and implications derived from analytical results.},

This ecosystem consists of four major hubs: 1) instructional design and performance technology hub; 2) knowledge hub; 3) research and technology hub; and 4) talent and training hub. Common to all four hubs are the factors in the three wheels: 1) infrastructure, business industry, and communication; 2) technology access and equity; and 3) user rights, data security, and privacy policy. We believe that this framework can help guide emerging research and development on the applications of the Metaverse in education. We also hope this article can serve as a launch pad for the special issue on the Metaverse and the Future of Education supported by the IEEE Education Society.},

  abstract     = {Design and computer graphics curricula for tertiary education include 3-D modeling skills. Students must learn to represent (complex) 3-D objects by means of parametric surfaces or polygonal meshes. Three-dimensional modeling may be a complex task, and students must be able to accrue a certain deal of experience in the field before passing the exam. The main difficulties the students must face mainly concern the comprehension of 3-D shapes and the choice of the most appropriate modeling techniques. This article proposes a framework to support bachelor&#39;s degree students in modeling 3-D objects by means of parametric surfaces. The proposed framework provides two augmented reality (AR) apps for smartphones and a web portal. The mobile AR apps allow students to deeply visualize 3-D object shapes, thus performing a set of guided exercises to practice basic modeling techniques. On the other hand, the web portal allows students to share their models with teachers and classmates to obtain feedback and comments. The preliminary results show the effectiveness of the proposed solution, as all volunteers involved in the experimental phase achieved better results after using the tools. Moreover, the students&#39; opinions about the proposed framework are positive.},

  abstract     = {Central to imagining the future of technology-enhanced professional learning is the question of how data are gathered, analyzed, and fed back to stakeholders. The field of learning analytics (LA) has emerged over the last decade at the intersection of data science, learning sciences, human-centered and instructional design, and organizational change, and so could in principle inform how data can be gathered and analyzed in ways that support professional learning. However, in contrast to formal education where most research in LA has been conducted, much work-integrated learning is experiential, social, situated, and practice-bound. Supporting such learning exposes a significant weakness in LA research, and to make sense of this gap, this article proposes an adaptation of the Knowledge-Agency Window framework. It draws attention to how different forms of professional learning locate on the dimensions of learner agency and knowledge creation. Specifically, we argue that the concept of “reframing oneself” holds particular relevance for informal, work-integrated learning. To illustrate how this insight translates into LA design for professionals, three examples are provided: first, analyzing personal and team skills profiles ( skills analytics ); second, making sense of challenging workplace experiences ( reflective writing analytics ); and third, reflecting on orientation to learning ( dispositional analytics ). We foreground professional agency as a key requirement for such techniques to be used effectively and ethically.},

The interviews were analyzed through a framework that combined lenses of value-sensitive design and value creation to uncover the values underpinning current applications of LA in the corporate sector. We found that corporations vary in their strategic LA orientations when it comes to organizational learning and development. However, although aspirational narratives of executives are diverse, their activities are not. The implications of the rich qualitative findings suggest that learning sciences can support organizational learning by creating diagnostic tools to identify organizational orientations for LA. Computer scientists can also support decision-making and research on corporate LA by creating tools that can help map organizational aspirations and activities in relation to the various data sources, stemming from different organizational units. We conclude by outlining these recommendations.},

  abstract     = {Computer science pedagogy, especially in the higher education and vocational training context, has long-favored the hands-on practice provided by programming tasks due to the belief that this leads to better performance on hands-on tasks at work. This assumption, however, has not been experimentally tested against other modes of engagement such as worked example-based reflection. While theory suggests that example-based reflection could be better for conceptual learning, the concern is that the lack of practice will leave students unable to implement the learned concepts in practice, thus leaving them unprepared for work. In this article, therefore, we experimentally contrast programming practice with example-based reflection to observe their differential impact on conceptual learning and performance on a hands-on task in the context of a collaborative programming project. The industry paradigm of Mob Programming, adapted for use in an online and instructional context, is used to structure the collaboration. Keeping with the prevailing view held in pedagogy, we hypothesize that example-based reflection will lead to better conceptual learning but will be detrimental to hands-on task performance. Results support that reflection leads to conceptual learning. Additionally, however, reflection does not pose an impediment to hands-on task performance. We discuss possible explanations for this effect, thus providing an improved understanding of prior theory in this new computer science education context. We also discuss implications for the pedagogy of software engineering education, in light of this new evidence, that impacts student learning as well as work performance in the future.},

However, there is a dearth of research in the context of automated analysis of reflective writing demonstrated by professionals within workplace learning. Building on a four-level reflective content analysis model, this article evaluates the depth of reflection exhibited by learners within a professional development MOOC using an automated assessment classifier. Our results identify the varying association of linguistic features across these different levels of reflection.

Rebo Junior, a nonadaptive conversational agent, was evaluated in a 12-week field study with apprentices. We analyzed apprentices’ interactions with Rebo Junior in terms of reflectivity and measured the development of their reflection competence via reflective essays at three points in time during the field study. Reflection competence, a key competency for lifelong professional learning, becomes significantly higher by the third essay after repeated interactions with Rebo Junior (paired samples t -test t 13 = 3.00, p = 0.010 from Essay 1 to Essay 3). However, we also observed a significant decrease in reflectivity in the Rebo Junior interactions over time (paired samples t -test between the first and eighth interaction: t 7 = 2.50, p = 0.041). We attribute this decline to 1) the novelty of Rebo Junior wearing off (novelty effect) and 2) the apprentices learning the script and experiencing subsequent frustration due to the script not fading over time. Overall, this work 1) informs future design through the observation of consistent decreases in engagement over eight interactions with static scaffolding, 2) contributes a reflection script applicable for reflection on tasks that resemble future expected work tasks, a typical setting in lifelong professional learning, and 3) indicates increased reflection competence after repeated reflection guided by a conversational agent.},

Based on a systematic literature review and semistructured interviews, we have developed design requirements for interactive 360-degree learning environments. We used a workshop-based mixed-method approach with interviews, concept maps, and video analysis to evaluate the motivation and performance of precision mechanics within a prototypical work-process-oriented learning environment in an intercompany vocational training center. The results show a positive effect on learning outcomes and motivation. In addition, the ease of use and sense of presence while using the learning environment are rated as high. We contribute to theory by shedding new light on learners’ motivation and performance within work-process-oriented interactive 360-degree learning environments. Furthermore, we offer guidelines for developing interactive 360-degree learning environments against the background of the current metaverse discussion.},

  abstract     = {The use of virtual reality (VR) for industrial training helps minimize risks and costs by allowing more frequent and varied use of experiential learning activities, leading to active and improved learning. However, creating VR training experiences is costly and time-consuming, requiring software development experts. Additionally, current authoring tools lack integration with existing data and are desktop-oriented, which detach the pedagogic process of creating the immersive experience from experiencing it in a situated context. In this article, we present a novel interactive approach for immersive authoring of VR-based experiential training by the trainers themselves, from inside the virtual environment and without the support of development experts. The design includes identifying interactable elements, such as 3-D models, equipment, tools, settings, and environment. The trainer also specifies by demonstration the actions to be performed by trainees, as a virtual choreography. During course execution, trainees’ activities are also registered as virtual choreographies and matched to those specified by the trainer. Thus, trainer and trainee are culturally situated within their area semantics and social discourse, rather than adopting concepts of the VR system for the learning content. We conducted a usability case study with professionals from an international wind energy company, using detailed models of wind turbines and real-world procedures. Trainers set up a training course using the immersive authoring tool, and trainees executed the course. The learning experience and usability were analyzed, and the training was certified by comparing real-world task completion between a user who had undergone virtual training and a user who did not.},

In an era of global, organizational, and technological change, all of which are transforming the world of work, professional and workplace learning are critical for employability and organizational competitiveness. A range of fundamental transformations is changing how people work. Digital technologies are replacing human labor and, at the same time, are accelerating the expansion of job roles and work practices. Work is becoming increasingly specialized, which means that professionals in collaborative and networked ways across discipline and organization boundaries. In parallel, labor is increasingly decentralized, making decisionmaking more distributed and raising the need for remote communication and collaboration. Subsequently, work is becoming more independent from time and place, as people connect, collaborate, and work via digital technologies. These changes come with a need for substantial and continuous workplace learning, and with the need for changes in how workplace learning happens. Of course, digital technologies are already used to provide learning and training in workplaces. However, most of these learning technologies have been developed for formal education (e.g., K- 12 and higher education) rather than in workplace contexts. There is a need to understand and evidence workplace learning needs and to further develop technologies that can support and scale workplace learning.},

Literature provides examples of tools for scaffolding SRL in online environments. In this article, we provide the state-of-the-art concerning tools that support SRL in terms of theoretical models underpinning development, supported SRL processes, tool functionalities, used data and visualizations. We reviewed 42 articles published between 2008 and 2020, including information from 25 tools designed to support SRL. Our findings indicate that: 1) many of the studies do not explicitly specify the SRL theoretical model used to guide the design process of the tool; 2) goal setting, monitoring, and self-evaluation are the most prevalent SRL processes supported through functionalities, such as content navigation, user input forms, collaboration features, and recommendations; 3) the relationship between tool functionalities and SRL processes are rarely described; and 4) few tools assess the impact on learners’ SRL process and learning performance. Finally, we highlight some lessons learned that might contribute to implementing future tools that support learners’ SRL processes.},

In this article, we systematically map the techniques and algorithms that are needed to create such learning paths automatically. We focus on open educational resources (OER), though a similar approach can be used with other types of learning objects. Our method of mapping goes through three passes of selected literature. First, we selected all articles mentioning OER and machine learning from IEEE, SCOPUS, and ACM. This resulted in a set of 347 papers after removing duplicates. Of these, 13 were selected as relating to learning paths and their references and citations were identified and organized into eight categories identified in this article (metadata, linked data, recommendation systems, concept maps, knowledge graphs, classification, and learning paths). After identifying these topics, a manual review was conducted resulting in the final set of 112 papers. This article combines the found categories into three steps for learning path creation, which are then discussed in detail. These steps are as follows: 1) concept extraction; 2) relationship mapping; and 3) path creation. Current research relates primarily to enhancing concept extraction and relationship mapping. We identify directions for potential future research that focus on automatically augmenting previously created learning paths in accordance with the changing needs of learners.},

  abstract     = {Predictive modeling is a core technique used in tackling various tasks in learning analytics research, e.g., classifying educational forum posts, predicting learning performance, and identifying at-risk students. When applying a predictive model, it is often treated as the first priority to improve its prediction accuracy as much as possible. Class balancing, which aims to adjust the unbalanced data samples of different class labels before using them as input to train a predictive model, has been widely regarded as a powerful method for boosting prediction accuracy. However, its impact on algorithmic bias remains largely unexplored, i.e., whether the use of class balancing methods would alleviate or amplify the differentiated prediction accuracy received by different groups of students (e.g., female versus male). To fill this gap, our study selected three representative predictive tasks as the testbed, based on which we 1) applied two well known metrics (i.e., hardness bias and distribution bias) to measure data characteristics to which algorithmic bias might be attributed; and 2) investigated the impact of a total of eleven class balancing techniques on prediction fairness. Through extensive analysis and evaluation, we found that class balancing techniques, in general, tended to improve predictive fairness between different groups of students. Furthermore, class balancing techniques (e.g., SMOTE and ADASYN), which add samples to the minority group (i.e., oversampling) can enhance the predictive accuracy of the minority group while not negatively affecting the majority group. Consequently, both fairness and accuracy can be improved by applying these oversampling class balancing methods.

  abstract     = {In this article, we advocate for and propose a novel concept map driven knowledge tracing (CMKT) model, which utilizes educational concept map for learner modeling. This article particularly addresses the issue of learner data sparseness caused by the unwillingness to practice and irregular learning behaviors on the learner side. CMKT considers the concept map as a new information source and explicitly exploits its inherent information to help the estimation of the learner&#39;s knowledge state. Specifically, the pairwise educational relations in the concept map are formulated as the ordering pairs and are used as mathematical constraints for model construction. The topology information in the concept map is extracted and used as the model input by employing the network embedding techniques. Integrating both educational relation information and topology information in the concept map, CMKT adopts the recurrent neural network to perform knowledge tracing tasks. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on five public educational datasets of four different subjects (more than 8000 learners and their 300 000 records) demonstrate the promise and effectiveness of CMKT: The average area under ROC curve (AUC) and overall prediction accuracy (ACC) achieve 0.82 and 0.75, respectively, and CMKT outperforms all the baselines by at least 12.2% and 9.2% in terms of AUC and ACC.},

Previous research suggests that increasing children&#39;s awareness about their own behaviors during collaboration may help them adjust their behaviors and become better partners. Despite this promise, there are currently no educational technologies designed to support children in visualizing and reflecting on their collaborative dialogues. This article reports on an application that generates interactive visualizations of children&#39;s dialogue illustrating their word counts, questions counts and types, dialogue content, keywords from their dialogue, and a video recording of their interaction. We evaluated the application by conducting a study with 20 children who were completing computer science (block-based coding) tasks collaboratively and examined how they changed their dialogues in a subsequent dialogue after interacting with the visualizations of their dialogues. Results show that after viewing their dialogue visualizations, children engaged in more balanced dialogues and that less-engaged students talked more and asked more questions. This article provides evidence that dialogue visualization tools have a great potential for supporting young learners as they deeply think about their own dialogue and improve their collaborative behaviors.},

Understanding OOP concepts can be difficult for novice programmers, and often leads to the development of misconceptions. This is exacerbated when the discipline requires students to learn a technical low-level language such as C++, as is the case in many engineering disciplines. We propose a block-based programming language extension, Blockly-OOP, to help students learn core OOP concepts without the technical complexities associated with traditional textual languages. The Blockly-OOP Learning Environment was developed by integrating Blockly-OOP with learning activities that guide students through programming exercises that target popular OOP misconceptions. An evaluation ( n = 238) in a second-year programming course (CS2) showed that a block-based programming language helps students improve their understanding of object-oriented concepts, warranting further research in this area.},

The current landscape is dominated by special-purpose, context-specific peer evaluation systems, which were designed to support a particular type of learning activity, artifact, or discipline. In this article, we propose an alternative, a generic and comprehensive peer assessment platform, called LearnEval, which is very flexible and able to accommodate a variety of pedagogical scenarios. Distinctive functionalities include: highly configurable peer assessment workflow, several automatic and manual review allocation mechanisms, initial calibration/training options for the students, complex dashboard with statistics, scores and graphical visualizations, as well as an extensive open learner model. The platform was developed in an iterative manner, with several extensions and improvements informed by the findings of the initial pilot studies. The article also reports on a practical application of LearnEval in a project-based learning scenario, with very promising results; multiple perspectives of the peer assessment process are analyzed: student behavior, peer grades validity, and perceived learning experience. Comparative results with an earlier study show increased levels of system usability, grading validity, and student satisfaction.},

At the same time, tools such as notebooks and interactive apps designed to support the teaching of programming concepts are becoming ever more popular. However, in non-CS majors, CT might not be perceived as essential, and students might lack the motivation to engage with such tools in order to acquire solid CT skills. This article presents a field study conducted with 115 students during a full semester on a novel computational notebook environment. It evaluates computational notebooks and CT skills in an introductory course on information technology for first-year undergraduates in business and economics. A multidimensional evaluation approach makes use of pre- and post-test surveys, lectures, and self-directed laboratory sessions tracking analytics. Our findings suggest that, in the process of learning CT for non-CS students, engagement in active learning activities can be a stronger determinant of learning outcomes than initial knowledge. Furthermore, gamifying computational notebooks can serve as a strong driver of active learning engagement, even more so than initial motivational factors.},

Based on insights from literature and a survey with learning analytics (LA) experts, we have developed a framework to guide the design of SFLA. The framework is built around three questions that designers should address to generate SFLA features for supporting SRL: What are the students’ self-regulated learning support needs based on self-regulated learning theory? What are the students’ perspectives of SFLA in meeting their SRL needs? What SFLA features are appropriate to support students’ self-regulated learning based on their SRL needs ? A set of activities that should be conducted to respond to each question is identified within the framework. To evaluate the framework, a focus group discussion with LA experts was conducted, and feedback obtained was used to revise the framework. The framework provides a rationale for understanding student needs as informed by theory.},

  abstract     = {Automatic short-answer grading (ASAG) is a key component of intelligent tutoring systems. Deep learning is an advanced method to deal with recognizing textual entailment tasks in an end-to-end manner. However, deep learning methods for ASAG still remain challenging mainly because of the following two major reasons: 1) high-precision scoring requires a deep understanding of the answer text; and 2) ASAG&#39;s corpus is usually small and cannot provide enough training data for deep learning. To address these challenges, in this article, we propose a novel bidirectional encoder representation from transformer (BERT)-based deep neural network framework for ASAG. First, we use a pretrained and fine-tuned BERT model to dynamically encode the answer text, which can effectively overcome the problem of a too small corpus in the ASAG task. Second, to generate a powerful semantic representation for ASAG, we construct a semantic refinement layer to refine the semantics of the BERT outputs, which consists of a bidirectional-Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network and a Capsule network with position information in parallel. Third, we propose a triple-hot loss strategy for regression tasks in ASAG, which changes the gold label representation in the standard cross-entropy loss function from one-hot to triple-hot. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed model is effective and outperforms most of the state-of-the-art systems on both the SemEval-2013 dataset and the Mohler dataset. The code is available online at https://github.com/wuhan-1222/ASAG .},

  abstract     = {Effective presentation skills are an important ability for students and professionals to possess. Automatic analysis of presentation skills can help provide feedback to a speaker, and a complete analysis is possible only with both speaker and audience measurement. In this article, we propose a methodology to predict presentation skills on a small dataset using a model learned on a larger and reasonably closer dataset, which we call the source dataset. A classroom-type multimodal dataset with videos of both the speaker and the audience was collected. A rich set of audio, visual, and textual cues were extracted that relate to the presentation skill of a speaker. The presentation skills and audience engagement are inferred using models learned on the source dataset, which is close to our data. The analysis shows that adaptation of the source model to the target domain data is required for better performance. Also, automatic prediction of audience engagement is done to analyze the relationship between audience engagement and the presentation skill of the speaker. The analysis shows that a weak correlation exists between the automatic audience engagement prediction and the audience rating given for the presentation skill of the speaker.},

  abstract     = {In a concept learning scenario, any technology-supported learning system must provide students with mechanisms that help them with the acquisition of the concepts to be learned. For the technology-supported learning systems to be successful in this task, the development of didactic material is crucial—a hard task that could be alleviated by means of an automation process. In this proposal, two systems which have been previously developed, ArikIturri and DOM-Sortze, are combined to automatically generate multiple-choice questions, based on pedagogically relevant information gathered in textbooks. Originally, the former was able to generate multiple-choice questions from plain texts; and the latter was able to elicit learning objects based on didactic material explicitly represented in electronic textbooks, i.e., definitions, examples, and exercises. This article presents an approach for the automatic generation of multiple-choice questions from learning objects extracted from textbooks. Specifically, ArikIturri uses as input the texts gathered in the learning objects elicited by DOM-Sortze and, using natural language processing techniques, generates multiple-choice questions. This way, considering domain-relevant information from the textbooks, test-type exercises which were not previously elicited by DOM-Sortze are created. In summary, this new approach is able to enrich domain modules of technology-supported learning systems. The proposal has been tested with a textbook which is written in the Basque language and the results show that the generated exercises are suitable to be used in science learning scenarios at secondary school.},

  abstract     = {Existing research on spatial ability recognizes the critical role played by spatial visualization and mental rotation. Recent evidence suggests that external visualization and manipulation can boost spatial thinking. The virtual environment provides an exciting opportunity so that many spatial ability training tasks based on reading printed illustrations can be migrated to a highly 3-D interactive and visualized environment. However, few studies have employed virtual reality (VR) technology to improve spatial visualization and mental rotation. In addition, the design of training contents and corresponding VR applications are still lacking. In this work, we propose FORSpatial, a system mainly for spatial ability training in a virtual environment. First, in this article, we design a novel scheme and principles for generating tasks, involving spatial visualization and mental rotation through flexible combinations of shapes and letters. Based on this, we create testing questions and a FORSpatial training application in desktop VR. FORSpatial and its components are made publicly available and free to use. To evaluate the performance of spatial training, verify the usability of the FORSpatial application, and analyze learning behavior, we organized a user study with 49 .participants, including an experimental group and a control group. The comparison between experimental and control groups shows the significant improvement of spatial skills through training. The analysis of interaction logging data and subjective comments reveals how FORSpatial supports spatial thinking.},

In this article, we propose a method for predicting student final grades in a course using only their performance data in the current semester. It assists students in analyzing how much effort they need to put into the course to obtain the desired grades while helping course instructors identify student types at the early stages of the course to provide better support for them. Our method, initially clusters students into several groups based on experience points (XP) that they obtain during a semester. Then, we estimate cluster size and balance clusters by generating and adding virtual students to the smaller clusters. Finally, we drop unimportant student attributes using a feature selection technique. We then predict their final grades via three different algorithms. We have compared the performance of our method with other approaches using data collected from a course for nine years, using data collected from 679 students. The results indicate that our method outperformed the others while achieving 78.02% average accuracy only four weeks after starting the course. It shows we can effectively predict final grades, which will potentially enhance students’ learning outcomes.},

Literacy is significantly affected when problems exist in understanding the phonological component or sound structure of language, i.e., phonological awareness. Children with dyslexia in particular experience difficulties in spelling and reading accuracy due to a deficit in this phonological component of language. To support children with dyslexia and reduced literacy skills, intervention programs that focus on phonological awareness elements are recommended. Studies show that game-based learning interventions can enhance learning for children with dyslexia. The purpose of this pilot study was to partner with children with dyslexia aged between 9 and 12 years, to develop a game toolkit called Cosmic Sounds, and to support the teaching of phonological awareness skills. The content for the Cosmic Sounds games was informed by a pedagogical expert in dyslexia. This pilot study addressed the following: “Can a toolkit of games, codesigned by children with dyslexia improve the teaching of phonological awareness skills?” Our findings showed that by including children and their teacher as part of the design team, they were more invested in using the games for learning. Furthermore, when children with dyslexia played Cosmic Sounds, there was a positive impact on their phonological awareness skills progress while their engagement in learning also increased.},

  abstract     = {Children with autism are characterized by milestones in joint attention (JA) skill. They fail to understand the directional cue issued by a partner (during social communication), which often results in them reciprocating inappropriately and not completing the JA bid successfully. The directional cues can be gaze-pointing, finger-pointing, etc., toward a target object of interest. Here, in this article, we present a TABlet-based Joint Attention Task (TABJAT) platform that can present JA tasks on a tablet with virtual characters (serving the role of JA administrator), delivering prompting cues (e.g., gaze-pointing, finger-pointing, and head orientation) and virtual objects offering sparkling cue. The platform is adaptive to one&#39;s JA skill (while autonomously offering JA tasks with gradually decreasing cueing prompt information, i.e., increasing the task difficulty). This can offer an opportunity for a child to interact with the JA tasks by himself/herself (preserving the triadic interaction regime of JA tasks) and learn the skill while being at home and/or school. Results of a study with 18 children with autism indicate the feasibility of TABJAT to be accepted by the target group, and quantify their JA skill in an individualized manner in terms of their task performance while adaptively offering the JA tasks of varying difficulty.},

An AR-based assembly instruction app on mobile devices was developed, and a comparative research approach was adopted. A total of 104 junior students from four classes on automotive engineering at Nanjing Forestry University participated in the experiment during their professional skill training course. The control group was provided with handouts as usual, and the experimental group was required to use AR instructions during the assembly processes. Several evaluation indicators, such as assembly quality and speed, were recorded and analyzed at the same time. The results showed that such indicators were significantly improved with the utilization of AR. In addition, a questionnaire was specifically designed and distributed to all the students at the end of the course. It was found that several learning factors, such as learning interest and academic achievements in the experimental group, showed a positive correlation.},

The more learners participating in the forum, the more difficult it is for instructors to provide timely support. The effective intervention of teaching assistants (TAs) can play a crucial role in mitigating this issue; however, questions arise regarding the instructional approaches that TAs follow and whether they can effectively promote learning in a MOOC environment. In this article, we study the instructional approaches that TAs followed in two MOOCs of different subject matters, using mixed-methods. The goal was to evaluate the pedagogies that TAs adopted in facilitating learners, following a broadly accepted framework on MOOC instructional quality. Content analysis and interviews with the TAs provided insights into their intervention strategies, while linguistic and social network analysis enhanced the findings. The study revealed that the TAs most often were rushing to provide direct answers rather than guiding learners in finding themselves an answer. Problem-solving approaches and collaboration were not adequately promoted. The findings of this article provide design implications for the development of supportive tools that could automatically assess facilitators’ instructional approaches in the forum. Thus, timely feedback could be provided to instructors so as to refine the instructional design of their online courses and to provide guided support to their learner facilitators while courses are running.},

  abstract     = {Educational assessments often require uniform test forms, for which each test form has equivalent measurement accuracy but with a different set of items. For uniform test assembly, an important issue is the increase of the number of assembled uniform tests. Although many automatic uniform test assembly methods exist, the maximum clique algorithm (MCA)-based method is known to assemble the greatest number of uniform tests with the highest measurement accuracy based on the item response theory. In that method, the graph is constructed by sequentially adding a randomly formed test as a vertex without considering the graph structure. However, an important difficulty is its high space complexity, which interrupts search cliques with more than a hundred thousand vertices. To overcome this difficulty, this article proposes a new uniform test assembly algorithm: hybrid maximum clique algorithm using parallel integer programming. The first step searches a maximum clique that is as large as possible up to computer memory limitations using a state-of-the-art MCA with low time complexity but with high space complexity. The second step repeatedly searches a vertex connected with all vertices of the current maximum clique from the remaining vertices using integer programming with low space complexity but with high time complexity. The proposed method constructs a larger number of tests than the traditional methods do. Finally, we use simulation and actual data experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Results show that our method assembles a 1.5–2.7 times greater number of uniform tests than traditional methods can.},

These courses typically have a strong practical component where students learn the fundamentals of the computer architecture and the handling of input/output operations through the development of simple programs in a low-level assembly programming language. Since these practical sessions require a strong involvement, student attendance and withdrawal rates are poor, lowering academic results and introducing a negative feedback loop that preconditions students to dislike them. This article introduces a new methodology for the practical sessions of Computer Organization and Design courses. This methodology disavows the use of simulators and focuses on actual hardware to promote a feeling of proximity to the execution and outcome of the programs. The proposed setup uses Raspberry Pi devices to encourage students to work autonomously, due to their low cost, capability of running an OS, and rich ecosystem of simple hardware devices. The setup is completed with RISC OS, which combines a simple window-based graphical interface with a low-level management of the hardware without requiring software abstraction layers. The article presents the methodology and the UCDebug tool, developed to help students debug their codes in RISC OS. After the introduction of the new setup at the University of Cantabria, academic results and student satisfaction have improved.

  abstract     = {This article illustrates that the task design and problem selection are of characteristic influence to evoke sense-reason-act programming (SRA) among primary school pupils when programming robots. Research shows that the task design influences the development of computational thinking (CT). The literature provides evidence that the context, the problem space, and the representation of the problem to apply SRA-programming require the programming task to be embedded in a dynamic context in which a programmable robot must use sensory information to anticipate changes in the environment. In order to ascertain whether the problem space and the task design influence the evocation of SRA-thinking, this article uses a research design comparing the differences between two programming conditions (static/dynamic). In these conditions, pupils use Lego EV-3 robots and Mindstorms software to solve programming problems. As a post-measurement, a Lego challenge is applied. In this article, it is shown that the integration of a dynamic task design to solve a programming problem is essential for a deeper understanding of CT skills. Furthermore, when pupils can immediately test the consequences of their program in a dynamic environment and, thus, the learning environment provides an appropriate problem, they gain a deeper understanding of the added value of sensors and will be better able to reason about complex problems. It is found that programming in a dynamic problem environment almost naturally evokes SRA-thinking, as opposed to programming in a static environment. The influence of SRA-programming as demonstrated identifies characteristics of CT.},

The tailoring process should simultaneously consider user and contextual characteristics (e.g., activity to be done and geographic location), which leads to several combinations to tailor. Consequently, tools for automating gamification personalization are needed. However, which of those characteristics are relevant and how to do such tailoring are open questions. Furthermore, the required automating tools are lacking. We tackled these problems in two steps. First, we conducted an exploratory study, collecting participants&#39; opinions on the game elements they consider the most useful for different learning activity types (LAT) via survey. Then, we modeled opinions through Conditional Decision Trees to address the aforementioned tailoring process. Second, as a product of the first step, we implemented a recommender system that suggests personalized gamification designs (which game elements to use), addressing the problem of automating gamification personalization. Our findings present empirical evidence that LAT, geographic locations, and other user characteristics affect users&#39; preferences, enable defining gamification designs tailored to user and contextual features simultaneously, and provide technological aid for those interested in designing personalized gamification. The main implications are that demographics, game-related characteristics, geographic location, and LAT to be done, as well as the interaction between different kinds of information (user and contextual characteristics), should be considered in defining gamification designs and that personalizing gamification designs can be improved with aid from our recommender system.},

  abstract     = {To provide insight into online learners’ interests in various knowledge from course discussion texts, modeling learners’ sentiments and interests at different granularities are of great importance. In this article, the proposed framework combines a deep convolutional neural network and a hierarchical topic model to discover the hidden structure of online learners’ sentiments about knowledge topics. The approach is to capture multigranularity knowledge of topics of interest to learners with the hierarchical topic model and to identify information about learners’ different sentiments with the convolutional neural network. This approach not only models knowledge of hierarchical interest from general to specific but also identifies learners and their sentiment orientations to better correspond to the different granularities of knowledge. The experimental results and analysis of real-world datasets show that the proposed approach is effective and feasible.},

  abstract     = {Self-directed learning is generally considered a key competence in higher education. To enable self-directed learning, assessment practices increasingly embrace assessment for learning rather than the assessment of learning, shifting the focus from grades and scores to provision of rich, narrative, and personalized feedback. Students are expected to collect, interpret, and give meaning to this feedback, in order to self-assess their progress and to formulate new, appropriate learning goals and strategies. However, interpretation of aggregated, longitudinal narrative feedback has been proven to be very challenging, cognitively demanding, and time consuming. In this article, we, therefore, explored the applicability of existing, proven text mining techniques to support feedback interpretation. More specifically, we investigated whether it is possible to automatically generate meaningful information about prevailing topics and the emotional load of feedback provided in medical students’ competence-based portfolios (N = 1500), taking into account the competence framework and the students’ various performance levels. Our findings indicate that the text-mining techniques topic modeling and sentiment analysis make it feasible to automatically unveil the two principal aspects of narrative feedback, namely the most relevant topics in the feedback and their sentiment. This article, therefore, takes a valuable first step toward the automatic, online support of students, who are tasked with meaningful interpretation of complex narrative data in their portfolio as they develop into self-directed life-long learners.},

Moreover, the PNs’ underlying mathematical model allows users to draw coherent and well-formed graphs representing rather complex clinical cases. Finally, HIN can be easily integrated into a simulation environment to support case-based learning activities and assessment. The examples of the exercises provided in this article show, on the one hand, the ways the introduced methodology is figured out and implemented; on the other hand, they outline the variety of learning questions that users may deal with when deploying the HIN approach.},

  abstract     = {Forums are essential components facilitating interactions in online courses. However, in large-scale courses, many posts generated, which results in learners’ difficulties. First, the posts are poorly organized and some deviate from the topic, making it difficult for learners’ knowledge acquisition. Second, learners cannot receive timely feedback and guidance, making the learning progress unclear for them. Well-designed scaffoldings should be built based on challenges of forums to improve learners’ learning outcomes, knowledge construction, and completion rate. While targeting the problems in online forums, this article proposed principles for the design of online scaffolding after analyzing the requirements of online learning scaffolding or scripts. Subsequently, in this article, we designed an automatic feedback scaffolding based on the principles and a knowledge construction model. The scaffolding provided learners with timely feedback and related learning guidance. Tags were used to assist learners in acquiring relevant information more easily. The scaffolding was then integrated into the Learning Cell Knowledge Community and used in an online course for 955 learners. The results showed that automatic feedback scaffolding positively affected learners’ learning and promoted positive knowledge transformation. Furthermore, we found that the scaffolding could help learners induce more constructive behaviors defined in the Interactive, Constructive, Active, and Passive deep learning framework that demonstrated the reason for learners’ knowledge transformation. At last, learners’ course completion rate also increased with the help of the scaffolding, which provided evidence that well-designed scaffolding can result in positive educational outcomes. In addition, the principles proposed could also contribute to further scaffolding design and practices.},

To improve the delivery and reality of 360-degree VR content, we filmed the video in the third person so that the viewers could feel like they were in the environment where the lecture was conducted. To verify the educational effects, 33 university students participated in our experiment. We conducted pretest learning, using 360-degree videos, and posttest learning via conventional 2-D videos for statistical analysis. A paired t -test was used to compare the means of the pretest and the posttest. In addition, learning via 360-degree videos was assessed for its effectiveness through questionnaires consisting of five measurement elements—engagement, immersion, motivation, cognitive benefits, and perceived learning effectiveness—and comparing them to the existing 2-D video method, based on e-learning. From the results, we confirmed that the teaching material delivered through 360-degree VR content allows students to be more focused, immersed, and interested than 2-D learning modes. Furthermore, the high scores of cognitive and perceived learning elements imply that VR-based 360-degree educational content can encourage more active participation than traditional lectures and can improve the ability to analyze and organize study lessons.},

After detecting that video games may decrease physical activity and social interactions, real world is coming back to computer entertainment, with a new gaming genre: Pervasive games. These games integrate physical and social aspects of real world, so that they overcome the limitations of traditional games in the spatial, temporal, or social dimensions. Interactive spaces are a natural place to deploy pervasive games, as they both share their ubiquitous computing nature. Thus, we have tried to explore the possibility of having pervasive games in interactive spaces playing a role as learning tools, specifically for developing attention, planning, and social skills. This way, we have designed a pervasive game to be played in an interactive space to work on those aspects. The game is made up of ten different missions. Also, in this article, we have developed an observation and analysis model that allows identifying which processes get activated during the game, and we have carried out an evaluation with the model with the intention of validating the usefulness of the activities and of the model. Lastly, we have obtained some recommendations for the design and mediation of pervasive games in interactive spaces.},

Our aim is to defeat potential student plagiarism or collusion as much as possible, while not consuming more than a tolerable amount of time and efforts on the teaching team as a whole. For the most vulnerable online, open-book, and nonproctored exams, we thus propose to limit the reading and answering of each main or section question to a strictly allocated amount of time questionwise, and we forbid returning to any previous questions that are already completed, or expired, to greatly reduce the time window for potential plagiarism and collusion. An equally important design goal here is that the relevant implementation, maintenance, deployment, exam management, answer retrieval, and marking should in principle be made sufficiently efficient to be handled completely just by the relevant subject instructor(s), at least after the initial development.},

The article investigated inquiry behaviors such as interpreting graphs, applying formulas, drawing conclusions, and peer collaboration, and how these influenced learning achievement. The app&#39;s and the learning activities’ effects on learning perceptions and motivation were also analyzed. A total of 45 first-grade vocational high school students majoring in housekeeping management were volunteered and divided into an experimental with gMap ( n = 20) and a control group without gMap ( n = 25). The results show that the inquiry behaviors of the experimental group who used U-Physics with gMap significantly outperformed the control group. Analysis of the correlations among inquiry behaviors and learning achievement revealed that the quantity of learning records on gMap had the greatest influence on learning achievement. Additionally, most students reported positive perceptions of the U-Physics app and were highly motivated to use it for future learning. These findings confirm that exploring and conducting physics phenomena outside of the classroom enhances students’ understanding of the physics phenomena being studied. It also enriches their authentic experiences because an outdoor activity can provide useful experience to connect students’ knowledge with daily life environments, enrich their scientific understanding, and stimulate their motivation to learn physics anytime at anywhere.},

Studies have shown that students often face difficulties and develop misconceptions in multiple aspects when learning OOP. This article presents a systematic way of developing a teaching tool that uses a combination of visualization and analogies to help students overcome these barriers and understand the OOP concepts better. To ensure the tool would have pedagogical value and novelty, we first reviewed the educational theories on using analogies and visualization, as well as numerous existing tools. A set of activities in the form of code snippets were then designed to target these misconceptions and difficulties, along with a set of analogies and their interaction mechanisms that mapped to the OOP concepts. A teaching tool was then developed based on those designs and evaluated with engineering students in a CS2 course ( n = 253). The results and our analysis show that a statistically significant improvement was achieved in student understanding and confidence through interaction with visualization of OOP concepts with analogies (VOOPA) exercises. Similar gains were also observed using more traditional methods. No statistically significant positive difference in understanding and confidence can be attributed to use of VOOPA through the current study.},

In the literature, there are many strategies for estimating the duration, which do not represent the actual online time of the students. In this article, we combine LMS log files of our students with parallel screen recordings and automatically analyze for how long the LMS is present in the video. We visualize the results and show that common online time estimation strategies do not represent the online time for our students accurately.

This article analyzes the effect of a gamified mathematic learning environment on the motivation and the motivated behaviors of 258 learners in secondary schools in France. Overall, results indicate that randomly assigned game elements generally demotivate learners. A more thorough analysis revealed that gamification has a positive impact on the most amotivated learners to do mathematic although different effects were observed on learners. In particular, we noticed significant influences of their initial level of motivation and their player type on the variation in motivation during the study. We show that these influences vary according to the game element they used. These findings suggest that to increase efficiency, gamification should be tailored not only to the player profile but also to their level of initial motivation for the learning task.},

  abstract     = {This article uses digital traces to help identify students’ online learning strategies by making a clear distinction between the descriptive features (the proportional distribution of students’ different online learning actions) and quantitative aspects (the total number of the online learning sessions), a distinction that has not been properly addressed in extant research. It also examines the extent to which the descriptive features and quantitative aspects of students’ observed online learning behaviors are related to students’ self-reported perceptions of the blended learning environment and the academic learning outcomes. A cohort of 317 Australian undergraduates enrolled in a compulsory engineering course participated in the study. A hierarchical cluster analysis, based on the different proportions of the types of online learning activities in which students were involved, identified two qualitatively different online learning strategies: content and practice oriented. The content-oriented learners not only had significantly more online learning sessions but also performed significantly better on both the formative and summative assessments, than their practice-oriented counterparts. Moreover, a higher proportion of students reporting more negative perceptions were observed to adopt practice-oriented strategies, whereas a higher proportion of students reporting better perceptions were observed to adopt content-oriented strategies. The study results serve as triangulated evidence for the previous self-reported research on the relations between students’ perceptions and strategies. The results of the study also offer a number of ideas for teaching and curriculum design in blended courses in order to improve the quality of students’ blended learning experiences.},

  abstract     = {During the COVID-19 pandemic, many students lost opportunities to explore science in labs due to school closures. Remote labs provide a possible solution to mitigate this loss. However, most remote labs to date are based on a somehow centralized model in which experts design and conduct certain types of experiments in well-equipped facilities, with a few options of manipulation provided to remote users. In this article, we propose a distributed framework, dubbed remote labs 2.0, that offers the flexibility needed to build an open platform to support educators to create, operate, and share their own remote labs. Similar to the transformation of the Web from 1.0 to 2.0, remote labs 2.0 can greatly enrich experimental science on the Internet by allowing users to choose and contribute their subjects and topics. As a reference implementation, we developed a platform branded as Telelab. In collaboration with a high school chemistry teacher, we conducted remote chemical reaction experiments on the Telelab platform with two online classes. Pre/posttest results showed that these high school students attained significant gains ( t (26) = 8.76, p &lt; 0.00001) in evidence-based reasoning abilities. Student surveys revealed the following three key affordances of Telelab: 1) live experiments; 2) scientific instruments; and 3) social interactions. All 31 respondents were engaged by one or more of these affordances. Students’ behaviors were characterized by analyzing their interaction data logged by the platform. These findings suggest that appropriate applications of remote labs 2.0 in distance education can, to some extent, reproduce critical effects of their local counterparts on promoting science learning.},

  abstract     = {Making students become intrinsically motivated to participate in daily class activities is an open challenge that has been addressed in different ways. In this article, we evaluate the impact of an educational innovation project, named TrivialCV, in terms of student motivation, engagement, and learning outcomes. We analyze the impact of two types of activities: multiplayer team-based competitions created for delivery during a live class session and single-player competitions created to be played asynchronously from home. We deployed these activities in two different computer engineering courses (programming fundamentals and operating systems) and used questionnaires, grades, and activity tracking in the virtual campus to evaluate their impact. After the analysis, we can assert that the use of TrivialCV activities was useful for providing additional motivation to the students and improving their engagement with the courses in which they were deployed. TrivialCV activities were very well received by the students, who considered them fun, engaging, and useful.},
