  abstract     = {In order to support reliability and safety in autonomous driving services, vehicular networks should be able to efficiently and fairly allocate the time-varying and limited resources to multiple vehicles as quickly as possible. In this paper, we adopt the Nash bargaining solution (NBS) as the resource management strategy. However, the resource allocation based on the NBS requires exponentially increasing computational complexity for dynamically changing resources over time. We propose an analytic solution, referred to as the exact computation of the sequential NBS (ECS-NBS), to perfectly compute the NBS sequentially without any iterations. The key idea is to use the axiom of independence of linear transformations in NBS for the design of a transformation matrix that captures the changes in the adjacent feasible utility sets. This enables the NBS to be invariant to the change of utility sets over time, yielding the perfectly accurate NBS with the lowest complexity, as confirmed through simulations.},

Subsequently, a time-domain pilot based model is developed for estimating the DDA-domain channel state information (CSI) of our MIMO OTFS system. The key differentiating feature of the CSI estimation model derived is its ability to exploit the 4-dimensional (4D)-sparsity arising in the DDA-domain, given the limited number of dominant scatterers. Furthermore, the training overhead of the proposed framework is low, and the pilot placement is quite flexible, necessitating no guard-interval. Finally, an orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) framework is employed for 4D-sparse CSI acquisition, followed by deriving the Oracle minimum mean squared error (Oracle-MMSE) and its Bayesian Cramer-Rao lower bound (BCRLB). Our simulation results confirm the improved CSI estimation performance attained over the benchmarks.},

The low complexity detections, such as minimum mean square error (MMSE) Viterbi-like and MMSE subcarrier-wise log-likelihood ratio (MMSE-LLR), are proposed to largely reduce the receiver detection complexity.

By jointly considering the physical models of ORIS, RF channel, atmospheric turbulence, and pointing error, the closed-form solutions of the system&#39;s exact outage probability, asymptotic outage probability and BER have been derived. It is shown through numerical results that the derivation results are accurate and the RF-FSO links with ORISs show a slightly worse performance than the traditional RF-FSO links. However, the performance degradation introduced by ORIS is relatively small, and at the cost of this, the FSO link obtains a higher degree of beam adjustment freedom. We can also observe that both the increase of Rice factor in RF link and the decrease of pointing error in FSO link can effectively improve the system performance.

This strategy explores the benefits of (i) allowing users to occupy sub-bands with unequal bandwidths and (ii) optimally avoiding using some spectra that exist at the edges of TWs where molecular absorption loss is high. To maximize the aggregated multiuser data rate, we formulate an optimization problem, with the primary focus on spectrum allocation. We then apply transformations and modifications to make the problem computationally tractable, and develop an iterative algorithm based on successive convex approximation to determine the optimal sub-band bandwidth and the unused spectra at the edges of TWs. Using numerical results, we show that a significantly higher data rate can be achieved by changing the sub-band bandwidth, as compared to equal sub-band bandwidth. We also show that a further data rate gain can be obtained by optimally determining the unused spectra at the edges of TWs, as compared to avoiding using pre-defined spectra at the edges of TWs.},

The near user acts as a relay, which operates in full-duplex (FD) mode and employs decode-and-forward protocol, to forward the information to the far user. Two kinds of residual self-interference (RSI) models, which are modeled as being free of fading and following Rayleigh fading, are considered. We first derive the approximate closed-form expressions of average block error rate (BLER) at both users under these two RSI models. Then, simulations are provided to verify the validity of our theoretical analysis. Finally, we evaluate the BLER performance difference between long-packet and short-packet transmissions for FD C-NOMA and that between FD relaying and half-duplex (HD) relaying. The analysis and simulation results show that, for ultra-reliable and low-latency communication, we can use RSI link modeled as being free of fading to simplify the system analysis. Furthermore, compared to long-packet communication, for FD C-NOMA SPC have a narrow range of power allocation to achieve high-reliable transmission, and because BLER outperformance of FD relaying over HD relaying degrades when the RSI signal becomes strong, the optimal duplex mode for FD C-NOMA SPC is determined by the RSI signal and the target BLERs at both users.},

Motivated by the success of deep learning in various informatics domains, many AMC methods based on deep learning have been proposed. However, they usually require a large amount of labeled training samples for each category of modulation, which is hardly applicable in real-world AMC tasks. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes a novel few-shot learning framework, namely the spatial-temporal hybrid feature extraction network (STHFEN). In STHFEN, two feature extraction networks are designed to map the wireless communication signals into the spatial feature space and the temporal feature space, respectively. Then, a hybrid inference classifier is designed to combine the classification results in the two feature spaces. To train STHFEN more effectively, a hybrid loss function which promotes better inter-class separability of signals in the two feature spaces is proposed. Experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness and robustness of STHFEN in few-shot AMC tasks.},

  abstract     = {Cell-free networks are regarded as a promising technology to meet higher rate requirements for beyond fifth-generation (5G) communications. Most works on cell-free networks focus on either fully centralized beamforming to maximally enhance system performance, or fully distributed beamforming to avoid extensive channel state information (CSI) exchange among access points (APs). In order to achieve both network capacity improvement and CSI exchange reduction, we propose a partially distributed beamforming design algorithm for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided cell-free networks. We aim at maximizing the weighted sum-rate of all users by designing active and passive beamforming subject to transmit power constraints of APs and unit-modulus constraints of RIS elements. The weighted sum-rate maximization problem is first transformed into an equivalent weighted sum-mean-square-error (sum-MSE) minimization problem, and then alternating optimization (AO) approach is adopted to iteratively design active and passive beamformer. Specifically, active beamforming vectors are obtained by local APs and passive beamforming vector is optimized by central processing unit (CPU). Numerical results not only illustrate the proposed partially distributed algorithm achieves the remarkable performance improvement compared with conventional local beamforming methods, but also further show the considerable potential of deploying RIS in cell-free networks.},

Motivated by active learning, a communication-efficient way is to select most informative data samples for model training. In this article, we develop a new data scheduling scheme based on data representation.

In this context, this paper proposes a practical channel model for RIS-aided MIMO communications which considers the effects of RIS configurations, operating environments, path loss, scattering, etc. With this comprehensive channel model, the probability density function and the cumulative distribution function of the received signal-to-noise power ratio are derived by utilizing a double generalized K distribution, and closed-form expressions for the system’s error rate, outage probability, and channel capacity, are obtained.

  abstract     = {Multi-source localization based on received signal strength has drawn great interest in wireless sensor networks. However, the shadow fading term caused by obstacles cannot be separated from the received signal, which leads to severe error in location estimate. In this paper, we approximate the log-normal sum distribution through Fenton-Wilkinson method to formulate a non-convex maximum likelihood (ML) estimator with unknown shadow fading factor and transmitted power. In order to overcome the difficulty in solving the non-convex problem, we propose a novel algorithm to estimate the locations of sources. Specifically, the region is divided into &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$N$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; grids firstly, and the multi-source localization is converted into a sparse recovery problem so that we can obtain the sparse solution. Then we utilize the k-means clustering method to obtain the rough locations of the off-grid sources as the initial feasible point of the ML estimator. Finally, an iterative refinement of the estimated locations is proposed by dynamic updating of the localization dictionary. The proposed algorithm can efficiently approach a superior local optimal solution of the ML estimator. It is shown from the simulation results that the proposed method has a promising localization performance and improves the robustness for co-channel multi-source localization in shadow fading environments. Moreover, the proposed method provides a better computational complexity from &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$O(K^{3}\,N^{3})$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; to &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$O(N^{3})$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; .},

This article proposes a two-level deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework to solve this challenge. The first-level deep neural network (DNN) is applied to model the dynamic changing environment. In the second level, we employ a deep Q-learning network to plan a trajectory online according to the environment features from the first level DNN. Besides, online trajectory planning is performed by a low-power UAV edge computing platform. To enable online planning on the power-constraint UAV edge-computing platform, all networks adopt a lightweight low-complexity optimization design. According to simulation results, the proposed system achieves higher data acquisition success rates when compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. We also perform field tests on the proposed UAV edge computing platform, which also demonstrates high data acquisition performance.},

Due to different roles of drones in a network, some drones can be recognized as more important than others. For example, in UAV-assisted wireless sensor networks, drones can be used as store-carry and forward nodes to collect data from sensors and aid communications among them. If UAVs that act as the bridge of a large number of sensors are attacked, the production efficiency will be seriously affected. However, existing work concerning about UAV network security seldom noticed the differences among drones, let alone implementing special measures for protecting key drones. Motivated by this, we focus on the security issue of UAV networks from the perspective of key drones&#39; protection. We first analyze the distinctions of attack impacts when adopting different target selection strategies, revealing that key drones exist and it is significantly important to protect them. Then, a topology deception scheme based on software-defined networking is proposed, which can mitigate the attack impact by tempting attackers through our well-designed virtual topologies, leading to their misjudgments on the key drones. Extensive experimental results illustrate that our scheme can effectively deceive attackers and significantly mitigate the impact of targeted attacks.},

To better capture the regional-different popularity distribution, we adopt a hierarchical architecture to deploy edge caching nodes in IoT networks.

In this paper, we focus on the meta distribution of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) in the mmWave heterogeneous networks where the base stations (BS) in each tier are modeled as a Poisson point process (PPP). By utilizing stochastic geometry and queueing theory, we characterize the spatial and temporal randomness while the special characteristics of mmWave communications, including different path loss laws for line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight links and directional beamforming, are incorporated into the analysis. We derive the moments of the conditional successful transmission probability (STP). By taking the temporal random arrival of traffic into consideration, an equation on the meta distribution is formulated and its solution is obtained in a recursive manner. The critical arrival rate for a fraction of the queues at the BSs to be stable is provided. In addition, the mean delay is obtained. The numerical results reveal the impact of the key network parameters, such as the blockage parameter, the bias factor, the number of antenna elements and the BS density, on the network performance. Specifically, offloading the users from the macro BS tier to the small BS tier by biasing can reduce the performance fluctuation while only causing a slight degradation of the overall network performance.},

In deriving the theoretical models, the road distribution of an urban area is modeled as a Poisson line process (PLP), the spatial distribution of vehicle nodes on each street are modeled as an independent one-dimensional homogeneous Poisson point process (PPP), and edge nodes are deployed along each street with a certain probability. Moreover, a carrier sense multiple access (CSMA) mechanism is considered for channel access, and independent Nakagami-m fading is considered over all wireless links.

  abstract     = {Data plane programmability enables the embedding of a network intrusion detection system (NIDS) on programmable switches to dynamically control the efficiency of attack type detection and the overhead in the computation and network side. However, it is a challenging task to implement a feasible embedded detection model with advanced machine learning techniques such as deep learning. It is due to the limited support provided by programming languages on the data plane and the computing resource constraints at the edge. We propose a joint traffic classification architecture called JointNIDS that splits a classification model into two sequential sub-models. In this model, the primary switch is dedicated to major attack classification. The secondary switch is used mainly for a further in-depth inspection of the rest of the minor traffic types. The presence of some partially overlapping hidden units in the two sequential switches can help to reduce the computational overhead at the edge, while increasing the packet inspection throughput. Experimental results on the P4 framework demonstrate that JointNIDS has reduced attack detection time, while achieving a similar accuracy performance, as other counterpart algorithms. To further develop the proposed architecture, JointNIDS implements an optimization step. It maximizes the amount of data to be inspected by a system, taking into account the constraints of computing resources and network bandwidth for a given performance requirement. We validate the effectiveness of collaborative joint optimization in various scenarios.},

  abstract     = {In the context of the social Internet of vehicles (SIoV), constructing reliable social relationships between dynamic and distributed entities is a challenging research problem. Rating-based reputation systems have been widely applied to assist human users in evaluating the honesty of target entities. However, the ratings in SIoV expose user privacy, including behavior, location, etc., which are required to be protected properly. Meanwhile, the blockchain technology with its distributed paradigm is potentially employed to protect information privacy. In this study, we propose the design of a blockchain-enabled reputation system named “VRepChain” for SIoV by especially considering the rating privacy issue. In our design, the ratings&#39; privacy is strongly preserved in the processes of transmission and storage. The reputation of a vehicle is constructed based on the ratings with the agreement of the rating providers, ensuring the ratings are never abused by any other unauthorized entities during the usage process. Through experiments, the proposed system is demonstrated to improve the effectiveness of vehicles in terms of arriving at their destinations in a faster speed. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the constructed reputation model with untruthful ratings is extensively examined, showing its robustness and practicality in realistic applications.},

  abstract     = {Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC) systems exploit resources on both vehicles and Roadside Units (RSUs) to provide services for real-time vehicular applications that cannot be completed in the vehicles alone. Two types of decisions are critical for VEC: one is for task offloading to migrate vehicular tasks to suitable RSUs, and the other is for resource allocation at the RSUs to provide the optimal amount of computational resource to the migrated tasks under constraints on response time and energy consumption. Most of the published optimization-based methods determine the optimal solutions of the two types of decisions jointly within one optimization problem at RSUs, but the complexity of solving the optimization problem is extraordinary, because the problem is not convex and has discrete variables. Meanwhile, the nature of centralized solutions requires extra information exchange between vehicles and RSUs, which is challenged by the additional communication delay and security issues. The contribution of this paper is to decompose the joint optimization problem into two decoupled subproblems: task offloading and resource allocation. Both subproblems are reformulated for efficient solutions. The resource allocation problem is simplified by dual decomposition and can be solved at vehicles in a decentralized way. The task offloading problem is transformed from a discrete problem to a continuous convex one by a probability-based solution. Our new method efficiently achieves a near-optimal solution through decentralized optimizations, and the error bound between the solution and the true optimum is analyzed. Simulation results demonstrate the advantage of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {Mega-constellation Low Earth Orbit (LEO) Satellite Networks (LSNs) have become an ongoing projection to realize the ubiquitous large-capacity wireless communication. With the rapid growth of satellite scale, the transmission efficiency of Mega-constellation LSNs is substantially decreased as the Average Shortest Path Length (ASPL) is dramatically increased, which not only encumbers the high-speed data transmission, but results in more processing delay, cost of satellite energy, rerouting probability and loss rate of packets. To this end, this paper proposes the structural optimization methods of Two-Layered Satellite Networks (TLSNs) to enhance the transmission efficiency of Mega-constellation LSNs. Differing from the traditional TLSNs, the proposed TLSNs emphasize on the highly integration between the different layers. The evaluated results confirm that the proposed methods not only effectively enhance the transmission efficiency of mega-constellation LSNs, but significantly increase the duration time of Inter-Layer Links (ILLs) and reduce the topological dynamics of TLSNs deriving from the switching of ILLs.},

  abstract     = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are expected to become one of the key enablers of the promising 5G and beyond 5G (B5G) communications. However, the deployment of the UAVs is fundamentally constrained by low energy storage capacity and limited flying time capability. These limitations are further aggravated in static UAVs (SUAVs), used as aerial nodes in cellular-connected applications such as surveillance, natural disaster, and heterogeneous cellular systems, among other high-speed wireless communications. In this paper, the idea of UAV to UAV wireless charging is envisaged. A scenario of wireless charging of an SUAV by the most cost-effective master UAV (MUAV), capable of wireless energy transfer (ET) is considered, wherein MUAVs are associated with their fixed grounded platforms. A UAV network is considered in which the most economical MUAV is dispatched to the known location of the SUAV and charge without discontinuing the mission of SUAV. Motivated by the fact that an optimized and relevant pricing scheme for futuristic charging service providers will be the critical aspect in the promising competitive market scenarios, a suitable pricing scheme is proposed; and the equilibrium in the market sharing condition using a game-theoretic approach is investigated. The Nash equilibrium (NE) for the total profit for each platform in a non-cooperative competitive environment is derived by analyzing their corresponding best prices. In this regard, a closed-form expression of the decision boundary for the SUAVs, based on area division, is identified.},

Edge servers can selectively cache executed services for reuse by subsequent tasks to improve the offloading efficiency of the system. The offloading efficiency is defined as a weighted sum of the computation time of the task and the energy drained from the respective vehicle. To maximize the offloading efficiency, we formulate the tasks offloading and service caching problem as a mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem and develop a semi-distributed algorithm based on dynamic programming to solve the optimization problem. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has higher offloading efficiency and a higher completion rate under application deadlines compared with similar offloading algorithms.},

An EQS route is a route with minimum end-to-end (E2E) queuing delay subject to QoS constraints such as link stability, residual energy, number of hops and avoiding licensed channels of primary users. Particularly, we propose an NP-complete optimization problem which has a feasible solution as an EQS route. To tackle this problem, we design a new deep reinforcement learning model which supports the DRQR protocol to establish EQS routes in real time by offline training instead of online training like most of literature studies. Moreover, the DRQR protocol guarantees to have high system performance. A mathematical analysis of the E2E queuing delay with random waypoint mobility model also provides to verify simulation results. Numerical results show that the DRQR protocol outperforms state-of-the-art routing protocols in terms of routing delay, queuing delay, control overhead, PDR and energy consumption.},

However, counterfeits, also known as fake products, present a non-negligible effect on vehicle supply chains. Counterfeit vehicular parts have created significant losses in both monetary value and social terms. For example, tainted and sub-standard tires or batteries used in vehicles even have caused traffic accidents or loss of human life. Due to these dominant reasons, many researchers have focused on building anti-counterfeiting supply chain systems. More recently, several blockchain-based solutions have been presented, whereas most of them lack privacy protection. In this paper, aiming at the issue, we propose a reliable and A nti-counterfeiting and P rivacy- P reserving B lockchain-based vehicle supply chains, called APPB. APPB is characterized by offering dual advantages, by utilizing the immutability of blockchain and keeping the privacy of product selling information and business relationship.

  abstract     = {UAV-assisted communication is a promising paradigm to enhance the performance of wireless networks. In this paper, we consider the network randomness in the delay-tolerant UAV-assisted communication systems. We aim to optimize both the UAV trajectory and user association in an online manner to achieve a finite queueing delay at the users&#39; buffers with the minimum energy consumption of the UAVs. We first formulate our problem as a stochastic dynamic programming problem that integrates the future expected energy consumption and delay into its objective function and constraints, respectively. To deal with the inaccurate knowledge of future user demand and mobility, we apply the Lyapunov optimization technique and convert it into a series of online joint UAV trajectory and user association optimization problems. However, each online problem is a non-convex non-linear integer programming problem, which is very challenging to solve in general. As such, we first eliminate the coupling relationship of user association variables in each online problem. By exploiting the special graph structure of the problem, we can decompose the joint problem into inner optimization and outer optimization problems. Then, we propose the online UAV mobility and user association selection (UMUAS) scheme, which includes two steps to solve the inner and outer problems. Simulation results show that our online UMUAS scheme achieves the near-optimal performance of the energy-delay tradeoff, which also has a 44.2% improvement over the greedy scheme and a 51.3% improvement over the interference-free scheme. Moreover, it achieves the highest energy efficiency among the three benchmark schemes.},

This paper considers a multi-cloud radio access network (MC-RAN), where each cloud is connected to a distinct set of cache-enabled base stations (BSs) via limited capacity fronthaul links. The BSs are equipped with local cache storage and baseband processing capabilities, as a means to alleviate the fronthaul congestion problem. The paper then investigates the problem of jointly assigning users to clouds and determining their beamforming vectors so as to maximize the network-wide energy efficiency subject to fronthaul capacity and transmit power constraints.

In this paper, we aim to explore a communication environment where a multi-antenna transmitter facilitates communication between two users equipped with two different technologies — backscattering and radio frequency based energy harvesting. Under such a setting, we aim to minimize the transmit power over a set of constraints by considering the traditional linear and the more practical nonlinear (sigmoid) energy harvesting model. Henceforth, we propose a novel optimal solution approach, exploiting the geometric interpretation of constraints and interdependency of optimization variables and the performance metric, to solve the formulated non-convex problem for the multi-antenna transmitter case for both the energy harvesting models considered. In addition, we revisit the power minimization problem for the single-antenna transmitter case, solved in our previous work, to demonstrate the applicability of the current solution approach. Furthermore, to establish a fair balance between the performance and the computation-intensive nature of the proposed optimal solution, we present two low complexity sub-optimal solution approaches leveraging the analysis carried out for the single antenna transmitter case. Finally, using the numerical simulations, we assess the performance of our system and present a comparison between the proposed solution approaches by varying some key parameters of our simulation setting.},

The influence of imperfect successive interference cancellation on RIS-TW-NOMA is taken into account. To evaluate the potential performance of RIS-TW-NOMA, we derive the exact and asymptotic expressions of outage probability and ergodic rate for a pair of users. Based on the analytical results, the diversity orders and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) slopes are obtained in the high SNR regime, which are closely related to the number of RIS elements. Additionally, we analyze the system throughput and energy efficiency of RIS-TW-NOMA networks in both delay-limited and delay-tolerant transmission modes. Numerical results indicate that: 1) The outage behaviors and ergodic rate of RIS-TW-NOMA are superior to that of RIS-TW-OMA and two-way relay OMA (TWR-OMA); 2) As the number of RIS elements increases, the RIS-TW-NOMA networks are capable of achieving the enhanced outage performance; and 3) By comparing with RIS-TW-OMA and TWR-OMA networks, the energy efficiency and system throughput of RIS-TW-NOMA has obvious advantages.},

  abstract     = {The emerging technology of dynamic metasurface antennas (DMAs) offers a promising solution to revolutionize future wireless communications by reducing hardware costs, physical size and power consumption. Especially in the field of radar imaging, DMAs can be used as an effective alternative platform for modern computational imaging; because they can simplify the physical hardware architecture and increase the data acquisition rate. Fourier transform (FT)-based scene image reconstruction techniques are known as cost-effective computing solutions for the imaging system processing unit. However, due to the physical layer compression in DMAs and the fact that they do not produce uniform radiation patterns, the information provided by them is not compatible with Fourier-based techniques and cannot be applied directly. In this article, we first introduce a 3D near-field bistatic imaging approach using two one-dimensional (1D) DMAs as a panel-to-panel model in a Mills Cross structure. Then, based on the introduced mathematical model, we derive a Fourier-based algorithm for the image reconstruction problem. The proposed algorithm consists of five main steps: (i) pre-processing (to transfer the data provided by the transmitter and receiver DMAs to a set of equivalent spatial measurements), (ii) applying FTs to the transferred signal, (iii) filtering in the Fourier domain, (iv) a simplified interpolation, and (v) applying a 3D inverse FT to retrieve scene information. The results of numerical simulations confirm the satisfactory performance of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {Theoretical analysis of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems, equipped at the receiver by a non-linear impulsive noise suppressor, is very challenging. Indeed, although an exact closed-form expression for the output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of such OFDM systems is available for widely used impulsive noise models, theoretical analysis of the associated symbol error rate (SER) is still open. The analytical SER available in the literature, exploit a Gaussian approximation of the non-linear distortion noise, which however holds true only under specific conditions. Conversely, this work develops an accurate analytical closed-form expression of the distortion noise distribution at the nonlinearity output, as well as its approximation by a Gaussian mixture model (GMM). By using GMMs we unify the SER analysis for communication systems equipped by non-linear impulsive noise suppressors, typically also used in vehicular communications. Closed form expressions for the SER are derived both for non-fading and frequency-selective Rayleigh/Rician fading channels affected by impulsive noise, which is also modeled by a GMM, including Bernoulli-Gaussian (BG), Middleton Class-A, and alpha-stable noises. Theoretical SER performance are compared with simulations, showing very good agreement for all the impulsive noise scenarios and the non-linear suppressors.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we propose a low-complexity quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) filter-bank multicarrier (FBMC) system with high spectral efficiency and low self-interference. To circumvent the limitations imposed by the Balian-Low theorem on the interference suppression capability of QAM-FBMC systems, the proposed system relaxes time-frequency (TF) product at the transmitter (TX) and time-domain localization at the receiver (RX). The PHYDYAS filter is employed as a TX prototype filter, and a filter mismatched to the TX filter is employed as an RX prototype filter. Since the PHYDYAS filter has excellent spectral confinement, its use well compensates for the loss in TF-product and leads to higher spectral efficiency than the conventional systems in multi-user uplink. The RX has an extended observation window and a separate equalizer followed by a fixed pre-computed filter. To find the RX prototype filter that minimizes the self-interference, an optimization problem is formulated based on a bi-orthogonality condition, subject to the frequency-domain sparsity constraint in terms of the &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\ell _{0}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -norm. To efficiently search for the solution, a modified relaxed LASSO procedure is proposed, where the size of the problem is reduced to make the problem numerically tractable. Numerical results and discussions show that the proposed QAM-FBMC system strikes an excellent balance between performance and complexity.},

  abstract     = {Decentralized baseband processing (DBP) architectures can alleviate the extremely high interconnect data rates and chip input/output (I/O) bandwidth bottlenecks of the conventional centralized massive multiple-input multiple-output (M-MIMO) system. Nonetheless, fully decentralized (FD) detectors suffer significant performance loss compared with the centralized counterparts due to the constrained information-sharing between antenna clusters, especially for systems with a large number of antenna clusters and/or high-order modulation. In this article, we propose an enhanced message-passing-based FD detection method by utilizing an information-lossless factor graph (FG) transformation scheme. As an illustrative example, the expectation propagation (EP) algorithm is considered in this work. In each antenna cluster, the FG is transformed to a less-loopy one and the effective interference of users is suppressed. Based on the message-passing principle of the EP algorithm, we devise an efficient non-linear fusion scheme in the central processing unit (CPU). In addition, a compensation factor accounting for the cluster profile is introduced to mitigate the inaccuracy of message-passing caused by DBP, thus further enhancing the detection performance. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed enhanced FD detector obtains significantly better performance than the counterpart with even lower computational complexity, especially in a large number of antenna clusters and/or high-order modulation scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Stochastic geometry has emerged as a well-established analysis tool for dense wireless networks. However, the commonly assumed homogeneous Poisson point process (PPP) model, where users are distributed in the space uniformly, may not be accurate enough, since the users are more likely to be clustered at densely populated sites. Driven by capacity needs, small base stations (SBSs) are deployed at the user hotspots, which results in a user-SBS correlated deployment. In order to capture this correlation, user locations are modeled as Poisson cluster process (PCP) with SBSs serving as the cluster centers. In this paper, by using the discontinuous transmission (DTX) mode, the local delay has been analyzed. We carried out the analysis under two classic PCP models—Thomas cluster process and Matérn cluster process. Moreover, it is found that under PCP the local delay is more dependent on base station (BS) density and transmit power than under the conventional PPP model. Finally, we found that the local delay increases as the cluster size increases, and it converges to the PPP result when the cluster size approaches the infinity.},

We specifically consider Orthogonal MA methods (OMA) where the user terminals (UTs) are allocated non-overlapping physical resource in the delay-Doppler (DD) and/or time-frequency (TF) domain. Well known OMA methods include, i) Guard Band (GB) based MA (GBMA), ii) Interleaved Delay Doppler MA (IDDMA), iii) Interleaved Time Frequency MA (ITFMA). The spectral efficiency (SE) performance of these OMA methods has only been studied for ideal transmit and receive pulses. With ideal pulses , IDDMA and ITFMA are free from multi-user interference (MUI) and unlike GBMA they do not use guard bands in the DD/TF domain. Since ideal pulses are not realizable, in this paper we study the SE performance of these OMA methods with practical rectangular pulses . For these OMA methods, we derive the expression for the received DD/TF domain symbols at the base station (BS) receiver and the effective DD domain channel matrix when rectangular pulses are used. Study of these expressions reveals the presence of MUI when rectangular pulses are used, although the amount of MUI in IDDMA is observed to be significantly smaller than that in ITFMA. We also derive the expression for the achievable sum SE. Through simulations, for practical values of the received signal-to-noise ratio, we observe that with rectangular pulses the sum SE achieved by the IDDMA method is significantly higher than that achieved by the ITFMA and GBMA methods.},

  abstract     = {The integration of Cognitive Radio (CR) with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is an effective step towards relieving the spectrum scarcity and empowering the UAV with a high degree of intelligence. The dynamic nature of CR and the dominant line-of-sight links of UAVs poses serious security challenges and make the CR-UAV prone to a variety of attacks as malicious jamming. Joint jammer detection and automatic jammer classification is a powerful approach against the physical layer threats by identifying multiple jammers attacking the network that realize a crucial stage towards efficient interference management. This paper proposes a novel method for joint detection and automatic classification of multiple jammers attacking with different modulation schemes. The method is based on learning a representation of the radio environment encoded in a Generalized Dynamic Bayesian Network (GDBN) whilst multiple GDBN models represent various jamming signals under different modulation schemes. The CR-UAV performs multiple predictions online in parallel and evaluates multiple abnormality measurements based on a Modified Markov Jump Particle Filter (M-MJPF) to select the best-fit model that explains the detected jammer and recognize the modulation scheme accordingly. The simulated results demonstrate that the proposed GDBN-based method outperforms Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Stacked Autoencoder (SAE) in terms of classification accuracy and achieves a higher degree of explainability of its own decisions by interpreting causes and effects at hierarchical levels under the Bayesian learning and reasoning processes.},

  abstract     = {The ever-increasing number of wireless users (or devices) and their varied demand require the need for an advanced architecture for the future wireless network. To support massive connectivity, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has been recognized as a promising solution. NOMA increases the number of simultaneous connections using available resources for users with varying demands. Furthermore, recent measurements and experiments suggest that wide underutilized bandwidth available at millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequencies provide high data rate and therefore are capable of addressing the issue of spectrum scarcity at sub-6 GHz bands utilized by the 4 G network. Consequently, co-existence of multi-radio access technologies (RATs) for 5 G and beyond networks has been of interest to both industries and academia. In this context, this work studies the co-existence of the two RATs, namely, sub-6 GHz and mmWave communication using NOMA-enabled hybrid heterogeneous network (NOMA-HHN) for massive connectivity. The application of NOMA requires ordering users, which in turn requires the knowledge of users&#39; channel state information (CSI). However, gathering and processing CSI of such a large number of users is difficult to implement in practice. Thus, a solution based on partial CSI is proposed. Additionally, a feedback scheme for user scheduling and RAT selection using dual association is proposed to reduce the initial access delay in beam-training at the mmWave network. Moreover, utilizing directional nature of the mmWave communication, random beamforming is used to reduce system overhead in a network with massive users. The analytical results are confirmed using Monte-Carlo simulation, and various significant advantages are noted for the proposed NOMA-HHN over existing architectures.},

  abstract     = {Grant-free (GF) access is one key technology for massive machine-type communication (mMTC) in Internet-of-things. Single-carrier (SC) modulation has higher power-efficiency than multicarrier modulation such as orthogonal frequency division multiplexing, due to lower peak-to-average power ratio, and thus is specifically suitable for low-power-supply machine-type devices. In this paper, we study both the coherent and non-coherent grant-free non-orthogonal multiple access (GF-NOMA) schemes where SC modulation is employed in frequency selective fading channels. For coherent SC-GF-NOMA, the linear input-output relation is first presented, and two user-activity detection (UAD) algorithms, block covariance-based maximum-likelihood detection (CB-MLD) and turbo approximated message passing (Turbo AMP), are proposed. In block CB-MLD, a block update strategy is introduced in the coordinate descent iteration to utilize the special block-sparsity signal property inherent in coherent SC-GF-NOMA. Moreover, Turbo AMP consists of two components, AMP and message passing (MP), and turbo iteration between them. Concretely, AMP is designed for UAD-CE with fixed active user probability, and MP is designed to update the active user probability by utilizing the block sparsity. Moreover, the performance of Turbo AMP is analyzed by state-evolution (SE) formalism. For non-coherent SC-GF-NOMA, the linear input-output relation is first derived from which the hierarchical block-sparsity signal property is observed, and then block CB-MLD-based UAD algorithm is presented to utilize this signal property. Finally, computer simulation results are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in both coherent and non-coherent SC-GF-NOMA.},

To obtain further insights, an asymptotic BLER analysis is carried out at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, based on which the diversity orders are deduced. Numerical results are presented to corroborate the analytical results, and they show that: (i) the performance of the NOMA system outperforms its orthogonal multiple access (OMA) counterpart in terms of BLER and throughput; (ii) the BLERs of the users are improved significantly by employing the proposed RS strategy compared with benchmark schemes; (iii) CU&#39;s diversity order is primarily determined by the fading parameters, whereas the diversity order of CE relies on both fading parameters and number of relays; and (iv) the proposed system can achieve maximum throughput performance by handling a reasonable channel coding ratio.},

  abstract     = {It has been recognized that the performance of the traditional direction of arrival (DOA) estimation algorithms is highly dependent on array geometry parameters, especially the array size and element number. Unfortunately, significant performance degradation may be caused under unideal array geometry such as small size array onboard small underwater vehicle. Among all the possible directions, the presence of underwater target at a certain direction constitutes a type of spatial sparsity. Thus, spatial sparse recovery provides a potential way to address this challenging problem. As each DOA will correspond to a different transmission response pattern with respect to each array element, thus constitutes a direction-dependent transmission response (DDTR) that can be explored. However, random contribution of underwater acoustic (UWA) channel contained in DDTR makes it extremely difficult to directly construct dictionary matrix with DDTR. In this paper, a novel DDTR based small size array DOA estimation method is proposed. First, DDTRs are decomposed into time delay (TD) term and random channel response (RCR) term to decouple the adverse impact of UWA channel. Second, TD is conveniently constructed as dictionary matrix in terms of geometry relationship. Then, by accumulating the constructed DOA at frequency bins selected with energy or correlation coefficient, a selective frequency accumulation compressed sensing reconstruction (SFA-CS) algorithm is designed to mitigate the negative effect of UWA channel. Compared with the conventional DOA estimation algorithms, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve small array DOA estimation with a lower root mean squared error (RMSE) and higher success rate (SR).},

To be practical, both small scale fading and large scale path loss, and shadowing effects are considered in the analysis. A 3D channel model taking both the azimuth and elevation domains into account is adopted for the analysis of the URA and UCA topologies. Considering randomly distributed users in the cell, we firstly deduce the distribution functions of the distances between the users and the BS, and the azimuth and elevation angles of departure, respectively. Based on the derived probability distribution, tight approximations on the achievable SE with maximum ration transmission under the three antenna array topologies are derived. Analytical results show that under all the three topologies, the total achievable SE increases with the number of BS antennas, but decreases with the radius of cell and decay exponent. Moreover, it converges to a saturated value in the high SNR regime and a large inter-element spacing. It is also found that the UCA configuration has a superior achievable SE than the URA and ULA cases, and thus is the best choice for mmWave massive MIMO systems in terms of the achievable SE.},

  abstract     = {The increased power consumption of high-resolution data converters at higher carrier frequencies and larger bandwidths is becoming a bottleneck for communication systems. In this paper, we consider a fully digital base station equipped with 1-bit analog-to-digital (in uplink) and digital-to-analog (in downlink) converters on each radio frequency chain. The base station communicates with multiple single antenna users with individual SINR constraints. We first establish the uplink downlink duality principle under 1-bit hardware constraints under an uncorrelated quantization noise assumption. We then present a linear solution to the multi-user downlink beamforming problem based on the uplink downlink duality principle. The proposed solution takes into account the hardware constraints and jointly optimizes the downlink beamformers and the power allocated to each user. Optimized dithering obtained by adding dummy users to the true system users ensures that the uncorrelated quantization noise assumption is true under realistic settings. Detailed simulations carried out using 3GPP channel models generated from Quadriga show that our proposed solution outperforms state of the art solutions in terms of the ergodic sum and minimum rate especially when the number of users is large. We also demonstrate that the proposed solution significantly reduces the performance gap from non-linear solutions in terms of the uncoded bit error rate at a fraction of the computational complexity.},

  abstract     = {Internet-of-drones (IoD) systems require enhanced data transmission security and efficient interference management to accommodate the rapidly growing drone-based and rate-intensive applications. This paper develops a novel resource allocation scheme to jointly manage interference and enhance the physical layer security of cellular-connected IoD networks in the presence of a multi-band eavesdropping drone. Our envisioned cellular-connected IoD network has multiple full-duplex cellular base stations (CBSs), where each CBS reserves an orthogonal cellular radio resource block (RRB) for the aerial communication links. To efficiently utilize the cellular RRBs, each CBS is connected to a cluster of data transmitting drones using uplink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scheme. In addition, all the CBSs simultaneously transmit artificial noise signals to weaken the eavesdropper links. A joint optimization problem, considering the transmit power allocation and clustering of the legitimate drones, and the jamming power allocation of the CBSs, is formulated to maximize the worst-case average sum-secrecy-rate of the network. The joint optimization problem is decomposed into drone-clustering and power allocation sub-problems to obtain an efficient solution. A multi-agent reinforcement-learning framework is devised to solve the drone-clustering sub-problem. Meanwhile, the transmit and jamming power allocation sub-problem is solved by employing fractional programming, successive convex approximation, and alternating optimization techniques. By iteratively solving these two sub-problems, a convergent resource allocation algorithm, namely, &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\underline{\text{s}}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; ecurity and &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\underline{\text{i}}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; nterference management with &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\underline{\text{re}}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; inforcement-learning and &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\underline{\text{N}}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; OMA (SIREN), is proposed.

Specifically, the transceiver NI-RF-RPs encapsulate the non-ideal amplitude responses (NI-A-RPs) and non-ideal phase responses (NI-P-RPs) at both access points (APs) and users (UEs). By virtue of a generic RF-RP model, rigorous closed-form expressions of uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) achievable spectral efficiencies (SEs) with different NI-RF-RPs and pilot transmission protocols are respectively derived, which enable us to quantify the impact of the key system parameters, such as the transceiver amplitude (and phase) response variances and the transceiver reciprocity. Numerical results demonstrate that the SP protocol is superior to the RP protocol in terms of the UL and DL SEs, regardless of the presence of the NI-RF-RPs. Besides, the NI-A-RPs have negative effect on both UL and DL SEs, and the DL SE is immune to the transceiver amplitude non-reciprocity. Moreover, from the perspective of the NI-P-RPs, it is shown that the DL SE is only sensitive to the AP NI-P-RPs and whether the AP phase is reciprocal or not will significantly disturb the effect of the NI-P-RPs on the DL SE.},

Due to the coupling of optimization variables, this problem is a complex non-convex optimization problem, and it is challenging to solve it directly. We first transform the problem, and then apply the alternating optimization (AO) algorithm framework to divide the transformed problem into four sub-problems to solve it. Specifically, by applying successive convex approximation (SCA), penalty function method and difference-convex (DC) programming, UAV trajectory, SIC decoding order, UAV transmit power allocation, PS ratio and IRS reflection coefficient are alternately optimized until the convergence is achieved.

Under the co-pilot assignment strategy, we derive the minimum-mean-square error (MMSE) channel state information (CSI) estimation for unicast and multicast users. Given the acquired CSI, the closed-form expressions for downlink achievable rates with maximum ratio transmission (MRT), zero-forcing (ZF) and MMSE beamforming are derived. Based on these expressions, we propose an efficient power allocation scheme by solving a multi-objective optimization problem (MOOP) between maximizing the minimum spectral efficiency (SE) of multicast users and maximizing the average SE of unicast users with non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II). Moreover, the MOOP is converted into a deep learning (DL) problem and solved by an unsupervised learning method to further promote computational efficiency. Numerical results verify the accuracy of the derived closed-form expressions and the effectiveness of the joint unicast and multigroup multicast transmission scheme in cell-free distributed massive MIMO systems. The SE analysis under various system parameters and the trade-off regions between these two conflicting optimization objectives offers numerous flexibilities for system optimization.},

The resulting tracking mean-squared errors averaged across all vehicles of each state parameter are close to their posterior Cramér-Rao lower bounds.

By utilizing even higher frequency bands than 5G millimeter wave (mmWave) New Radio (NR), they will operate over extreme bandwidth delivering unprecedented rates at the access interface. However, by relying upon pencil-wide beams, these systems will not only inherit mmWave propagation challenges such as blockage phenomenon but introduce their own issues associated with micromobility of user equipment (UE).

  abstract     = {In this article, we present two clustered sparse Bayesian learning (Cluster-SBL) channel estimation algorithms for millimeter-wave (mmWave) massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Different from prior literature, channel path correlations at both the transmitter and the receiver are considered and exploited for estimation performance enhancement. Specifically, we first propose a Kronecker product-based multivariate Gaussian (KP-Gaussian) prior model for mmWave massive MIMO channels, which captures not only sparsity but also the widely existing clustering channel property in mmWave communications. Then, a channel approximation method is derived and leveraged to overcome the challenge caused by channel priors&#39; uncertainty due to the varying propagation environments and improve the robustness of the channel estimation algorithm against channel sparsity. After that, the Cluster-SBL channel estimation algorithm, which is developed based on the expectation maximization (EM) framework and has superior estimation accuracy and high robustness, is proposed. Moreover, to reduce the computation complexity in the channel estimation for practical applications, we also propose an efficient Cluster-SBL (eCluster-SBL) channel estimation algorithm. It is highly beneficial to mmWave massive MIMO systems, especially when the angular resolution is relatively high. Numerical results reveal that, compared with the existing compressed sensing-based and Bayesian criterion-based algorithms, the proposed two channel estimation algorithms exhibit the better performance from both the aspect of estimation accuracy and the aspect of robustness.},

However, the communication symbols and pilot information carried by the integrated signal and the cyclic prefix of OFDM greatly limit the performance of the radar and communication. In this paper, we propose a joint sequence optimization-based OFDM waveform design method for IRC. First, the ambiguity function of the OFDM signal block and guard interval (GI) sequence are deduced in detail, and a new composite sequence with the cascading of Walsh code and m sequence is used to optimize the correlation of communication information, resulting in better ambiguity function characteristics. Then, a multivariate optimization model is explored, and the constrained particle swarm optimization algorithm based on weight allocation (WCPSO) is proposed to obtain the optimal GI sequence. It has lower sidelobe levels and higher information transmission efficiency. In addition, an improved received signal processing method is introduced to achieve stable communication synchronization and high-resolution distance and velocity estimation of multiple targets radar detection. Finally, numerical simulation results are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

However, ETR has uncertainties owing to variation in vehicle mass, air pressure in the tire, and dynamic load transfer. This article firstly demonstrates the sensitivity of ETR on wheel slip estimation using a Fixed Radius Recursive Least Squares (FR-RLS) estimator and analyzes its effects on Antilock Brake System (ABS) performance. Secondly, it proposes a Radius Searching RLS (RS-RLS) wheel slip estimator that mitigates the drift in estimates, maintains vehicle stability, and improves ABS performance. The proposed method was evaluated on a Hardware-in-Loop system with IPG TruckMaker.

This article first establishes a coupling harmonic current-voltage model at multiple synchronous frames by simultaneously considering positive and negative harmonics. Then, a systematic method for analysing the command response and coupling response of harmonic currents is put forward based on the coupling model, and the shortage of conventional harmonic current regulators has been demonstrated theoretically. Consequently, an internal model decoupling regulator is proposed, yielding ideal reference tracking performance at the full speed range and strong parameter robustness at magnetic saturation conditions. Finally, experimental results of bench and vehicle tests demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed regulator on harmonic current tracking and active noise reduction.},

These aims are achieved by considering the dynamic model of the motor that improves the controller reaction and accuracy during the transient states as contrary to the existing literature. Moreover, the simplified current sensorless dynamic direct voltage control (DDVC) technology contains a couple of control gains versus three times that with the classical MTPA Field-oriented control (FOC) method. Moreover, a comparative validation of the simplified current sensorless dynamic direct voltage MTPA methodology and the FOC strategy is executed. Experimental results with energy consumption measurements and energy efficiency study prove that the proposed simplified DDVC MTPA strategy is a promising alternative to the existing MTPA technologies of IPMSMs&#39; drives as it preserves high energy efficiency during transient.},

The heat transfers between the end caps of electric vehicle wheels and the outside air are considered by the model. The node temperature of LPTN can be adopted as the boundary condition of the proposed analytical method to predict and calculate the maximum temperature and average temperature of the wheel motor and improve the accuracy of temperature rise calculation. To further analyze the winding temperature, the armature winding is divided into active winding and end winding for calculation respectively. In the calculation of active winding, based on the equivalent area method, the active winding and other materials are layered into a series of equal-width rectangular rings through a novel layered strategy. The compensated thermal resistance (TR) is introduced into the analytical model of end winding, and the accuracy of the end temperature solution is improved by the iteration of compensated TR. Finally, the effectiveness and correctness of the proposed analytical thermal model for motor temperature rise prediction are verified on a 2kW distributed double-layer winding wheel motor.},

  abstract     = {Lithium-ion battery state of health (SOH) estimation technology is an important part of the design of a battery monitoring system (BMS) for electric vehicles. People often use battery capacity and internal resistance as SOH estimation indicators. However, due to actual working conditions, it is difficult for electric vehicles to achieve complete charge and discharge, so the battery capacity and internal resistance cannot be monitored online. In view of the above questions, this article proposes an indirect SOH estimation method for online EV lithium-ion batteries based on arctangent function adaptive genetic algorithm combination with back propagation neural network (ATAGA-BP). Firstly, constant current drop time (CCDT), constant current drop capacity (CCDC) and maximum constant current drop rate (MCCDR) in constant voltage charging stage are used as health indicator (HI) to evaluate battery SOH in order to indirectly quantify the degradation process of lithium-ion batteries. Error point optimization and correlation verification are also carried out. Secondly, an ATAGA-BP algorithm is proposed to establish the relationship between HI and available battery capacity, and SOH estimate is made for lithium-ion batteries according to the proposed algorithm. Finally, simulation results with NASA data show the correlation between the proposed HI and lithium-ion battery capacity is above 85%, the error of SOH estimation method proposed is 3.7%, and the iteration efficiency is increased by 17.8%.},

  abstract     = {The simultaneous imaging and tracking of drones and small UAVs is one of the most challenging problems in inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) signal processing and has received significant attention recently. Wide-angle ISAR imaging may offer better resolution and richer geometrical features. Aiming at this issue, we propose a new algorithm for multiple extended drone targets (EDTs) detection and tracking from wide-angle ISAR images. Since a conventional tracking algorithm using a random matrices model (RMM) is not accurate enough to reconstruct a drone&#39;s extension by one ellipse, an appropriate technique needs to be developed for ISAR imaging and tracking of EDTs. This paper models the EDT&#39;s extension as multiple ellipses with a time-varying orientation angle and solves the resulting interference problem involving data association between the nonlinear measurements and sub-ellipses. Recently, the multi-Bernoulli (MB) filter for extended targets has been proposed with the RMM approach for linear ellipsoidal target tracking by additional state variables. However, the implementation of the MB-RMM filter for nonlinear non-Gaussian models and the Doppler effect has not been presented, especially for ISAR images. We consider linearizing the nonlinear observations to solve the nonlinearity due to the Doppler effect, target motion, and wide-angle ISAR images. We presented a new robust Sub-RMM-MB-TBD filter to obtain the estimated orientation of EDT&#39;s shape after using the range-only motion compensation that uses both range and Doppler information. Moreover, the authors applied the k-space algorithm to generate ISAR image. Simulation results demonstrate this remarkable performance.},

This paper proposes a reinforcement learning (RL) based real-time EMS for a HEV, which requires no prior knowledge of the future driving conditions. First, considering that the practical driving conditions are mutative, an online recursive Markov Chain model is constructed, which can depict the stochastic environment more accurately. Then, a novel RL framework, heuristic search, is introduced, which means using extra knowledge in the search process. It aims to find an optimal action for a specific state rather than learn a policy for an entire driving cycle like traditional RL algorithms. Consequently, the learning process is significantly efficient and real-time optimization can be realized. Moreover, a Q-table is learned offline, and is used online as a heuristic function to direct the search process, which can accelerate the convergence rate and improve the real-time performance further. In the simulation, the effectiveness of the recursive Markov Chain model and the superiority of the heuristic function are verified. Then, a comparative simulation of heuristic search, Q-learning, dynamic programming (DP) and equivalent consumption minimization strategy is conducted and evaluated. The proposed method consumes 1.63% more fuel compared with DP in a totally unknown cycle, which demonstrates its control performance and real-time capability.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a novel circularly polarized (CP) ridge-waveguide slotted antenna array is proposed for vehicle used Satcom on the Move (SOTM) applications. The antenna array is designed closely following the required factors for generating the circular polarization. The proposed antenna array is constructed on a symmetrical single-ridge slotted waveguide. Each antenna element consists of a pair of inclined slots opened on the narrow walls, and longitudinal slots opened on the bottom of the U-shaped wall of the waveguide. The inclined slots and the longitudinal slots are able to radiate orthogonal electric-fields independently with a phase-difference of 90°. After a vector superposition in the far-field by using this design, the circular polarization could be realized with extremely low axial ratio theoretically. Several essential parameters affecting the CP performance are also studied in this paper. To verify the feasibility of the proposed approach, a four-element CP antenna array is simulated, fabricated and measured. Results show that the obtained prototype achieves a measured impedance bandwidth of 14.74% from 9.24 GHz to 10.71 GHz with S11 &lt;−10 dB, and a 3-dB axial ratio bandwidth of 19.1% from 9.0 GHz to 10.9 GHz.},

Using the complex vector method and equivalent substitution method, kinematics and dynamics models of driving mechanical legs are established. Combined with models of driving and brake systems of manipulated vehicles, the longitudinal dynamics model is built. Then the longitudinal manipulation strategy is established. Based on the dynamics model of the mechanical leg, the sliding mode controller&#39;s control law is deduced. In addition, the fuzzy adaptive approximation is constructed and the fuzzy adaptive law is designed. Furthermore, the stability of the fuzzy sliding mode controller is proven using the Lyapunov function. Finally, through simulation and experiment, a comparison among the proposed method and several existing control methods demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {The problem of mainlobe deceptive jammer suppression with a novel stepped frequency (SF)-receive delay array (RDA) radar is addressed in this paper. In our system design, the linear frequency modulation (LFM) waveform with a SF across the antenna elements is transmitted in a uniform linear array, and the received echo is delayed with a time shift between adjacent antenna elements, introducing extra range-dependent degrees-of-freedom (DOFs) in both transmit and receive domains. Consider a typical form of mainlobe jammers, where multiple false targets are generated in the same transmit pulse or same range bin behind the true target after short time modulation. In this respect, the jammers are discriminated from the true target in the joint transmit-receive spatial frequency domain, and suppressed via a data-dependent beamformer based on the minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) criterion. To further solve the problem of sample selection due to the pseudo-random distribution of the false targets, two kinds of robust beamformers based on the enhanced Capon power spectrum (ECPS) and the eigen-projection elimination (EPE), are developed to reconstruct the jammer-plus-noise covariance matrix and estimate the steering vector of the true target. The performance of the proposed methods in suppression of mainlobe deceptive jammers is evaluated via numerical simulations and compared with the existing systems and robust beamforming methods.},

To analyze the impact of drivers&#39; behavior on the coupled network, and reveal the relationship between the two networks, a coupled traffic-distribution (CTD) model is proposed, in which the total traveling cost of UTN and the power service cost of PDN is minimized. In the CTD model, A stochastic user equilibrium traffic assignment problem (SUE-TAP) with elastic traffic demand and discrete path selection of drivers is formulated to capture the traffic flow distribution comprised of EVs and gasoline vehicles (GVs). An alternative current optimal power flow (ACOPF) model of PDN is utilized to provide the optimal charging price and scheduling plan. Besides, the SUE-TAP with nonlinear functions is difficult to solve, a novel piecewise linear approximation method is presented to deal with the nonlinear items of the SUE-TAP caused by drivers&#39; traveling cost and traveling tendency incorporating perception. Incorporating the behavioral theory, a distributed coordination method derived from optimal condition decomposition is proposed for the coupled traffic-power network equilibrium. The proposed distributed scheme is examined using a coupled network, which consists of a 20-road UTN and a 33-bus PDN. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed model and the distributed coordination method.},

In this article, we focus on the control of the powertrain energy management for an autonomous HEV. A new powertrain control strategy is enabled by leveraging one of the uniqueness in the powertrain management of an autonomous vehicle, i.e., the instantaneous power generated by the powertrain does not need to exactly follow the power demand by the vehicle motion controller. This is referred to as flexible power demand , which adds an extra degree of freedom to the powertrain energy management, and can lead to control design achieving better fuel economy. The powertrain control is then formulated under the Approximate Dynamic Programming (ADP) framework, and the power flexibility is incorporated in the ADP formulation. At last, an example of multiple connected HEVs following a leader vehicle operating in an off-road scenario is given to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method.},

Firstly, after the traffic flow parameters are obtained using vehicle-to-infrastructure communication technology, the kinematic shockwave model is used to predict the vehicle queue length at the saturated intersections. Secondly, to decrease fuel consumption, a fuel-saving optimization problem is formulated using the estimated queue length, and for real-time control, the formulated optimization problem is decomposed into two subproblems depending on whether the CAV will stop to queue. Then, to reduce fuel consumption and travel time simultaneously, the eco-driving algorithm is designed, where the trajectory re-optimization process is implemented in order not to block the upstream vehicles. Finally, extensive simulations are carried out on VISSIM to demonstrate the control performance of the proposed eco-driving algorithm on CAVs and on the entire traffic flow. Simulation results show that the proposed eco-driving algorithm can significantly decrease the fuel consumption and travel time of both CAVs and the traffic flow, and higher market penetration rate of CAVs can result in better control performance.},

In the process of regenerative braking, all components of the system dissipate a great amount of energy, especially in winter. On the other hand, heating the vehicle&#39;s cabin consumes electric energy, further reducing its autonomy. Based on this, we propose a novel Self-excited, electromagnetic Braking and Heating System (SBHS), to solve problem of the driving range dramatic decline of electric bus when heating the bus cabin in winter. The system converts the kinetic energy of the electric bus into heat, via electromagnetic braking, and uses it to warm the vehicle&#39;s cabin in winter. Our system improves the conversion efficiency of regenerative braking. We present the structure of the system and calculate the air gap magnetic density using the magnetic circuit method. We develop the braking heat generation model and obtain the heat generation performance at different speeds using J-MAG. To improve the braking energy utilization efficiency, we design a braking force distribution strategy based on a fuzzy control system. We also characterize the braking and built-in generator performances in a test bench, and obtain the braking and heating characteristic at different speeds. We implemented our EBHS and installed on a test electric bus. The test records include SOC, temperature inside the vehicle and distance. The results show that the SBHS can provide both sufficient braking torque for the vehicle and heat energy for the cabin.},

In this paper, we put forward a privacy-preserving and efficient scheme for vehicular congestion detection with both horizontal and vertical partitioned vehicular sensing data using Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) approach. Particularly, this work considers that different vehicle manufacturers would choose their encryption systems, which poses a challenge on how to collaboratively train an MLP model on these heterogeneous encrypted sensing data. To address this challenge, we utilize proxy re-encryption and additive homomorphic encryption schemes for preserving the confidentiality of raw sensing data and learning models while maintaining secure computation efficiency. Formally security analysis is provided to demonstrate that our proposed scheme is able to guarantee the privacy of the MLP learning process. Finally, we implement our scheme and evaluate it with real datasets.

Accordingly, NMSVs are capable to achieve arbitrary preset configuration transformations, while only a small part of the formation members called leaders obtain the configuration information. Then, a synthetical constraint is designed, which can concern position and attitude configuration rigidities simultaneously. This feature enables NMSVs to achieve formation maneuvers with time-varying formation speeds and orientations. On these bases, a novel CDAFC scheme is developed. In contrast to the conventional fully distributed control schemes, the implementation requirements are completely limited to the local reference frame, i.e., not only is CDAFC designed in a node-based way, but the CDAFC implementation just depends on the local relative poses and self velocities. Thus, we call it completely distributed . The semi-physical simulations are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness.},

Entity trust, the communication capability of equipment, and sociality trust, the social status of humans, are factors affecting the content distribution in SIoV.

However, the existing trust evaluation schemes didn&#39;t consider the balance between entity and sociality, which affects the SIoV&#39;s quality of service (QoS). In this paper, we propose an entity and sociality trust-aware model for content distribution in SIoV. The model makes a trade-off between entity trust and sociality trust (social activity and the feedback of acquaintances) based on the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation, to obtain an overall trust level and limit the driving application functions and social behavior in SIoV. In addition, the blocking rules of content distribution are improved, taking into account trust value and location, including the extreme situation of the proportion of untrusted vehicles in SIoV. The experiment results of both simulation and the real road layout in Madrid, Spain show that the model effectively improves the security of the network and QoS in terms of content reception and delivery time.},

  abstract     = {A novel nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) strategy for path tracking of autonomous vehicles with stable limit handling is proposed in this article. To improve the path tracking performance under complex driving maneuvers, a tire lateral force model, which treats road adhesion coefficient and vertical load as variable parameters, is discussed first. It has the advantage that the dynamics model can be applied under different driving conditions. In addition, the stability properties of the dynamics system with the front tire lateral force as the virtual control input are analyzed. The global asymptotical stability with zero input and local input-to-state stability with nonzero input of the dynamics system are proved respectively. To perform path tracking within the handling limits, both constraints of front tire lateral force and rear tire slip angle are included in the NMPC controller. The constraint of front tire lateral force is considered as peak limits related to load transfer and adhesion coefficient. And for the rear tire slip angle, a combining constraint scheme is proposed, where the indirect constraint is implemented by a penalty term that predicts the saturation of rear tire lateral force, while the direct constraint is implemented by a dead-zone exponential penalty function. The Continuation/Generalized Minimum Residual (C/GMRES) algorithm is applied to improve the computation efficiency of the NMPC. The performance of the controller is evaluated in simulations and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) tests, and the results show that the controller is able to track the reference path with high precision in real-time.},

  abstract     = {Real-time driver behavior detection (DBD) is essential for developing driver-centered human-vehicle co-driving systems. This paper proposes an accurate and easily implementable DBD method based on driver behavior images and deep learning. Convolutional neural networks have difficulty dealing with changes in driver behavior images (rotation, scale, and translation). They suffer from a tradeoff between accuracy and number of trainable parameters, noise interference in images of driver behavior, and the black-box problem of neural networks, limiting the effectiveness of current DBD methods. Therefore, we design a novel deep learning-based DBD method consisting of a deep deformable inverted residual network with an attention mechanism. Deformable convolution is used to deal with image rotation and translation. An inverted residual block and linear bottleneck approach based on depthwise separable convolution is used to reduce the number of trainable parameters while maintaining high accuracy. An attention mechanism based on soft thresholding is incorporated into the nonlinear transformation layers to extract driver behavior-relevant features. We also innovatively propose a visualization method to improve the interpretability of the proposed method. The experimental results show that the proposed method can accurately detect driver behavior (95.17% mAP on the Kaggle driving test dataset), significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods regarding accuracy, real-time performance, and reliability.},

In this work, an adaptive encoding scheme is adopted to represent trajectories as knot vectors of parametric cubic splines, and therefore the original problem is reformulated into a constrained numerical optimization version. The number of knots can be adjusted to trade-off between the shape flexibility and computation efficiency. Further, the proposed coevolutionary algorithm decomposes the initially high-dimensional problem into smaller subproblems, significantly reducing the complexity. A hybrid evolutionary algorithm is developed as an optimizer for subproblems. Additionally, a branch-and-bound strategy and a Tabu search component are integrated into the steepest ascent hill-climbing algorithm to speed up convergences within the local exploitation phase. Numerical experiments are conducted on extensive scenarios with different platooning sizes and initial separations. Experimental results indicate the superiority of the proposed approach in optimality and stability with reasonable sub-second computation time for real-life applications.},

  abstract     = {In modern electronic warfare, it is becoming very important to develop intelligent and adaptive radar anti-jamming methods since jammers can now launch increasingly complex and unpredictable attacks. Besides, in practice, the jamming strategy is usually unknown to the radar. To overcome the limitations caused by the lack of information about the jammer, reinforcement learning is applied to radar anti-jamming in this paper via the adaptation of frequency hopping interval. In reinforcement learning, the sequential decision problem to solve is described as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). To describe the sequential radar anti-jamming decision making process, a detailed radar anti-jamming MDP model is formulated. To balance between integration efficiency and probability of interception, a flexible adjustable tradeoff between them is devised by defining the reward function of the MDP as the weighted sum of the integration efficiency factor and the probability of interception factor. Two properties of the MDP value function are proved. These properties are used to derive the optimal frequency hopping time interval for different pulse widths under the RL framework. Simulation results show that the proposed radar anti-jamming strategy can adapt to the jamming environment well and can control its performance flexibly by adjusting the weights of integration efficiency and probability of interception.},

Since the transmitter has only a delayed CSIT, a HARQ with Chase combining is employed for error recovery. The problem is to decide the transmit-energy in each time-slot such that the timely-throughput is maximum for a given average transmit-energy constraint. We pose this problem as a constrained Markov decision process, and provide an optimum policy based on Lagrangian relaxation. The optimum Lagrangian multiplier is obtained using a subgradient method. We obtain the structure of the optimum policy, based on which we propose a computationally simple policy READER that requires no CSIT. We show that for large Doppler spread (or mobility), the timely-throughput of READER is close to the optimum policy. We also provide two more policies: an optimum policy assuming perfect CSIT with zero delay, and a naive randomization policy, and compare the throughput performance of the proposed policies.},

Moreover, two EM reconstruction methods, which serve as the keys to the model, are proposed to reconstruct EMs to provide information for communication optimization according to different demands. One method is KGA-GAN-SBI, which combines the kriging algorithm, generative adversarial network and split bregman iterations, and the other is APCA-KGA-DPA, which combines the affinity propagation clustering algorithm, kriging algorithm and domain mapping algorithm. The former can satisfy the demand of high-accuracy EMs. The latter can reconstruct an EM faster than KGA-GAN-SBI. The simulation results show that both low-cost methods can reconstruct more accurate EMs than several existing algorithms; they can provide an effective way to optimize the communication quality of temporary communication and fill the gap in the study of EM applications.},

In this paper, we consider the transmit power control algorithm to minimize interference among cellular users and vehicles in the context of V2V communication underlaid uplink cellular networks. First, we formulate the problem, which is an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem with linear constraints. Addressing this problem with traditional optimization methods is ineffective; therefore, we design and train a deep neural network to address this optimization problem. Computational complexity analyses and simulation results reveal that the proposed algorithm outperforms weighted minimum mean squared error (WMMSE), fixed transmit power, and Dinkelbach&#39;s methods, and achieves near-global optimum with lower computation complexity than the exhaustive search (ES).},

Our simulation results highlight that the key information generated by the eavesdropper is almost zero in the case of highly correlated legitimate and eavesdropping channels under LoS conditions.

  abstract     = {The design of a blind receiver for unsynchronized bursty communications is a challenging task, especially when the data burst duration is very short and the over-sampling ratio (OSR) at the receiver is a non-integer value. In this article, the problem of blind symbol-rate estimation for bursty communications is studied. A cyclostationary method with bias removal (CS-BR) is proposed to improve the accuracy of the “OSR peak” detection in cyclostationary method when the length of signal burst is very short. Factors which affect the accuracy of the proposed blind symbol-rate estimation are thoroughly analyzed. Both field measurement data simulations and Monte Carlo simulations show that by using our proposed CS-BR method, the accuracy of blind symbol-rate estimation can be significantly improved, and the root-mean-square-error of the estimated OSR can be reduced to as small as &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$10^{-4}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; even if each short data burst consists of only tens of symbols.},

An optimization framework for the joint transmit beamforming and receive filters design of a coordinated two-cell network is formulated. Specifically, we minimize the transmit power at two BSs subject to the signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio constraints. To solve the formulated non-convex optimization problem, an alternating optimization-based method is invoked.

Switched antenna arrays have recently emerged as an effective solution to reduce the cost and power consumption of MIMO systems. Switch-based array architectures connect a limited number of radio frequency chains to a subset of the antenna elements forming a subarray. This paper addresses the problem of antenna selection to optimize DOA estimation performance. We first perform a subarray layout alignment process to remove subarrays with identical beampatterns and create a unique subarray set. By using this set, and based on a DOA threshold region performance approximation, we propose two antenna selection algorithms; a greedy algorithm and a deep-learning-based algorithm. The performance of the proposed algorithms is evaluated numerically. The results show a significant performance improvement over selected benchmark approaches in terms of DOA estimation in the threshold region and computational complexity.},

  abstract     = {Indoor multi-robot communications face two key challenges: one is the severe signal strength degradation caused by blockages (e.g., walls) and the other is the dynamic environment caused by robot mobility. To address these issues, we consider the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) to overcome the signal blockage and assist the trajectory design among multiple robots. Meanwhile, the non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is adopted to cope with the scarcity of spectrum and enhance the connectivity of robots. Considering the limited battery capacity of robots, we aim to maximize the energy efficiency by jointly optimizing the transmit power of the access point (AP), the phase shifts of the RIS, and the trajectory of robots. A novel federated deep reinforcement learning (F-DRL) approach is developed to solve this challenging problem with one dynamic long-term objective. Through each robot planning its path and downlink power, the AP only needs to determine the phase shifts of the RIS, which can significantly save the computation overhead due to the reduced training dimension. Simulation results reveal the following findings: i) the proposed F-DRL can reduce at least 86% convergence time compared to the centralized DRL; ii) the designed algorithm can adapt to the increasing number of robots; iii) compared to traditional OMA-based benchmarks, NOMA-enhanced schemes can achieve higher energy efficiency.},

In the phase of beam sweep, the beam misleading algorithm induces the transmitter to choose the beam which is beneficial to the monitor by optimizing the relay precoding matrices. In the phase of data transmission, the data eavesdropping algorithm elevates the monitoring rate by optimizing the relay power split factors and power gain factors of all subcarriers.

  abstract     = {With the development of Internet of Things, communication and computer technology, the significance of realizing vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) become more important. Due to wireless communication, VANETs suffer cyber attacks in practice. Many anonymous authentication schemes have been proposed in the literature. Li et al. proposed an efficient authentication scheme called CL-CPPA. However, the proposed scheme failed to realize the claimed un-linkability and anonymity. In this work, we proposed a new certificateless conditional privacy-preserving authentication scheme with an enhanced security guarantee. Specifically, a random number is selected to encrypt the unique tag to ensure anonymity. And our proposed scheme also realizes un-linkability, ensuring that attackers cannot determine whether different messages are sent by the same vehicle. Besides, we present a detailed and efficient revocation mechanism in the proposed scheme. Each RSU has its own private key, when there is a malicious vehicle, RSU will immediately update the private key of current area. Only legitimate vehicles can get the new private key, and malicious vehicle is efficiently revoked from the network. The experiment results show that the proposed scheme solves the above problems with little additional extra calculations.},

  abstract     = {The wireless-powered communication paradigm brings self-sustainability to the on-vehicle sensors by harvesting the energy from radiated radio frequency (RF) signals. This paper proposes a novel transmission and resource allocation strategy for the scenario where multiple wireless powered vehicle area networks (VAN) co-existed with high density. The considered multi-VAN system consists of a remote master access point (MAP), multiple on-vehicle hybrid access points (HAPs) and sensors. Unlike previous works, we consider that the sensors can recycle the radiated radio frequency energy from all the HAPs when HAPs communicate with MAP, so the dedicated signals for energy harvesting (EH) are unnecessary. The proposed strategy can achieve simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) without complex receiver architecture requirements. The extra EH and interference caused by the dense distribution of VANs, which are rarely explored, are fully considered. To maximize the sum throughput of all the sensors while guaranteeing the transmission from HAPs to the MAP, we jointly optimize the time allocation, system energy consumption, power allocation, and receive beamforming. Due to the non-convexity of the formulated problem, we address the sub-problems separately through the Rayleigh quotient, Frobenius norm minimization and convex optimization. Then an efficient iterative algorithm to obtain sub-optimal solutions. The simulation results and discussions illustrate the proposed scheme&#39;s effectiveness and advantages.},

  abstract     = {Mobile edge computing is popular for providing services with low latency and high privacy. It becomes more powerful by leveraging the widely deployed Small cell Base Stations (SBS) with zooming cells for energy-efficient service placement. However, the literature ignores the joint optimization of SBS power control and service placement. The Quality of Services (QoS) guarantee is also challenging, taking into account the component dependency and parallelization in multi-component services and the resource slicing for separated service deployment. Moreover, prior works assume the same amount of allocated resources of links on a placed path for service edge allocation, leading to the ossification of resource allocation and inevitable resource fragments. Towards the above challenges, this paper addresses the energy-efficient and flexible service placement in cell zooming enabled Mobile Edge Cloud (MEC) networks. The delay of multi-component services is constructed depending on the allocated resource slice. Besides, the joint optimization of service placement and SBS power control is formulated and transformed into a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP). More importantly, the equivalent bandwidth for an edge allocation is defined and analyzed to obtain flexible edge placement with minimum resource cost. Leveraging the results of MILP, an Energy-efficient Service placement algorithm based on equivalent Bandwidth in Cell zooming enabled MEC networks (ESBC) is proposed to improve the probability of successful service placement with QoS guarantee by optimizing the delay distribution among components and edges and reducing resource fragments. Finally, simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.},

DBSs can work as computing nodes to provide computing services to user equipments ( UEs ) as well as relays to forward the tasks to the MBS at the same time. Both DBSs and MBS are provisioned with servers. UEs can offload their tasks to the MBS directly, DBSs directly, or the MBS via a DBS.

Since TENSOR is a mixed-integer nonlinear problem, we decompose it into four sub-problems: resource (bandwidth and computation) assignment and DBS transmission power control problem, UE power control problem, UE association problem, and DBS placement problem. Successive convex approximation and an iterative algorithm are leveraged to solve the four sub-problems separately. In each iteration, we use the output of the first three as the input for the fourth.

In such scenario, the entities of IoV need to be mutually authenticated since potential attacks can impersonate edge nodes to send false instructions to vehicles, or impersonate legitimate service subscribers to get free-ride IoV services. Furthermore, due to the high mobility characteristics of vehicles, frequent authentication is required between vehicles and edge nodes. We hope that the authentication process can be conducted efficiently to ensure the continuous service. Existing works cannot balance the security and efficiency well. This is still an issue worthy of discussion. In this article, we propose SEA, a secure and efficient blockchain-assisted authentication scheme for IoV. SEA achieves mutual authentication among vehicles, edge nodes and cloud servers. Specifically, the cloud server is only involved when vehicles are initially authenticated. And edge nodes realize the authentication of vehicles by querying the authentication result recorded by cloud on the blockchain, which significantly reduces the cryptographic computation overhead and eliminates network communication delay. Besides, session keys between any two entities involved are negotiated, which can secure sensitive data of vehicles. Extensive experiments have been conducted to show the security and efficiency of SEA.},

  abstract     = {As the network slicing is one of the critical enablers in communication networks, one anomalous physical node (PN) or physical link (PL) in substrate networks that carries multiple virtual network elements can cause significant performance degradation of multiple network slices. To recover the substrate networks from anomaly within a short time, rapid and accurate identification of whether or not the anomaly exists in PNs and PLs is vital. Online anomaly detection methods that can analyze system data in real-time are preferred. Besides, as virtual nodes and links mapped to PNs and PLs are scattered in multiple slices, the distributed detection modes are required to adapt to the virtualized environment. According to those requirements, in this paper, we first propose a distributed online PN anomaly detection algorithm based on a decentralized one-class support vector machine (OCSVM), which is realized through analyzing real-time measurements of virtual nodes mapped to PNs in a distributed manner. Specifically, to decouple the OCSVM objective function, we transform the original problem to a group of decentralized quadratic programming problems by introducing the consensus constraints. The alternating direction method of multipliers is adopted to achieve the solution for the distributed online PN anomaly detection. Next, by utilizing the correlation of measurements between neighbor virtual nodes, another distributed online PL anomaly detection algorithm based on the canonical correlation analysis is proposed. The network only needs to store covariance matrices and mean vectors of current data to calculate the canonical correlation vectors for real-time PL anomaly analysis. The simulation results on both synthetic and real-world network datasets show the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed distributed online anomaly detection algorithms.},

  abstract     = {The spectrum usage often comes in an online fashion. Considering the selfish behaviors of both primary users(PUs) and sencond users(SUs), we design online double spectrum allocation methods. We propose a truthful online double auction for spectrum allocation. Preempting existing spectrum usage is not allowed. We design a strategyproof mechanism for both the primary user side and the SU side. In previous studies, users who do not interfere with each other have not been reasonably allocated to use channels. There is one and only one user on the used spectrum channel at a certain time, which will result in discarding many user requests. Our model allows multiple users to use a spectrum channel at the same time. Aiming at the shortcomings of previous research, we propose the concept of grouping for online auctions, so that all SUs that do not interfere with each other can use spectrum channels at the same time. This will greatly increase the number of users who use the spectrum at the same time. We thus increase the utilization rate of the user market, and a large number of users will not be idle and abandoned.In the design of our experiments, the grouping model proposed in this paper has obtained at least &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$43{\%}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; utilization rate on the set channel, and our experiments have obtained good generality for different interference radius.},

  abstract     = {Mobile edge computing (MEC) and millimeter wave (mmWave) communications are capable of significantly reducing the network&#39;s delay and enhancing its capacity. In this paper we investigate a mmWave and device-to-device (D2D) assisted MEC system, in which user A carries out some computational tasks and shares the results with user B with the aid of a base station (BS). We assume partial offloading model and the task can be partitioned into two portions: the first part is computed locally at user A, while the second part is transmitted to the BS and computed by the MEC server. The computational results are then sent to user B through a D2D link and via the link from the BS to user B, respectively. To support computation offloading, both the users and the BS are equipped with multiple antennas and employ analog and digital (A/D) hybrid beamforming. Moreover, we propose a novel two-timescale joint hybrid beamforming and task allocation algorithm to reduce the system latency whilst cut down the required signaling overhead. Specifically, the high-dimensional analog beamforming matrices are updated in a frame-based manner based on the channel state information (CSI) samples, where each frame consists of a number of time slots, while the low-dimensional digital beamforming matrices and the offloading ratio are optimized more frequently relied on the low-dimensional effective channel matrices in each time slot. A stochastic successive convex approximation (SSCA) based algorithm is developed to design the long-term analog beamforming matrices. As for the short-term variables, the digital beamforming matrices are optimized relying on the innovative penalty-concave convex procedure (penalty-CCCP) for handling the mmWave non-linear transmit power constraint, and the offloading ratio can be obtained via the derived closed-form solution. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm by comparing the benchmarks.},

However, the benefit of CUPS in decoupling the network coverage and data service functions has not been fully utilized to facilitate network slicing. In this paper, we present a novel CUPS-based end-to-end (CUPS-E2E) network slicing scheme. First, the base stations (BS) are classified into control BSs (CBS) that provide control plane (CP) coverage and traffic BSs (TBS) that deliver user plane (UP) traffic. Next, upon CBSs and TBSs being virtualized, we define four typical end-to-end (E2E) network slices: one for CP coverage, one for high-throughput services, one for computation-intensive services, and the other for delay-sensitive services. The utilities of the four E2E network slices are defined based on their coverage, throughput, computing capability and delay requirements, respectively. Then, a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)-based algorithm is employed to maximize the long-term sum-utility of the four E2E network slices by jointly optimizing the allocation of communication and computing resources to the four network slices and the activation of virtual TBSs, while meeting the service requirements of all users. Simulation results show that our proposed CUPS-E2E network slicing scheme in conjunction with a DDPG-based sum-utility maximization algorithm can support the CP wide-coverage and massive access requirements as well as the UP high-throughput, computation-intensive and delay-sensitive services simultaneously, and outperforms the existing E2E network slicing schemes in terms of the sum-utility, coverage percentage, throughput and delay.},

This article firstly constructs a new user-content evolution model to infer such performance changes, and analyzes the number of links between users and content (i.e., degree). Then, the requested probability of the content and the optimal copy number are calculated by using the content degree. Next, the minimum average transmission distance of the content and system capacity under the cache scheme are given. Finally, a user-content time-varying system is simulated.

  abstract     = {Digital twin (DT) has emerged as a promising technology to create digital replicas of physical vehicles to facilitate driving in Internet of Vehicles (IoV). However, due to the uneven distribution of vehicles in the networks and the dynamics of heterogeneous wireless links, how to optimize the connection along the vehicle&#39;s trip between the vehicle and its DT to achieve the lowest cost ( i.e. , delay and energy consumption) is a fundamental challenge. In this paper, we investigate the joint network selection and power level allocation problem in the data synchronization issue between vehicles and DTs in the heterogeneous access networks. In order to better use the information shared by DT to facilitate the data synchronization process, we propose a learning-based heterogeneous network selection scheme in DT empowered IoV. First, we consider the data divided into blocks and model the data synchronization problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) to minimize the long-term cost in terms of the delay and energy consumption. Based on the information obtained from the digital twin communications, we develop an actor-critic learning approach to solve the MDP problem with the block-level state method, and obtain the optimal network selection strategy for the vehicles. In addition, we explore the capability of digital twins by applying transfer learning. The vehicles are divided into two types, i.e. , learner vehicles and expert vehicles, so that the knowledge can be transferred from the expert vehicles to the learner vehicles to effectively improve the learning efficiency and decrease the data synchronization latency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our scheme can effectively find the optimal network selection policy and achieve the fast convergence and better performance compared with existing related approaches.},

  abstract     = {With an emerging development in transport technologies, many applications in vehicular environments access roadside unit (RSU) services for tasks offloading. These applications use different types of paid services (e.g., communication, WiFi, and computing nodes) for their execution. The vehicular fog cloud computing (VFCN) is a cooperative computing environment to handle vehicle applications&#39; mobility and resource allocation. However, the aforementioned collaborative VFCN environment still suffers from mobility and security issues in the existing systems. To address the aforementioned issues, in this work we present a cost-efficient and secure VFCN which consists of a mobility-aware multi-scenario offloading phase (MAMSOP) to deal with the mobility and offloading costs. The objective of the work is to execute applications with minimum delays and costs in a secure way. For the security concern, we propose a security scheme based on fully-homomorphism encryption, which encrypts and decrypts data locally and involves computation on encrypted data rather than decrypting it into its original form. As most of the applications have deadline and mobility constraints, so we propose the fully polynomial-time approximation scheme (FPTAS) based search task scheduling (STS) to ensure the execution of all applications within their given constraints. The goal of STS-FPTAS is to determine the delay and cost-aware scheduling into knapsack-aware resources. The knapsack allows all tasks to be allocated to the available length of resources. The results show that the proposed work optimizes the costs by 40% compared to existing systems.},

  abstract     = {The accuracy of artificial intelligence (AI) models is crucial for connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs). However, in reality, model training under less frequent weather faces the problem of insufficient sampling. Also, in the real world, weather, sunlight, etc., can only change with the speed of the real-time clock, so the traditional sampling process is very slow. Moreover, currently, collective learning, which can make up the limited experience and computing power of a single vehicle, is always introduced to cases where the data from participants have the same structure, wasting massive heterogeneous data from vehicles of different brands. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a quantum collective learning and many-to-many matching game-based scheme in the metaverse for CAVs. The environment is simulated in the metaverse, which has its own time clock system, thereby expanding sample size and speeding up the sampling process. And we quantify the quality of intelligence in collective learning from the perspective of feature diversity. It is the cornerstone of collective learning between heterogeneous vehicles, facilitating maximum utilization of data with different structures. Then, we formulate the distributed vehicles selection problem as a many-to-many matching game and use Gale–Shapely algorithm to solve it. Also, we formulate the spectrum resource allocation problem as a discrete Markov decision process (MDP) and adopt a quantum-inspired reinforcement learning (QRL) algorithm to find the optimal policy to achieve the high revenue of the system. In simulations, the performance of the proposed scheme is compared with existing methods.},

However, the Received Signal Strength (RSS) is significantly different on heterogeneous devices, and this difference has a negative impact on localization results. In this paper, we propose a multi-fingerprint and multi-classifier fusion (MFMCF) localization method to improve the localization accuracy and solve the problem of heterogeneous hardware. First, the individual feature set of original RSS fingerprint, signal strength difference (SSD) fingerprint and hyperbolic location fingerprint (HLF) are fused as a composite fingerprint set (CFS), and then the data dimension is reduced by linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Second, three representative machine learning algorithms including K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) are selected and trained to construct an integrated fusion model. Finally, in order to get more accurate predictions, in the online phase, a selective strategy based on entropy is proposed by calculating the entropy of each classifier’s prediction result. Experiments show that MFMCF is an effective scheme to solve the localization problem of heterogeneous devices and improve the localization accuracy.},

In particular, we first analyze the feasibility of the problem by deriving the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of feasible solutions and propose an efficient algorithm to obtain the set of feasible values of transmission time allocation. We then propose an efficient algorithm for the transmission time allocation to improve the sum-throughput.

  abstract     = {As an aerial base station, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has been considered as a promising technology to assist future wireless communications due to its flexible, swift and low cost features, where resource allocation is the basis for ensuring energy-efficient UAV-assisted networks. This paper formulates a joint optimization problem of user association, UAV trajectory design and power control to maximize the channel capacity among all ground users at a limited power level in a downlink transmission. To tackle the mixed-integer non-linear programming problem, this paper proposes a clustering-aided reinforcement learning approach consisting of three consecutive stages. Firstly, modified expectation-maximization unsupervised learning algorithm is investigated to cluster the ground users, which reduces the dimensions and hence, the association complexity is reduced as well. Then, Kuhn-Munkres algorithm is incorporated for user association, which associates a UAV with the ground users via matching to the cluster, and assigns the UAVs to the centroid of the matching cluster for pre-placement, with the aim of speeding up the convergence of the following deep reinforcement learning algorithm. Finally, a multi-agent twin delayed deep deterministic (MATD3) policy gradient is proposed to solve the non-convex sub-problem, which determines the transmit power and designs the fine-tuned trajectory of UAVs. By incorporating low-bias value estimation technique, the reward of the proposed MATD3 algorithm is improved. Simulation results have demonstrated that our proposed approach achieves higher reward as well as converging faster than existing reinforcement algorithms. Besides, the clustering-aided reinforcement learning has lower computational complexity than the benchmark schemes.},

To this end, we propose a secure aerial computing architecture that integrates MEC and blockchain technology for UAV networks to effectively ensure the security and privacy of computation offloading between UAVs and mobile users. Under this architecture, a problem of joint optimization of user association, UAV trajectory, block processor scheduling, and computation resource allocation is formulated to minimize the weighted sum of the energy consumption and the delay in completing computation tasks and blockchain tasks processing. To handle this intractable issue, we first decouple the optimization variables and then separate the original problem into multiple subproblems to be solved alternately.

  abstract     = {The Third Generation Partnership Project has standardized cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) sidelink Mode 4 to support direct communication between vehicles. In Mode 4, the sensing-based semipersistent scheduling (SPS) scheme enables vehicles to autonomously reserve and select radio resources. In particular, SPS has three processes to realize the resource scheduling, including continuously sensing resources, probabilistically reselecting resources, and periodically reserving resources. However, vehicles randomly select resources from the available resource lists in the resource reselection process, resulting in frequent packet collisions especially when radio resources are insufficient. Unlike the traditional SPS, this paper proposes a multiagent deep reinforcement learning-based SPS (RL-SPS) algorithm to help vehicles select appropriate radio resources with the aim of reducing packet collisions. Furthermore, a multi-head attention mechanism is adopted to improve the training efficiency by helping vehicles selectively pay attention to the observations and actions of neighbouring vehicles. It is worth noting that the RL-SPS algorithm fits the characteristics of Mode 4, which selects resources without requiring any global information. Simulation results show that RL-SPS outperforms other decentralized approaches and demonstrate the scalability and robustness of RL-SPS in a dynamic vehicular network.},

  abstract     = {Vehicular networks which are paralyzed by natural disasters is faced with communication dilemma. Through building a decentralized communication network, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with high mobility and flexibility are expected to be the solution to the post-disaster vehicular networks. The blockchain technology has been widely used in UAV networks to provision the prompt security of distributed communications. However, existing works ignore the dynamics of the network in that due to high mobility, distributed UAVs cannot timely connect to the backbone to synchronize blockchain transactions. The delay of synchronization can result in severe security issues. On addressing the issues, this paper proposes UAVs-aided blockchain offline transactions to ensure the security and effectiveness of delay-tolerant blockchain transactions when UAVs are offline. In specific, we consider vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) charging transactions in post-disaster vehicular networks. By establishing offline channel between charging and discharging electric vehicles (EVs) by hashed time locked contract (HTLC), we design a UAVs aided penalty algorithm with accountable assertions to prevent deposit forging attacks and double-spending attacks. In addition, considering the selfishness of EVs, a Stackelberg game based incentive scheme is developed to encourage EVs to participate the offline transactions and to improve their trust values. By suing the mechanisms above, our proposal addresses the security of offline EV charging, as well as the selfishness of participant. Using extensive simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed scheme can realize secure transactions among EVs and can effectively improve the utilities of EVs through the comparison with conventional schemes.},

  abstract     = {Benefiting from the rapid progress of wireless communication and artificial intelligence, multi-agent collaboration opens up new opportunities for various fields. To facilitate multi-agent acting as a group, effective communication plays a crucial role. Recently, many efforts based on multi-agent reinforcement learning have been made to enable effective multi-agent communication under limited bandwidth or noisy channel. However, current methods do not explore wireless resource allocation strategy explicitly. Moreover, due to ignoring task-relevant significance of information, traditional wireless resource allocation schemes may fail to guarantee the transmission efficiency and reliability for multi-agent communication. To this end, in this paper, we propose a task-oriented communication principle for multi-agent communication. We model the task-oriented channel allocation problem as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process and propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework as a solution. Specifically, we design a novel variational information bottleneck to extract task-relevant information from local observation. Furthermore, a task-oriented channel allocation mechanism is developed to choose the allocation pattern with maximum expected gain. Finally, a double attention mechanism is developed to motivate the efficient utilization of task-relevant information. Experimental results show that our method can improve the effectiveness and efficiency of multi-agent communication, enhancing collaboration performance compared to baselines.},

Besides, they are densely deployed to have overlapping radio coverage so that requested files can be delivered cooperatively using beamforming. The bottleneck of the network is typically in the bandwidth-limited wireless fronthaul, which connects a cloud server to the F-APs. This work studies index coding design for cooperative caching and delivery in F-RAN to minimize fronthaul traffic and transmit energy. Index coding algorithms are designed considering the cached content at the F-APs and the possibility of beamforming in the access network under coded and uncoded caching schemes. An optimal polynomial-time index coding algorithm for uncoded and repetition caching and an efficient heuristic for Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) coded caching are designed, and their superior performance is verified by simulations. The study is further extended to consider the tradeoff between the traffic load of the fronthaul link and the transmit energy consumed in the access network. At the expense of more fronthaul traffic, beamforming opportunities can be increased, significantly reducing energy consumption. Algorithms to achieve the tradeoff are crafted, and simulation results show that uncoded caching well balances the tradeoff.},

  abstract     = {Cognitive radio is considered a relevant communication paradigm to deal with the increasing demands in modern communications systems. Adaptive schemes are required to recognize channel conditions and to properly adjust main transmission parameters to improve the quality of communications. In this direction, blind algorithms to recover constellation, from phase-modulated signals, represent a means to implement cognitive capabilities to allow automatic modulation recognition (AMR) on receivers. Commonly, the most popular approaches for blind constellation recovery are based on a two-step scheme. The first step uses to equalize channel effects and reduce inter-symbol interference (ISI). The second step carries out constellation recovery utilizing phase locked loop (PLL) systems like the Costas Loop, then to classify the incoming signal. This work proposes a novel single-step blind adaptive filter solution, inspired by an adaptive interference canceler, for joint equalization and constellation symbol recovery from received phase shift keying (PSK) waveforms. Furthermore, we propose new coefficients update mechanisms based on the constant amplitude of PSK signals. The proposed solution exhibits reduced computational complexity compared to the state of the art and a reduced time of convergence. Additionally, the proposed scheme does not require a training sequence to operate properly. The obtained results clearly show that the proposed scheme significantly improves accuracy regarding phase symbol estimation and ISI reduction.},

  abstract     = {Cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) systems are an alternative topology for mMIMO deployment, wherein a large number of access points are distributed over the coverage area to jointly serve users. Linear precoding methods such as zero-forcing are sufficient to achieve near-optimal performance in mMIMO systems. However, a key challenge in implementing these precoders can be a channel matrix inversion operation, which results in significant computational complexity in systems with large-scale antenna arrays. Hence, instead of direct matrix inversion, we examine several iterative methods to calculate the precoding matrix in a cell-free mMIMO system. We investigate their computational complexity and convergence rate in the presence of small- and large-scale fading and spatial correlation between antennas. Notably, we demonstrate that some iterative methods previously proposed for conventional (co-located) mMIMO do not always converge for cell-free mMIMO. Our main focus is the hyper-power iterative inversion method, which can be applied to both matrix inverses and pseudoinverses with guaranteed convergence; its factorized version also reduces its computational complexity. Although the hyper-power method does not reduce the complexity compared to direct matrix inversion, it converges quickly with high accuracy and strong numerical stability, and is conducive to parallel computation. These qualities make it a good candidate for matrix inversion in cell-free mMIMO system precoders.},

  abstract     = {Conventional direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation algorithms like MUSIC only allow localization of fewer number of sources than the number of physical sensors. In this paper, underdetermined azimuth localization (localizing more sources than the number of sensors) using arbitrary planar arrays has been proposed, using only second-order statistics of the received data. To achieve this, we utilize the difference coarray of the actual array and express the elements of the array covariance matrix as the signal received by the virtual sensors of the coarray. We explore the structure and geometry of the difference coarray of an &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$N$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -element planar array and show that the coarray can provide an increased degree-of-freedom (DOF) of &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\mathcal {O}(N^{2})$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; which enables underdetermined localization. Then, we extend the manifold separation (MS) technique to the coarray to express the coarray steering matrix in terms of a Vandermonde structured matrix by designing a signal independent coarray characteristic matrix. As the signal model of a coarray is a single snapshot model, the Vandermonde structure enables us to perform a spatial smoothing type operation to restore the rank of the coarray covariance matrix. This allows us to propose a novel subspace-based algorithm, which we call the coarrayMS-MUSIC, to perform underdetermined source localization using arbitrary planar arrays. We have also introduced the polynomial rooting version of our algorithm called the coarrayMS-rootMUSIC. Finally, we have conducted extensive numerical simulations to verify the effectiveness and usefulness of the proposed methods.},

However, addressing channel-estimation overheads caused by the large number of IRS elements remains a major challenge. In particular, these overheads increase proportionately with an increase in the number of IRS elements, thereby making it difficult to handle multiple IRSs. Therefore, we investigate a passive beamforming method with partial channel state information (CSI) in distributed IRS communication systems called selective reflection control (SRC). Specifically, the proposed method determines the associations between the IRS and user equipment (UE) to obtain the CSI of the associated IRS-UE links. Simulations were conducted, and the obtained results confirm that the proposed method based on SRC outperforms the benchmark method in terms of the user sum rate. Furthermore, the proposed method realizes robust transmissions against shielding owing to appropriate IRS–UE associations. Therefore, the proposed SRC achieves better communication performance with less channel estimation overheads, which is expected to accelerate large-scale IRS deployment.},

A benchmark scheme is firstly devised based on a direct extension of the conventional PTS-based OFDM scheme. Based on the characteristics of the near-optimal SCMA codebook designs reported in our previous work, a PTS-based SCMA-OFDM design is proposed by carefully determining the rotation angles of the SCMA codebooks, according to the adopted signal sub-constellations. A receiver which does not need the side information is further devised. Considering the phase ambiguity issue of the receiver, the PTS angles have been carefully refined. When compared to both the original scheme that does not consider PAPR reduction techniques and the benchmark scheme, the proposed scheme achieves a significantly enhanced PAPR performance with approximately the same error performance. In addition, a comparable PAPR performance, an improved error performance, and a lower computational complexity can be achieved when compared to the clipping-based SCMA-OFDM scheme reported in the previous literature.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we focus on the pilot-assisted transmission design for secure ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC) systems, which has not yet been studied in the existing literatures. In each transmission period of this system, the multi-antenna controller sends confidential URLLC messages integrated with artificial noise (AN) to a single-antenna actuator for some mission-critical operations (e.g., remote control), and while an unknown number of passive eavesdroppers attempt to intercept this confidential message in a non-colluding manner. Since the conventional ergodic secrecy capacity is not accurate to describe the maximal achievable secrecy rate of URLLC with short blocklength coding, we establish the concept of achievable effective secrecy rate (AESR) to measure the secrecy performance of our URLLC system, which is defined as the average number of information bits can be transmitted per channel use under given reliability and information leakage constraints. Due to the exact expression of AESR has an intractable form, we derive a closed-form approximation on the AESR to simplify the calculation, via leveraging the Laplace approximation and Gaussian-Chebyshev quadrature method. Following by this approximation, we propose an efficient two-dimensional search algorithm to determine the optimal transmission parameters that maximize the AESR, i.e., the training pilot length and the power allocation ratio between confidential data signals and AN. Furthermore, the asymptotic performance of AESR in the high-SNR regime is also analyzed to gain more insights. Numerical results validate the accuracy of theoretical approximations presented in this paper, and illustrate how the particular system parameters impact the AESR of our considered URLLC system.},

This paper proposes a task offloading and service replication scheme on local and remote MEC servers. The scheme minimizes the response time of all users while satisfying the delay requirements of user groups in traffic-heavy and multimedia-intense applications (e.g., online gaming, multimedia conferencing, augmenting reality). We formulate an integer linear problem that minimizes the average response time of all users while satisfying the time and time difference constraints of the user groups running the same applications. We then use linear relaxation programming using Lagrangian analysis and solve the problem using a numerical solver.

The constraints are used to control the dynamic range on the magnitude of each signal, to control variations in the transmit power from the individual antennas and the total energy of the signals. The considered problem is challenging as it is non-convex. To this end, we propose an iterative solution that incorporates the majoriztion-minimization(MM) and alternating direction method of multipliers(ADMM) frameworks. Our solution avoids the computationally expensive operations such as matrix inverse and eigenvalue decomposition. We provide numerical results to validate the proposed solution.

  abstract     = {Non-orthogonal communications are expected to play a key role in future wireless systems. In downlink transmissions, the data symbols are broadcast from a base station to different users, which are superimposed with different power to facilitate high-integrity detection using successive interference cancellation (SIC). However, SIC requires accurate knowledge of both the channel model and channel state information (CSI), which may be difficult to acquire. We propose a deep learning-aided SIC detector termed SICNet, which replaces the interference cancellation blocks of SIC by deep neural networks (DNNs). Explicitly, SICNet jointly trains its internal DNN-aided blocks for inferring the soft information representing the interfering symbols in a data-driven fashion, rather than using hard-decision decoders as in classical SIC. As a result, SICNet reliably detects the superimposed symbols in the downlink of non-orthogonal systems without requiring any prior knowledge of the channel model, while being less sensitive to CSI uncertainty than its model-based counterpart. SICNet is also robust to changes in the number of users and to their power allocation. Furthermore, SICNet learns to produce accurate soft outputs, which facilitates improved soft-input error correction decoding compared to model-based SIC. Finally, we propose an online training method for SICNet under block fading, which exploits the channel decoding for accurately recovering online data labels for retraining, hence, allowing it to smoothly track the fading envelope without requiring dedicated pilots. Our numerical results show that SICNet approaches the performance of classical SIC under perfect CSI, while outperforming it under realistic CSI uncertainty.},

First, upper bounds on the average achievable rates of the two users are derived. Then, channel hardening is shown to occur in the proposed system, based on which we derive approximations of the average achievable rates of the two users. The analytical results illustrate that the proposed upper bound and approximation on the average achievable rates are asymptotically equivalent in the number of elements. Furthermore, it is proved that the asymptotic equivalence also holds for the average achievable rates with correlated and uncorrelated channels. Additionally, we extend the analysis by evaluating the average achievable rates for IOS assisted orthogonal multiple access (OMA) and IOS assisted multi-user NOMA scenarios. Simulation results corroborate the theoretical analysis and demonstrate that: i) low-precision elements with only two-bit phase adjustment can achieve the performance close to the ideal continuous phase shifting scheme; ii) The average achievable rates with correlated channels and uncorrelated channels are asymptotically equivalent in the number of elements; iii) IOS-assisted NOMA does not always perform better than OMA due to the reconfigurability of IOS in different time slots.},

  abstract     = {Radar-embedded communication (REC) is a new type of covert communication whereby communication signals are embedded in radar backscattered echoes. Conventional REC waveform design strategies generally involve transforming the radar sampling sequence into a square matrix that can be eigenvalue decomposed; however, it may lose some original characteristics of the radar signal during this process. In this paper, we propose two REC waveform design methods based on singular value decomposition (SVD), namely, SVD-NDP (non-dominant-processing waveform based on SVD) and SVD-SNDP (shaped-non-dominant-processing waveform based on SVD), and derive the similarities between the radar signal and the proposed waveforms. We then simulate the anti-detection performance, anti-interception performance, and communication reliability of the proposed waveforms and analyze the degrees of freedom and computational complexity of their design. The results show that, compared with conventional REC waveforms, the proposed waveforms could improve communication reliability without sacrificing low probability of intercept (LPI) performance and at least double the design degrees of freedom. SVD-NDP and SVD-SNDP algorithms can reduce computational complexity by more than 30% compared with conventional waveform design algorithms based on eigenvalue decomposition when the number of communication waveforms (symbols) is set to 4 (2 bits), and the proportion of the dominant subspace is set to 50%.},

In this scheme, a user is served by a cluster of Small Base Stations (SBSs) that cache contents. If the user-requested content is missing in its cache, the SBS retrieves it from the central processor (backhaul link) and the MBS (wireless broadcast). We minimize the total delay of this system. We thus optimize user grouping, decoding order, RS variables, BS clustering, and beamforming subject to the transmit power and backhaul capacity constraints. This process formulates a non-convex problem, which we decouple into three subproblems. First, we must pair users to reduce intra-group interference. We thus develop a Low-Complexity User Pairing (LCUP) algorithm. Second, we optimize the decoding order to minimize the broadcast link delay. We, therefore, propose a Dynamic Delay-based Decoding Order Update (D &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$^{3}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; OU) algorithm. Third, we jointly design the RS variables, beamforming, and BS clustering. We use surrogate optimization via the Quadratic Transform (QT), Woodbury matrix identity, and Taylor expansion. We then recast this problem to a Two-Tier Alternating (TTA) problem, which we solve with closed-form (outer tier) and convex (inner tier) formulations. We integrate these algorithms to propose an overall algorithm. It achieves significant performance gains and a 3-fold reduction in time-complexity over the standard Semi-Definite Relaxation (SDR)-based algorithm and several benchmark schemes.},

In this paper, a novel tensor-based uplink channel estimation scheme is proposed for multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO) systems over time-varying channels. In the proposed scheme, a low-overhead pilot transmission scheme is designed to track the varying channel. The received uplink signal at the base station (BS) is formulated as a third-order tensor which admits a CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) model. The CP decomposition issue is then solved using blind matrix decomposition, in which the special structures of signals in the time dimension and the matrix subspace are utilized. By exploiting low-rank structure of the signal tensor, the channel parameters (angles of arrival/departure, path gains, and Doppler shifts) are estimated from the factor matrices. Moreover, the proposed scheme is theoretically analyzed and it is guaranteed with low pilot overhead. Simulation results verify that the proposed scheme can outperform the compressed sensing (CS) based scheme and the iteration-based scheme in terms of accuracy and stability. The uniqueness of the proposed scheme is also verified in our simulation.},

  abstract     = {Although Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are capable of significantly improving the information security by detecting the eavesdropper&#39;s location, their limited energy motivates our research to propose a secure and energy efficient scheme. Thanks to the common-message philosophy introduced by Rate-Splitting (RS), we no longer have to allocate a portion of the transmit power to radiate Artificial Noise (AN), and yet both the Energy Efficiency (EE) and secrecy can be improved. Hence we define and study the Secrecy Energy Efficiency (SEE) of a multi-carrier multi-UAV network, in which Cooperative Rate-Splitting (CRS) is employed by each multi-antenna UAV Base-Station (UAV-BS) for protecting their downlink transmissions against an external eavesdropper ( &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$Eve$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; ). Furthermore, we consider the challenging scenario in which CRS is employed by each multi-antenna UAV-BS to protect their corresponding downlink transmissions against an external &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$Eve$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; . We further consider a difficult scenario in terms of security in which only imperfect channel state information of &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$Eve$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; is available at the Tx. Accordingly, we conceive a robust secure resource allocation algorithm, which maximizes the SEE by jointly optimizing both the user association matrix and the network parameter allocation problem, including the RS precoders, time slot sharing and power allocation. Due to the non-convexity of the problem, it is decoupled into a pair of convex sub-problems. Firstly, new two-tier intra-cell optimization problems are formulated for achieving &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\xi$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -optimal solutions by iterative block coordinate decent programming.

  abstract     = {Massive MIMO is a promising air interface technology for 5G wireless communications. Such antenna systems offer capabilities to utilize channel correlations to create beams suitable for user specific transmissions. Most of the prior research is devoted to user-specific transmission in such systems, where a narrow beam is formed towards a user to improve its reception. Meanwhile, public-channel transmission to multiple users at once by means of broad beams has been understudied. In this paper, we introduce the concept of array-size invariant (ASI) beamforming, enabling generation of broad beams from very large antenna arrays where all elements are transmitting at maximum power. The ASI technique offers the possibility to achieve a perfectly flat array factor by exploiting the additional degree of freedom coming from the dual-polarization beamforming. The proposed technique is applicable to both uniform linear and rectangular arrays. The benefits of the method are shown by means of several numerical examples. In particular, the practical usefulness of the ASI beamforming, in terms of coverage and energy efficiency, is illustrated on an example of designing a cell-specific broad beam for public-channel transmission in a realistic network deployment.},

Millimeter-wave (mmWave) can achieve high data transmission rates, but it is accompanied by high propagation loss and vulnerability to blockage. To address this issue, developments of directional antennas and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) enhance the robustness of the mmWave train-ground communication system. In this paper, we propose a UAV and MRs relay assistance (UMRA) algorithm to effectively overcome link blockage, which can maximize the number of transmission flows on the premise of meeting QoS requirements and channel qualities. First, we formulate a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem for UAV trajectory design and transmission scheduling in the full-duplex (FD) mode. Then, in UMRA, the relay decision algorithm and transmission scheduling algorithm based on graph theory are proposed, which make a good tradeoff between computation complexity and system performance. Extensive simulation results show that a suitable UAV position will greatly improve the performance of the UMRA algorithm and make it close to the optimal solution. Compared with the other two existing benchmark schemes, with the high channel quality requirements and large-area blockage, UMRA can greatly improve the number of completed flows and system throughput.},

Traditional localization method based on LOS measurement is no longer available which provides lower localization accuracy in Non-Line of Sight (NLOS) environments. In response to this problem, this paper proposes a joint localization algorithm for scatterers and target user based on indoor prior information in NLOS scenarios. The algorithm makes use of the prior localization information of the access point (AP) and the wall to determine the position of the scatterers and target user simultaneously. Since the established constrained optimization problem is non-convex which is a difference of convex (DC) problem, it is transformed into a convex one based on a Taylor series expansion (TSE) method before it is solved. At the same time, as only a single AP signal can be received normally, the proposed method is then extended to the scenario with only one AP. Simulation and real-world testing results both show that not only the proposed method based on multiple APs, but also the method based on a single AP achieve high positioning accuracy, which are better than the existing positioning methods mentioned in this article as well.},

  abstract     = {As millimeter wave (mmWave) technology becomes more integrated into today&#39;s communication infrastructure, its application to mobile scenarios has attracted considerable interests. In particular, mmWave technology is one of the leading candidates in Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) community to address the ever-rising data exchange demand from vehicles. However, the inherent directionality of the technology poses challenges to peer discovery and transmission scheduling in typical V2X scenarios, causing significant loss of network capacity. To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel sub-6 GHz V2X-assisted synchronous mmWave communication scheduler in this paper. The sub-6 GHz channel serves as control channel for mmWave scheduling. The scheduler carefully considers data importance and freshness in determining communication schedule, such that network utility across mmWave links is maximized. We formulate the scheduling problem into an integer linear programming (ILP) problem. However, ILP problem is NP-hard and has exponential computational complexity for the worst cases. We then develop a scheduling algorithm, maximum weight matching based iterative algorithm (MWMIA), that operates in polynomial time with performance guarantees for the NP-hard ILP, by leveraging structural properties of link conflicts. Comparative simulation studies verify the effectiveness of our scheduler against other solutions.},

  abstract     = {Millimeter-wave vehicle-to-vehicle communication systems with multiple-input multiple-output antenna array have drawn significant attention because it is expected to satisfy the growing bandwidth requirements for the cooperative intelligent transportation systems. However, maintaining high-quality communication links between communicating vehicles without high overhead is a challenging problem due to the high mobility of vehicles. In this paper, we propose a beam management algorithm with spatially distributed antenna subarrays instead of a single co-located antenna array. Unlike existing methods, we use distributed antenna subarrays to exploit the geometric relationship of the beam directions and the relative distance between communicating vehicles. We reduce the beam alignment errors by minimizing the sum of squared errors between the estimated beam direction after the beam training process and the refined beam direction derived from the measured position and velocity data. Additionally, a position data request protocol is devised to reduce the beam refining errors. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed beam management algorithm successfully reduces the beam alignment errors and it is robust to position and velocity measurement errors.},

  abstract     = {We analyze the secrecy performance of a wireless system with limited feedback, where the channel state information (CSI) is imperfectly known at a multi-antenna source. In order to mitigate the adverse effects of limited feedback and eavesdropper attack on secrecy transmission, we propose the quantized secrecy precoding (QSP) oriented adaptive transmit antenna selection (ATAS) scheme denoted as QSP-ATAS, where the transmit antennas with poor channel quality are inactivated by adjusting the channel gain threshold. Besides, the conventional single transmit antenna selection (STAS) scheme without secrecy precoding (NSP-STAS), where only the optimal transmit antenna has the chance to be selected for transmission, is considered as a baseline. Since that both the number of active transmit antennas and the number of quantization bits affect the quantization error, we define the effective secrecy throughput as the difference between the secrecy data rate and feedback rate to evaluate the system performance. We conduct an effective secrecy throughput analysis for both QSP-ATAS and NSP-STAS schemes and show the existence of the maximal effective secrecy throughput of proposed QSP-ATAS scheme. Furthermore, an optimization analysis of the QSP-ATAS scheme is carried out for the sake of further improving the effective secrecy throughput with regard to the channel gain threshold. Numerical simulation results demonstrate that our proposed QSP-ATAS scheme performs better than the conventional NSP-STAS scheme in terms of the effective secrecy throughput.},

The objective is to cooperatively optimize the active transmit beamforming at the PTx and passive reflecting beamforming at the RIS to minimize the PTx&#39;s transmit power, subject to the signal-to-noise ratio constraints of primary and RIS transmissions. A new optimization problem is formulated where the RIS phase shifts are not only related to the channel state information (CSI), but also related to its message. First, we consider the perfect CSI setup to draw useful insights into the cooperative beamforming design between the PTx and RIS. Then, the worst-case robust beamforming design is carried out under the imperfect CSI setup. In particular, we take into account the imperfect successive interference cancellation at the PRx. Finally, simulation results show the effectiveness of the RIS information transfer and the integration of RIS into a symbiotic radio system can significantly improve the performance.},

  abstract     = {This paper provides a comprehensive performance comparison between a current robust military waveform; namely, MIL-STD-188-110D, Waveform 0, and a filter bank multicarrier spread-spectrum (FBMC-SS) waveform proposed for communications through ionospheric/skywave HF channels. Waveform 0 is effectively a direct sequence spread spectrum waveform that uses Walsh multi-codes to enhance the information transmission rate. It may thus be referred to as Walsh-DSSS. FBMC-SS, on the other hand, makes use of filter banks to provide excellent performance when the received signal is subject to partial band interference. Successful application of FBMC-SS for communications across skywave HF channels has been previously demonstrated, both theoretically and through experimental work. However, very little has been done to contrast FBMC-SS against Walsh-DSSS. The goal of this paper is to first add new features to FBMC-SS to bring it on par with Walsh-DSSS. These features include: (i), introduction of multi-codes that achieve a comparable (or better) data rate to Walsh-DSSS; and (ii), addition of a scrambling step applied to the multi-codes to make the receiver detection robust against widely spread multipaths. With this established, in the second part of the paper, we examine the performance of the developed FBMC-SS against Walsh-DSSS when both are applied for communications across skywave HF channels. The two waveforms are compared both through a theoretical study and through experimental works across several skywave channels ranging from hundreds to thousands of kilometers.},

  abstract     = {With low-cost energy consumption, the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technique is a potential solution to the real-time data processing for intelligent transportation systems (ITSs). In this paper, an intelligent transmissive surface is introduced into the vehicular communications, enabling vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) signals to penetrate the intelligent RIS to access the base station (BS) on the opposite side of the vehicle. Considering that the vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication reuses the spectrum spanned for V2I link, we investigate the ergodic capacity optimization problem for the vehicle performing V2I communications with the assistance of RIS, while meeting the low-latency and high-reliability requirements of the V2V link. The RIS transmission coefficients and power allocation of vehicles are jointly optimized, for the management of the desired and undesired vehicular communication links. Moreover, the expression of optimal phase shifts is derived in a closed-form, which reveals that the performance gain brought by RIS is proportional to the number of intelligent elements, while inversely proportional to the distance from vehicle-to-BS, in a quadratic form. Moreover, in the case of discrete phase shifts, an intelligent algorithm is proposed for the beamforming design at RIS. Afterwards, with the objective to maximize the ergodic capacity of the V2I link, the optimal power allocation is also proposed. Simulation results confirm the accuracy of the proposed resource allocation strategy, and that the system performance in terms of the ergodic V2I capacity can be significantly improved by the RIS.},

  abstract     = {Millimeter wave (mmWave) frequency spectrum offers orders of magnitude greater spectrum to mitigate the severe spectrum shortage in conventional cellular bands. To overcome the high propagation loss in the mmWave band, massive multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) can be adopted at both transmitter and receiver to provide large beamforming gains. At the same time, hybrid architecture is applied to reduce the huge power consumption caused by devices operating at radio frequency (RF). However, because of the hybrid architecture and large number of antennas, it is hard to obtain the channel state information (CSI) which is crucial for obtaining desirable beamforming gains. Off-grid error and sparsity pattern (SP) estimation error are two main limiting factors of the performance of most existing compressive sensing (CS) based channel estimation (CE) algorithms. Off-grid error presents when the true angle does not lie on the discretized angle grid of mmWave channel in the spatial domain. In this paper, we first propose a fast Bayesian matching pursuit method with ‘virtual sparsity’ to improve the accuracy of SP estimation and name it as the improved Bayesian matching pursuit (IBMP). Then an enhanced algorithm, named off-grid IBMP (OG-IBMP), is developed to mitigate the off-grid problem, followed by a theoretical analysis of OG-IBMP. This method iteratively updates the selected grid points and updates the corresponding parameters based on the maximum a posteriori (MAP) criterion. Numerical simulations are performed to validate our theoretical analysis and evaluate the performance of the proposed method. Compared to other existing methods, the results show that our proposed OG-IBMP algorithm greatly reduces the off-grid error and significantly enhances the accuracy of the SP estimation with low computational complexity.},

During active states, energy injection is applied to the IPT compensation tank which increases the IPT resonant current; during the zero state; no injection occurs, and the resonant current of IPT tank is in free oscillation. The FPGA-based IPT power controller is designed to be applied on single stage AC-AC matrix converter which allows direct connection to the main grid without any need of DC conversion; the controller is also operational in dual-stage AC-DC-AC topologies. The proposed IPT power controller is self-tuned without any need to wireless communication channel and offers more simplicity, higher speed, ease of implementation and lower cost.

  abstract     = {Vehicular social networking is expected to become a reality soon, where secure and privacy-preserving identity management is a prerequisite. Various organizations and studies have recommended using Vehicular Public-key Infrastructure (VPKI) to securely and privately manage vehicles&#39; identities. However, the existing VPKI schemes still do not deal with identity management in vehicular social networking. In this work, we propose a Privacy-Preserving Identity Management (PPTIM) scheme for vehicular social networking to securely and privately manage vehicles&#39; social identities. PPTIM builds on the transparency log (distributed ledger) proposals for web PKI, but it addresses challenges specific to vehicular social networking. All pseudo-social identities, pseudonym certificates issued against pseudo-social identities, revocation process, and revocation status validation are conducted on a transparency log. With an efficient data structure named the Accumulation Tree (AT), we extend the conventional transparency log to offer trustworthy pseudonym certificate validation without relying on the Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs). In addition, PPTIM strengthens the security of vehicular social networking by protecting vehicles to a greater extent from being duped by malicious pseudonym certificates through logging and constant monitoring. Finally, performance and security analysis show the cost-effectiveness and security of PPTIM.},

  abstract     = {Recent research showcased several cyber-attacks against unmodified licensed vehicles, demonstrating the vulnerability of their internal networks. Many solutions have already been proposed by industry and academia, aiming to detect and prevent cyber-attacks targeting in-vehicle networks. The majority of these proposals borrow security algorithms and techniques from the classical ICT domain, and in many cases they do not consider the inherent limitations of legacy automotive protocols and resource-constrained microcontrollers. This paper proposes DAGA , an anomaly detection algorithm for in-vehicle networks exploiting &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$n-$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; gram analysis. DAGA only uses sequences of CAN message IDs for the definition of the &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$n-$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; grams used in the detection process, without requiring the content of the payload or other CAN message fields. The DAGA framework allows the creation of detection models characterized by different memory footprints, allowing their deployment on microcontrollers with different hardware constraints. Experimental results based on three prototype implementations of DAGA showcase the trade off between hardware requirements and detection performance. DAGA outperforms the state-of-the-art detectors on the most performing microcontrollers, and can execute with lower performance on simple microcontrollers that cannot support the vast majority of IDS approaches proposed in literature. As additional contributions, we publicly release the full dataset and our reference DAGA implementations.},

  abstract     = {Movement intention inference for non-cooperative evasive targets in urban environments is difficult due to the lack of a priori knowledge of the possible target&#39;s movement intentions set. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a multi-level intention inference approach to construct and infer the movement intentions of a non-cooperative evasive target in urban environments. Firstly, to reasonably represent the possible movement intentions of the target, we decompose the target&#39;s movement intention into different regions at multiple levels according to the urban environment and the location of the target. At the same time, we divide the region at each level into several different sub-regions to represent the different movement intentions of the target at that level. Thus, the possible target&#39;s movement intentions are constructed as different regions at different levels where the target intends to go. Secondly, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based intention inference models are developed, which can fuse the urban environment information and the observed target&#39;s trajectory to infer the target&#39;s movement intentions. Extensive simulation experiments results show that our proposed multi-level intention inference models can accurately and timely (with 79% accuracy and 84% timeliness) infer the region where the target intends to go when the possible destinations of the target are unknowable and maintain a robust inference performance when the target&#39;s behavior changes.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a model fusion method (MFM) is proposed for online state of charge (SOC) and state of power (SOP) co-estimation of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) in electric vehicles (EVs). Firstly, a particle swarm optimization-genetic algorithm (PSO-GA) method is cooperated with a 2-RC CPE fractional-order model (FOM) to construct battery open-circuit voltage (OCV)-SOC curve, which only relies on a part of dynamic load profile without the prior knowledge of an initial SOC. Secondly, a dual extended Kalman filter (DEKF) algorithm based on a 1-RC model is employed to identify the model parameters and estimate battery SOC with the extracted OCV-SOC curve. Furthermore, battery polarization dynamics in a SOP prediction window is analyzed from two aspects: (1) self-recovery; and (2) current excitation. They are separately simulated using 2-RC CPE FOM and 1-RC model, and then integrated through a model fusion for online SOP estimation, which enables an analytical expression of battery peak charge/discharge current in a prediction window without weakening the nonlinear characteristic of FOM. Experimental results demonstrate the improved performance of the proposed MFM for online discharge SOP estimation, where the mean absolute error and root mean square error are only 0.288 W and 0.35 W, respectively, under the urban dynamometer driving schedule profile.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we propose an ecological predictive cruise control method for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) using data-driven predicted leading vehicle speed in a car-following scenario. Many existing studies assume that the leading vehicle&#39;s behavior is known when planning the trajectory of the ego vehicle. Unfortunately, predicting the future behavior of adjacent vehicles is extremely uncertain and inaccurate for use in control. To overcome this, we adopt the vector autoregressive model (VAR) that is well suited for generating simultaneous forecasts of the response variables when predicting the short-term behavior of the vehicle ahead. As many human drivers behave similarly in a car-following situation, vehicle connectivity is specifically used to drop hints of the behaviors of the cars following the connected car. Once the leading vehicle&#39;s future trajectory is predicted, the ego vehicle is controlled in a way that minimizes energy consumption by optimizing its speed trajectory while remaining safe. Through simulation case studies, we demonstrate that our approach can achieve improved energy efficiency considerably than the conventional strategy that cannot predict the speed of vehicles ahead. Given the recent market penetration of vehicle connectivity technologies and advanced driving assistance systems (ADAS), the proposed method is expected to have a high commercialization potential.},

  abstract     = {Responsive and highly controlled autonomous vehicles (AVs) on the road easily form platoons with small inter-vehicle gaps to increase traffic throughput and reduce energy consumption. Unlike human drivers, AVs typically employ discrete quantization signals and only generate finite discrete acceleration. Finite discrete acceleration easily causes unstable inter-vehicle gaps and inter-vehicle collisions, especially when there are inaccurate quantization parameters due to quantizer aging. Based on the backstepping technique, this paper proposes the cooperative constrained control algorithm under unknown quantization parameters for AVs with nonuniform input quantization and motion uncertainties. The control laws of each AV in the platoon only depend on the state information of its consecutive AVs. The position trajectories of consecutive AVs are constructed as inter-vehicle collision-free constraints to avoid emergency braking and inter-vehicle collisions. In addition, the consistent characteristic of two types of nonuniform quantizers (i.e., logarithmic quantizers and hysteresis quantizers) is proposed, and unknown disturbances in vehicle motion are compensated. The Lyapunov based local stability and string stability are proved. Numerical simulation shows that the control algorithm is applicable to AVs with either logarithmic quantizers or hysteresis quantizers. Compared with the previous control algorithms without considering input quantization and inter-vehicle collision avoidance, the control algorithm proposed reduces inter-vehicle spacing errors, avoids high acceleration, and avoids inter-vehicle collisions.},

  abstract     = {Consensus-based Speed Advisory System (CSAS) is used to recommend a consensus speed to a group of vehicles for specific application purposes, such as minimizing emissions or energy consumption. To remedy data privacy concerns for speed advisory services, the latest works have investigated how to get an optimal speed in a privacy-preserving manner. However, almost all the designs are based on a centralized architecture, which could still meet service trust issues, such as that a random speed could be recommended when the central server meets cyber incursion attacks. To address the problem, in this paper we propose BSAS, a trustworthy and privacy-preserving CSAS over the blockchain. Specifically, BSAS follows a fully decentralized architecture with cryptographic primitives to guarantee service trust and data privacy. Moreover, to encourage vehicles to participate in the service computing process, a value-driven incentive mechanism is also employed. We present the detailed design and implementation of BSAS, and our emulation results show that the proposed BSAS can achieve promising system performance in terms of real-time speed recommendation in a trustworthy and privacy-preserving way.},

  abstract     = {In vehicular networks, authentication technology provides a basic security means to achieve trusted communication between legitimate vehicles. Revocation checking for vehicle certificates is an indispensable procedure in the process of authentication to protect vehicular networks from attacks by non-legitimate vehicles. However, revocation checking introduces procedures that requires additional time to process which challenges latency-sensitive applications in vehicular networks. This challenge grows more evidently when considering the factor of privacy preservation. In this paper, we propose to offload partial revocation task to network edges to lighten the revocation process in vehicles. Particularly, we design a method to achieve decentralized Global Certificate Revocation List (GCRL) management in network edges using permissioned blockchain technologies. In the method, both tamper-proof property and quick synchronization of the GCRL are guaranteed. Besides, our method can detect illegal revocation behaviours by validation in vehicles. Finally, we build a prototype of our proposed solution based on Hyperledger Fabric, and compare with Proof-of-Work scheme in terms of blockchain synchronization latency performance.},

  abstract     = {One of the most challenging problems in autonomous driving is trajectory planning for lane changes. Conventional trajectory planning is generally realized by optimizing a specific cost function. However, the model performance required for different scenarios makes it repetitive and time-consuming to tune the cost function. Furthermore, to ensure driving safety, comfort as well as traffic efficiency, it is essential to interact with other vehicles by predicting their driving intentions. Therefore, this paper proposes a segmented-updated lane-change trajectory planning method for autonomous vehicles on closed highways. The maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) algorithm for human demonstration learning and the long short-term memory and Bayesian network (LSTM-BN)-based model for target vehicles&#39; driving intentions are applied. Three contributions are made in this work: 1) The LSTM-BN is used to judge the intentions of surrounding vehicles based on its historical information to inform lane-change trajectory planning. 2) Different feature-based cost functions of the IRL algorithm are designed according to different lane-change scenarios, which enhances its adaptability to different scenarios. 3) Segmented-updated trajectory planning is used to dynamically optimize trajectories via an online optimization process, which reduces the model&#39;s limitations and improves overall lane-change performance. Finally, simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed method has strong generalization ability, reliable accuracy, and can adjust lane-change trajectories reasonably according to the driving intentions of surrounding vehicles.},

  abstract     = {The application of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) to multi-layer multicast video streaming is envisioned to address the explosively growing demand for capacity which is dominated mostly by multimedia content. In this paper, a joint power allocation and subgrouping scheme is developed to enhance the performance of NOMA-based multi-layer multicast systems. An optimization problem is formulated to maximize the overall sum multicast rate whilst satisfying the maximum transmission power and proportional rate constraints. Due to the complexity of the optimization problem, we first derive two power allocation techniques for the 2-layer case considering arbitrary subgrouping which are based on the iterative implementation and closed-form analysis, respectively. We then generalize the low-complexity closed-form solution for the general multi-layer case. This scheme successively allocates power to each layer stream while assuring that the minimum target rate and proportionality are guaranteed, particularly for the transmission rate of the high-priority base layer stream. A sub-optimal joint power allocation and subgrouping scheme is also designed by incorporating the power allocation scheme into the proposed iterative subgrouping techniques. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the power allocation and subgrouping schemes in enhancing the sum multicast rate performance. In addition, the proposed power allocation scheme ensures substantially higher rates for the base layer stream, which is crucial in robust delivery of standard quality video to all users.},

The key feature of the interior PMV machines is to place the middle iron pole sandwiched by PMs in the slots between the salient rotor poles. As a result, three types of interior PMV machines with different PM arrangements, namely two V-type PMV (V-PMV) and one U-type PMV (U-PMV) machines, are developed. Due to the improved flux modulation effect, the V-PMV and U-PMV machines can respectively provide over 20% and 30% higher torque density than the conventional PMV counterpart, under a high power factor level of 0.86. The working principle is illustrated based on the field modulation theory. A comparative study among the conventional PMV and interior PMV machines is conducted in terms of electromagnetic performances and dynamic responses, after performing global optimization of design parameters. Finally, a prototype is manufactured and tested for experimental validations.},

Numerous researches have been accomplished to solve the CAV scheduling problem at the intersection scenario. However, most of them focus on intersections where lane-changing behavior is prohibited, which is impractical for real-world implementation. To address this problem, this paper proposes a novel cooperation framework to solve the CAV arrival scheduling problem in unsignalized intersections where lane changing behavior is permitted. In the first stage, an iterative framework is proposed to solve target assignment and path planning problems, which prevents the deadlock of multiple CAVs with different target lanes. In the second stage, a graph-based minimum clique cover method is then established to obtain the optimal scheduling plan for the CAVs with a low calculation burden. Extensive numerical simulations for different numbers of vehicles and traffic volumes validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

This is also the first work to investigate the impact of finite block length on platoon communication. The optimal finite block length coding rate under automatic repeat request retransmission is obtained. A subchannel multiplexing criterion is proposed and closed-form expressions for the optimal transmission powers of the platoon manager and its subchannel multiplexing partner are derived.

All previous propagation parameters are also found assuming measurements with similar transmitter locations come from the same channel conditions. This assumption is tested.

First, we formulate the optimization problem where the objective is to maximize the minimum achievable rate of trains by jointly optimizing the trajectory of UAV and the phase-shift of IRS. Due to the non-convex nature of the formulated problem, it is decomposed into two subproblems: IRS phase-shift problem and UAV trajectory optimization problem.

In platooning, vehicles automatically drive following a leader vehicle keeping a small inter-vehicle distance based on the shared status information via vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications. Therefore, in order to ensure platoon safety and stability, other vehicles’ status information must be timely updated and the platooning messages (i.e., beacons) should be reliably and timely exchanged. In this paper, we propose an age of information (AoI) based beacon transmission (AoIBT) scheme where vehicles request additional beacon transmissions with the consideration of AoI for reducing delay in updating other vehicles’ status caused by beacon loss. Evaluation results demonstrate that AoIBT has significant performance improvement by up to 180% in various platoon environments compared with conventional schemes.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies the collision-resolution random access (CRRA) protocol for information update systems with age of information (AoI) requirements. AoI measures the information freshness, defined as the time elapsed since the generation of the last successfully received update. When a large number of users contend and send update packets to a common access point (AP), conventional random access protocols such as slotted Aloha (SA) simply ignore the collisions and inform the users to contend for the wireless channel again, thus leading to high average AoI due to the high collision probability. This paper argues that resolving collisions can improve the information freshness. When a collision occurs in CRRA, only the collided users enter a collision resolution procedure (CRP) to contend and access the channel until all of their update packets are received successfully. In particular, the time to receive a user’s update packet in the CRP is random, which complicates the AoI analysis. This paper theoretically analyze the average AoI of CRRA. Simulations show that CRRA significantly reduces the average AoI of SA, especially when update packets have a large payload. Furthermore, CRRA is more robust against the estimation error of the number of random-access users, and it is thus a promising solution to networks with time-varying traffic.},

The energy efficiency (EE) of the secondary networks (SN) is also provided. Moreover, a simple transmit power scheme is proposed to enhance the performance of the SN and guarantee the quality-of-service (QoS) of the primary network (PN). The trends of the introduced closed-form performance metrics are then examined versus important network parameters allowing for the optimization of those parameters.

To address this, fast beamforming schemes with precise direction-of-arrival (DOA) can achieve effective channel gain and improve interference mitigation. In this paper, we propose a novel radial-basis function neural network (RBFNN)-based method for the multi-DOA tracking, in which the RBFNN is trained by the location-based prior information. Consequently, the DOA tracking problem is transformed into an RBFNN with trained input/output pairs. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme in terms of complexity and accuracy is verified by simulation results. Finally, the impact of the shapes of the array on estimation accuracy is also discussed.},

Therefore, in the binary hypothesis test framework, we consider the timeliness of Willie’s detection in covert communications for the first time. Specifically, we consider Willie adopting a truncated one-sided sequential probability ratio test (TOSPRT). By analogy with the KL divergence in the FSS detection framework, we demonstrate that the Chernoff information is a correct and reasonable metric as the covert constraint. The key indicators of the three-node model of finite blocklength covert communications are analyzed. Further, to maximize the communication rate between Alice and the receiver Bob, we optimize the transmission power and blocklength of Alice subject to the covert constraint. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show that the maximum covert information can be transmitted when the blocklength reaches the maximum.},

In contrast, traffic base stations (TBSs) on the ground forming the user plane (UP) are used for transmitting high-speed data under the blanket of the CP. To study the performance of SCN based on CUPS, especially CP’s coverage, we present an analytical model in this paper. Based on stochastic geometry, we derive the CP’s coverage probability under Rician fading, and UP’s energy efficiency (UP-EE) under Rayleigh fading. Moreover, the letter is dependent on the successful coverage of CP. Numerical results show that when the traffic load is high, the CP’s coverage probability increases with the increasing density of the CBSs. We also found that the maximal CP’s coverage probability can be achieved by optimizing the height of the CBSs while achieving a high UP-EE within CP’s coverage.},

Both the complexity analysis and simulation results indicate that the proposed precoder has very low computational complexity while still performing favorably. Because symbol-level precoders perform precoding on a symbol-by-symbol basis, they need to be of low complexity in their real world use.

Moreover, we formulate a min-max prioritized delay problem for non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-based multi-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) emergency networks, where the powers of all users are concurrently optimized to balance prioritized delay among users while suppressing multi-user interference introduced by NOMA and multiple UAVs. The problem is found to be non-convex, and we propose the substitution-decomposition-scaling-block successive upper bound minimization (SDS-BSUM) algorithm to address this issue. Specifically, the originally-formulated problem is first transformed into a standard form through variable substitution , followed by problem decomposition into single-UAV subproblems through exploiting its separable structure, and the scaling of non-convex constraints into tight convex ones. Finally, the converted problem is fitted into BSUM for solving. Simulation results reveal that compared with the existing schemes, the proposed SDS-BSUM not only reduces the prioritized delay by up to 70 &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\%$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; , but also achieves an excellent delay fairness commensurate with users’ priorities.},

  abstract     = {Although the frequency-division duplex (FDD) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system can offer high spectral and energy efficiency, it requires to feedback the downlink channel state information (CSI) from users to the base station (BS), in order to fulfill the precoding design at the BS. However, the large dimension of CSI matrices in the massive MIMO system makes the CSI feedback very challenging, and it is urgent to compress the feedback CSI. To this end, this paper proposes a novel dilated convolution based CSI feedback network, namely D ilated C hannel R econstruction Net work (DCRNet). Specifically, the dilated convolutions are used to enhance the receptive field (RecF) of the proposed DCRNet without increasing the convolution size. Moreover, advanced encoder and decoder blocks are designed to improve the reconstruction performance and reduce computational complexity as well. Numerical results are presented to show the superiority of the proposed DCRNet over the conventional networks. In particular, compared to the state-of-the-arts (SOTA) networks, the proposed DCRNet can achieve almost the same performance while reduce floating point operations (FLOPs) by about 30%.},

  abstract     = {In the view of spatial statistical average, when users are associated with their nearest small base stations (SBSs), they are mainly interfered by their second closest SBSs, especially for edge users. To reduce inter-cell interference (ICI) caused by the second closest SBSs, a distributed joint spectrum resource allocation strategy with power control in the downlink of one-tier ultra-dense networks (UDNs) is proposed in this paper. According to the distance from users to their nearest SBSs, users are divided into inner users and edge users. We then try to make the subchannel randomly allocated so they be different from that of edge users of their second closest SBS. Meanwhile the transmission power of SBSs on different subchannels is adjusted. Using stochastic geometry we derive the analytical expressions of the meta distribution of signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) to obtain more fine-grained information such as the mean and variance of conditional success probability, the local delay. Furthermore, we revise and redefine the area spectrum efficiency (ASE) and energy efficiency (EE) to accurately evaluate the benefits. Compared with the traditional random resource allocation strategy, which does not exploit resource allocation and interference coordination scheme, the proposed strategy can balance the performance of users and improve the whole network EE. Our analytical results are validated through simulation.},

However, existing secure and privacy-preserving schemes for vehicular communications face some challenges, e.g., fast verification of signatures and certificates, reducing the storage/transmission overheads, avoiding the dependence on ideal tamper-proof devices. In this paper, we propose a hybrid and hierarchical aggregation-verification scheme for efficient verification of certificates and signatures on safety messages in VANET. In our scheme, short-term anonymous certificates and aggregate signatures are employed to guarantee the security and privacy of the VANET system. A novel hybrid aggregation-verification technique is proposed to firstly aggregate the signatures in different certificates and signatures on safety messages into fixed length aggregate signature and then verify the aggregate signature with very short delay. To the best of our knowledge, this paper achieves signature aggregation and verification of such kind for the first time. Further, our scheme also enables hierarchical aggregation-verification of certificates and signatures in VANET.},

FD BA relaying offers high spectral efficiency but it does not change the buffer states, while HD relaying offers the ability to change the buffer states, which can be exploited to minimize the outage probability and the average delay by controlling the queue length of the relays. Unlike the existing hybrid BA relaying schemes and opportunistic relying schemes, the proposed scheme considers the average buffering delay and uses probabilistic relay selection (RS) instead of using a fixed RS policy. It probabilistically prioritizes the selection of one of the FD and HD modes over the other. Markov chain (MC) theory is used to model the considered system and derive the throughput, average delay and outage probability as functions of the prioritizing probabilities. Based on the buffer and average channel states, the prioritizing probabilities are determined such that the overall average delay is minimized using the accelerated proximal gradient method. As compared to the existing HD, opportunistic, and hybrid BA relaying schemes, simulation results show that the proposed scheme offers higher throughput and lower average delay.},

  abstract     = {Analog neural networks are highly effective to solve some optimization problems, and they have been used for target localization in distributed multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar. In this work, we design a new relaxed energy function based neural network (RNFNN) for target localization in distributed MIMO radar. We start with the maximum likelihood (ML) target localization with a complicated objective function, which can be transformed to a more tractable one with equality constraints by introducing some auxiliary variables. Different from the existing Lagrangian programming neural network (LPNN) methods, we further relax the optimization problem formulated for target localization, so that the Lagrangian multiplier terms are no longer needed, leading to a relaxed energy function with better convexity. Based on the relaxed energy function, a RNFNN is implemented with much simpler structure and faster convergence speed. Furthermore, the RNFNN method is extended to localization in the presence of transmitter and receiver location errors. It is shown that the performance of the proposed localization approach achieves the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) within a wider range of signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). Extensive comparisons with the state-of-the-art approaches are provided, which demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach in terms of performance improvement and computational complexity (or convergence speed).},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we investigate a method of transmit power control (TPC) for wireless-powered secure communications with untrusted energy harvesting receivers (EH-Rxs), which are allowed to harvest energy but not to decode information from the signals sent by transmitters. In practice, channel state information (CSI) is sometimes inaccurate due to the time-varying nature of wireless channels and quantization errors in the CSI feedback. Furthermore, the CSI on the EH link between transmitters and EH-Rxs is likely to be more inaccurate than the CSI on the signal link when the EH-Rxs act deceitfully, so the level of uncertainty in the CSI can be different for the signal link and the EH link. In the presence of this heterogeneity of channel uncertainty, a deep learning (DL)-based TPC strategy is proposed to maintain the confidentiality of information at the untrusted EH-Rxs whilst guaranteeing that the required energy can still be harvested. In particular, the modified CSI for each signal and EH link, which is generated from the estimated CSI through the addition of random noise, is taken into account in the training of a deep neural network (DNN) to compensate appropriately for the heterogeneous errors in the CSI. Simulation results confirm that the proposed scheme provides a good approximation to the optimal TPC strategy, even in the presence of severely heterogeneous channel errors, such that it outperforms conventional baseline schemes and shows a near-optimal secrecy performance whilst achieving a significantly lower computation time.},

It has been deemed a promising solution for the large-scale deployment of IoT nodes. In this paper, we exploit stochastic geometry (SG) to develop a tractable framework to evaluate the successful transmission probability in WP-BackCom while considering the imperfect successive interference cancellation (SIC) at each gateway (GW) and the non-linear energy harvesting (EH) model and energy-causality constraint at each backscatter user (BU). The successful transmission probability is defined as the probability for the event that not only the BU can harvest sufficient power from PBs for sustaining its operation but also the backscattered information can be successfully decoded by the GW. We derive the active probability into a closed form and then obtain the successful transmission probability based on the random spectrum access (RSA) policy. The closed-form expression for the successful transmission probability is derived under three special cases. We also devise a closed-form expression for the sub-optimal reflection coefficient to obtain a sub-optimal successful transmission probability. The analysis reveals that the sub-optimal reflection coefficient increases with the SIC coefficient. Numerical simulations validate the correctness of the above theoretical derivations and examine the impacts of various parameters on the successful transmission probability.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous vehicles produce high data rates of sensory information from sensing systems. To achieve the advantages of sensor fusion among different vehicles in a cooperative driving scenario, high data-rate communication becomes essential. Current strategies for joint radar-communication (JRC) often rely on specialized hardware, prior knowledge of the system model, and entail diminished capability in either radar or communication functions. In this paper, we propose a framework for intelligent vehicles to conduct JRC, with minimal prior knowledge of the system model and a tunable performance balance, in an environment where surrounding vehicles execute radar detection periodically, which is typical in contemporary protocols. We introduce a metric on the usefulness of data to help an intelligent vehicle decide what, and to whom, data should be transmitted. The problem framework is cast as a generalized form of the Markov Decision Process (MDP). We identify deep reinforcement learning algorithms (DRL) and algorithmic extensions suitable for solving our JRC problem. For multi-agent scenarios, we introduce a Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework via a control channel. This framework enables modular and fair comparisons of various algorithmic extensions. Our experiments show that DRL results in superior performance compared to non-learning algorithms. Learning of inter-agent coordination in the GNN framework, based only on the Markov task reward, further improves performance.},

In contrast, in out-of-cellular-coverage areas, comparatively inefficient distributed radio resource management is used. To exploit the benefits of the centralized approach for enhancing the reliability of V2V communications on roads lacking cellular coverage, we propose VRLS (Vehicular Reinforcement Learning Scheduler), a centralized scheduler that proactively assigns resources for out-of-coverage V2V communications before vehicles leave the cellular network coverage. By training in simulated vehicular environments, VRLS can learn a scheduling policy that is robust and adaptable to environmental changes, thus eliminating the need for targeted (re-)training in complex real-life environments. We evaluate the performance of VRLS under varying mobility, network load, wireless channel, and resource configurations. VRLS outperforms the state-of-the-art distributed scheduling algorithm in zones without cellular network coverage by reducing the packet error rate by half in highly loaded conditions and achieving near-maximum reliability in low-load scenarios.},

Due to the increase of security incidents and massive activities on networks, existing works have mainly focused on designing Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) based on traditional machine learning and deep learning models. In recent times, state of the art performance has been achieved in various fields through Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), which combines deep learning with reinforcement learning. In this paper, we propose a new DRL-based IDS for network traffics using Markov decision process (MDP) to improve the IDS decision-making performance. In addition, an extensive analysis of the IDS behavior is provided through modeling the interaction between the well-behaving IDS and attacker players using Stochastic Game Theory . Specifically, we used a non-zero-sum stochastic game, where the transitions between states depend on both the IDS and the attacker’s actions at each stage of the game. We show that our game reaches a Nash Equilibrium upon convergence to seek the optimal solution, which corresponds to the optimal decision policy where both players maximize their profits. We compared the performance of our proposed DRL-IDS to the baseline benchmark of standard reinforcement learning (RL) and several machine learning algorithms using NSL-KDD dataset. As a result, our proposed DRL-IDS outperforms the existing models by improving both the detection rate and the accuracy while reducing false alarms. Results were provided to demonstrate the convergence of the game theory-based IDS under various settings toward equilibrium. This equilibrium corresponds to the safe state where both players are playing their respective best strategies.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a joint non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) clustering and power allocation problem is studied to maximize the uplink total sum rate in Internet of Remote Things (IoRT)-oriented satellite terrestrial relay networks (STRNs). The joint optimization problem is a mixed-integer programming (MIP) problem, which is non-convex and NP-hard. To solve this problem, we decompose it into two subproblems and propose staged algorithms to solve them. The first subproblem is an optimal NOMA clustering problem, which is still non-convex and NP-hard. To solve the subproblem efficiently, a reinforcement learning-based dynamic clustering algorithm (RL-DCA) is proposed. Using the RL-DCA, the users are able to gradually learn the optimal NOMA clustering policy in a distributed fashion. The RL-DCA has fast convergence and its computational complexity at each user remains fixed for any network size. The second subproblem is an intra-cluster optimal NOMA power allocation problem, which is still non-convex. To solve it, we firstly convert it into a convex problem by constrait approximation, then use the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions based algorithm to find the optimal power allocation policy. The second subproblem is solved in an offline fashion, which enables low computational complexity in transmission. Simulation results show that: 1) The RL-DCA has fast convergence and enables good clustering performance; 2) The joint NOMA clustering and power allocation scheme greatly outperforms the orthogonal multiple access (OMA) scheme and other NOMA schemes in terms of total sum rate.},

  abstract     = {Airplane sensors and on-board equipment collect an increasingly large amount of maintenance data during flights that are used for airplane maintenance. We propose to download part of the data during airplane’s descent via a cellular base station (BS) located at the airport. We formulate and solve an offline optimization problem to quantify how much data can be offloaded in a non-dedicated band while ensuring that the interference power at the terrestrial BSs in the vicinity of the airport remains below a maximum allowable threshold. Our problem allows for adaptive tuning of transmit power, number of frequency channels to be used, and beamforming according to the position of the plane on the descent path. Our results show that, when the BS at the airport and the plane are equipped with uniform planar arrays, during the last 5 minutes of descent, in the microwave band the plane can offload up to 5GB of maintenance data in a 20 MHz band with a transmit power of 1 W or 40 W. In the mmWave band, the plane can offload up to 24 times more data in a 1 GHz band, with a transmit power of 40 W (using most of the bandwidth) and below 4 times with a transmit power of 1 W (effectively using a maximum of 202 MHz due to bandwidth tuning). Beamforming, power and bandwidth tuning are all crucial in maintaining a good performance in the mmWave band while in the microwave band, dynamic tuning of bandwidth does not improve the performance noticeably.},

The power consumption of each BS is correlated with the number of associated mobile users (MUs) and their random mobility. We formulate a stochastic optimization problem and decompose it into two subproblems with limited optimality gap. We solve the first MU association subproblem by minimizing the price-weighted power consumption of BSs under low-complexity matching algorithm. For the second energy control subproblem, we propose a novel two-timescale approach based on stochastic network optimization to tackle with the time-coupling turn-on/off cost and battery dynamic constraints. We derive the long-term time-averaged turn-on/off cost minimized by our approach including its upper bound and approximate expression.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider a multi-user interference network where a central controller allocates power resources to multiple base stations for maximizing the entire network utility under a long-term power budget constraint. The optimal power allocation strategy depends on accurate and instant channel state information (CSI). However, due to users’ mobility and the existence of channel fading and interference, timely channel estimation is unavailable. To overcome the difficulty of unknown channel states, we resort to the Lyapunov drift analysis framework and design an online power allocation algorithm based on historical observations. The algorithm can be proven to achieve sub-linear performance for both cumulative regret and power budget violation. The sub-linear regret indicates the proposed algorithm can asymptotically achieve the optimal static power allocation performance in hindsight. Moreover, we use a general doubling trick to construct a parameter-free algorithm based on the aforementioned online algorithm without the knowledge of time horizon &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$T$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; , which can be proven to preserve the order of the regret and violation upper bound.

Recently, deep learning (DL)-based ASR methods have been proposed, which generally outperform traditional, but they generally have high computation complexity and large model sizes, which are hardly introduced into mobile edge devices, such as smart vehicles. In this paper, a lightweight convolutional neural network design method, inspired by MobileNet, is introduced into ASR for reducing computation complexity and model sizes. In addition, this method may bring about performance loss, and knowledge distillation (KD) is adopted to make up for this performance loss. Simulation results demonstrated that our proposed ASR method just has 30% computation complexity and model size of the original method, and its performance loss is very limited, especially after KD.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, the data from Internet of Things (IoT) devices is growing at a rapid pace, and the data collection issues have attracted more and more attention. Distinct from existing solutions which usually adopted traditional wireless technologies achieving low-bandwidth data connections towards IoT devices, this paper adopts the 60 GHz communication technology which is with increasing maturity, providing high-bandwidth wireless transmission for data-intensive IoT devices, such as high-definition (HD) cameras. However, 60 GHz links are subject to line-of-sight short communication range, therefore, we propose to use unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to fly over data-intensive IoT devices and achieve short-range high-throughput 60 GHz transmission in this paper. Moreover, for a set of HD cameras deployed in the linear scenario, multiple UAV flights are assigned to collect data by 60 GHz communication. To this end, we investigate the UAV flight scheduling (UFS) problem which aims to minimize the number of UAV flights while satisfying the data requirements of all ground cameras (GCs) with limitations of UAV’s energy and data storage. We prove that the UFS problem is NP-hard and design efficient algorithms with constant theoretical approximation ratios. Specifically, we first study a special case of the UFS problem where all the cameras are on the same direction of the UAV ground station, and propose two algorithms NF_SUFS and FF_SUFS, whose approximation ratios are both proved to be 2 by theoretical analysis. Then, we extend the algorithms to a more general case with the cameras on both directions of the ground station along the road, and put forward the FF_UFS algorithm that achieves an approximation ratio of 3. Finally, we conduct experiments to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) represents a promising distributed machine learning paradigm that allows smart devices to collaboratively train a shared model via providing local data sets. However, problems considering multiple co-existing FL services and different types of service providers are rarely studied. In this paper, we investigate a multiple FL service trading problem in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-aided networks, where FL service demanders (FLSDs) aim to purchase various data sets from feasible clients (smart devices, e.g., smartphones, smart vehicles), and model aggregation services from UAVs, to fulfill their requirements. An auction-based trading market is established to facilitate the trading among three parties, i.e., FLSDs acting as buyers, distributed located client groups acting as data-sellers, and UAVs acting as UAV-sellers. The proposed auction is formalized as a 0-1 integer programming problem, aiming to maximize the overall buyers’ revenue via investigating winner determination and payment rule design. Specifically, since two seller types (data-sellers and UAV-sellers) are considered, an interesting idea integrating seller pair and joint bid is introduced, which turns diverse sellers into virtual seller pairs. Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG)-based, and one-sided matching-based mechanisms are proposed, respectively, where the former achieves the optimal solutions, which, however, is computationally intractable. While the latter can obtain suboptimal solutions that approach to the optimal ones, with low computational complexity, especially upon considering a large number of participants. Significant properties such as truthfulness and individual rationality are comprehensively analyzed for both mechanisms. Extensive experimental results verify the properties and demonstrate that our proposed mechanisms outperform representative methods significantly.},

  abstract     = {Inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) technology has attracted considerable attention in smart traffic monitoring, owing to the superiority of high-resolution imaging and tracking for moving targets in all-weather. However, in practical application cases, it is hard to obtain a globally-focused image of multiple vehicles by traditional ISAR imaging techniques due to the nonuniform motions of vehicles. Hence, a dynamic ISAR imaging method for multiple moving vehicles based on the joint of orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) and consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (CADMM) is proposed in this paper. First, the preprocessing for raw data is performed in the wavenumber domain to simplify the imaging task into linear phase error estimation and distributed image recovery. Based on the sparsity of moving vehicles, the OMP method is utilized to estimate the dynamic motion phase error of consecutive frames data for different moving vehicles with less computational overhead. Then, the dynamic ISAR imaging problems of multiple moving vehicles can be transformed into the distributed imaging problem with variously estimated phases. Motivated by this fact, the CADMM optimization framework is exploited for the distributed ISAR imaging problem to obtain a globally-focused result according to the consensus constraint characteristic of multiple vehicles. Lastly, both the simulation and real data experiments are conducted to verify the performance and feasibility of the OMP-CADMM method. Furthermore, the experimental results show that the proposed method is capable of dynamic imaging and de-noising for multiple vehicles without signal separation.},

  abstract     = {Mobile crowdsensing (MCS) is a cost-effective paradigm for gathering real-time and location-related urban sensing data. To complete MCS tasks, MCS platform needs to exploit the trajectory of participants (vehicles or individuals, etc.) for effectively choosing participants. On one hand, the existing works usually assume that platform has possessed the abundant historical movement trajectory for participant selection, or can accurately predict the movement of participant before selection, but this assumption is impractical for many MCS applications, for some candidates have just arrived without sufficient mobility profiles, so-called trajectory from-scratch, or cold-trajectory issue. On the other hand, most of works only considers the coverage ratio of the sensing area, while some hotspots should be sensed frequently, so-called coverage degree of hotspots. To solve the issue, this paper proposes a reinforcement learning (RL) based, i.e., an improved Q-learning based online participant selection scheme to incorporate both coverage ratio and degree, PSARE. First, to solve the explosion of state-value table in traditional tabular Q-learning, an improved two-level Q-learning method is proposed to select participants in online way so as to achieve high long-term return. Specifically, in each selection round, PSARE dynamically compresses all the real participants (RPs) into several virtual participants (VPs) using the available historical trajectories of RPs, and the VP-based state-value table is constructed and constantly updated (i.e., the first level). Then, after selecting the VP through looking up the table, PARSE chooses the RP with the largest expected reward in this VP using epsilon-greedy way to balance the effect of exploration and exploitation (i.e., the second level). Moreover, the reward function is designed to measure the MCS coverage quality, including both coverage degree of hotspots and coverage ratio of target area. Thorough experiments on real-world mobility data set demonstrate that PSARE outperforms than other RL based online participant selection schemes (including deep Q-learning network) and traditional offline selection methods.},

Taking the kinematic constraints on the speed and the turning angle of the UAV into account, we formulate a UAV trajectory optimization problem to maximize the average throughput of the considered system, while satisfying the coverage requirements of the mobile users simultaneously. To solve this NP-hard problem, we first propose an offline trajectory design algorithm that can determine the whole trajectory of the UAV, assuming that the global information (e.g., channel state information and the users’ location information at all time slots) is known a priori . Then, we propose two low-complexity online algorithms that utilize the past and current information of the system only. Numerical results are provided to verify the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms. Moreover, we show that our proposed online algorithms can achieve almost the same system performance as the proposed offline algorithm, while inducing significant lower computational complexity.},

  abstract     = {Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN) consisting of multiple space-borne and airborne non-terrestrial base stations (NT-BSs) have recently been introduced by 3GPP as a new paradigm of infrastructure to extend the capacity and coverage of existing terrestrial networks to further support non-terrestrial UEs (NT-UEs). Mobility of NT-BSs and NT-UEs however leads to a dynamic and non-stationary environment, which creates unique challenges in the coverage optimization particularly for the dynamic deployment of multiple NT-BSs. Under the dynamic and non-stationary environment, each NT-BS should autonomously predict not only moving trajectories of NT-UEs and other NT-BSs but also the probability of presence of NT-UEs at any given location, and consequently a new machine learning (ML) scheme is desired. In this paper, instead of adopting the recent innovation of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches inducing an unaffordable complexity for NT-BSs with a limited computing capability, new reinforcement learning (RL) schemes are therefore proposed, by which each of multiple NT-BSs autonomously determines the deployment trajectories to maximize the number of NT-UEs that can access NT-BSs. Through the comprehensive analysis, we justify the convergence of the performance of the proposed schemes. The simulation results also show the effectiveness of the proposed schemes and the outstanding performances as compared with state-of-the-art schemes.},

In this paper, we consider the problem of joint resource reservation in the backhaul and Radio Access Network (RAN) based on the statistics of user demands and channel states, and also network availability. The goal is to maximize the sum of expected traffic flow rates, subject to link and access point budget constraints, while minimizing the expected outage of downlinks. The formulated problem turns out to be non-convex and difficult to solve to global optimality. We propose an efficient Block Coordinate Descent (BCD) algorithm to approximately solve the problem. The proposed BCD algorithm optimizes the link capacity reservation in the backhaul using a novel multi-path routing algorithm that decomposes the problem down to link-level and parallelizes the computation across backhaul links, while the reservation of transmission resources in RAN is carried out via a novel scalable and distributed algorithm based on Block Successive Upper-bound Minimization (BSUM). We prove that the proposed BCD algorithm converges to a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) solution. Simulation results verify the efficiency and the efficacy of our BCD approach against two heuristic algorithms.},

These UEs harvest energy from downlink radio frequency (RF) signals in order to power their own uplink wireless information transfer (WIT). However, the uplink information collection of the H-AP suffers from the self-interference (SI) induced by the downlink WPT. In this paper, for the sake of maximising the uplink fair-throughput of UEs, we jointly design the transmit beamforming and receive combining at the H-AP having multiple antennas in the spatial-domain, the resource allocation in the time-domain and the UEs’ scheduling in the user-domain. Since the resultant optimisation problem is non-convex in nature, an iterative algorithm is developed by decoupling the original joint design into several sub-problems. Our numerical results demonstrate the fast convergence, the uplink fair-throughput gain and the great fairness of our multi-domain resource scheduling design.},

In this work, therefore, we propose a twofold computation offloading mechanism in a collaborative way for a multi-UAV assisted MEC network using the Connected Dominating Set (CDS).

Secondly, according to the surveillance platform, side information such as the location, speed, and realtime throughput of HAPS is obtained by all the static base stations using ADS-B system. Thirdly, a modified handover strategy over HAPS based on the side information is used to enhance the service ability of all the network.

  abstract     = {In this work, we design an elastic open radio access network (O-RAN) slicing for the Industrial Internet of things (IIoT). Due to the rapid spread of IoT in the industrial use-cases such as safety and mobile robot communications, the IIoT landscape has been shifted from static manufacturing processes towards dynamic manufacturing workflows (e.g., Modular Production System). But unlike IoT, IIoT poses additional challenges such as severe communication environment, network-slice resource demand variations, and on-time information update from the IIoT devices during industrial production. First, we formulate the O-RAN slicing problem for on-time industrial monitoring and control where the objective is to minimize the cost of fresh information updates (i.e., age of information (AoI)) from the IIoT devices (i.e., sensors) with the device energy consumption and O-RAN slice isolation constraints. Second, we propose the intelligent O-RAN framework based on game theory and machine learning to mitigate the problem’s complexity. We propose a two-sided distributed matching game in the O-RAN control layer that captures the IIoT channel characteristics and the IIoT service priorities to create IIoT device and small cell base station (SBS) preference lists. We then employ an actor-critic model with a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) in the O-RAN service management layer to solve the resource allocation problem for optimizing the network slice configuration policy under time-varying slicing demand. Furthermore, the proposed matching game within the actor-critic model training helps to enforce the long-term policy-based guidance for resource allocation that reflects the trends of all IIoT devices and SBSs satisfactions with the assignment. Finally, the simulation results show that the proposed solution enhances the performance gain for the IIoT services by serving an average of 50% and 43.64% more IIoT devices than the baseline approaches.},

In UAV-assisted wireless communications, the advantage of the line of sight (LOS) dominant air-ground channels makes it more attractive to apply directional millimeter wave (mmWave) communications, where beam management is highly related to user location. Nevertheless, due to the high mobility of UAVs and trains, how to accurately and efficiently track beams becomes a critical problem to solve. Based on this observation, in this paper, we first present an UAV-assisted dual-band HSR wireless network architecture, which integrates the frequency bands below 6 GHz (sub-6 GHz) to provide reliable transmissions for UAV controls and HSR safety services, with the mmWave bands to enhance the transmission capacity between UAVs and trains. To solve the beam tracking problem, we analyze the beam angular variations, and then propose an efficient algorithm based on Kalman filtering (KF) with varying update periods and long-short term memory (LSTM) to improve the beam tracking performance. Finally, we conduct extensive simulations to demonstrate that the proposed scheme can achieve more accurate beam tracking and higher spectrum efficiency.},

To make an energy-efficient system with a low computational complexity, we propose a single carrier hybrid beamforming scheme equipped with multi-tap analog beamformer that can mitiagte ISI in analog domain so that a simple baseband beamformer can be used. Our design aims to maximize the achievable sum rate of multi-user uplink system, and optimizes the beamforming matrix with a complex circle manifold-based conjugate gradient algorithm with a proposed initialization allowing fast convergence. Considering the baseband and circuit power consumption, the proposed scheme achieves a higher energy efficiency than conventional beamforming schemes in practical transmit power region.

  abstract     = {Code-domain non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is a promising technology to achieve ubiquitous massive connections for 5G and beyond. In application scenarios with high channel dynamics or simplified scheduling procedures, multi-user signals face the difficulty of accurate synchronization. The resulted asynchronous inter-user interference (IUI) is too complex to be modeled or alleviated by conventional multi-user detection algorithms. To effectively characterize the asynchronous IUI for code-domain NOMA, this paper constructs a three-dimensional (3D) factor-graph by introducing time delay as an additional dimension and develops the corresponding message passing mechanisms. Then, a novel 3D-expectation propagation algorithm (3D-EPA) is proposed for low-complexity asynchronous multi-user detection. The proposed 3D-EPA iterates between per-user estimation, which projects the asynchronous interference via Gaussian approximation, and inter-user message passing, which propagates the previous estimates among the users to refine the approximation. We also extend the 3D-EPA to multi-antenna scenarios and analyze its state evolution. Simulation results show that the proposed asynchronous NOMA system with 3D-EPA even outperforms its synchronous counterpart, especially under high overloadings.},

  abstract     = {Channel reciprocity, assumed in fifth-generation (5G) systems such as massive multiple-input-multiple-output (mMIMO), appears to be questioned in practice by recent studies on intelligent reflecting surface (IRS). Hence, contrary to previous works, we consider frequency division duplexing (FDD) to study the performance of an IRS-assisted mMIMO system. However, FDD is not suitable for large number of antennas architectures. For this reason we employ the joint spatial division and multiplexing (JSDM) approach exploiting the structure of the correlation of the channel vectors to reduce the channel state information (CSI) uplink feedback, and thus, allowing the use even of a large number of antennas at the base station. Specifically, we derive the sum spectral efficiency (SE) based on statistical CSI in terms of large-scale statistics by using the deterministic equivalent (DE) analysis while accounting for correlated Rayleigh fading. Subsequently, we formulate the optimization problem concerning the sum SE with respect to the reflecting beamforming matrix (RBM)and the total transmit power, which can be performed at every several coherence intervals by taking advantage of the slow time variation of the large-scale statistics. This notable property contributes further to the decrease of the feedback overhead. Numerical results, verified by Monte-Carlo (MC) simulations, enable interesting observations by elucidating how fundamental system parameters such as the rank of the covariance matrix and the number of groups of UEs affect the performance. For example, the selection of a high rank improves the channel conditioning but increases the feedback overhead.},

Cross PHY/application (APP) layer resource allocation and adaptive source encoding rate for single-antenna NOMA/ orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) video communications was also recently proposed. These prior works did not deal with joint subcarrier/ BF cluster assignment in a cross-layer fashion. In this paper, we propose a joint adaptive source encoding rate and iterative cross-PHY/APP layer resource management for BF-NOMA-OFDMA video communications to support 2N users on one subcarrier and improves the average video quality peak-signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). The proposed scheme outperforms Ali et al. PHY layer resource management by 4.18dB in the numerical results. Considering the high computational complexity of the iterative resource allocation, we further propose replacing the iterative cross-layer resource allocation by a supervised learning-based approach. We propose a novel and problem-specific post-processing procedure to guarantee the constraints that every user holds at least one subcarrier and a subcarrier support 2N users. The proposed supervised learning-based approach reduces the execution time by 98% in a GPU-based platform, comparable with 91-99% execution time reduction of supervised learning based communication algorithms in the literature, at the cost of 4% PSNR loss. Finally, we propose a supervised/unsupervised learning -based approach with minus PSNR as the cost function for continuous learning in an unsupervised learning fashion after supervised learning is done. The numerical results show that the proposed hybrid supervised/unsupervised learning approach can reduce the PSNR loss to just 1%.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the joint beamforming design for the intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) aided multi-antenna multiuser (MU) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) downlink transmissions under imperfect channel state information (CSI), where the IRS can only take discrete PSs (PSs) at each element and the weighted sum rate (WSR) is adopted as the performance metric. By deriving the covariance matrix of the interference and noise at the users under the statistical channel estimation errors (CEEs) model, the joint WSR maximization problem is reformulated as an equivalent weighted minimum mean square error minimization problem and decoupled into two subproblems which are solved alternatively. In particular, two algorithms based on the majorization-minimization and gradient descent methods are proposed to obtain the optimal beamforming matrix at the IRS. Simulation results validate the accuracy of the proposed robust design and reveal that in case of imperfect CSI, the IRS can still achieve a significant improvement in WSR even with 2-bits PSs at the IRS. Moreover, it is also found that increasing the number of reflecting elements may not always be beneficial and that the optimal location of the IRS may be closer to the base station in the presence of CEEs.},

  abstract     = {Downlink precoding has been widely accepted as a crucial technique in low-earth-orbit (LEO) satellite communications due to its advantages in improving the space division multiplexing capability and enhancing spectrum efficiency. Because of the strong spatial directivity in the satellite channels, the downlink precoder can be efficiently designed based on the angle of departure (AoD)-based channel state information (CSI). However, acquiring perfect AoD-based CSI is challenging due to the angle estimation error and attitude jitter of the LEO satellites. In light of this, this paper investigates the precoder design for the LEO satellite downlinks with imperfect AoD-based CSI. For robust design, we treat the angle deviations of each user as random variables, which are supposed to exhibit a particular distribution, then integrate them within a certain range to achieve the robustness of the proposed downlink precoder against the angle mismatch. Instead of using the sum-power constraint on the transmit antennas, we adopt a more realistic per-antenna power constraint (PAPC). Accordingly, we formulate the problem to maximize the ergodic sum rate of the system. By leveraging the corresponding Lagrangian formulation and identifying the optimal precoder structure as the solution to a generalized eigenvalue problem, an iterative algorithm for the robust precoder design is derived. To reduce the computational complexity, a low-complexity version of the proposed algorithm is implemented based on deep learning techniques to meet the high demand for real-time applications in LEO satellite systems. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed precoding approach.},

  abstract     = {In the upcoming satellite-integrated Internet, a noted limitation is the non-trivial propagation latency due to the long distances. To support the emergent timeliness applications, information must be transmitted within a short end-to-end latency. Hence, the traditional hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) strategies with frequent feedbacks do not fit anymore, because the reliable transmission needs retransmission of the lost packets, which inevitably leads to the low efficiency in the satellite-integrated Internet. In this paper, we propose an age-optimal network code HARQ (NC-HARQ) transmission scheme with the metric of information timeliness, i.e., age of information (AoI) to realize limited/no feedback dual-hop reliable transmission in the satellite-integrated Internet. We derive the closed-form expression for the average and peak AoI of the proposed dual-hop age-optimal NC-HARQ transmission scheme, and also the expression for the benchmark schemes through establishing a finite-state Markov chain. Then, by taking account of the time-varying channel and the characteristics of random update of data file, two dynamic forward transmission strategies are further designed. Simulation results illustrate that our dual-hop age-optimal NC-HARQ transmission scheme can achieve lower average and peak AoI in comparison with several state-of-the-art HARQ schemes.},

Furthermore, an efficient initialization strategy for the L-BFGS method based MMSE detection is devised, which helps to accelerate convergence and improve performance with acceptable complexity overhead added compared to the conventional L-BFGS based detection algorithms. Simulation results finally validate that the proposed detection scheme based on the L-BFGS method can closely approach to the MMSE accuracy with a small number of iterations even in poor propagation environments and provide attractive trade-offs between performance and complexity.},

The two-hop transmission with relay selection has been shown to achieve a good trade-off between extended communication range and undesired bandwidth penalty due to information repetition using multiple relays. In this work, we propose a relay selection scheme for buffer-aided relays that store the received signal in a finite data buffer and accumulate the energy harvested from RF signals in a finite energy storage. In the proposed scheme, relays are prioritized according to their instantaneous energy and data buffer status as well as channel conditions reported by relays. To render practical implementation, the anticipated cost of status update for relay selection that has been commonly ignored is explicitly considered. Besides, the energy accumulation rate is increased by utilizing both the source-relay and inter-relay channels to harvest energy. The performance of the proposed relay selection scheme is theoretically analyzed using a discrete-time Markov chain. Numerical results show the superiority of the proposed relay selection scheme than the state-of-art and the key factors that dominate the outage performance.},

To address the complexity issue in 5G new radio (NR) systems, where low-density parity check (LDPC) codes are adopted for data transmission, we also extend the proposed algorithm to concatenated detection and decoding in MIMO-LDPC systems to achieve low complexity. Simulation results show that the convergence speed of MIMO detection can be improved by at most 50%, while for the MIMO-LDPC system, the proposed algorithm can achieve 2 dB gain compared to the conventional minimum mean square error (MMSE) detection mechanism.},

It shifts the traditional focus on channel state information (CSI) to a quality of service (QoS) driven strategy, which matches cognitive radio philosophy. We present an analytical framework to theoretically study Hybrid SIC (HS) and Hybrid SIC with dynamic power control (HS-P) algorithms in terms of their probability of success under Rayleigh channel. Specifically, considering a CR-NOMA uplink system, we analyse the probability to allocate a primary and a secondary user into a radio resource, given their minimum QoS requirement. We obtain closed-form expressions for the mentioned algorithms and investigate the impact that the minimum QoS and the channel conditions have on the performance. Our analysis demonstrates that both algorithms share similarities in the way the primary user behaves, whereas they significantly differ in the secondary user’s case. Finally, we validate the correctness of the study by conducting Monte Carlo simulations using various system parameters. Our results show that our theoretical expressions closely match the simulated results in all testing scenarios. They appear promising to design advanced CR-NOMA features to enhance system performance based on success probability such as grouping algorithms.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates a dual-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) aided communication system to improve the security of the communication between ground devices and UAVs. Different from the existing works which ignored ground devices mobility and just considered one-way communication security between ground devices and UAVs, we allow the devices to be mobile and consider bi-directional ground-UAV communication security. Specifically, one UAV server communicates with mobile ground devices, and the other UAV jammer is invoked to confuse eavesdroppers. Our objective is to maximize the worst-case average secrecy rate by the joint optimization of UAV trajectory and sender transmit power. To achieve it, we first formulate the worst-case average secrecy rate maximization problem as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) under the constraints of UAV flight space, flight speed, energy capacity, anti-collision, and peak transmit power. Then, we design a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) based algorithm to solve the CMDP. Experiment results demonstrate that our joint optimization scheme can enhance the communication security in terms of the secrecy rate in both UAV-to-ground (U2G) case and ground-to-UAV (G2U) case. Besides, it is observed that UAV trajectory and sender transmit power have different impacts on the communication security in U2G case and G2U case.},

However, this technique is applied in the ideal condition with white Gaussian noise. In this paper, we propose to extend the coprime array to the practical communication scenario by taking impulsive noise and non-circular signals into account. An augmented phased fractional low-order moment (A-PFLOM) is proposed to suppress impulsive noise, and then reduced-dimension MUSIC (RD-MUSIC) subspace techniques are applied for direction of arrival (DOA) information of non-circular sources.

In this paper, a hierarchical basis expansion model (BEM) based channel estimation scheme is proposed for doubly selective channels, which requires a low pilot overhead and computational complexity. A mixed-BEM is proposed for time-varying channels alongside a complex exponential-BEM (CE-BEM), resulting in very few unknown parameters required for channel estimation. Based on the hierarchical BEM structure, an analytical channel estimation model is derived. By employing the block-structured sparsity and a small number of mixed-BEM coefficients in the antenna-time-BEM domain, a low-complexity estimator is proposed to recover the mixed-BEM coefficients accurately. The lower bound on the mean square error (MSE) of channel estimation is derived to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. Simulation results show that the proposed channel estimation scheme significantly outperforms the existing methods in terms of MSE of channel estimation and bit error rate, with much lower pilot overhead and computational complexity.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider the uplink channel estimation phase and downlink data transmission phase of cell-free millimeter wave (mmWave) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with low-capacity fronthaul links and low-resolution analog-to-digital converters/digital-to-analog converters (ADC/DACs). In cell-free massive MIMO, a control unit dictates the baseband processing at a geographical scale, while the base stations communicate with the control unit through fronthaul links. Unlike most of previous works in cell-free massive MIMO with finite-capacity fronthaul links, we consider the general case where the fronthaul capacity and ADC/DAC resolution are not necessarily the same. In particular, the fronthaul compression and ADC/DAC quantization occur independently where each one is modeled based on the information theoretic argument and additive quantization noise model (AQNM). Then, we address the codebook design problem that aims to minimize the channel estimation error for the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) and colored compression noise cases. Also, we propose an alternating optimization (AO) method to tackle the max-min fairness problem. In essence, the AO method alternates between two subproblems that correspond to the power allocation and codebook design problems. The AO method proposed for the zero-forcing (ZF) precoder is guaranteed to converge, whereas the one for the maximum ratio transmission (MRT) precoder has no such guarantee. Finally, the performance of the proposed schemes is evaluated by the simulation results in terms of both energy and spectral efficiency. The numerical results show that the proposed scheme for the ZF precoder yields spectral and energy efficiency 28% and 15% higher than that of the best baseline.},

This paper investigates the coverage performance of the cell-free massive MIMO HSR communication systems with multiple APs and multiple users. Initially, the system and channel models are proposed. Based on the established models, the uplink training, uplink data transmission and downlink data transmission are analyzed, respectively. By using the deterministic equivalent analysis, we derive a deterministic signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio expression for downlink transmission. Then, a tight upper bound on the coverage probability is derived. In the high power regime, the asymptotic coverage performance is also analyzed. Numerical results verify the correctness of the derived theoretical expressions. Moreover, the effects of the downlink transmit power, AP’s antenna number, AP’s density, user number, and channel fading parameter on coverage performance are also discussed.},

In order to extend the SC-SM scheme to multi-user scenario, a multi-user SC-SM (MU-SC-SM) scheme based on beamforming is proposed. The proposed MU-SC-SM scheme not only eliminates the inter-user interference (IUI) and enhances the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the served user, but also resolves the conflict between beamforming and spatial modulation. The achievable rate, the bit-error-rate (BER) performance and computational complexity of the proposed MU-SC-SM scheme are analyzed in detail. The impacts of the imperfect channel state information on the BER performance are also analyzed. Simulations are carried out to verify that the proposed MU-SC-SM scheme is superior to existing multi-user spatial modulation schemes in BER performance.},

The algorithm establishes a state space equation related to the penalty coefficient, which takes the difference between the decision variable that violates the constraint condition and the boundary of the feasible region as the state quantity. By introducing the Gerschgorin Circle Theorem, the eigenvalues of the system matrix are restricted to be within the unit circle, which guarantees the convergence. On the basis of ensuring the convergence, the overall convergence rate of the algorithm is improved by minimizing the radius of the circle containing the eigenvalues. Compared with the existing iterative methods of penalty coefficients, the proposed algorithm has better convergence.

Temperature plays a key role in the system-wide reliability of the electronic control systems (ECS) used in the automotive. A vehicle is usually subjected to harsh temperature conditions from its operating environment. The increasing power density of IC chips in the ECS further exacerbates the operating temperature and thermal gradient condition on the chip, thereby significantly impacting the vehicle’s reliability. In this paper, we study how to map a periodic distributed automotive application on a heterogeneous multiple-core processing architecture with temperature and system-level reliability issues in check. We first present a mathematical programming model to bound the peak operating temperature for the ECS. Then we propose a more sophisticated approach based on the genetic algorithm to effectively bound the peak temperature and optimize the system-wide reliability of the ECS by maximizing its mean-time-to-failure (MTTF). To this end, we present an algorithm to guarantee the peak temperature for periodic applications with variable execution times to ensure our approach’s effectiveness. We also present several computationally efficient techniques for system-wide MTTF computation, which show several-order-of-magnitude speed-up over the state-of-the-art method when tested using synthetic cases and practical benchmarks.},

  abstract     = {Connected vehicles have recently attracted considerable attention for revolutionizing the transportation industry. Although connectivity brings about a vast number of benefits, it can give rise to a wider attack surface as more physical access interfaces have been introduced. In particular, anomalous behaviour of the Electronic Control Units (ECUs) caused by malicious attacks can result in serious consequences and possibly lead to fatal accidents. Hence, it is important to develop methodologies that can sniff vehicular data and detect it for further attack analysis. In this article, we develop a novel similarity-based intrusion detection methodology named SIDuDTW, which identifies malicious messages inside vehicle network, e.g., Controller Area Network (CAN), by using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance between CAN ID sequences. Subsequently, the theoretical analysis for the recurring sequence pattern, wave splitting strategies, similarity metric, and optimal parameters providing strong robustness against several kinds of attacks in SIDuDTW are detailed. A series of experiments demonstrate that the developed methodology can detect attacks with high accuracy. In addition, this proposed methodology significantly outperforms the intrusion detection capabilities of existing approaches in terms of basic injection, replay and suppression attacks. It is envisioned that this work will contribute to the development of safer autonomous vehicle conceptualized as a key unit within broader smart city.},

Furthermore, taking the practical measurable variables (i.e., revolving speed of propeller and rudder angle) as the control input, an auxiliary system is designed to deal with the influence of actuator saturation, which is distinct from most existing saturation-tolerant methods for USV. For merits of the neural damping technique, both the internal and external uncertainties are remodeled and only four adaptive parameters require to be updated online. Considerable effort has been made to guarantee the semi-globally uniform ultimate bounded (SGUUB) stability. Finally, the numerical simulation and physical experiment are illustrated to demonstrate the remarkable performance of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents an online-capable controller based on model predictive control for the energy management system of a parallel hybrid electric vehicle, which is equipped with two electric motors (EM). Its task is to minimize the vehicle’s fuel consumption along a predicted driving mission. If the fuel consumption is the only cost to be minimized, a frequent use of the electric components ensues. This can result in their overheating, which is prevented in practice by defining a maximum motor temperature, beyond which the motor’s maximum capability is decreased drastically. This is referred to as thermal derating. A multi-level control structure is proposed that explicitly includes maximum temperature bounds on both EMs. The high-level controller is developed based on the model predictive control approach. The low-level controller is based on Pontryagin’s maximum principle and is an extension of the equivalent consumption minimization strategy. To validate the multi-level control structure, three test scenarios of increasing difficulty are presented in simulation. They include thermal disturbances as well as driving mission mispredictions and are provided to demonstrate the robustness of the control algorithm. The proposed controller is able to recover 70% of the loss of optimality of a state-of-the-art predictive controller. A comparison to a dynamic programming optimization reveals close to optimal results.},

In the proposed wide output converter, a reconfigurable topology based on matrix transformer is presented, the primary sides of the matrix transformer are connected in parallel, the connection of the secondary sides can be changed by controlling the selector switch on the secondary side, which are categorized into HV and LV operation mode and suitable for different output levels. The HV operation mode whose secondary rectifiers are connected in series is employed for the high output level, while the LV operation mode whose secondary rectifiers are connected in parallel is employed for the low output level. Consequently, the output range is widened by configuring the connection structure. What&#39;s more, the switching frequency range can be reduced. Furthermore, the magnetizing current will be reduced by the parallel connection of the primary sides, and soft-switching operation is realized on all of the switches over the full operation range. Therefore, the proposed converter features a wide output voltage range along with high efficiency. Finally, an experimental prototype with 400 VDC input and 150 VDC/14 A-500 VDC/4.2 A output is fabricated and tested to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the converter.},

  abstract     = {With the emergence of the concept of smart city and the increasing demands for a range of drones, Internet of Drones (IoD) has achieved a variety of attention by providing multiple benefits in academia and industry. IoD offers numerous services, such as traffic monitoring, environmental monitoring, and disaster management by combining infrastructure, Internet of Things (IoT), and Flying Ad-Hoc Networks (FANET) in smart city environments. However, communication among drones is vulnerable to potential security threats because the sensitive messages in various applications are exchanged via an insecure channel in IoD-based smart city environments. Since IoDs can be operated in unattended environment with minimum human interventions, smart devices (e.g., drones and sensors) deployed in IoD architectures are vulnerable to physical capture attacks. In addition, drones are resource-constrained in terms of computation and communication overheads, and it is not much viable to apply public key cryptography (PKC) that requires high computation and communication overheads. Thus, we design a secure and lightweight authentication protocol using a physical unclonable function (PUF) for IoD to guarantee reliable and useful services in smart city environments, called SLAP-IoD. We prove the security of the SLAP-IoD using informal and formal security analyses using the broadly recognized Real-Or-Random (ROR) random oracle model, and also through the formal security verification using the widely-accepted Automated Validation of Internet Security-sensitive Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) security verification. Furthermore, we compare the performance of the SLAP-IoD with related schemes. Consequently, we show that SLAP-IoD offers better security and efficiency than other related schemes and is suitable for IoD-based smart city environments.},

The torque converter provides large torque amplification at low vehicle speed, however generates large amount of heat inside. This brings a challenge during frequent vehicle start and stop. In this study, an alternative torque conversion solution to the powertrain of mobile machine with a power split hydraulic transmission is proposed, where the hydraulic transmission is a substitute for the torque converter. It eliminates overheating problem by dissipating the heat inside through its outlet. The mathematical models of the proposed powertrain including the wheel drive and working function are developed. An engine-speed-based system optimization is conducted and a rule-based control strategy based on optimization results is developed. The engine operations and engine fuel consumptions with optimization-based and rule-based control strategies are compared using three different loading cycles (57 s, 30 s, 90 s).

  abstract     = {The intelligent vehicle terminal T-BOX of intelligent connected vehicles (ICVs) is directly connected to the vehicle interface and constantly exchanges real-time data inside and outside the vehicle, which significantly increases the communication pressure on the in-vehicle network. Excessive data will increase the load on the channel due to the limited bandwidth of the vehicle. Although the existing data compression algorithm can effectively reduce the communication pressure, it requires significant driving data to count the number of signal changes, which increases the preliminary labor cost. Meanwhile, it is difficult to meet the stable compression rate using a static configuration when a large amount of CAN data is transmitted with fluctuating data changes, which cannot satisfy the requirement of reducing the bus load rate, and satisfying the real-time requirements of ICV is challenging. Thus, we propose a real-time dynamic data compression algorithm for vehicles to satisfy such requirements. The experiments show that for the frequently changing signals, the proposed algorithm can improve the compression rate by about 10% compared with the existing compression algorithm. The execution time of the compression process is 4.55 μs at a clock frequency of 400 MHz and the decompression process execution time is 86.48 μs. Compared with the bus load when the original message is transmitted, the proposed algorithm can reduce the bus load by 19% on average. In the future, a stable compression rate will be crucial when loading authentication codes on the CAN to ensure its security.},

  abstract     = {Differential GNSS (DGNSS) has been demonstrated to provide reliable, high-quality range correction information enabling real-time navigation with centimeter to sub-meter accuracy, which is required for applications such as connected and autonomous vehicles. However, DGNSS requires a local reference station near each user. For a continental or global scale implementation, this information dissemination approach would require a dense network of reference stations whose construction and maintenance would be prohibitively expensive. Precise Point Positioning (PPP) affords more flexibility as a public service for Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) receivers, but its State Space Representation (SSR) format is not supported by most receivers in the field or on the market. This article proposes a novel Virtual Network DGNSS (VNDGNSS) approach and an optimization algorithm that is key to its implementation. The approach capitalizes on the existing PPP infrastructure without the need for new physical reference stations. Specifically, no reference station is needed in the local vicinity of any user. By connecting to public GNSS SSR data services, a VNDGNSS server maintains current information about satellite code bias, satellite orbit and clock, and atmospheric models. Construction of the Radio Technical Commission for Maritime Services (RTCM) Observation Space Representation (OSR) messages from this SSR information requires both the signal time-of-transmission and the satellite position at that time which are consistent with the time-of-reception for each client. This article presents an algorithm to determine these quantities. Then the VNDGNSS computes and transmits RTCM OSR messages to user receivers. This approach achieves global dissemination coverage for real-time navigation without the need for additional local base stations near each user. The results of real-time stationary and moving platform evaluations are included, using u-blox M8P and ZED-F9P receivers. The performance surpasses the Society of Automotive Engineering (SAE) specification (68% of horizontal error &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\leqslant$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; 1.5 m and vertical error &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\leqslant$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; 3 m) and shows significantly better horizontal performance than GNSS Open Service (OS). The moving tests also show better horizontal performance than the ZED-F9P receiver with Satellite Based Augmentation Systems (SBAS) enabled and achieve the lane-level accuracy (95% of horizontal errors less than 1 m).},

The energy loss prediction models of the battery, the supercapacitor and the bidirectional DC/DC converter are established, respectively. Afterward, the objective optimization control function is deduced from the perspective of the minimum comprehensive energy loss. Dynamic power distribution ratios are obtained under the constraints. The superiorities of the supercapacitor are fully utilized and the dynamic supply-demand power balance is maintained.

  abstract     = {Decision-making in uncontrolled intersection is one of the main challenges in urban autonomous driving. This paper proposed a new decision-making framework in uncontrolled intersection based on the intention prediction method and Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium theory. The framework is a three-stage method: target vehicle motion prediction, driving mode decision, and motion planning. The driving intention (left turn, right turn, or go straight) of the target vehicle at the intersection can be predicted using the combination algorithm of GMM-HMM and SVM. According to the driving intention and road structure, the trajectory fitting module would use the Bezier curve to fit the predicted trajectory of a target vehicle. Furthermore, combined with trajectories of the ego vehicle, the S-T diagram is used to judge whether there is a spatio-temporal conflict point of the target vehicle and ego vehicle. If there is a conflict point of the target vehicle and ego vehicle, the driving mode (‘yield’ or ‘cross’) of the ego vehicle is selected by using the Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium theory. This method can not only avoid premature or unnecessary deceleration due to conservation but also avoid a collision or violent deceleration due to greed. According to the driving mode, the planning module uses the model predictive control algorithm to determine the optimal acceleration strategy. Have been verified by the vehicle test, it indicates that the proposed decision-making framework can make ego vehicles pass through the intersection safely and comfortably.},

To this end, for each uncertain parameter, multitude of random vectors with the specification of corresponding uncertain parameters are generated and a fuzzy membership function is then assigned to each vector. Since the most probable samples occur repeatedly, they are recognized by the superposition of the generated fuzzy membership functions. The simulation results on various case studies indicate the high accuracy of the proposed method in comparison with Monte-Carlo simulation (MCs), Unscented Transformation (UT), and Point Estimate Method (PEM). It also scales down the computational burden compared to MCs. Also, a real-world case study is employed to examine the ability of the method in capturing the uncertainty of EVs’ arrival and departure time. The studies on this case reveal that involving EVs in P2P trading augments the amount of energy traded within the prosumers.},

Compared to traditional non-learning-based flocking and navigation control methods, reinforcement learning-based methods have advantages in model-free, flexibility, and adaptability. In this paper, we formulate the flocking and navigation control of the UAV swarm as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and use multi-agent reinforcement learning methods to solve the problem. There are two significant challenges introduced by reinforcement learning: the scalability issue and the partial observations of each UAV. We adopt the independent learning and parameter sharing scheme to tackle the scalability issue, which extends the single-agent reinforcement learning algorithms to the multi-agent scenario. For the partial observations, we propose an oracle-guided two-stage training and execution scheme, which utilizes the flock center during the training phase but avoids the dependence on the flock center during the execution phase.

The key of this study is to introduce a new concept of parameter sensitivity region (PSR) into the process of optimization, aiming at comprehensively considering the fluctuation of multiple motor parameters into the motor design. To determine the motor parameters related to the sensitivity region, a parameters anti-disturbance analysis is carried out based on analysis of variance. According to the analysis, motor design parameters are classified into two groups, where the PSR-based uncertainty optimization method is purposely utilized in the group with highly robustness-related parameters. Then, a deterministic optimization is employed for the group with weakly robustness-related parameters. After optimization, the motor performances are analyzed in detail, including torque, torque ripple, and so on, as well as their corresponding analysis of performance consistency. Finally, a prototype is manufactured and tested to further verify the proposed method and RH-PM motor.},

However, existing distribution-based methods do not sufficiently exploit the information from source point cloud, which affects the odometry performance. In this paper, a novel distribution-to-distribution matching method is proposed based on maximum likelihood estimation to solve relative transformation, where source and target point sets are tightly jointed to represent the sampling distribution in the objective function. On this basis, a hierarchical 3D LiDAR odometry with the low-level scan-to-map matching and high-level fixed-lag smoothing is designed. With the decoupling strategy, the matching method is extended to a fixed-lag smoothing module and the heavy computation burden is overcome. Our smoothing module is universal, which can be attached to LiDAR odometry framework for performance improvement. The experiments on KITTI dataset, Newer College dataset, and large-scale KITTI-360 dataset verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Many radar applications require a high range resolution, entailing the necessity for a large signal bandwidth. When employing an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) radar system in its standard implementation, the radar system must operate at a high sampling frequency to ensure covering the entire signal bandwidth, thus imposing significant challenges on its implementation. Therefore, methods for reducing the sampling frequency are topic of recent research. In this work, a method for reducing the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) sampling frequency at the receiver without losing range resolution is proposed. This is achieved by activating only a fraction of the subcarriers at the transmitter, while simultaneously allowing for systematic aliasing due to undersampling in the receiver. This aliasing is designed such that the active subcarriers do not interfere with each other, which ensures a simple separation of them in the frequency domain. The proposed concept, denoted as subcarrier aliasing (SA), allows reducing the ADC sampling frequency in the receiver, but lacks in reducing the digital-to-analog converter (DAC) sampling frequency in the transmitter. However, the key asset of SA-OFDM lies in the properties of its waveform, making it especially suitable for joint radar and communication applications over other waveforms, e.g., stepped-carrier OFDM.},

In this paper, a parabolic equation-based modeling approach is proposed to characterize the maritime evaporation duct channel. The constant coefficients of each variable in the modeling are calculated by the least square method, and the specific distribution of shadow fading in channel modeling is determined by the Kullback-Leibler divergence method. Furthermore, the partitioning around medoids method is utilized to reduce the average deviation and improve the accuracy of the model. Numerical results illustrate that the statistical channel model possesses satisfactory calculation ability at the distance of signal interference caused by the evaporation duct.

We formulate the system utility maximization problem with joint consideration of offloading decisions, offloading ratio, and resource allocation. Considering the complexity and privacy issues of centralized scheme as well as the inherent resource contention among MDs, we adopt game-theoretic approach to devise a low-complexity distributed offloading scheme, in which the offloading decision-making problem is modeled as an exact potential game, and the optimal offloading ratio and resource allocation are determined using a subgradient method.

However, existing localization/positioning systems are mainly trained and deployed in a fixed environment, and thus they are likely to suffer from substantial performance declines when immigrating to new environments. In this paper, we address the fundamental problem of WiFi-based cross-environment indoor localization using a semi-supervised approach, in which we only have access to the annotations of the source environment while the data in the target environments are un-annotated. This problem is of high practical values in enabling a well-trained system to be scalable to new environments without tedious human annotations. To this end, a deep neural forest is introduced which unifies the ensemble learning with the representation learning functionalities from deep neural networks in an end-to-end trainable fashion. On top of that, an adversarial training strategy is further employed to learn environment-invariant feature representations for facilitating more robust localization. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed methods over state-of-the-art baselines. Compared with the best-performing baseline, our model excels with an average 12.7% relative improvement on all six evaluation settings.},

Under the assumption that the fronthaul links connecting APs to CS have finite capacity, a rate-splitting transmission at IoT devices (IDs) is proposed which enables hybrid edge and cloud decoding of split uplink messages. The problem of completion time minimization for FL is tackled by optimizing the rate-splitting transmission and fronthaul quantization strategies along with training hyperparameters such as precision and iteration numbers.

To mitigate this problem, we introduce a DYSON: DelaYed offloading System with Opportunistic fog Node (OFN) such as vehicles and mobile phones which can opportunistically reduce the load of static FN thanks to their mobility. In DYSON, to maximize the offloading effect of OFN, when IoT device cannot use OFN, it delays the task offloading with the expectation of future contacts of OFN. To assess the performance of DYSON, we develop an analytic model for the opportunistic offloading probability that the task can be offloaded to OFN. Based on the analytic model, we derive the optimal delay timer to maximize the opportunistic offloading probability while maintaining the probability that the task cannot be processed within the deadline below a target probability.

First, we derive a theoretical condition of soft NOMA handover (NOMA-HO) that increases the handover user rate without reducing the sum rate of two paired users in serving and target cells. Based on this condition, we then design an efficient soft NOMA-HO procedure that minimizes signaling overhead and channel feedback.

  abstract     = {In this paper, a robust uplink transmission scheme combining beamforming (BF) with rate splitting multiple access is proposed to improve the spectrum efficiency of a multibeam satellite system. By assuming that only imperfect channel state information is available, we first formulate an optimization problem to minimize the total transmit power under the constraints of individual transmit power budget and users’ rate requirements. Then, based on the successive convex approximation and difference-of-convex, we present an approach to convert the nonconvex constraints into convex ones, and obtain the BF vectors and power control parameters through iterative procedure. Finally, numerical results confirm the validity and superiority of our proposed scheme.},

  abstract     = {In connected vehicular networks, it is vital to have vehicular nodes that are capable of sensing surrounding environments and exchanging messages with each other for automating and coordinating purposes. Towards this end, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), combining both sensing and communication systems to jointly utilize their resources and pursue mutual benefits, emerges as a new cost-effective solution. In ISAC, the hardware and spectrum co-sharing leads to a fundamental tradeoff between sensing and communication performance, which is not well understood except for very simple cases with the same sensing and channel states, and perfect channel state information at the receiver (CSIR). In this paper, a general point-to-point ISAC model is proposed to account for the scenarios where the sensing state is different from but correlated with the channel state, and the CSIR is not necessarily perfect. For the model considered, the optimal tradeoff is characterized by a capacity-distortion function that quantifies the best communication rate for a given sensing distortion constraint requirement. An iterative algorithm is proposed to compute such tradeoff, and a few non-trivial examples are constructed to demonstrate the benefits of ISAC as compared to the separation-based approach.},

We aim to maximize the sum secrecy rate (SSR) via jointly optimizing the beamforming vectors, the artificial noise (AN) and the phase shifts at the IRS subject to the maximum transmit power constraint and unit modulus constraints. To address the non-convex optimization problem, we first propose an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm based on semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and obtain a high-quality sub-optimal solution. In order to reduce the high computational complexity, a low-complexity alternating optimization (LC-AO) algorithm is developed, in which the beamforming vectors, AN and the IRS phase shifts are optimized alternately by the generalized power iteration (GPI) and the Riemannian manifold conjugate gradient (RMCG) algorithm, respectively. Simulation results show the advantages of deploying the IRS in improving the system secrecy performance.},

Then, we notice that the legitimate receiver enable to reconstruct the AN from the received signal by almost the same method as the transmitter without AN reference, which reduces the system complexity in practice. Subsequently, the AN cancellation performance and the secrecy capacity at the receiver are analyzed, and their upper bounds are also derived. Finally, simulation results confirm that the proposed reference-free AN design and cancellation scheme can effectively suppress the AN at legitimate receiver, while degrades the signal to noise ratio (SNR) at eavesdropper seriously, which provides impressive secure performance in terms of secrecy capacity.},

As an efficient tool to combat malicious jamming, receive beamforming (RBF) is usually designed by using the statistical properties of the jamming received by Bob. Thus, it is very necessary to estimate the receive jamming covariance matrix (JCM) at Bob. To achieve a precise JCM estimation, three JCM estimation methods, including eigenvalue decomposition (EVD), parametric estimation method by gradient descend (PEM-GD) and parametric estimation method by alternating optimization (PEM-AO), are proposed. Here, the proposed EVD is derived according to the rank-2 constraint of JCM. The PEM-GD method fully explores the structure features of JCM and the PEM-AO is proposed to decrease the computational complexity of the former via dimensionality reduction. The simulation results show that the proposed three methods perform better than directly using sample covariance matrix. Additionally, the proposed PEM-GD and PEM-AO outperform EVD method and the clutter and disturbance covariance estimator RCML.},

As the number of satellites is highly increasing and with the radical revolution in wireless technology, eavesdropping on SatCom will be possible in next-generation networks. In this context, we introduce the satellite eavesdropping approach, where an eavesdropping spacecraft can intercept optical communications established between a low Earth orbit satellite and a high altitude platform station (HAPS). Specifically, we propose two practical eavesdropping scenarios for satellite-to-HAPS (downlink) and HAPS-to-satellite (uplink) optical communications, where the attacker spacecraft can eavesdrop on the transmitted signal or the received signal. To quantify the secrecy performance of the scenarios, the average secrecy capacity and secrecy outage probability expressions are derived and validated with Monte Carlo simulations. Moreover, the secrecy throughput of the proposed models is investigated. We observe that turbulence-induced fading significantly impacts the secrecy performance of free-space optical communication.},

The signal-to-interference plus noise ratio (SINR) is evaluated for flat and frequency-selective fading channels (FSC), where closed-form analytical expressions are derived for the flat fading case. In FSC, the SINR is obtained using Monte Carlo simulation due to the analysis intractability. The bit error rate (BER) performance of OFDM and P-OFDM based on WHT, Haar, and Zadoff-Chu matrix transforms are considered to demonstrate the STO impact on the BER using various precoding transforms. The obtained results show that the impact of STO on P-OFDM is substantially different from conventional OFDM. In particular, it is found that STO affects the SINR of each subcarrier differently, where the SINR of certain subcarriers is severely degraded while others are immune. Furthermore, the diversity gain advantage of the precoding process may vanish for large STOs.},

Secondly, according to the characteristics of semi-persistent of scheduling, we formulate the reliability equation through the principle of iteration, thereby obtaining the closed-form expression of the scheduling reliability.

This new distribution is simple, characterized in terms of physical parameters, able to model environments where the multipath fading coexists with shadowing and takes into account the clustering imbalance between the in-phase and quadrature components. For the aforementioned distribution, new expressions are derived for the probability density function (PDF); cumulative distribution function, higher-order moments and moment generating function of the instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio; joint envelope-phase PDF and amount of fading.

However, in practice, the execution time in the edge server is hard to estimate due to the complex environment, especially in Internet of Vehicles (IoV), which makes resource allocation a significant challenge. To address this problem, we propose an optimal resource allocation approach based on Federated Learning (FL). In our proposed approach, we consider both the delay and energy consumption. First, we assume that we have perfect knowledge about the execution time in the edge server, and we obtain the optimal CPU cycles which should be assigned to process 1-bit task. We also verify the Poisson property of the task arrival for each server pool in the edge server. Since we use Delay Energy Product (DEP) as our optimization target for resource allocation, we can derive the optimal balanced delay and energy performance in the scheduling. Next, we propose the Federated Learning based method to estimate the execution time in the edge server. Simulation results obtained demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.},

Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is a promising wireless communication technique to solve the problems related to spectral efficiency effectively. The index coding (IC) is a powerful method to improve spectral utilization, where a sender aims to satisfy the needs of multiple receivers with a minimum number of transmissions. By combining these two approaches, in this work, we propose a novel technique called index coded NOMA (IC-NOMA), where we apply NOMA techniques on index coded data to reduce the number of transmissions further. This work shows that the IC-NOMA system demands a specific design for index codes to reap the advantages of NOMA. We have done the feasibility analysis of the proposed method in a general scenario and proposed an index code design to integrate IC over NOMA for the best efficiency. Through detailed analytical studies it is validated that the proposed transmission system provides improved spectral efficiency and power saving compared to conventional IC systems.},

  abstract     = {The multi-hop unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) network can serve as data relays where ground users (GUs) do not have reliable direct connections to the base station (BS). Existing works mainly focus on simple dual-hop system. In this paper, we investigate the packet routing problem in a multi-hop UAV relay network to minimize the data transmission time and enhance the network throughput. However, the dynamic network topology due to UAV mobility makes the packet routing challenging since the limited communication range of each UAV leads to volatile wireless connection. Moreover, the line-of-sight communication links may cause strong interference among UAVs. Towards this end, we propose a novel multi-agent deep reinforcement learning based algorithm, named as multi-agent QMIX (MAQMIX) to: 1) design proper UAVs’ trajectories to serve the moving GUs while maintaining the network connection; 2) allocate frequency resource properly among UAVs to alleviate the impact of interference; and 3) choose a proper next hop UAV for each data packet to reduce the transmission time and probability of network congestion. The proposed MAQMIX has two novel training mechanisms, i.e., intra-UAV and inter-UAV training mechanisms, which can tackle the large action space issue and coordinate the training among UAVs in the multi-hop UAV relay network. Simulation results demonstrate that the MAQMIX outperforms baseline schemes in terms of the network congestion avoidance, throughput, and transmission time.},

Controller placement is a critical problem in SDN to achieve its robustness and flexibility with the changes of network status. Motivated by the advantages of SDN and Mobile-edge computing (MEC), this paper aims at enhancing the performance of IoV with the assistance of these two. Specifically, we consider a three-layer hierarchical SDN control plane for the IoV, where the SDN controllers are placed at the edge of networks. Under this framework, we investigate a multi-objective optimization problem on controller placement problem including delay, load balancing, and path reliability. To efficiently solve the formulated NP-hard problems, we develop an algorithm based on multi-agent deep Q-learning networks (MADQN) because of its advantages for large-scale combinatorial optimization. At last, we use multi-process technology to accelerate the operation of the algorithm, so as to complete the algorithm iteration faster. Numerical results show that the proposed methods achieve better performances than three baselines.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we propose MobiTrust, a game theoretic pricing scheme, to address the problem of ensuring trust in the edge-enabled mobile sensor-cloud (MSC) architecture for vehicular Internet-of-Things (IoT). In the edge-enabled MSC, a sensor-cloud service provider (SCSP) utilises multiple sensor-equipped vehicular IoT-based devices belonging to different owners and multiple edge devices deployed by different edge infrastructure providers (IPs) to provision Sensors-as-a-Service (Se-aaS). Since these entities are revenue-driven and they depend on each other for successful service provisioning, there is a need to establish trust among them to ensure the sustainability of MSC. Existing works on sensor-cloud address the issue of ensuring trust among selfish device-owners. However, these works do not consider the presence of IPs and assume that the IoT devices are stationary in nature, which renders them unsuitable for MSC. Therefore, in this work, we aim to address this drawback of the existing literature by proposing MobiTrust, which is comprised of two components. First, we propose a mobility-aware trust model designed based on the Transferable Belief Model, which utilizes different types of evidence collected by the devices to estimate their trust values. Second, we propose a trust-based pricing and resource allocation scheme based on the Stackelberg game that aims to maximise the profits and satisfaction of the various stakeholders. We analyze the proposed scheme theoretically and examine the existence of equilibrium in the proposed game. Results of extensive simulations show that MobiTrust increases profits for the stakeholders and QoS by 9% and 11%, respectively, compared to benchmarks.},

  abstract     = {Machine-type communications (MTC) is a key technology for Internet-of-Things (IoT) services in 5G mobile communications and beyond. An essential design problem for an MTC network is the efficient and scalable data collection from low-power machine-type communication devices (MTCDs). This paper uses unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to facilitate data collection from a clustered MTC network on the ground. The notion of artificial energy map (AEM) is introduced as a novel modeling technique for energy efficiency analysis, which is critical to the subject of investigation here considering the limited energy of battery-powered MTCDs and UAVs. The proposed design framework first determines the number of MTCD clusters &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$L_\mathrm{{opt}}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; according to a certain criterion. A greedy learning clustering (GLC) algorithm is then employed to divide the MTCDs into &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$L_\mathrm{{opt}}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; clusters. For each MTCD cluster, an AEM is constructed, and the optimal UAV hovering strategy within the cluster can be obtained accordingly. Finally, the UAV stations travel across the clusters and collect data from each cluster while hovering above it. This AEM-based modeling technique leads to a solution that can effectively improve the energy efficiency (EE) of UAV-enabled data collection. However, the MTCD clustering strategy, UAV hovering strategy, and UAV flying strategy all have impacts on the overall energy efficiency, which results in a coupled optimization problem that is difficult to solve. The GLC-AEM method is proposed to decouple the original EE optimization problem into sub-problems that can be handled easily by standard optimization techniques. Simulation results show that the GLC-AEM algorithm can be applied to UAV-enabled data collection scenarios with single and multiple UAV stations, and it can improve the overall EE effectively. Besides, the GLC-AEM algorithm shows good scalability and consistent performance in clustered MTC networks. The more MTCDs, the higher the achieved EE.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT), vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) have gradually become a research hotspot. A number of Conditional Privacy-preserving Authentication (CPPA) schemes have been proposed to protect the security and privacy of the VANETs communication. However, most of them can only provide one function between signature and signcryption, making it difficult to meet the needs of complex application scenarios. Moreover, the majority of CPPA schemes allow a Trusted Authority (TA) to expose the malicious message&#39;s sender, but they can hardly prove the authenticity of the tracking result. Therefore, we propose a new CPPA protocol to solve these problems. In our protocol, generalized ring signcryption is introduced to provide ring signature mode and ring signcryption mode in one algorithm to satisfy the different security requirements in complex application scenarios. A convenient public verification algorithm is designed to make the tracking result provable and more credible. Furthermore, we prove that our protocol achieves confidentiality, unforgeability, and Known Session-Specific Temporary Information Security (KSSTIS). We also introduce pseudonyms in our protocol to resist the ring selection attack. The performance analysis shows that our protocol has at least 61.84% improvement in computational cost compared with several similar schemes.},

Specifically, the time-expanded graph (TEG) is exploited to characterize the dynamic topology of SINs. Furthermore, although there exist multiple feasible links for SINs, only a limited number of them can be actually established due to the constraint on the number of transceivers. Traditionally the established link is fixed within one time interval in the TEG. In order to fully exploit the resource of multiple feasible links, we divide each time interval in the TEG into multiple fine-grained time periods and design the maximum flow routing strategy by jointly optimizing both the fine-grained time period duration and the link allocation as well as the amount of data transmitted on each transmission link and the amount of data stored in each caching link. This problem can be formulated as a mixed-integer quadratic program (MIQP), which is difficult to solve. To overcome this difficulty, we transform the MIQP into an equivalent mixed-integer linear program (MILP), which can be effectively solved by existing methods. Simulation results show that the proposed dynamic link allocation strategy can significantly outperform the fixed link allocation strategy within each time interval.},

  abstract     = {With the gradual popularization of self-driving, it is becoming increasingly important for vehicles to smartly make the right driving decisions and autonomously obey traffic rules by correctly recognizing traffic signs. However, for machine learning-based traffic sign recognition on the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), a large amount of traffic sign data from distributed vehicles is needed to be gathered in a centralized server for model training, which brings serious privacy leakage risk because of traffic sign data containing lots of location privacy information. To address this issue, we first exploit privacy-preserving federated learning to perform collaborative training for accurate recognition models without sharing raw traffic sign data. Nevertheless, due to the limited computing and energy resources of most devices, it is hard for vehicles to continuously undertake complex artificial intelligence tasks. Therefore, we introduce powerful Spike Neural Networks (SNNs) into traffic sign recognition for energy-efficient and fast model training, which is the next generation of neural networks and is practical and well-fitted to IoV scenarios. Furthermore, we design a novel encoding scheme for SNNs based on neuron receptive fields to extract information from the pixel and spatial dimensions of traffic signs to achieve high-accuracy training. Numerical results indicate that the proposed federated SNN outperforms traditional federated convolutional neural networks in terms of accuracy, noise immunity, and energy efficiency as well.},

Countering drones or drone swarms is thus of great significance. Some effective counter approaches for a small group of drones have been studied. However, these approaches may be insufficient to counter a large-scale drone swarm due to the lack of efficient time-saving detecting technologies. Towards this end, this paper proposes a fast counter approach to deprive the drone swarm of its coordination and clustering capabilities in a short time by splitting the drone swarm into several unconnected components. To achieve efficient splitting, two efficient algorithms for searching critical nodes are proposed, namely, the genetic algorithm and the particle swarm optimization algorithm. Extensive simulation results are presented to validate the superior performances of the proposed two algorithms for splitting the drone swarms in different formations. The results show that the drone swarms lose their coordination ability as they are forced to split into multiple components with a constraint of group size. The high accuracy and efficiency of the proposed algorithms are also verified by a series of comparative experiments.},

  abstract     = {Resource-constrained end devices can offload computation to backend clouds. The stochastic wireless channel that an end device is connected to can introduce bursty computation demand to the cloud. Specifically, under good channel conditions, a device can transmit more data to the cloud, which consequently yields higher instantaneous computation demand. Conversely, poor channel conditions can result in lower instantaneous demand. The performance indicator for such a mobile cloud computing system is the average of the response time, which is the time span from the arrival of the computation demand at the backend cloud instance to the completion of its execution. The question we target in this paper is how resources should be provisioned for the backend cloud instance to address this bursty computation demand and guarantee a desired quality-of-service (QoS), namely, a user-specified average response time. To answer this question, we model the mobile cloud computing system as two tandem queues. We analyze this queueing network using the fluid flow analysis framework, and derive the analytical relationship between the required resource capacity at the backend cloud instance and the desired QoS, given the workload generation process at the end device and the wireless channel conditions. Having obtained the required resource capacity for a desired QoS, we then determine whether it is economical to provision this resource capacity by subscribing to the traditional static instance or the recently introduced burstable instance offered by public cloud providers. Finally, trace-driven simulations validate our theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous vehicles (AVs) generate a massive amount of multi-modal data that once collected and processed through Machine Learning algorithms, enable AI-based services at the Edge. In fact, only a subset of the collected data present informative attributes to be exploited at the Edge. Therefore, extracting such a subset is of utmost importance to limit computation and communication workloads. Doing that in a distributed manner imposes the AVs to cooperate in finding an agreement on which attributes should be sent to the Edge. In this work, we address such a problem by proposing a federated feature selection (FFS) algorithm where the AVs collaborate to filter out, iteratively, the less relevant attributes in a distributed manner, without any exchange of raw data, thought two different components: a Mutual-Information-based feature selection algorithm run by the AVs and a novel aggregation function based on the Bayes theorem executed on the Edge. The FFS algorithm has been tested on two reference datasets: MAV with images and inertial measurements of a monitored vehicle, WESAD with a collection of samples from biophysical sensors to monitor a relative passenger. The numerical results show that the AVs converge to a minimum achievable subset of features with both the datasets, i.e., 24 out of 2166 (99%) in MAV and 4 out of 8 (50%) in WESAD, respectively, preserving the informative content of data.},

  abstract     = {Data collection in underwater acoustic sensor networks (UASNs) and the exposure of node location information pose a threat to the security of the entire network. Therefore, the main challenge for underwater acoustic sensor network security is to protect the security and privacy of the node locations. Compared to active attacks, the characteristics of passive attacks are indistinguishable. Therefore, this research focuses on passive attacks in underwater acoustic sensor networks, and an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV)-aided data-importance-based scheme for protecting location privacy (DIS-PLP) is proposed. The DIS-PLP comprises three main parts. First, the anchor node calculates the importance of the current data based on the historical dataset and decides whether to send data packets to the base station according to the importance result. Subsequently, an AUV privacy violation is defined, and an AUV path planning method is proposed to prevent attackers from tracking the AUV to obtain the location of the source node. Finally, to prevent nodes from waiting too long for AUVs, a secure multi-hop transmission method is proposed that uses fake source nodes to send fake source data packets to hide the real traffic. The simulation results show that the DIS-PLP offers well performance in terms of safety time and delay, which has strong practical significance for Smart Ocean to improve the level of network security.},

To explore the advantages of this edge computing-based framework, possible offloading and processing delay resulting from computation bottlenecks, and the offloading latency caused due to inter-cell interference must be properly considered. This paper thus considered a multi-class channel access mechanism for cognitive edge computing-based IoT networks where IoT users were categorized based on their quality of experience requirements. Essential IoT devices are permitted to offload to the edge server at any time following the hybrid channel access model, while delay-tolerant IoT devices are only permitted to offload to the server when the channel is idle following the overlay channel access model. Analyses were obtained for transmission rate and offloading delay to demonstrate the performance of the proposed mechanism, while important metrics such as total offloading latency and total offloading cost were investigated. The total offloading costs were formulated through the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium method. The proposed mechanism achieves lower offloading latencies and costs for both type 1 and type 2 CUs when compared with existing methods. The obtained results showed that multi-class channel access mechanisms can reduce packet offloading delay in cognitive edge computing-based IoT networks.},

  abstract     = {Recent advances in digitization, artificial intelligence, and wireless networking are revolutionizing the traditional transportation networks and the automotive industry, leading for instance to the widespread adoption of ride-sharing services and the emergence of self-driving vehicles. As a result, a considerable rise in the volume of infotainment data consumed by the vehicles’ passengers is expected. To support such traffic loads, we explore leveraging vehicles as part of the cellular infrastructure. This paper investigates and quantifies the performance gains that using Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication to form relay clusters would enable, including (1) improving opportunistic channel access to the cellular infrastructure by relaying the cluster’s traffic through the vehicle seeing the best channel quality; and (2) balancing traffic loads across cells through cluster multihoming. We introduce a stochastic geometric model allowing us to provide a deeper understanding of the possible gains associated with cluster-based opportunistic relaying and its sensitivity to the system parameters, e.g., base station density, vehicle density on the roads, etc. We develop a natural network utility maximization problem to serve as a baseline to evaluate the performance of a simpler distributed cluster management algorithm which we show to be near-optimal.

When the traffic roads become congested or the roadside units (RSUs) are unaccessed beyond the communication range, the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted vehicular edge computing network (VECN) is considered as a potential solution. In this paper, we propose a learning based channel allocation and task offloading strategy in temporary UAV-assisted VECNs from a user perspective, in which the UAV passing temporarily can serve as the relay and edge computing node to support the decision making system. However, the limited available computation resources and time-varying communication channel states make it critical to process the received computing tasks. To address the above mentioned challenges, we design an efficient data transmission strategy combined the long-term evolution vehicle-to-everything (LTE-V2X) and time-division multiple access (TDMA) technologies firstly, then, we propose a multi-option task processing scheme, a service cost minimization problem is proposed where the integral decisions of channel allocation and task processing mode selection are jointly optimized. Under dynamic computing resources and the current data transmission conditions, the UAV selects an optimal task processing service model based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm. Simulation results show the proposed strategy greatly improves the data transmission efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Edge computing has been regarded as an enabling technology for supporting future smart applications, such as industrial Internet of Things. In this paper, a novel computation offloading framework for edge computing is proposed. Unlike existing studies, this work considers that end users can intentionally reserve some time for local pre-processing before requesting the computation offloading service (instead of always declaring their offloading requests immediately when heavy-duty tasks are generated). By doing so, each task’s offloading cost may decrease because of less edge resource demand, while the delay cost may increase due to the later report of its offloading request. Furthermore, end users can select their preferred priority levels in the offloading scheduling by paying premium service charges. To maximize the individual utility, each end user may strategically and jointly determine its local pre-processing time-length and priority selection in computation offloading. For characterizing strategic interactions among end users and the quality-of-service (QoS) of the scheduling system with congested nature, a computation offloading game built upon a queueing model is formulated. On top of this, a revenue maximization problem for the interest of edge operator is also investigated. Simulations evaluate the performance of the proposed solution, and shows its superiority over counterparts.},

  abstract     = {The deployed vehicles in an Internet of Vehicles (IoV) can take intelligent decisions by means of exchanging the real-time traffic-related information between the vehicles and IoV infrastructures. This further reduces the probability of the traffic jams and accidents. However, the insecure (public) communication among the various entities in IoV makes various security threats and attacks that can be launched by passive/active adversaries present in the network. In view of this context, there is a need of an efficient cryptographic primitive which can produce single compact signature. A multi-signature scheme (MSS) empowers a collection of signers to conjointly sign a given message using a single compact signature that can be verified by any verifier. Herein, we put forward a new identity-based multivariate MSS, namely MV-MSS , which is built on top of the intractability of multivariate-quadratic (MQ) problem. The fact is that multivariate public key cryptosystem provides fast, post-quantum safe and efficient primitives, which makes it the front runner candidate among the post-quantum cryptographic candidates. MV-MSS is proven to be secure in the existential unforgeability under chosen-message and chosen identity attack model if solving the MQ problem is NP-hard. We then incorporate the designed MV-MSS in IoV application where the leader (cluster head) selected from a group of vehicles in a dynamic cluster forms the multi-signatures on the messages securely received from its member vehicles. Later, the messages along with their multi-signatures are forwarded to the nearby road-side unit (RSU) of the cluster head, which are then forwarded to a cloud server in the blockchain center maintained by a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) cloud servers network. In this way, the messages and their signatures considered as transactions are put in blocks and added into a public blockchain with the help of consensus algorithm. A comparative study among the proposed MV-MSS and other existing schemes shows that MV-MSS is efficient and secure as compared to other schemes. Finally, a blockchain implementation through simulation study has been performed to show its practical use in IoV application.},

  abstract     = {Traffic patterns of urban road intersections are important in traffic monitoring and accident prediction, thus play crucial roles in urban traffic management. Although real-time traffic information is consistently provided by surveillance cameras equipped at road intersections, the sparsity of surveillance distribution poses great challenges in performing a complete real-time traffic pattern analysis. To tackle that, existing works either assume that the traffic patterns are static, or assume a multi-variant distribution model for intersection traffic volumes. The former assumption neglects the temporal features of traffic patterns, and the latter is limited in capturing fine-grained spatiotemporal dependencies. To tackle the problem, we propose a novel framework, SpatioTemporal-Generative Adversarial Network (ST-GAN), that exploits deep spatiotemporal features of urban networks and offers accurate traffic pattern inferences with incomplete surveillance information. The ST-GAN framework incorporates a modified GCN network wired with the encoder-decoder mechanism and an LSTM network, which are further boosted by an iterative adversarial training process. Comprehensive experiments on real datasets show that ST-GAN achieves better inference accuracies than state-of-the-art solutions.},

With the number of users increasing dramatically and user demands diversifying, multi-server architecture was proposed to solve issues on lack of service resources that single-server architecture remains. However, multi-server architecture faces a series of challenges in applications, such as security and authentication efficiency requirements. Thus, many authenticated key agreement (AKA) protocols are presented, yet most of them require unacceptable computation and communication overhead, which is inefficient indeed. In this paper, we propose an adaptive secure handover authenticated key agreement protocol for multi-server architecture. Specifically, broadcast mechanism is utilized to assist users to select appropriate service providers with the lowest cost. Users can realize efficient handover authentication with multiple servers in the proposed scheme, that is, after completing initial authentication, users can switch to other servers and complete authentication through simple operations. Security analysis shows the proposed protocol can meet all security requirements and compared with other relevant protocols, it greatly reduces the computation and communication overhead. In addition, the above advantages grow significantly as the number of servers to be authenticated increases.},

The features of the proposed cellular network include: small base stations (SBSs) are equipped with directional antennas; the beam boresight directions of antennas are adaptively adjusted with the locations of users on the two-dimensional horizontal plane while the boresight directions are perfectly aligned with their associated users. In addition, an angle fading model, which follows from the exponential distribution, is developed to simulate the signals attenuation of interference links. The angle fading of the interference signals depends on the angle offset between the locations of users and the beam boresight directions of their interfering SBSs. With the assistance of stochastic geometry, the analytical expressions of coverage probability and average ergodic rate are derived by combining with the probability density function of angle offset variable. Then, the meta distribution of SIR is obtained to capture the performance changes of individual links for users. The numerical results indicate that the performance advantages of the proposed directional network obviously exceed that of the conventional isotropic antennas case.

  abstract     = {This article studies the transmit beamforming security in the dual-functional radar-communication (DFRC) system, where the radar beam also serves as the artificial jamming to suppress potential eavesdropper channels. Unlike previous researches, which assumed that the lone target might be a potential eavesdropper on the adversary side, this paper analyses a more generic scenario in which the eavesdroppers’ channel state information (CSI) is unknown. The eavesdropping rate should be limited to guarantee transmission confidentiality, which is intractable owing to the unknown CSI. To address this issue, we present the long-term eavesdropping signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) as a more tractable security metric. Based on the long-term eavesdropping SINR, the sum rate maximization (SRM) and jamming power maximization (JPM) transmission scheme are investigated. For the SRM scheme, we propose a zero-forcing (ZF) suboptimal algorithm to solve the non-convex fractional programming (FP) problem, and for the JPM scheme, the resultant problem is solved via the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) technique. Finally, numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed beamforming approaches.},

To this end, both inter- and intra-numerology interference (inter-NI and intra-NI) should be suppressed, which is not straightforward. This paper proposes a novel zero-forcing (ZF) precoding design, which perfectly eliminates all the interference, for massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with multi-numerology. First of all, we express the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of the multi-numerology system with spectrum sharing. From the SINR representation, we identify the channels that precoders must nullify to suppress inter-NI. After that, we propose a ZF precoder suppressing both inter-NI and intra-NI perfectly. The lower bound of ergodic achievable rate with perfect channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) is analyzed. Based on the lower bound of ergodic achievable rate, we present the feasible rate region. Also, we propose two power allocation schemes: user fairness and the ergodic sum rate maximization. The simulation results demonstrate the advantage of the proposed precoding design and verify our analysis results.},

A practical energy receiver (ER) with multiple antennas is investigated. Multiple RF energy flows gleaned by all the receive antennas are input multiple energy harvesters, which are further rectified to direct-current (DC) energy. The resultant multiple DC energy flows are then combined in the DC domain for energy storage. Three classic waveforms, namely deterministic waveform, M-QAM waveform, and Gaussian waveform, are considered for WPT. We maximize the output DC power by jointly designing the active transmit beamformer of the transmitter and the passive reflecting beamformer of the IRS with the above-mentioned waveforms, respectively, subject to the transmit power constraint at the transmitter and to the limited resolution constraints on the phase-shifters of the IRS. A low complexity alternating optimization (AO) algorithm is proposed, which converges to a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point and thus results in a locally optimal solution. The numerical results demonstrate that the Gaussian waveform has the best energy performance with a low input RF power to the energy harvesters. By contrast, the deterministic waveform becomes superior with a high input RF power to the energy harvesters.},

Then, unstructured and structured neural network (NN) pruning algorithms are proposed to reduce the per-sample computational complexity and the required memory, without compromising their modeling performance. The mathematical equations of the complexity and the memory are derived to analyze the hardware cost and design low cost models. An experimental platform is developed to measure the modeling performance in terms of adjacent channel leakage ratio (ACLR), normalized mean square error, error vector magnitude (EVM) and bit error rate. The platform uses an envelope tracking PA excited by 80 MHz IEEE 802.11ac signals.

Furthermore, an observation path with time alignment is used to remove the transmit latency in the state-of-the-art approach. At 3.15 dB gain compression, the proposed models outperform the state-of-the-art feedforward and convolutional NN models by at least 1.3 dB in EVM, outperform the general memory polynomial model by at least 3.3 dB in EVM. The above evidences indicate that the proposed RNN models can be implemented with relatively low hardware cost and achieve the best EVM in high power efficiency scenario.},

  abstract     = {Due to the combined effects of different acoustic propagation, reflection patterns in different time-scale, time-varying underwater acoustic (UWA) channel generally exhibits hybrid sparsity, i.e., contains not only rapidly time-varying elements, but also stationary or slowly time-varying ones. While the classic sparse reconstruction algorithms such as orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) generally do not take it into account, the existence of static multipath will unavoidably hinder the tracking of rapid time variations. In this paper, a sequential adaptive observation length orthogonal matching pursuit (SAOLOMP) approach is proposed to sequentially explore rapidly time-varying sparsity in a two-step sequential manner. Specifically, the static components are firstly separated via simultaneous orthogonal matching pursuit (SOMP) among continuous measurements. Upon the residual error of the SOMP, the measurement-wise OMP is applied for estimating the remained dynamic components. As the variation of the SOMP residual error indicates how rapidly the remained dynamic multipath components vary, the observation length of the OMP is adjusted according to the gradient of residual error to adapt to rapidly time-varying components. Finally, both types of sparse components are summed up to obtain the whole channel response. Numerical simulations as well as experimental results from field UWA communication data show that the proposed algorithm exhibits better performance in exploiting rapidly time-varying sparsity than the state-of-the-art compressive methods do under UWA channel.},

This article proposes sub-GHz two-way ranging based on phase detection which offers high tolerance against reference clock offset between a pair of transceiver devices and a novel compensation scheme against multipath effects. We present the operation principle and theoretical performance under a two-path model of radio propagation and additive white Gaussian noise.

However, most of the existing works only focus on guaranteeing the communication covertness, while they ignore the information freshness and energy consumption which are important for the delay-sensitive applications and energy-constrained devices. In this work, we propose an energy-efficient transmit probability-power control scheme for covert D2D communication with the information freshness requirement. Specifically, we first construct a novel status update model in covert D2D communication, and further derive the closed-form average age of information (AoI) to characterize the freshness of status information. Then, from the perspective of warden, we analyze its detection performance and derive the minimum detection error probability to measure the communication covertness. Subsequently, from the perspective of D2D pair, we propose the notion of covert energy efficiency (EE) to characterize the tradeoff between covert rate and power consumption. Guided by this, we jointly optimize the transmit probability and transmit power of status information to maximize the covert EE of the D2D pair subject to the constraints of communication covertness and information freshness. Due to its intractability, we design an iterative algorithm based on the successive convex approximation (SCA) approach. Simulation results verify the correctness of derived expressions and show the effectiveness of our proposed scheme.},

Since the joint UA and PC problem is a mixed-integer problem, it is challenging to develop a joint UA and PC algorithm that closely achieves the optimal proportional fairness (PF) performance while satisfying the tight computation time budget of recent 3GPP standards. Although previous studies have reduced the computation time on the UA and PC by employing a fully-connected-neural network (FCN), the FCN architecture is not generally applicable to dynamic HetNets because of a varying number of users. In pursuit of scalable neural network design, we propose an unsupervised learning-based UA and PC algorithm using a recurrent neural network (RNN). Notably, in the RNN-based UA, we relax the combinatorial UA variable into a low-dimensional continuous variable, the length of which is invariant to the number of users. The optimality loss in the variable relaxation is upper-bounded by the negligibly small duality gap. Through extensive experiments, we show that the proposed scheme has a 10% higher PF performance than conventional optimization-based methods with the same number of flops and closely achieves the optimal PF performance for various numbers of users.},

Moreover, the proposed RM-PI-DCSK has one more modulation bit in the reference segment than the conventional permutation index differential chaos shift keying (PI-DCSK). Both the reference signal in the first time-slot and a permuted replica of the reference in the second time-slot are modulated for efficient transmission. The theoretical bit-error-rate (BER) performance and the highly consistent simulation results demonstrate that the proposed RM-PI-DCSK can achieve a performance gain 3 dB over the conventional PI-DCSK at a BER of &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$10^{-4}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; , and this gain becomes larger in a high-delay-spread channel. In particular, the performance superiority of the RM-PI-DCSK is further demonstrated in a typical ultra-wideband (UWB) channel with narrow-band interference.

Inspired by this, we propose a computationally efficient fully-digital beamformer relying on low-resolution ADCs/DACs for multi-user mmWave communication networks. Both a generalized (unstructured) beamformer (GB) and a structured zero-forcing beamformer (ZFB) are proposed. For maintaining fairness among all users in the network, specifically tailored objective functions are considered under sum-power constraints, namely that of maximizing the geometric mean (GM) of users’ rate and their max-min rate. These computationally challenging beamforming design problems are tackled by developing computationally efficient steep ascent algorithms, which have the radical benefit of relying on a closed-form solution at each iteration. Moreover, to facilitate the employment of low-cost amplifiers at each antenna, the GB design problem subject to the equal-gain transmission constraint is considered, which assigns equal transmit power to each transmit antenna. The proposed algorithms promise a user-rate distribution having a reduced deviation among the user-rates, i.e., improved rate-fairness. Our extensive simulation results show an approximately upto 45% reduction for the GM-rate of a 2-bit ADC (4-bin quantization) compared to the &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\infty$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -resolution ADC.},

FDA employs small frequency increments across the element indices which yields angle-range dependent beamspace. Herein, an equivalent radiate beamspace is designed to serve the users. Further, to ensure user equity, we formulate objective function to max-min achievable sum rate subject to power allocation and BS equivalent FDA transmit beamspace along the users. Since the problem is not convex, a boundary-compressed Bat meta-heuristic optimization algorithm is devised to provide a sub-optimal solution by optimizing the frequency increments to synthesis the BS beamspace along the users. The achievable secrecy rate, cost efficiency (CE), economic efficiency (ECE), and secrecy energy efficiency (SEE) are derived for the users. Both theoretical analysis and simulation results indicate that the proposed scheme would constitute an excellent nominee for 5G mmWave NOMA communication applications.},

  abstract     = {Radio signal recognition has a wide application in future communication systems and the vehicular communication, whose core is the extraction of signal features such as electromagnetic fingerprints. With the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, deep learning has made amazing breakthroughs in image recognition, speech recognition and other fields. Deep learning is applied to electromagnetic fingerprint extraction in this paper. Firstly, thousands of the downlink aircraft communications addressing and reporting system (ACARS) signals used for communication between civil aircraft and airport tower are collected and generated. Then a pre-transformation network suitable for electromagnetic signals is constructed to convert one-dimensional signals into two-dimensional feature maps, and afterwards the feature maps are input into the convolutional neural network (CNN) for classification. By adopting the attention modules, the classification results were improved by a few percentage points over the baseline with a little cost. The method proposed in this paper achieves an accuracy rate of 94.1% and can obtain the aircraft type in a shorter time than traditional method. Moreover, the robustness of the proposed model in response to additive Gaussian white noise (AWGN) and phase deviation is studied and tested.},

The conventional range-Doppler processing has its limits in attaining a high-resolution RV map with few samples. Moreover, the conventional range-Doppler processing may cause severe range migration problems and bias in the range estimation. In this paper, we propose to attain a high-resolution and accurate RV map with the sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) framework. Unlike the existing works that use the discrete Fourier transform to build the dictionary for sparse representation, we build a dictionary from a model of the wide-band frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar to avoid the model mismatch problem. This dictionary allows for the effective decomposition of the signal and the full utilization of the structure of the signal. In addition, based on the fast marginal likelihood maximization, we also propose a fast method to reduce the computational burden. Simulations show that the proposed method and the proposed fast method are superior in terms of resolution, accuracy, and maximum unambiguous velocity compared with the existing methods.},

  abstract     = {Adaptive bitrate streaming can confront dynamic environment and satisfy multifarious user requirements by encoding video files into different bitrate versions. It can significantly improve the user quality of experience (QoE). But at the same time, it can also lead to a further increase in video data volume. The interaction of massive video data tends to aggravate network congestion and increase transmission energy, which triggers new challenges for wireless networks in terms of delivery delay and energy consumption. In this paper, taking different video sizes and playback rate requirements into account, we aim to minimize the weighted sum of delivery delay and energy consumption for adaptive video streaming. The problem is formulated by jointly optimizing caching, computing and power allocation, which turns out to be a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem. To tackle it, a joint caching, computing and power allocation (JCCPA) algorithm is proposed. More specifically, the original problem is decomposed into two subproblems: 1) power allocation problem and 2) joint caching placement and computing decision problem. The power allocation problem is proved to be a quasi-convex problem, and the closed-form solution is derived. With the optimal transmit power, the joint caching placement and computing decision problem is further divided into two subproblems, which are solved in an iterative manner. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can effectively reduce the weighted sum of delivery delay and energy consumption (outperforms the baselines around 5%–12% within a certain range).},

However, in the practical communication systems, the CSI is unknown and needs to be estimated. In particular, channel estimation is more difficult when the relay adopts a hybrid precoding structure. In this paper, we propose an efficient channel estimation scheme based on Tucker-2 tensor model for a multi-way massive MIMO hybrid relay system. The proposed algorithm provides all the CSI involved in the communication links at each user end. Compared with traditional channel estimation algorithms, the proposed algorithm has better estimation performance and requires few iterations to achieve convergence.

The objective is to minimize the outage probability of GT-to-UAV transmissions. Optimal placement of UAVs under different UAV altitude constraints and GT densities is studied. A practical variant of the Rician fading model, which has been developed by Azari et al. (2018) specifically for UAV systems, is used to model the communication channels. First, the structure of optimal deployments is determined when the common altitude constraint is large. For a wide class of GT densities, it is shown that all UAVs should be placed to the same location in an optimal deployment. A design implication is that one can use a single multi-antenna UAV as opposed to multiple single-antenna UAVs without loss of optimality. Next, using a random deployment argument, a general upper bound on the optimal outage probability is found for any density of GTs and any number of UAVs. Further, for any arbitrary user density, centralized and distributed numerical algorithms are designed using particle swarm optimization and modified gradient descent algorithms, respectively. Simulations show that our distributed algorithm provides almost optimal results even with considerably reduced communication and sensing ranges at the UAVs.},

Thanks to the high mobility and flexibility, UAVs can be deployed in many scenarios to provide various types of services. In these scenarios, the position of the UAVs must be timely and accurately acquired to avoid UAV collisions and realize millimeter-wave beamforming. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a potential approach to fulfill localization under GPS-denied environment. However, it has the drawbacks of high complexity and relative large localization error. In this article, we consider the UAV localization problem based on improved PSO, which aims at reducing complexity and localization error. We firstly analyze the performance metrics and performance bounds of conventional PSO in the considered UAV localization scenario. Then, the particle initialization process is reconsidered, where a particle and search space reduction method is introduced as the hierarchical PSO (HPSO). Next, the particle updating schemes are redesigned based on the particle number, where the reference best particle is introduced to deal with the limitations in conventional PSO, this is called reference PSO (RPSO). Lastly, the proposed HPSO and RPSO are validated in simulation results. It is shown that the proposed PSO method has both reduced complexity and localization error compared with conventional PSO and other reference methods.},

Exploiting the inherent nature of sporadic transmissions in the grant-free NOMA systems, compressed sensing based multiuser detection (CS-MUD) has been deemed as a powerful solution to user activity detection (UAD) and data detection (DD). In this paper, block coordinate descend (BCD) method is employed in CS-MUD to reduce the computational complexity. We propose two modified BCD based algorithms, called enhanced BCD (EBCD) and complexity reduction enhanced BCD (CR-EBCD), respectively. To be specific, by incorporating a novel candidate set pruning mechanism into the original BCD framework, our proposed EBCD algorithm achieves remarkable CS-MUD performance improvement. In addition, the proposed CR-EBCD algorithm further ameliorates the proposed EBCD by eliminating the redundant matrix multiplications during the iteration process. As a consequence, compared with the proposed EBCD algorithm, our proposed CR-EBCD algorithm enjoys two orders of magnitude complexity saving without any CS-MUD performance degradation, rendering it a viable solution for future mMTC scenarios.

Specifically, the HAP can extend the network coverage and LAPs can act as relays to improve the transmission performance for hot spots. In the considered network, we investigate the sum rate maximization problem by optimizing the downlink and the uplink transmissions, respectively. In the downlink, we adopt the orthogonal frequency division multiple access technique and take the basic rate requirement into account. In addition, we optimize the height of LAPs and the spectrum allocation between the HAP and LAPs, and between the LAP and users. Then, we decouple the downlink sum rate maximation problem as three subproblems. An alternating optimization framework is designed to deal with these non-convex optimization problems, where the height and spectrum allocation are tackled in turn. In the uplink, we adopt the non-orthogonal multiple access technique, and consider the decoding threshold of the successive interference cancellation technique. Afterward, we optimize the power allocation of each user, and the spectrum allocation between users and the LAP, and between LAPs and the HAP. Finally, simulation results show the effects of spectrum allocation, height optimization and power allocation on network performance, which verify that the proposed scheme can achieve higher sum rate on both downlink and uplink in comparison with the current works.},

To begin with, we analyze the average AoI and derive a general upper bound for G/G/1 systems with a certain outage probability. Subsequently, for an M/M/1 system with the FCFS scheme, we obtain a concise closed-form expression of the upper bound, and further refine the upper bound after analyzing the relative error. Interestingly, it is found by the analysis that the relative error is independent of the service rate, and the upper bound becomes tighter as the outage probability increases. Based on the refined upper bound, we minimize the average AoI for the communications suffering from block Rayleigh fading. We derive a closed-form expression of the outage probability over a fading channel, and then prove that the refined upper bound is a convex function with respect to the average update generating rate. Consequently, we optimize the AoI performance by solving a convex optimization problem formulated utilizing the refined upper bound expression. The numerical results indicate that the minimum average AoI can be reduced by either increasing the service rate or the transmission power.},

Because of those features, RIS has been considered to be integrated into the wireless vehicular network (WVN), which is characterized by high mobility and high quality of service (QoS) requirements. Hence, similar to relaying systems, a vehicle needs to select the best available RIS that maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the receiver. Inspired by that, in this paper, we introduce the partial RIS selection for enhancing capacity and reducing error rate. We derive closed-form expressions for the ergodic capacity, symbol error probability (SEP), and energy efficiency for a partial RIS selection design. Besides, we compare its performances to the partial relaying design while considering: decode-and-forward (DF) and amplify-and-forward fixed gain (AF). Moreover, we consider a wireless attack scenario, where an eavesdropper intends to overhear the transmitted signal at the receiver’s end. Then, we compare partial RIS to partial relay selection from this security perspective, where we derive closed-form expressions for the average secrecy capacity. Furthermore, we compare the partial RIS selection to a single RIS architecture scenario from the literature, where our solution outperforms the related existing work.},

  abstract     = {In this research, we propose a novel vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) visible light communications (VLC)-based system model under shadowing. Shadowing significantly affects the path loss, which arises due to the blockage of the line-of-sight path, on the VLC link performance. Moreover, we analyze the performance of the considered system using the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) metric. Note that DMT provides an optimal tradeoff between the diversity gain and the multiplexing gain. Further, DMT provides the operating points which play a significant role in the design of the communication system. In this research, we first model the V2V-VLC system based on the probabilistic behavior of the shadowing, followed by analyzing the corresponding DMT. In addition, we investigate the optimal DMT for a practical transmission scenario, where there is a possibility that the VLC link may experience an outage. Furthermore, we investigate the system performance under the atmospheric turbulence conditions. Finally, the entire study and the subsequent analysis is acknowledged by means of useful remarks and interesting observations that have not been previously identified in the literature.},

The positional awareness merely based on GPS or local sensors has an error margin of around 10 meters, which can worsen in uncertain real-time conditions such as road topology and highway traffic. The paper analyses the relation between vehicle dynamics, beamforming, and beam alignment for highly directive antennas. When the subsystem models presented in this paper are taken into consideration, the joint vehicle dynamics-beamforming approach will optimize the link connectivity and SNR. The vehicle dynamics model is designed to be more realistic considering the non-linear acceleration based on the throttle-brake jerks due to induced noises. The Unscented Kalman Filter based prediction subsystem predicts the alignment values even during non-linear acceleration and jerks. The feasibility of antenna design for the beamforming strategies is supported by the requirements of phase shifters and the number of elements.},

  abstract     = {We present an approach to automatically generate semantic labels for real recordings of automotive range-Doppler (RD) radar spectra. Such labels are required when training a neural network for object recognition from radar data. The automatic labeling approach rests on the simultaneous recording of camera and lidar data in addition to the radar spectrum. By warping radar spectra into the camera image, state-of-the-art object recognition algorithms can be applied to label relevant objects, such as cars, in the camera image. The warping operation is designed to be fully differentiable, which allows backpropagating the gradient computed on the camera image through the warping operation to the neural network operating on the radar data. As the warping operation relies on accurate scene flow estimation, we further propose a novel scene flow estimation algorithm which exploits information from camera, lidar and radar sensors. The proposed scene flow estimation approach is compared against a state-of-the-art scene flow algorithm, and it outperforms it by approximately 30% w.r.t. mean average error. The feasibility of the overall framework for automatic label generation for RD spectra is verified by evaluating the performance of neural networks trained with the proposed framework for Direction-of-Arrival estimation.},

Introducing the Lie group theory to the DVL calibration study for the first time, and taking advantage of the Special Orthogonal Group of order 3 [SO(3)] representation, a new DVL calibration model based SO(3) group with the ability to represent large misalignment angles is established. And an invariant extended Kalman filter (IEKF) design for the DVL calibration model is introduced. Then, a robust IEKF is proposed by combining the linear error propagation equation of the SO(3)-based DVL calibration model with the statistical similarity measure (SSM) theory. The proposed robust IEKF algorithm enriches the IEKF theory and has the ability to accurately estimate the state of the Lie group model in outlier environments. The simulation and lake trial are used to illustrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed DVL calibration method.},

Further, significant efforts focus on developing monitoring systems for abnormal driving conditions such as wheel spinning and sliding that can increase the operating environment’s hazards and speed up the wearing-off process. Thus, these events play a primary role in influencing the safety of the involved humans and determining the vehicle’s lifespan and the incurred maintenance costs because of the encumbrances by the generated vibrations and shocks. However, the existing measurement systems are not entirely digitized, and their initial development did not concern the concept of functional safety like redundancy to be used in safety-critical environments. Further, the current systems depend on a costly sensory system that requires strict and complex installation procedures. Therefore, the prevention of wheel spinning and sliding events by a safety-related miniaturized digital intelligent monitoring system comes to a corresponding meaning. Accordingly, this research work investigates the development of a novel safety-related platform following the standard IEC 61508 for monitoring and controlling abnormal driving conditions through vibration sensors incorporated with rotation sensors. The research work tests the novel system on a prototype vehicle where the conducted experiments prove the system’s capability to detect the events with reasonable accuracy. Further, this novel approach’s evaluation shows that the system represents a significant enhancement for various similar researches and applications.},

These schemes either provide vehicle user’s query privacy or LBS server’s data privacy. Some of the oblivious transfer (OT) protocol-based LBS schemes preserve vehicle users’ query privacy and LBS server’s data privacy. However, the OT-based LBS schemes do not preserve vehicle user’s identity privacy. Moreover, the efficiency (communication and computation costs) of the OT protocol-based LBS schemes depends on the LBS server’s database size, which is very high. In this work, we propose an anonymous linkable location-based services (AL2BS) scheme using linkable ring signcryption technique. The scheme provides vehicle user’s query privacy and LBS server’s data privacy without revealing the vehicle user’s identity. The efficiency of the AL2BS scheme is independent of the size of the LBS server’s database. The AL2BS scheme requires only one pairing operation on both ends and a few point multiplications. The theoretical and experimental results show that the performance of the AL2BS scheme in terms of communication and computation costs is better than the existing LBS schemes.},

Logistics companies especially keep trying to utilize drones for fast delivery following the growing market size of e-commerce. Accordingly, methods for safely operating multi-drone have been researched, and many researchers have proposed various optimal or near-optimal routing methods. However, such methods have some problems that cause routing failures or huge routing computation time in a drone-dense space due to many collisions. In this paper, we propose a centralized framework that deals with enormous collisions and obtains collision-free paths rapidly. We first build a drone energy consumption model with a data-driven method using flight experiment data of a commercial drone to estimate the drone battery state-of-charge (SoC). Then, we develop a novel routing method that generates collision-free paths by considering both the congestion of the space and the SoC of each drone. The proposed method is inspired by the VLSI circuit routing method that connects all signal nets among thousands of logic components. Through numerous delivery routing simulations, we confirm that the proposed method achieves a maximum of 6 times higher routing success rate with a 10x faster runtime compared with the state-of-the-art optimal method. In addition, we validate that the proposed method is applicable to delivery routing problems with various drone battery capacities.},

Ringing is one of the main causes of communication errors and performance degradation. In this paper, a ringing suppression system is proposed, which alleviates the impedance mismatch at two mismatch locations: the unterminated CAN nodes and the divergence points of bus lines. At the unterminated CAN nodes, a temporal impedance switching circuit, including a matching resistor and a limiting diode, is added. The circuit is controlled to only engage right after a dominant-to-recessive transition when ringing likely occurs. At the divergence points, a frequency-selective impedance matching circuit is inserted. The circuit consists of a resistor, a capacitor, and an inductor connected in parallel, which is also designed to activate only during state transitions with the dependency of their impedance on frequency. Thus, the side effects on CAN-FD operations can be prevented. The performance of the ringing suppression system is verified by experiments. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system reduces ringing to a level lower than the input threshold for recessive bit detection in diverse bus configurations and supports more reliable CAN-FD communication.},

In order to improve the steady-state performances, a four-vector phase model predictive voltage control (FV-PMPVC) is proposed in this paper. Due to the spatial distribution of phase voltage vector (PVV), an orthometric synthesis principle (OSP) is proposed to calculated the duration time for the vector synthesis, which reduces the computation burden and enhances the robustness. Comparing the existing control method, FV-PMPVC can get similar dynamic performances but better steady-state performances. Additionally, the half-centralized topology using FV-PMPVC can have same speed range while less VSIs are required. The effectiveness of FV-PMPVC is verified by experimental results.},

While the vertical dynamics and related compensation techniques are extensively covered by the suspension control literature, the longitudinal dynamics on uneven road surfaces are less frequently addressed, and are significantly influenced by the tires and suspension systems. The relatively slow response of internal combustion engines does not allow any form of active compensation of the effect of road irregularities. However, in-wheel electric powertrains, in conjunction with pre-emptive control based on the information on the road profile ahead, have some potential for effective compensation, which, however, has not been explored yet. This paper presents a proof-of-concept nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) implementation based on road preview, which is preliminarily assessed with a simulation model of an all-wheel drive electric vehicle with in-wheel motors, including a realistic tire model for ride comfort simulation. The major improvement brought by the proposed road preview controller is evaluated through objective performance indicators along multiple maneuvers, and is confirmed by the comparison with two benchmarking feedback controllers from the literature.},

  abstract     = {This article focuses on target search in dynamic environments using multiple solar-powered unmanned aerial vehicles (SUAVs) with the probability map method. First, the energy model of the SUAV and an external solar environment model are established. Second, the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is used to extract the prior probability distribution of the target to obtain multiple search areas composed of two-dimensional Gaussian distributions. Then, dynamic task allocation of the SUAVs based on the environment is performed utilizing the GMM information. Next, the SUAVs search for the target according to the assignment and plan a path with the energy model and probability established before, and the probability map is updated in real time according to the detection result of the SUAVs and the velocity vector field of the environment. In this study, two probability map update methods, namely the equivalent area iteration (EAI) and probability estimated diffusion (PED) methods, are proposed for the situations of precise and imprecise environmental information, respectively. Finally, comparative simulations are carried out for these two different situations to prove the improvement obtained using SUAVs.},

Traditional path finding algorithms are hard to adequately obtain optimal paths in real-time under fast time-varying and poor communication environments. We propose an online optimal control algorithm for USs based on a one-way broadcast communication mode under the assumption of a poor communication environment, mobile targets, radars (or sonar), and missiles (or torpedoes). With the principle of receding horizon control, optimal (or suboptimal) paths are then generated by the approximation theory of neural networks and gradient optimization techniques, with low computation requirements. Also, we give a convergence analysis for our algorithm, and show that each agent can reach its target in finite time under some conditions on agents, targets and radar-missiles. Moreover, simulations demonstrate that the agents in USs can generate optimal (or suboptimal) paths in real time using our algorithm while effectively avoiding collision with other agents or detection by enemy radars.},

  abstract     = {Electric vehicles (EVs) are being actively adopted as a solution to sustainable transportation. However, a bottleneck remains with charging, where two of the main problems are the long charging time and the range anxiety of EV drivers. In this research, we investigate the deployment of dynamic charging systems, i.e., electrified roads that wirelessly charge EVs on the go, with a view to accelerating EV adoption rate. We propose a traffic-based deployment strategy, statistically quantify its impact, and apply the strategy to two case studies of real traffic in New York City (USA) and Xi’an (China). We find that our analytical estimates not only closely match the real data, but they also suggest that dynamic charging considerably extends the driving range of popular EV models in urban mobility. For example, when only 5% of the existing roads in New York City are equipped with this technology, an EV model such as the Nissan Leaf will approximately maintain its battery level without stopping to recharge. If the percentage of charging roads is increased to 10%, then the Leaf will gain nearly 10% of its battery after every 40 kilometers of driving. Our framework provides a solution to public and private organizations that support and facilitate vehicle electrification through charging infrastructure.},

  abstract     = {The health status of the running gear in high-speed trains changes dynamically with time in a complete life cycle. Running gear systems composed of many coupled components are complex, and health statuses of which are difficult to predict in real time through a traditional health status prediction scheme. Lately, belief rule base (BRB), which is able to combine quantitative information and expert knowledge, has shown excellent expression in modeling complex systems. In the procedure of health status prediction, expert expertise can sufficiently enhance the accuracy and efficiency of this model. Therefore, this paper puts forwards a real-time health status prediction framework based on a multi-layer BRB with priority scheduling strategies for running gears. In the first-layer BRB, a time-series prediction model of multiple module BRB considering complete features is established. In the second-layer model, grey relation analysis (GRA) is employed in priority scheduling strategies of features. The third-layer BRB is used for assessing the health status of running gears by combining the features. In addition, the initial parameters of all module BRB given by experts may not be precise. Accordingly, the initial parameters in the BRB are updated by the recursive algorithm online. Finally, the proposed method is tested on the testing platform in running gears. The results make it clear the proposed method can predict the health status of running gears with much accuracy in real time.},

  abstract     = {Vehicle automation seeks to enhance road safety and improve the driving experience. However, a standard system does not account for variations in users and driving conditions. Customizing vehicle automation based on users’ preferences aims to improve the user experience and adoption of the technologies. This study introduces a systematic paradigm that starts with naturalistic driving data to identify the driving behaviors and styles for a customized automated lane change system. The driving behaviors are first extracted using Multivariate Functional Principal Component Analysis (MFPCA) with minimum prior expert knowledge. The driving styles are identified by clustering the extracted driving behaviors. An Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) algorithm is then used to train the automated lane change system from grouped demonstrations of the identified driving styles to capture the preferences of a group of drivers with a similar driving style. The performance of the proposed customized automated lane change system is compared to (1) a non-customized system trained on all the sample trips, (2) customized systems built on expert-coded reward functions, and (3) customized systems trained using a Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) algorithm. The results show that our method outperforms all the other systems with respect to the prediction accuracy of the lane change actions. Additionally, our method gains insights on the representative behaviors of different driving styles to enable customization of automated lane change systems.},

  abstract     = {With the development of transportation and the ever-improving of vehicular technology, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been popularized in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), especially in Traffic Flow Prediction (TFP). TFP plays an increasingly important role in alleviating traffic pressure caused by regional emergencies and coordinating resource allocation in advance to deployment decisions. However, existing research can hardly model the original intricate structural relationships of the transportation network (TN) due to the lack of in-depth consideration of the dynamic relevance of spatial, temporal, and periodic characteristics. Motivated by this and combined with deep learning (DL), we propose a novel framework entitled Fully Dynamic Self-Attention Spatio-Temporal Graph Networks (FDSA-STG) by improving the attention mechanism using Graph Attention Networks (GATs). In particular, to dynamically integrate the correlations of spatial dimension, time dimension, and periodic characteristics for highly-accurate prediction, we correspondingly devised three components including the spatial graph attention component (SGAT), the temporal graph attention component (TGAT), and the fusion layer. In this case, three groups of similar structures are designed to extract the flow characteristics of recent periodicity, daily periodicity, and weekly periodicity. Extensive evaluation results show the superiority of FDSA-STG from perspectives of prediction accuracy and prediction stability improvements, which also testifies high model adaptability to the dynamic characteristics of the actual observed traffic flow (TF).},

Taking the ultra-short baseline system (USBL) as the application background, a novel inertial navigation system (INS)/USBL integrated navigation scheme based on FGO is presented in this paper. The traditional pre-integration factor simplifies the earth rotation and coordinate system, which limits its application in high-precision sensors. This paper proposed an improved pre-integration model using the high precision measurements of fiber optics gyroscope in FGO. Simulation and field tests proved that, with the FGO method, improved accuracy of INS/USBL integration was obtained compared to the traditional KF method.

However, due to privacy and security protection policies and other reasons, the data set of private cars cannot be obtained, which hinders the research on the social attributes of vehicles in the IoV. Most of the previous work generated the same type of data, and how to generate private car data sets from various existing data sets is a huge challenge. In this paper, we propose a tri-layer framework to solve this problem. First, we propose a novel region division scheme that considers detailed inter-region relations connected by traffic flux. Second, a new spatial-temporal interaction model is developed to estimate the traffic flow between two regions. Third, we devise an evaluation pipeline to validate generation results from microscopic and macroscopic perspectives. Qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that the data generated in heavy density scenarios can provide strong data support for downstream IoV and mobility research tasks.},

Specifically, selecting storage collaborative edge nodes is a multi-objective integer linear programming problem. We transform it into a single objective 0-1 integer linear programming problem and use the dynamic programming method to obtain the optimal solution. In addition, we condense the storage resource allocation problem into a mixed-linear integer programming problem and use the greedy auction algorithm to obtain an approximate optimal solution, which significantly improves efficiency and performance. We evaluate the performance of the proposed two mechanisms by performing extensive experiments.

Thanks to the polarization-twisting technique and the simple structure of the phase shifter, the proposed element can be easily designed. For the transmitarray design, a multi-frequency phase compensation strategy is applied to guarantee stable performance over the operating band. To validate the design, a 12 × 12 transmitarray antenna simultaneously covering vehicle-to-satellite band (20 GHz), and 5G millimeter-wave (mmWave) bands (24 GHz/28 GHz) is designed, fabricated and measured. The experimental results show that the prototype can achieve high aperture efficiencies (&gt;40%) within a wide bandwidth (34%). The measured peak aperture efficiency is up to 53% at 23 GHz. These results demonstrate that the proposed 2-bit transmitarray antenna enjoys the advantages of wide operating bandwidth, high aperture efficiency and comparatively low design complexity. With these characteristics, the proposed transmitarray antenna can be a promising candidate for vehicular communications that require reliable satellite links and 5G millimeter-wave connections simultaneously.},

To achieve link adaptation, a novel multi-layer sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) algorithm is proposed for accurately and instantaneously providing the required channel state information. Meanwhile, a deep neural networks (DNN)-assisted adaptive modulation algorithm is proposed to choose the best possible transmission mode to maximize the achievable throughput.

Our contributions of this paper lie in: i) modeling the wobbling process of a hovering RW UAV; ii) developing an analytical model to derive the temporal autocorrelation function (ACF) for the millimeter-wave RW UAV A2G link in a closed-form expression; and iii) investigating how RW UAV wobbling impacts the Doppler effect on the millimeter-wave RW UAV A2G link. Numerical results show that different RW UAV wobbling patterns impact the amplitude and the frequency of ACF oscillation in the millimeter-wave RW UAV A2G link. For UAV wobbling, the temporal ACF decreases quickly and the impact of the Doppler effect is significant on the millimeter-wave A2G link.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a pervasive wireless channel modeling theory is first proposed, which uses a unified channel modeling method and a unified equation of channel impulse response (CIR), and can integrate important channel characteristics at different frequency bands and scenarios. Then, we apply the proposed theory to a three dimensional (3D) space-time-frequency (STF) non-stationary geometry-based stochastic model (GBSM) for the sixth generation (6G) wireless communication systems. The proposed 6G pervasive channel model (6GPCM) can characterize statistical properties of channels at all frequency bands from sub-6 GHz to visible light communication (VLC) bands and all scenarios such as unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), maritime, (ultra-)massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), and industry Internet of things (IIoT) scenarios. By adjusting channel model parameters, the 6GPCM can be reduced to various simplified channel models for specific frequency bands and scenarios. Also, it includes standard fifth generation (5G) channel models as special cases. In addition, key statistical properties of the proposed 6GPCM are derived, simulated, and verified by various channel measurement results, which clearly demonstrates its accuracy, pervasiveness, and applicability.},

  abstract     = {The use of antenna arrays is indispensable in radar and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless communications areas, as it permits the treatment of wavefronts in the spatial domain, enabling important applications such as beamforming and target detection. Spatial information is commonly given in terms of spatial correlation functions (SCFs), but its representation in terms of angular domain, such as the power azimuth spectrums (PASs), is sometimes more convenient. Therefore, transforming from SCF to PAS, and vice versa, is often required. This is commonly done by employing so-called beamformers, where the Bartlett beamformer (BB) is the most commonly utilized. However, the use of beamformers alone is not enough for retrieving PAS information from a given SCF. Particularly, this paper shows that a non-linear operation is missing in relating SCFs to PASs as provided by current beamformers. The paper also shows the mathematical expressions that correctly relate SCFs to PASs and wavenumber spectrums (WNSs) for the general case of systems with antenna arrays. The developed theory results in two new beamformers, which, corroborated by simulation results, solve any previous inconsistency in estimating PASs from SCFs.},

  abstract     = {In the environment of intelligent and connected vehicles, the information sharing level among vehicles and infrastructure get comprehensively improved. Aiming at the cooperative merging control at highway ramp, we present a two-stage hybrid cooperative control framework considering communication time delays including centralized decision-making for grouping with sequencing and distributed consensus control. The centralized controller is based on a grouping strategy and a cost function for minimizing total travel time and delays and determining the optimal vehicle passage order. Then we model the merging vehicles formation as a multi-agent system, which also could be viewed as a distributed controlling system. Combining with the multi-agent consensus method, it could achieve the desired inter-vehicle distance and speed. The proof tool is the Lyapunov-Krasovskii stability theorem in terms of convergence and formation stability. Finally, we design three simulation scenarios through varying the number of vehicles. Meanwhile, in order to verify the resistance of the algorithm to communication time delays, three conditions with respect to no time delays, heterogeneous time delays, and homogeneous time delays are considered. Simulation result verifies the advantage of the proposed method compared with the Hamilton control method. The efficiency of the proposed method is impervious in three different types of communication time delays and has approximately 30%, 25%, 15% improvement over that of the Hamiltonian method, respectively. Furthermore, the adaptation and effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated under different volumes of traffic flow and communication delays.},

The trajectory optimization of emergency base stations is of vital importance to the communication performance, which is related to the timeliness and effectiveness of rescue. In this paper, federated multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (F-MADDPG) based trajectory optimization algorithm is proposed to maximize the average spectrum efficiency. Specifically, the property of MADDPG is inherited to jointly control of multiple vehicles and federated averaging (FA) is utilized to eliminate the isolation of data to accelerate the convergence. Distributed F-MADDPG (DF-MADDPG) is further designed to reduce the communication overhead with a distributed architecture. The simulation results indicate that the proposed F-MADDPG and DF-MADDPG based algorithms significantly outperform the existing trajectory optimization algorithms, in terms of the average spectrum efficiency and the speed of convergence.},

The information freshness is captured by the age of information (AoI) metric, whilst the energy consumption of the UAV is seen as another performance criterion. Most importantly, the AoI and energy efficiency are inherently competing metrics, since decreasing the AoI requires the UAV returning to the depot more frequently, leading to a higher energy consumption. To this end, we design UAV paths that optimize these two competing metrics jointly and reveal the Pareto frontier. To formulate this problem, a multi-objective mixed integer linear programming (MILP) is proposed with a flow-based constraint set and we apply Bender’s decomposition on the proposed formulation. Numerical results show that the proposed method allows deriving non-dominated solutions among two competing metrics when designing the UAV path.},

The RIS can tune the mmWave signal and reduce the downlink transmit power, and NOMA achieves a relatively higher spectral efficiency than other MA methods. The integration of the RIS and NOMA, thus, can be a powerful solution. Previous studies have yet to obtain a closed-form solution for both the beam tuning settings and the decoding order in low complexity in the conventional RIS-NOMA. The proposed partition-based MA method, however, divides and arranges the array elements of the RIS to generate a fine beam for NOMA communications. We compare the transmit power reduction of the proposed method with the transmit power reduction of time-sharing and decode-and-forward relay. To confirm the feasibility of the integration, we also derive the criteria for MA mode selection.},

  abstract     = {This study explores the performance of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with one-bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) over Rayleigh fading channels. We particularly aim to characterize the pairwise error probability (PEP) achieved by maximum likelihood detection (MLD), which provides the optimal detection performance of the considered systems. First, the upper bound of the PEP is derived by leveraging Jensen’s inequality and the Chernoff bound. The asymptotic bounds of the PEP are then characterized to clarify the impact of the one-bit ADCs on the diversity order of the MIMO systems. Notably, the diversity order of the MIMO systems with one-bit ADCs is the same as the number of receive antennas only when transmitting two symbol vectors with the opposite sign. Except for this special case, the asymptotic bound of the PEP is saturated at a high signal-to-noise ratio due to the use of the one-bit ADCs. Using simulations, we verify that the analytical results coincide with the asymptotic behavior of the PEP of the MLD for MIMO systems with one-bit ADCs over Rayleigh fading channels.},

  abstract     = {In secure spatial modulation with a malicious full-duplex attacker, how to obtain the interference subspace or channel state information (CSI) is very important for Bob to reduce or even completely cancel the interference from Mallory. In this paper, different from existing work with perfect CSI, the covariance matrix of malicious interference (CMMI) from Mallory is estimated to construct the interference subspace. To improve the estimation accuracy, a CMMI rank detector relying on the Akaike information criterion (AIC) is derived first. To achieve a high-precision CMMI estimation, two methods, principal component analysis-eigenvalue decomposition (PCA-EVD) and joint diagonalization (JD) are proposed. The proposed PCA-EVD is a rank deduction method whereas the JD method is a joint optimization method with improved performance in the low jamming-to-noise ratio (JNR) region at the expense of increased complexity. Simulation results show that the proposed PCA-EVD performs much better than existing methods like sample estimated covariance matrix (SCM) and EVD in terms of normalized mean square error (NMSE) and secrecy rate (SR). Additionally, the proposed JD has achieved a better NMSE performance than PCA-EVD in the low JNR region (JNR &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\leq$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; 0 dB) while the proposed PCA-EVD performs better than JD in the high JNR region.},

Most of the existing privacy preservation methods are based on data tampering approaches (e.g., encryption, adding noise, aggregation), which are not practicable over V2G due to complexity in billing and inaccurate state estimation. In this paper, we develop a novel adaptive demand-side energy management framework by employing federated learning-based privacy preservation for the wireless charging V2G systems. Our framework learns the temporal evolution of energy consumption of dynamic charging electric vehicles in a distributed fashion and exploits the reinforcement learning model for cost-saving and reward maximization. The convergence and the privacy preservation properties of the framework are demonstrated with extensive evaluations.},

However, it is urgent to investigate intelligent control algorithms to improve the adaptability of CCC in complex traffic environment. In addition, the effect of communication delays attributed to shared wireless communications on the performance degradation of the intelligent CCC design cannot be ignored. In this study, the design of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) controller for CCC system in high-dynamic traffic scenarios is investigated, which considers both time-varying leading velocity and communication delays. To be more specific, an intelligent CCC algorithm based on deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) is developed. According to the training samples obtained from interacting with the traffic environment, the actor network and the critic network are trained to maximize the quadratic reward function determined by state errors and control inputs for generating intelligent control strategies. In particular, the effect of previous control strategies is considered in vehicle dynamics analysis, optimization problem formulation and Markov decision process (MDP) definition to compensate the performance degradation attributed to communication delays. Lastly, the effectiveness and convergence of the proposed DRL-based CCC controller are verified through numerical simulations with various conditions. The superior performance of the proposed algorithm is shown by comparing with existing traditional algorithms and state-of-the-art DRL algorithms.},

Previous related research considers enhancing the flexibility of WRSNs with the use of wireless charging vehicles (WCVs). Although this research prolongs network lifetime to some extent, there still exist two essential drawbacks: off-road limitation and traveling speed limitation. Benefiting from the intrinsic flexibility, high flight speed, low cost and small size, wireless charging drones (drones) have great potentials to be used to charge sensors in WRSNs. However, suffering from limited battery capacities, it is impossible to use drones for charging sensors in large WRSNs independently. To conquer the drawbacks of WCVs and drones, we propose a novel WRSN model which integrates WCVs, WCV-carried drones and independent drones to construct an efficient novel charging system. The proposed system, which aims to extend network lifetime and to minimize the time of charging scheduling on premise of satisfying charging requests with the cooperation of WCVs and drones. Thus, we develop a novel charging scheduling scheme, which divides the sensing region into three circular sub-regions for scheduling the WCVs or drones collaboratively. Sensor nodes located in the inner ring are charged by independent drones directly from the base station. Nodes located in the middle ring are charged by WCVs, while the outer ring charged by WCV-carried drones. Simulation results show that our scheduling scheme outperforms multiple WCVs which either employ temporal or distantial priority scheme and earliest-deadline first scheme with respect to the lifetime and network charging efficiency.},

However, the diversity of ubiquitous IoT devices and complex transmission environment lead to the difficulty of theoretical analysis of delay performance. In order to capture the characteristics of large IoT networks, a novel integrated analysis framework is developed to build the performance model and analyze the statistical delay performance in this paper. Specifically, we model the spatial distribution of IoT devices with heterogeneous Poisson point processes. With the Laplace transform of signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio, the service capability of the wireless channel with multiple interferes is determined with a mathematical stochastic-network-calculus aided approach in the exponential domain for Poisson bipolar and cellular networks.

  abstract     = {6G wireless networks have raised increasing attention with computation-sensitive services such as AI Internet of things (AIoT) and mobile augmented reality/virtual reality (AR/VR) applications. Mobile edge computing (MEC) provides rich computation resources for user equipments (UE) at the edge of networks. Aided by MEC servers, computation-intensive applications that are commonly modeled as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG) can be performed locally and offloaded to MEC servers to enhance execution efficiency. However, it is a key issue to efficiently provide low latency with limited energy. In this paper, we investigate a multiobjective task scheduling problem in MEC-aided 6G network. Then, an improved multiobjective cuckoo search (IMOCS) algorithm is proposed to deal with a DAG-based task scheduling problem, which aims to reduce the execution latency and energy consumption of UE. Particularly, the proposed IMOCS algorithm is based on the single-objective cuckoo search algorithm and Pareto dominance. An external archive is used to record nondominated solutions, whose update strategy improves the quality of solutions by the aid of fast nondominated sorting and crowding distance sorting. Simulation results demonstrate that IMOCS algorithm outperforms other four benchmark algorithms, which can provide optimal task scheduling policy for MEC severs in 6G networks.},

  abstract     = {Vehicles share information via Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET) that is considered the foundation of the intelligent transportation system. Access control from functional encryption (FE) allows secure sharing over encrypted data with both utilization and privacy. However, low-powerful vehicles and the untrusted server incurs that FE-based access control mechanisms are less practical with client-side inefficiency and access unreliability. In this work, we put forth ORAC, an Optimized encrypted Access Control system with partial privacy and Reliability . ORAC is built on top of functional encryption that guarantees data partial privacy and data utilization in VANET, and separates the data access into the offline phase and the online phase, such that most of decryption computation could be done in the offline phase and vehicles could execute the real decryption efficiently. By embedding blockchain transactions into identity records and data storage, ORAC protects data accessed by vehicles from tampering and thereby manages data transfers with high reliability. It can be instantiated directly from pairing-based assumptions and features only the decryption complexity of two exponentiation and two multiplication operations. We give a formal security proof of the instantiation in the semantic security model. We also prototype our scheme by implementing ORAC over Ethereum with two types of smart contracts and the evaluation can demonstrate its efficiency optimization.},

  abstract     = {The use of breath detection in vehicles can reduce the number of vehicular accidents caused by drivers in poor physical condition. Prior studies of contactless respiration detection mainly targeted a static person. However, there are emerging applications to sense a driver, with emphasis on contactless methods. For example, being able to detect a driver&#39;s respiration while driving by using a vehicular Wi-Fi system can significantly enhance driving safety. The sensing system can be mounted on the back of the driver&#39;s seat, and it can sense the tiny chest displacement of the driver via Wi-Fi signals. The body displacement and car vibrations could introduce significant noise in the sensed signal. The noise then needs to be filtered to obtain the driver&#39;s respiration. In this work, the noise in the sensed signal is proposed to be reduced using a Huber Kalman filter to restore the original respiration curve. Through several experiments in terms of different drivers, different car models, multiple passengers, and abnormal breathing, we demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the Huber Kalman filter in driver&#39;s respiration.},

We consider two different scenarios: I) the channel state information (CSI) of wiretap links is known, and II) the CSI of wiretap links is unknown. Accordingly, optimal and suboptimal relay-user pairing schemes are proposed for the aforementioned two scenarios, respectively. Specifically, a relay-user pair maximizing the secrecy rate is chosen as the optimal one to participate in the transmission, where all links’ CSI is used to perform relay-user pairing. However, suboptimal relay-user pairing scheme is designed only relying on the main links’ CSI without requiring wiretap links’ CSI, where a relay-user pair with the maximal transmission rate of main link is selected. Also, closed-form expressions of secrecy outage probability with both integer and rational fading severity parameter are derived in the case of satellite links undergo Shadowed-Rician fading and terrestrial links subject to Rayleigh fading. Furthermore, asymptotic secrecy outage probability analysis is conducted in the high signal-to-noise ratio region. Numerical results reveal that relay-user pairing is beneficial to further improve physical-layer security of the hybrid satellite-terrestrial network.},

In this article, we first discuss the difficulties in sequential UA optimization for scalable LEO-UDSNs. A specific multi-objective UA problem was formulated for the overall service efficiency. We initially proposed a practical Iterative Subgradient Algorithm (MOISA) decoupling potential trade-offs between limited equivalent power and availability relationship, rapidly obtaining solutions in stable cases. Second, we proposed a Multi-Objective Dynamic User Association Approach (MODUAA), inheriting the MOISA with stability enhancements for sequential optimizations, ensuring the performance requirements, and alleviating the iteration redundancy in dynamic scenarios. Finally, the outperforming of the MOISA and the applicability of the MODUAA were elaborated in various comparisons.},

  abstract     = {Vehicle and airborne navigation users are facing more and more complex signal interference and even spoofing. If vehicles and aircraft do not strengthen their anti-spoofing ability, their navigation performance is bound to be adversely affected. global navigation satellite system (GNSS) spoofing technology has gradually become a preferred interference method for spoofer because of its high concealment and great harm. For spoofer, user terminal increasingly adopts GNSS with inertial measurement unit (IMU): tightly-coupled GNSS/IMU, on this basis, user also configures a variety of anti-spoofing techniques to effectively deal with spoofing. Even if spoofer slowly changes user&#39;s positioning, if spoofing strategy is unreasonable, it will lead to the violation of parameter rationality of coupled filter output parameters and spoofing observation, which greatly increases the difficulty of spoofing. In view of the above problems, from the perspective of spoofer, in order to effectively counter the non cooperative target of assembling tightly-coupled GNSS/IMU by using GNSS spoofing, this paper establishes GNSS spoofing mathematical model, and proposes a slowly varying spoofing algorithm to avoid tightly-coupled GNSS/IMU with multiple anti-spoofing techniques based on the analysis of the influence mechanism of spoofing on the positioning of tightly-coupled GNSS/IMU, the algorithm proposes a measurement deviation determination method to avoid a variety of anti-spoofing techniques, which can gradually pull the positioning results of coupled system, and successfully avoid anti-spoofing techniques detection of least squares residual receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (RAIM) and parameter rationality check. The experimental results show that the algorithm can gradually change positioning of tightly-coupled GNSS/IMU within 30 s, and the north, east and down displacements basically achieve the spoofing effect, the errors with the expected offset are −0.5 m, 1.9 m and 12.7 m respectively. At the same time, the detection of the above anti-spoofing techniques is avoided. The mean value of test statistics for tightly-coupled system is reduced by 75.4% and does not exceed the alarm threshold, so as to achieve the purpose of spoofing, the effectiveness and high concealment of the spoofing algorithm are proved.},

Then, they provide specific services to their mobile users using the resources obtained from MNOs. However, wireless resource sharing among SPs is challenging as each SP wants to maximize their utility/profit selfishly while satisfying the QoS requirement of their mobile users. Therefore, in this paper, we propose joint users association and wireless resource sharing problem in the cell-free UAVs-assisted wireless networks with the objective of maximizing the total network utility of the SPs while ensuring QoS constraints of their mobile users and the resource constraints of the UAVs deployed by MNOs. To solve the proposed mixed-integer non-convex problem, we decompose the proposed problem into two subproblems: users association, and resource sharing problems. Then, a two-sided matching algorithm is deployed in order to solve users association problem. We further deploy the whale optimization and Lagrangian relaxation algorithms to solve the resource sharing problem.

This paper proposes a hybrid decentralized offloading architecture in which the MEC server and multiple terminals jointly participate in the caching and processing of WebVR tasks. In this framework, the graph convolutional network and unsupervised clustering algorithm are jointly applied to process the WebVR service feature graph to achieve FoV-level content caching. Moreover, WebVR users with idle computing resources assist neighboring users with performing tasks. On this basis, we propose a distributed low-bound-based alternative direction method of multiplier (LADMM) algorithm to optimize the offloading mode and the allocation of tasks and computing power resources to minimize system energy consumption. The proposed offloading mode can lower energy consumption while maintaining a good balance between delay performance and resource utilization.},

  abstract     = {Dynamic topology, fast-changing channels and the time sensitivity of safety-related services present challenges to the status quo of resource allocation for cellular-underlaying vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications. In this paper, we investigate a novel federated multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (FedMARL) approach for the decentralized joint optimization of channel selection and power control for V2V communication. The approach takes advantage of both deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and federated learning (FL), satisfying the reliability and delay requirements of V2V communication while maximizing the transmit rates of cellular links. Specifically, we elaborately construct individual V2V agent implement by the dueling double deep Q-network (D3QN), and design the reward function to train V2V agents collaboratively. As a result, each agent individually optimizes channel selection and power level based on its local observations, including the instantaneous channel state information (CSI) of corresponding V2V link, the instantaneous co-channel interference from the cellular link, the previous channels selections of nearby V2V pairs, and the queue backlog at the V2V transmitter. Another important aspect is that we incorporate FL to alleviate the training instability problem induced by cooperative multi-agent environment. The local DRL models of different V2V agents are federated periodically, addressing the limitations of partial observability on the entire network status for individual agent, and accelerating the training process of multi-agent learning. Validated via simulations, the proposed FedMARL scheme shows superiority to the baselines in terms of the cellular sum-rate and the V2V packet delivery rate.},

  abstract     = {Until now, multi-hop device-to-device (MD2D) routing in mobile wireless networks has been designed to operate over a single-protocol routing framework. Consequently, to the best of our knowledge, no framework has been developed to enable the dynamic deployment and switching of multiple MD2D routing protocols under one framework. This paper proposes a multi-protocol framework to introduce the idea of clustering a cell and deploying different MD2D routing protocols for each cluster based on the cluster requirements. To this end, four clusters are developed with varying network conditions (i.e., node density, mobility rate, and the number of flows). Then, the performance of our two previously designed multi-hop routing protocols, namely hybrid SDN architecture for wireless distributed networks (HSAW) and source-based virtual ad hoc routing protocol (VARP-S), are investigated in each cluster in terms of energy consumption, end-to-end (E2E) delay, packet loss, and cellular-band overhead. Based on the achieved simulation results, a multiple-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach based on the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is developed to choose the most suitable protocol for each cluster to provide the best performance. The simulation results indicate that our proposed multi-protocol framework provides better performance compared to traditional single-protocol architectures.},

We address the case of distributed streaming platforms with multiple message brokers to develop an optimisation model for the real-time assignment and load balancing of event streaming generated data traffic among Edge Computing facilities. The performance indicator function to be optimised is derived by adopting queuing models with different granularity (packet- and flow-level) that are suitably combined.

  abstract     = {A variety of emergency events such as traffic accidents often happen in urban areas and the related emergency information needs to be urgently diffused to vehicles that may pass through the accident place to avoid escalation of the event. However, due to the dynamics of vehicles, the information diffusion links between vehicles and roadside units (RSUs) may be unstable, and thus the information diffusion based on fixed RSUs may lead to the low information propagation rate and the limited influence range. To address the above issues, we propose an emergency information diffusion strategy based on the Social Internet of Vehicle (SIoV), where vehicles can build inter-vehicle social relationships without human intervention and exchange emergency information through stable vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) links. In detail, we design a &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$b$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -matching based stable link construction algorithm to build stable V2V links by considering the social characteristics and connection probability simultaneously, and then depict the vehicle link graph. Based on this graph, we formulate the information diffusion problem as an influence maximization problem. To solve this problem, we design an SIoV based emergency information influence maximization (SEIM) algorithm to maximize the influence range by selecting some influential seed vehicles and boosting some vehicles’ influence. The theoretical analysis and simulation results show that our algorithms have a lower dissemination delay and larger influence range by sacrificing part of the signaling overheads performance.},

We first propose two HBF schemes, namely, decentralized HBF (D-HBF) and semi-centralized HBF (SC-HBF). In the former, both the digital and analog beamformers are generated independently at each AP based on the local channel state information (CSI). In contrast, in the latter, only the digital beamformer is obtained locally at the access point (AP), whereas the analog beamforming matrix is generated at the central processing unit (CPU) based on the global CSI received from all APs. We show that the analog beamformers generated in these two HBF schemes provide approximately the same achievable rates despite the lower complexity of D-HBF and its lack of CSI requirement. Furthermore, to reduce the power consumption, we propose a novel adaptive radio frequency (RF) chain-activation (ARFA) scheme, which dynamically activates/deactivates RF chains and their connected analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and phase shifters (PSs) at the APs based on the CSI. For the activation of RF chains, low-complexity algorithms are proposed, which can achieve significant improvement in energy efficiency (EE) with only a marginal loss in the total achievable rate.},

  abstract     = {To achieve the performance gains of massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, the downlink channel state information (CSI) must be acquired at the base station (BS). In frequency division duplexing (FDD) massive MIMO systems, the BS always first transmits downlink pilot symbols so that the user equipment (UE) can estimate CSI and then feedback to the BS. However, the huge number of antennas at the BS will lead to overwhelming feedback overhead. Moreover, time-varying caused by high mobility of user terminals makes the priori channel knowledge of the channels to change from one slot to another so that CSI aquisition is hard. To simultaneously reduce the overhead of overwhelming downlink pilot signaling and uplink feedback in time-varying massive MIMO systems, we propose a channel estimation scheme based on compressive sensing (CS) and deep learning (DL) in frequency division duplexing (FDD) massive MIMO systems. Specifically, we first develop a new CS-based algorithm for sparse channel estimation, which requires no priori knowledge of channel statistics. After obtaining the innitial channel estimation, we utilize two DL-based networks, named DnNet and DnLSTM respectively for denoising. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can considerably reduce the training and feedback overhead and outperform the existing classical algorithms.},

URLLC services require lower latency and high reliability, whereas eMBB services expect maximum data rates. Since 5G new radio (NR) aims to support heterogeneous services, the 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP) supports a highly flexible frame structure by introducing mixed numerology and mini-slot approaches. In these systems, the time slot is further divided into mini-slots. The coexistence of these two heterogeneous services leads to a challenging resource allocation problem. In this paper, we study the joint resource allocation problem of eMBB and URLLC schedulers to maximize the minimum expected achieved rate (MEAR) of eMBB users while satisfying URLLC users’ quality of service (QoS) constraints. The resource allocation of eMBB traffic occurs at time slot boundaries. In contrast, URLLC traffic is overlapped at the mini-slot timescale by adopting the non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) superposition technique. The suitable pairs of eMBB, URLLC users are evaluated using the one-one matching theory by inculcating fairness among eMBB users while satisfying the QoS parameters of URLCC users. The significance of the proposed approach over the baseline approaches is evaluated through numerical simulations in terms of the MEAR, mixed numerologies, and fairness scores among eMBB users.},

The scheme mainly realizes physical layer security (PLS) in General Multi-Fractional Fourier Transform (GMFRFT) signal domain, which is different from traditional schemes that rely on the spatial domain. Different GMFRFT components are transmitted by multiple antennas at the transmitter, then the legitimate receiver and the eavesdropper receive the superposition of multiple non-orthogonal components. The resulting mutual interference will reduce the signal-to-interference and noise (SINR) at the eavesdropper, but without affecting the legitimate receiver. Because the legitimate receiver receives the non-contaminated GMFRFT signal due to designing multi-components at the transmitter, while the eavesdropper receives the signal whose constraint relations in the GMFRFT signal domain are destroyed, which will cause the energy loss of the information bearing signal. Furthermore, in order to achieve the maximum secrecy capacity, the selection method of GMFRFT transform order is given to adjust the power allocation among GMFRFT components. Compared with the scheme based on artificial noise (AN), the advantages of our scheme are: 1) our scheme can further reduce the capacity of wiretap channel while not requiring the transmitter to use partial power to transmit meaningless artificial noise signals; 2) our scheme outperforms AN-based schemes when the available spatial degrees of freedom are limited. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the secrecy performance of the proposed scheme.},

In this paper, we try to put forward some feasible solutions for this problem. We will use two physical layer communication techniques, the Coherent Beamforming (CB) technique and the Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) technique, to jointly optimize the throughput of vehicles data transmission and the network infrastructure cost. We first establish the mathematical model based on CB and SIC technology and prove that it cannot be solved directly. Then, we design the Road and CB-nodes Assignment (RCA) algorithm and the Uninstalling Data Scheduling (UDS) algorithm to solve the problem. RCA is based on CB and SIC technology to reasonably arrange CB-nodes, so that CB-nodes set can send data from vehicles to the base station and the base station can receive multiple sets of data at the same time. UDS schedules vehicles based on various factors to optimize the total amount of data transferred by vehicles and improve throughput. In simulations, we conduct some comparative experiments, which are the not using Algorithm 3 scheme, the CB scheme, the SIC scheme, the common scheme and the Relay Task Offloading Scheme in Vehicular Edge Computing algorithm (RVEC Algorithm).

  abstract     = {As a promising wireless access technique, sparse code multiple access (SCMA) directly maps the input bits to the transmitted multidimensional codewords according to the SCMA codebook. In general, SCMA codebook optimization and detector simplification are independent of each other. In this article, we propose a simplified SCMA codebook with a separable structure for implementing a low-complexity detector. For codebook design, a separable codebook structure is proposed to simplify the maximization of the minimum Euclidean distance (MED). With this structure, multiple one-dimensional complex codebooks corresponding to one resource element (RE) are determined by maximizing the MED of the superimposed codewords. Then, the entire codebook set is obtained based on a structure indicator matrix and the separable codebook structure. The proposed codebook has a larger MED than obtained by existing codebooks. Benefiting from the separable codebook structure, the signals transmitted over each RE can be independently used to recover the corresponding input bit information. Therefore, we propose a parallel maximum a posteriori (P-MAP) detector consisting of several low-complexity MAP detectors to reduce the complexity of the conventional multiuser message passing (MP) detector in SCMA. At the receiver, each RE is assigned a low-complexity MAP detector. Simulation results show that the proposed codebook outperforms the known optimal codebook over an AWGN channel. Moreover, the run time of the P-MAP detection algorithm is reduced by 99.8% compared to the Log-MPA algorithm. With the proposed codebook design scheme and the P-MAP detector, an SCMA unit can be separated into two independent non-SCMA units, which significantly increases system flexibility.},

To be specific, dynamic power allocation is adopted to ensure the reliability of the system and another friendly UAV jammer is introduced to improve the security of the system.

Moreover, the asymptotic EST is analyzed to obtain further insights. Numerical results show the validity of theoretical derivations and the superiority of the proposed PAAJ scheme over benchmark schemes. The EST of the UAV-enabled NOMA communication system outperforms the conventional terrestrial NOMA system at the low transmitting power from the UAV base station. There exists an optimal height of the UAV base station to maximize the EST, which provides a useful framework for designing UAV-enabled communication systems with heterogeneous service requirements.},

We propose a sequence of three Poisson multi-Bernoulli mixture (PMBM) based SLAM filters, which handle the entire SLAM problem in a theoretically optimal manner. The complexity of the three proposed SLAM filters is progressively reduced while sustaining high accuracy by deriving SLAM density approximation with the marginalization of nuisance parameters (either vehicle state or data association). Firstly, the PMBM SLAM filter serves as the foundation, for which we provide the first complete description based on a Rao-Blackwellized particle filter. Secondly, the Poisson multi-Bernoulli (PMB) SLAM filter is based on the standard reduction from PMBM to PMB, but involves a novel interpretation based on auxiliary variables and a relation to Bethe free energy. Finally, using the same auxiliary variable argument, we derive a marginalized PMB SLAM filter, which avoids particles and is instead implemented with a low-complexity cubature Kalman filter. We evaluate the three proposed SLAM filters in comparison with the probability hypothesis density (PHD) SLAM filter in 5G mmWave vehicular networks and show the computation-performance trade-off between them.},

  abstract     = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-enhanced wireless communication is one of the critical technologies of the sixth generation mobile communication, which has recently emerged as an innovative solution to the realization of intelligent transportation. It can meet the increasing demand for high-speed railway (HSR) communications services. In this paper, we consider a train-ground TDD wireless mobile communication paradigm to deploy two IRSs on the roadside and the train roof to assist the wireless transmission for the HSR communication system. To achieve the more significant performance gain, in the uplink transmission phase, we propose the practical channel estimation framework of the MIMO system aided by double IRSs to acquire reliable channel state information (CSI) of each channel. To facilitate the processing of the three-dimension tensor, we leverage the trilinearity of the parallel factor decomposition to decompose the received signal into a two-dimensional matrix. The Doppler frequency offset compensating scheme and channel tracking scheme based on Kalman-Filter are proposed to further decrease the pilot overheads. Then, in the downlink phase, a block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm is proposed to handle the data rate maximization problem of double IRSs communication system with the estimated CSI. We reformulate the original problem and decouple the double IRSs phase optimization problem into two single IRS phase optimization non-convex problems under the unit-modulus constraint. The Majorization-Minimization (MM) algorithm is proposed to approximate the optimal solution of the two optimization subproblems. Simulation results corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed channel estimation and phase shifts optimization scheme.},

  abstract     = {In a platoon-based vehicular cyber-physical system (VCPS), the traffic capacity and the fuel efficiency can be significantly improved by maintaining a small inter-vehicle distance (IVD). Meanwhile, the vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications provided by the roadside unit (RSU) are important for promoting the development of autonomous vehicles and reshaping the driving experience. However, as maintaining a small IVD inside the platoon may result in severe inter-beam interference, there is a tradeoff between the traffic capacity and the communication efficiency. In this paper, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize the IVD (a.k.a spacing) under the V2I quality-of-service (QoS) requirements by jointly controlling the transmit power, the beamwidth, and the IVD in a platoon-based VCPS. The traffic and channel uncertainties significantly complicate the analytical characterization of the impact of IVD, transmit power, and beamwidth on the QoS requirements. To solve the intractable challenging problem and capture the inherent timescale difference between the communication and vehicular systems, we propose a novel data-driven two-timescale reinforcement learning framework to control the beamforming and the spacing of the platoon at two timescales. With elaborately designed state, action, and reward, we develop a soft actor-critic based two-timescale deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm to learn an effective policy for the control-communication co-design problem. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of spacing control and show that the proposed two-timescale DRL algorithm can significantly improve the traffic capacity and reduce the air drag coefficient while satisfying the QoS requirements of V2I communications.},

Furthermore, a repeated computation reduced sphere decoding (RCR-SD) is proposed. RCR-SD is very suitable for the schemes constructed by a large number of DMs, including FO-QSM. By sorting the index vectors, the RCR-SD detector can efficiently reduce the repeated computations in the SD searching, which significantly reduces the decoding complexity without sacrificing optimal decoding performance.

  abstract     = {We focus on the rate-optimal design of Wireless Powered Relay Networks (WPRNs) and propose a new cooperative communication scheme. Our scheme employs multiple wireless powered Amplify and Forward (AF) relays and relay selection and combines Time Splitting (TS), with Antenna Switching (AS) and Self Energy Recycling (SER). It consists of an initial Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) subframe, followed by a cooperative transmission subframe, during which one antenna is used for Energy Harvesting (EH) and SER and the remaining ones are used for data reception and data forwarding. For this scheme, we present solutions to the problems of 1) rate-optimal beamforming (BF) design, 2) rate-optimal, joint Harvesting Antenna Selection (HAS), BF design, and WPT subframe duration determination. Our solutions build on a generic piecewise linear EH model, which allows us to closely approximate the characteristics of different non linear EH measurements and models, by selecting the number of piecewise linear components and their parameters. In addition, we consider a realistic power consumption model at the relays that accounts for both transmit and circuit power consumption. Moreover, our BF solution is optimal and requires solving a set of simple optimization problems, where the solution of each one of them can be found in a simple closed form. Thus, it is characterized by low implementation complexity, and avoids sophisticated iterative optimization methods. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first one to introduce a scheme, which combines TS, AS, and SER principles and exploits realistic EH and power consumption models at the relays. Finally, we assess the performance of our scheme over fading channels and find that it outperforms existing solutions that use the same hardware.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider an energy efficient resource allocation technique for a hybrid time division multiple access (TDMA) - non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system. In such a hybrid system, the available time for transmission is divided into several sub-time slots, and a sub-time slot is allocated to serve a group of users (i.e., cluster). Furthermore, signals for the users in each cluster are transmitted based on the NOMA approach. With NOMA, multiple users can be served simultaneously through utilizing power domain multiplexing at transmitter and successive interference cancellation (SIC) at receiver. In this paper, to maximize the energy efficiency (EE), we jointly allocate both the available time slots and the available transmit power in the hybrid TDMA-NOMA system. In particular, we formulate an EE maximization (EE-Max) problem aiming to maximize the overall EE of the system with a per-user minimum rate and transmit power constraints. However, this joint optimization problem is non-convex in nature, and thus, cannot be solved directly. Therefore, we develop an iterative algorithm by approximating the original problem into a convex one with sequential convex approximation (SCA) and a novel second-order cone (SOC) approach. Simulation results demonstrate that the performance of the proposed hybrid TDMA-NOMA system with joint resource allocation outperforms the system with equal time allocation in terms of the overall EE. Simulation results further confirm that the proposed iterative approaches with SCA and SOC techniques converge within a few number of iterations while yielding the solution to the original non-convex problem.},

  abstract     = {Due to the strong penetration ability and high transmission rate of ultra-wideband (UWB) signals, UWB technology plays a very significant role in the field of precise indoor positioning. However, the harsh and volatile indoor environment leads to non-line-of-sight (NLOS) propagation and severe attenuation of UWB signals, which may generate significant ranging and positioning errors. To mitigate NLOS effect and improve positioning accuracy, existing methods use ranging information and channel impulse response (CIR) to identify UWB signal propagation channels. However, these NLOS identification methods often require a priori knowledge and suitable thresholds, and most of them only perform a binary classification between LOS and NLOS in a particular scenario. To address these disadvantages, this paper proposes a novel multi-classification method to classify UWB signal propagation channels based on one-dimensional wavelet packet analysis (ODWPA) and convolutional neural network (CNN). This method first decomposes the CIR of known categories into colored coefficients images using a one-dimensional wavelet packet function, then uses these images to train CNNs with different structures, and finally selects CNN model with the best performance to identify the unknown category of UWB signal propagation channels. The experimental results show that the performance of the proposed method is always the best, regardless of the type of experimental scenario, and the identification accuracy is always higher than 90% and up to 100%.},

Notably, the secure transmission may be intercepted and blocked by the eavesdropper due to the blockage-prone nature in THz bands. To characterize the blocking effects of the eavesdropper, the blocking-based path loss is first investigated. With the imperfect eavesdropper channel state information (ECSI), the worst-case secrecy rate (WCSR) is derived, and a joint optimization problem of hybrid beamforming at the BS and reflecting beamforming at the IRS is formulated. For the BS-IRS link eavesdropping, the zero-forcing (ZF) principle-based hybrid beamforming and the closed-form phase shifts of multiple IRSs are respectively proposed. For the IRS-user link eavesdropping, an iterative algorithm is proposed to tackle the non-convex optimization problem with a given information leakage threshold. Finally, a robust secure transmission strategy for multi-eavesdropper systems is further investigated. Simulation results demonstrate that compared with blockage-unaware scenarios, our proposed scheme can resist the adverse effects of the blockage-prone nature of THz waves on information security, and significantly boost secrecy performance.},

Since only a few orthogonal beams are available and mission-driven UAV networks are autonomous and delay-sensitive, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) over these beams is considered for agility and efficiency. In particular, aiming to address these challenges of highly dynamic mobility, we propose a machine learning framework to enable agile analog beam management for mmWave-NOMA transmissions. The proposed beam management aims to achieve efficient beam tracking and NOMA-grouping-aware analog beamforming optimization to facilitate mmWave-NOMA transmissions by judiciously utilizing angular domain information (ADI). More specifically, a Gaussian process machine learning-based ADI prediction scheme is proposed to track the angular dynamics of FUAVs, which facilitates fast beam-tracking for mmWave-NOMA transmissions. Moreover, by exploiting the predicted ADI, an unsupervised-learning-based FUAV grouping scheme is proposed to facilitate mmWave-NOMA transmissions with high radio-frequency chain efficiency, while a deep learning-based NOMA-grouping-aware fast transmit beamforming optimization scheme is proposed to improve the coverage of mmWave-NOMA transmissions in highly dynamic multi-UAVs networks.

  abstract     = {This paper presents techniques that are expected to improve the bit error rate (BER) performance of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) communication systems. The decode-and-forward (DF)-based cooperative multi-hop Rician network using space shift keying (SSK) modulation is employed for this purpose. The SSK modulation and cooperative communication are merged and used together. This enhances the BER performance for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels, thus accentuating its significance as an important technique for consistently reliable communication methodology while, at the same time, eliminating wastage of energy. The new technique is named as high performance (HP) due to not only BER performance improvement but also increase of the diversity of the communication system. This new model is further used for multi-hop networks and the resulting BER characteristics are assessed for possible enhanced performance in Rician channels. The paper also showcases the generalized-n-hop BER equation for various multi-hop DF-based cooperative communication systems in diverse UAV models. The Monte Carlo simulations further confirm the theoretical results that already exist for transmit-receive antennas. This work also underlines the fact that the number of hops in a communication system has no bearing whatsoever on the BER performance diversity value.},

In exchange, the secondary BS acts as a relay for the primary network and aids in transmitting information from the primary BS to the primary users (PUs) along with its own information using non-orthogonal transmission and the harvested energy. Closed-form expressions for the end-to-end outage probability (OP) at all the PUs and SUs have been obtained considering Rayleigh fading channel links and also sensitivity and saturation impairments at the energy harvesting nodes. Moreover, all the energy harvesting nodes have been assumed to be equipped with a finite battery for storing the harvested energy and rely solely on this stored energy for running the transceiver circuitry. Closed-form expressions have also been obtained to characterize the degradation due to the energy harvesting impairments and finite battery on the end-to-end OP of all the users. Furthermore, closed-form expressions for the asymptotic outage floor and diversity order have been obtained to analyze the performance of the system at high transmit power.

  abstract     = {Cognitive radio networks (CRNs) and millimeter wave (mmWave) communications are two major technologies to enhance the spectrum efficiency (SE). Considering that the SE improvement in the CRNs is limited due to the interference temperature imposed on the primary user (PU), and the severe path loss and high directivity in mmWave communications make it vulnerable to blockage events, we introduce an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) into mmWave CRNs. Due to the estimation mismatch and the passivity of Eavesdroppers (Eves), perfect channel state information (CSI) of wiretap links is challenging to obtain, which promotes our research on robust secure beamforming (BF) design in the IRS-assisted mmWave CRNs. This paper considers the collaborate scenario of Eves, which allows us to investigate the BF design in the harsh eavesdropping environment. Specifically, by using a uniform linear array (ULA) at the cognitive base station (CBS) and a uniform planar array (UPA) at the IRS, and supposing that imperfect CSIs of angle-of-departures for wiretap links are known, we formulate a constrained problem to maximize the worst-case achievable secrecy rate (ASR) of the secondary user (SU) by jointly designing the transmit BF at the CBS and reflect BF at the IRS. To solve the non-convex problem with coupled variables, an efficient alternating optimization algorithm is proposed. As for the transmit BF at the CBS, we propose a heuristic robust transmit BF algorithm to attain the BF vectors analytically. As for the reflect BF at the IRS, by means of an auxiliary variable, we transform the non-convex problem into a semi-definite programming problem with rank-1 constraint, which is handled with the help of an iterative penalty function, and then obtain the optimal reflect BF through CVX. Finally, simulation results indicate that the ASR performance of our proposed algorithm has a small gap with that of the optimal solution with perfect CSI compared with the other benchmarks.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates the performance of intelligent reflective surfaces (IRS)-aided physical layer network coding (PNC) in two-way relaying channels (TWRC). Specifically, IRS is used to eliminate carrier phase offset (CPO) at the relay node. To this end, the IRS reflectors’ phase shifts are optimized to align the received signals from two source nodes at the relay. This facilitates using a simple mapping function at the relay to map the superimposed signal to a network-coded signal. Two scenarios are considered, the first of which assumes that each source node is served by a separate IRS panel, while the second scenario considers the more challenging case where only one IRS panel is available for the two source nodes. In the latter case, the IRS panel is seen by both source nodes and its phase shifts are optimized to mitigate the CPO problem while maximizing the received signal amplitude at the relay. This optimization problem is formulated and solved over the complex circle manifold. Finally, we extend the IRS-assisted PNC system to include channel coding and higher modulation orders, for which a repeat accumulate (RA) channel-coded IRS-aided PNC scheme is proposed for general quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) signals. A belief propagation (BP) based algorithm is designed to decode the network-coded sequences over a q-Ring using modular arithmetic. Our simulation results validate the theoretical error expressions derived for the two-IRS scenario as well as the efficacy of the proposed manifold optimization approach for the one-IRS scenario. The results also confirm the efficacy of the designed channel-coded IRS-aided PNC using high QAM modulation orders.},

  abstract     = {The traditional channel estimation for OFDM systems suffers from big overheads caused by pilots. Current channel estimation methods only consider the correlation among pilots within a time-frequency grid, which is a kind of local channel information. In this article, we propose a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based channel estimation method to utilize not only local channel information but also correlation across multiple frames, thus much fewer pilots are needed. We propose to explore GAN to establish a mapping from a low dimensional space to a high dimensional channel space. Then based on very few pilots, we solve an optimization problem to localize the low dimensional vector corresponding to the specified channel and generate the corresponding channel. Furthermore, we propose an improved conditional GAN (cGAN), which takes the multi-path number as conditional information, making the proposed generative channel model more robust in various scenarios. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed cGAN-based method can be applied to multiple channel profiles once trained offline, and it is robust to the mismatch of multi-path number. Besides, the proposed method outperforms the ideal ALMMSE and ChannelNet methods under the same pilot density. In the best case, it can achieve comparable performance with only about half the number of pilots.},

  abstract     = {Extensive delay-sensitive and computation-intensive tasks are involved in emerging vehicular applications. These tasks can hardly be all processed by the resource constrained vehicle alone, nor fully offloaded to edge facilities (like road side units) due to their incomplete coverage. To this end, we refer to the new paradigm of vehicular collaborative edge computing (VCEC) and make the best use of vehicles’ idle and redundant resources for energy consumption reduction within the VCEC system. To realize this target, we are faced with several nontrivial challenges, including short-term decision making coupled with long-term queue delay constraints, information uncertainty, and task offloading conflicts. Accordingly, we apply Lyapunov optimization to decouple the original problem into three sub-problems and then tackle them one by one: the first sub-problem is resolved by Lagrange multiplier method; the second is handled by UCB learning-matching approach; the third is addressed by a carefully designed greedy method. Scenarios without volatility and real-world road topology with realistic vehicular traffics are utilized to evaluate the proposed solution. Results from extensive numerical simulations demonstrate that our solution can achieve superior performances compared with the benchmark methods, in terms of energy consumption, learning regret, task backlog, and end-to-end delay.},

  abstract     = {To extend the transmission range governed by limited transmit power, collaborative beamforming (CB) can be employed with a virtual antenna array (VAA) constructed by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm. CB techniques combined with physical layer security (PLS) algorithms are known to better secure transmissions of sensitive information in the presence of eavesdropping attacks, compared to co-located antenna-based schemes. In particular, analog collaborative beamforming (ACB) with random VAA topologies, which is suitable for UAV networks due to its lower signaling/channel estimation overhead compared to the digital CB, can provide a significantly higher secrecy rate by creating noise-like signals at eavesdroppers. However, the increase in energy consumption to improve secrecy rate had been ignored in the existing ACB-based PLS schemes, which is of paramount importance considering the limited onboard energy of UAVs. Thus, motivated by such limitation, in this paper, we examine the security energy efficiency of the ACB-based PLS technique, where a group of UAVs (or VAA elements) randomly change their locations in a distributed manner to randomize the array factor of the VAA, i.e., a stochastic VAA. The proposed stochastic VAA outperforms the existing static VAA in terms of secrecy energy efficiency as verified by analytic and numerical results. Further, the impact of phase errors of the proposed scheme is also presented, which indicates the significance of the accurate phase estimation.},

  abstract     = {We propose an energy-efficient supervisory control method for the power management of parallel hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) to improve the fuel economy and reduce exhaust gas emissions. Plug-in HEVs ((P)HEVs) have multiple power sources (e.g., an engine and motor) that should be cooperatively operated to meet the required instantaneous traction power for the desired vehicle speed while satisfying their physical limits. Because the efficiencies of the engine and motor vary with different operating speeds and torques, the main issue of energy-efficient power management is to allocate the power demand among the power sources by achieving maximum power conversion efficiencies and satisfy the operating limits. For an efficient power allocation, an optimal control problem is formulated, and a global solution is found through deterministic dynamic programming (DP). Owing to the curse of dimensionality and uncertainties in real driving, DP solutions are not directly applicable in real time. To resolve the limitations of DP, we employ a non-parametric Bayesian function approximation technique using a Gaussian process (GP). The offline DP solutions obtained from a set of real vehicle driving test data were used to learn a state-dependent probabilistic value function through Gaussian process regression. For online implementations, a receding horizon control scheme was applied for the feedback control of the power management. In comparison with the existing charge sustaining strategy and charge depleting and charge sustaining mixed controllers, we recorded fuel efficiency improvements of over 4.8% and 7.3%, respectively, in a mixed urban-suburban route.},

This study theoretically reveals the slow dynamic response and large overshoot of a traditional WPT system. For solving these issues, a reliable adaptive feedforward control scheme is proposed and applied in the user-side DC-DC converter, where the communication unit is eliminated. The feedforward loop is proved theoretically to suppress overshoot and system dynamic response. Besides, the feedforward control increases the selective range of control parameters, which can improve the system dynamics.

At first, a 2.0-wavelength prototype magnetic dipole is introduced to lay down the flared angle, radius and the usable resonant TM 1,1 and TM 3,1 modes of the principal radiator. In these ways, a wideband backfire radiation characteristic can be generated. Then, the multi-point equivalent source model is developed and used to predict the initial values of the sectorial reflector and director, e.g., the flared angles, radii, and the separations between the principal radiator and director/reflector. Prototype antennas are in final designed and fabricated to experimentally validate the dual-resonant wideband property on the 2 mm-thick air substrate, thereby exhibiting an impedance bandwidth of 27.6%. As also numerically and experimentally validated, the backfire gain can be further enhanced to 4.2 dBi.

To ensure vehicle stability, safety limits are defined on the vehicle’s yaw rate, sideslip, and roll motions, considering road angle effects. The controller prioritizes the control actions and objectives based on, respectively, their advantages and their importance, and then combines the priorities such that differential braking, which is defined as the low priority actuation, will not kick in unless the stability limits are violated. The performance of the designed controller is thoroughly evaluated through numerical and full vehicle experimental studies in different driving scenarios on flat and non-flat roads.},

  abstract     = {To reduce the overloading of the power system due to the increasing use of electric vehicles (EVs), the power system operators employ dynamic cost plans depending on the number of EVs being charged. In this situation, the charging cost of an EV can be reduced by considering other EVs’ charging strategies and avoiding simultaneous charging. In this article, we develop a distributed EV charging mechanism (D-EVCM) where each EV possesses some information, such as the charging probabilities of other EVs, electricity price, current energy level, and expected departure time. Based on the information, an EV periodically decides whether to charge its battery in a distributed manner. To minimize the average charging cost of EV while avoiding the situation where an EV departs from a charging station with insufficient energy level, a constrained stochastic game model is formulated and its solution is obtained using a best response dynamics-based algorithm. The evaluation results show that D-EVCM can reduce the average charging cost over 48% with a sufficient low battery outage probability (e.g., 0.01%) compared to a threshold-based charging scheme.},

  abstract     = {Featuring the fast response and flexibility in control allocation, an electric vehicle with in-wheel motors is a good platform for implementing advanced vehicle dynamics control. Among many active safety functions of an in-wheel motor driven vehicle (IMDV), lateral stability control is a key technology, which can be realized through torque vectoring. To further advance the lateral stabilization performance of the IMDV, in this article a novel data-driven nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) is proposed based the recurrent high-order neural network (RHONN) modelling method. First, the new RHONN model is developed to represent vehicle’s nonlinear dynamic behaviors. Different from the conventional physics-based modelling method, the RHONN model forms high-order polynomials by neuron states to feature nonlinear dynamics. Based on the RHONN model, the steady-state responses of vehicle’s yaw rate and sideslip angle are iteratively optimized and set as the control objectives for low-level controller, aiming to improve the system robustness. Besides, a nonlinear model predictive controller is designed based on the RHONN, which is expected to improve the prediction accuracy during the receding horizon control. Further, a constrained optimization problem is formulated to derive the required yaw moment for vehicle lateral dynamics stabilization. Finally, the performance of the developed RHONN-based nonlinear MPC is validated on an IMDV in the CarSim/Simulink simulation environment. The validation results show that the developed approach outperforms the conventional method, and further improves the stable margin of the system. It is able to enhance the lateral stabilization performance of the IMDV under various driving scenarios, demonstrating the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {The optimization of the energy management of modern hybrid-electric or fully electric race cars for minimum lap time requires a description of the vehicle dynamics performance envelope, that is, of the tires’ grip limit in corners, braking zones and during acceleration. In this paper, we present a computationally efficient performance envelope model in the form of convex constraints on the achievable longitudinal and lateral acceleration, on the assumption that the path on the track is given. The proposed acceleration limits are modeled velocity-dependent to take into account the effect of aerodynamic downforce present in many circuit race cars. The formulation as linear equality, inequality and second-order cone constraints allows to embed the model in a convex energy management optimization framework. To showcase the approach, we identify the model with data obtained from a state-of-the-art hybrid-electric Formula 1 car and present results for the Silverstone and Spa-Francorchamps circuits. The optimal energy management strategies can be evaluated with a computational time of less than 1 s. The optimal velocity profile subject to the performance envelope constraints is close to the measured one. The good agreement between the optimal solution and the measurement data shows that the proposed model captures the vehicle dynamics accurately enough for the purposes of energy management optimization.},

A single-stage WPT converter with constant current (CC) and constant voltage (CV) output and its asymmetric modulation method are proposed in this paper. A direct AC-AC converter is applied to the primary side of the WPT converter to directly convert line-frequency AC to high-frequency AC. The applied direct AC-AC converter that can replace the commonly used multi-stage primary converter reduces the number of circuit devices, thereby reducing the volume and cost of primary converter. The proposed WPT converter can realize zero voltage switching (ZVS) and power factor correction (PFC). In order to achieve CC and CV output, a switchable hybrid compensation topology is applied to the proposed WPT converter.

Then, a sliding window with variable width is used to help the time series SOC estimation improve. Meanwhile, STCKF (Strong Tracking Cubature Kalman Filter) is combined with BLS to help search for an optimal hyperparameter for BLS. Then, this article takes the SOC diagnosis as a problem of diagnosing abnormal time segments and uses HOT SAX(Heuristically Ordered Time series using Symbolic Aggregate ApproXimation) to detect SOC anomalies. Moreover, a prediction method of RUL (Remain Useful Life) has been designed by BLS-STCK. In light of result of RUL, the capacity degradation is considered to improve SOC estimation, and capacity retention coefficient is posed to adjust BLS-STCKF when battery aged. Finally, the proposed methods has also been evaluated by real driving data of EVs. Based on those critical experiments, rational analysis and conclusion have been illustrated that the proposed method has competitive accuracy.},

As a remedy, we will introduce in this paper an end-to-end monocular autonomous reinforcement control (MARC) framework for autonomous control of VUVs, which is performed in two cascaded procedures, i.e., 1) perception, where a geometric network (GeoNet) is designed based on a convolutional encoder-decoder network to generate depth maps from input environmental videos; 2) decision, where with depth maps as input, a reinforcement control network (CtrlNet) integrates a convolutional neural network into a deep deterministic policy gradient network and outputs action decisions, which are refined by reinforcement learning algorithm for obstacle-avoiding based autonomous control. Numerical and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MARC exhibits high-quality depth prediction and is capable of conducting obstacle-avoiding navigation and autonomous control of VUVs with high accuracy and strong robustness.},

Recent studies using deep reinforcement learning techniques have shown promising results for traffic signal control, but they only focus on extracting features from traffic conditions of isolated or adjacent intersections. In this work, we employed navigation information for traffic signal control, greatly enriching the features for traffic signal control with deep reinforcement learning. In addition, we are the first to propose a novel scheme DeepNavi to exploit the temporal-spatial relations from numerous navigation routes and extract dynamic real-time and future traffic features. We tested our scheme on a challenging real-world traffic dataset with 16 intersections in a residential district of Hangzhou, China. Extensive experiments were conducted and the results demonstrated that our DeepNavi scheme achieves superior performance over five popular and state-of-the-art baseline methods on different metrics, including queue length, speed, travel time and accumulative waiting time. In addition, with our method, vehicles suffer the least red lights and enjoy the most green waves, which further validates that our scheme greatly relieves the congestion and provides excellent experience for drivers. Simulations with different penetration levels of navigation routes showed that even with only part of navigation routes available in the traffic network, our scheme can obtain superior performance, further demonstrating the effectiveness and feasibility of DeepNavi.},

None of the existing pricing schemes addresses the dynamic variation of price as the type of users and decision parameters requested by them vary. We assume road transportation as the implementation scenario of Safe-aaS. In order to deal with these issues, we formulate a pricing scheme, which renders different prices for the same decision parameters. The amount charged from the users are based on their type, decision parameters selected by them, and the duration for which they request the service. Additionally, the SSP allows suitable discounted price to the users, which is determined from their mode of payment and history of services availed. Further, to model the interaction between the users and SSPs, we design our problem as a multiple leader multiple follower non-cooperative Stackelberg game. We calculate the utility of SSPs and formulate an optimization problem to compute the optimal value of the basic price charged from the users. The exhaustive mathematical analysis and simulation results reveal that the proposed pricing scheme, Diff-Price improves the financial gain of the service providers as the number of users increases by 13.51%, 15.75%, and 14.173% respectively, compared to the adaptive incremental spot pricing scheme [1], differentiated cloud virtual-network as-a-service scheme [2], and smart road pricing system [3].},

  abstract     = {Roadside units (RSUs), which have strong computing capability and are close to vehicle nodes, have been widely used to process delay- and computation-intensive tasks of vehicle nodes. However, due to their high mobility, vehicles may drive out of the coverage of RSUs before receiving the task processing results. In this paper, we propose a mobile edge computing-assisted vehicular network, where vehicles can offload their tasks to a nearby vehicle via a vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) link or a nearby RSU via a vehicle-to-infrastructure link. These tasks are also migrated by a V2V link or an infrastructure-to-infrastructure (I2I) link to avoid the scenario where the vehicles cannot receive the processed task from the RSUs. Considering mutual interference from the same link of offloading tasks and migrating tasks, we construct a vehicle offloading decision-based game to minimize the computation overhead. We prove that the game can always achieve Nash equilibrium and convergence by exploiting the finite improvement property. We then propose a task migration (TM) algorithm that includes three task-processing methods and two task-migration methods. Based on the TM algorithm, computation overhead minimization offloading (COMO) algorithm is presented. Extensive simulation results show that the proposed TM and COMO algorithms reduce the computation overhead and increase the success rate of task processing.},

  abstract     = {To evaluate the stochastic responses of a newly designed virtual track train (VTT), a spatial dynamics model of VTT is developed theoretically in the paper. The structural characteristics of VTT; tyre-road dynamic interactions and road geometric random irregularity are considered. Additionally, a human-seat subsystem is built and integrated into the VTT system. This comprehensive dynamics model of the VTT enables detailed investigations on the system dynamic performance under complicated excitations. The Monte Carlo method is further adopted to assess the stochastic vibration characteristics of the VTT excited by random road irregularity. The results indicate that the vibration characteristics of the VTT are dominated by road irregularity. The lateral vibration of different carbodies of the VTT has little difference, while the vertical vibration of carbody 2 is worse than carbodies 1 and 3. Besides, the running speeds have significant influences on the running stability and ride comfort of the VTT. The increasing running speed and road irregularity level significantly increase the probability of running stability and ride comfort exceeding the threshold, which affects the operation of VTT. Furthermore, the proposed model is capable of being used for dynamics-related assessment and parameter optimisation design.},

  abstract     = {Traffic safety at road intersections can be enhanced by improving opportunistic exchange of safety messages between vehicles. In urban intersection scenario, obstacles such as buildings and road side installations/signboards block the line-of-sight communication between vehicles. In order to enhance the reliability of communication link, the existing vehicular solution utilizes relay placement at road intersection. However, as the vehicular density increases, the existing vehicular-radio frequency (V-RF) communication with relaying tends to suffer from higher interference, lower packet reception rate, and longer communication delays due to channel congestion. In contrast to the existing solutions, we propose to use practical deployment strategies namely hybrid vehicular-visible light communication (V-VLC)/V-RF with relaying and reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) aided V-RF solutions to improve the communication range for urban vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication. We present stochastic geometry based analytical framework to analyze the performance of proposed solutions in terms of outage probability, throughput and delay outage rate (DOR). Numerical results illustrate that the proposed solutions can achieve considerable performance improvement in outage, throughput while ensuring low latency as compared to conventional V-RF with relaying. These deployment strategies may also serve as a preferred alternative for Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) to meet ultra-high reliable and ultra-low latency communication for beyond 5 G (B5G) vehicular networks.},

On the other hand, owners of private parking spaces are less willing to share their spare lots. To deal with the parking problem, a new parking sharing network named ParkChain is firstly proposed using blockchain to build a decentralized but trustworthy network. Herein, ParkChain provides a distributed autonomous infrastructure for both vehicle drivers and park granters, which can promote the extensive parking resource sharing and relieve the parking problem. A new blockchain consensus protocol named Proof-of-Planned-Behavior (PoPB) is proposed. It builds the model of the autonomous consensus process based on the theory of planned behavior (TPB), derives a computable threshold for qualification of block data authorizers, and then develops a dynamic authorizer group mechanism for creditability and decentrality considerations. Furthermore, various smart contracts are developed to carry out the parking services transparently.

More critically, the anonymity from the perspective of honest-but-curious edge nodes has not been yet addressed. Thus, this paper proposes a novel ultra-lightweight framework for the secure and anonymous communications of vehicles during their charging reception by means of blockchain. Thanks to the blockchain technology, the accountability of electric vehicle possessors guaranteed. The proposed scheme has been validated in terms of security metrics and also implemented on two ARM-based platforms, one 32-bit ARM microcontroller and one 64-bit ARM processor.

  abstract     = {The performance of automated vehicle can be greatly improved by enabling vehicle-to-vehicle communication. An example of such applications is Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) along the highway. Although the adoption rate of vehicular connectivity is predicted to grow rapidly, CACC can only benefit vehicles that are both connected and automated. To take a full advantage of vehicular connectivity, a human-in-the-loop Connected Cruise Control (hCCC) algorithm is developed for human-driven connected vehicle. In hCCC, the human driver remains engaged in the longitudinal control of the vehicle, and hCCC controller applies additional acceleration/deceleration on top of human actions according to the received status of preceding vehicle. By allowing coexistence of the automatic control and driver&#39;s actions in a beneficial way, hCCC helps the human driver stabilize the vehicle more efficiently and safely. The proposed hCCC inherits the feedback-feedforward control structure and velocity-dependent spacing policy from the typical CACC systems. String stability analysis shows that hCCC can offer broader string-stable ranges of human parameters than human driving alone or the existing acceleration-based Connected Cruise Control (CCC), indicating a better capability to mitigate traffic disturbance with the uncertain human behaviors. The desirable properties of hCCC were validated in driving simulator experiments, which showed that hCCC could reduce 36.8% acceleration, 31.2% time-gap fluctuation, 81.2% exposure time to unsafe driving situations, and 15.8% fuel consumption from those of human driving alone. In addition, two derivative designs of hCCC are proposed and proven effective, further lowering down the practice threshold of hCCC.},

Given the information on the track route (track map and elevation) and on the throttle input command, the model computes the vehicle power demand and cruising speed. The model is validated by means of both indoor and outdoor experimental tests. The validated model is employed for the optimization of the transmission gear ratio and of the driving strategy to minimize the overall energy consumption on a given track. Design variables are related to the transmission gear ratio and to the throttle command profile. The algorithm aims to minimize the energy consumption, including constraints on the maximum current provided by the battery and on the maximum time available to complete the lap. Comparison with some common driving strategies confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed solution, with a foreseen 9% reduction of the vehicle overall energy demand.

In recent years, massive traffic data has brought many data-based traffic estimation methods, but few are utilized in traffic simulation. The cause is that the data-based traffic simulation has high requirements for data quality, needing the trip information of all vehicles, not met by common traffic data. Fortunately, the electronic registration identification (ERI) data of the vehicle can satisfy. Therefore, we utilize ERI data to study the traffic estimation and simulation for the road network. The core of this research is the travel time estimation model, which is constructed by combining traffic theory models and the deep neural network. The traffic theory models are a group of linear models, which represent the relationship between traffic flow or traffic density and travel time. The deep neural network can extract the temporal and spatial characteristics of the road network traffic by Moving Average Convergence-Divergence (MACD) and Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), respectively. We named the travel time estimation model MGCN. Then, we employed MGCN for traffic simulation. In the experiment section, we employed Chongqing ERI data to verify the research content. Compared with some baseline methods, our method is superior in travel time estimation and traffic simulation.},

  abstract     = {Chaos-based communications can be applied to high-speed vehicular information transmissions thanks to the anti-jamming and anti-interference capabilities of chaotic transmissions. In traditional practical chaotic systems, reference chaotic signals are required to be delivered to remove complex chaotic synchronization circuits. However, the direct transmission of reference signals will degrade the security performances, while interferences and noises imposed on the reference signals due to imperfect channel conditions will deteriorate the reliability performances. In order to enhance the reliability and security performances over vehicular channels such as the railway channel and the channels undergoing fast fadings, in this paper, we propose a deep learning (DL) aided intelligent OFDM-DCSK transceiver. In this design, no reference chaotic signals are delivered, and we propose to utilize the time-delay neural network (TDNN) to learn the chaotic maps, followed by the long short-term memory (LSTM) units to extract and exploit the correlations between chaotic modulated signals, and multiple fully connected layers (FCLs) to estimate the user bit data. With the aid of the constructed deep neural network (DNN), after the offline neural network training, the receiver can recover the transmitted information with lower bit error rate (BER) and enhance security performances. Theoretical performance is then analyzed for the proposed intelligent transceiver. Simulation results validate the proposed design, and demonstrate that the intelligent DL-based OFDM-DCSK system can achieve better BER and security performances over fast fading and railway channels compared with the benchmark systems.},

In this paper, we develop the TPHD and TCPHD filters which can adaptively learn the history of the unknown target detection probability, and therefore they can perform more robustly in scenarios where targets are with unknown and time-varying detection probabilities. These filters are referred to as the unknown TPHD (U-TPHD) and unknown TCPHD (U-TCPHD) filters. By minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD), the U-TPHD and U-TCPHD filters can obtain, respectively, the best Poisson and independent identically distributed (IID) density approximations over a set of augmented trajectories. For computational efficiency, we also propose the U-TPHD and U-TCPHD filters that only consider the unknown detection profile at the current time.

  abstract     = {Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is considered as a critical technique in 5 G New Radio (NR), due to its capability to significantly improve data rate and link reliability for the radio link. To make it a reality, it is essential to evaluate massive MIMO performance in realistic spatial fading channel conditions. Specifically, dynamic spatial channel emulation is crucial to evaluate the massive MIMO beam operations. Due to the high cost associated with both the traditional conduced testing method and the standardized multi-probe anechoic chamber (MPAC) based Over-the-Air (OTA) testing setup for massive MIMO performance testing, fading channel emulation for massive MIMO testing using a conductive phase matrix setup has been proposed in the literature. However, it is still a challenging problem to emulate dynamic spatial channels in a cost-effective and efficient manner for the conductive phase matrix setup, since traditional algorithms suffer from high computational complexity and system cost. This paper proposes a fast and accurate framework to emulate dynamic spatial channels in the phase matrix setup, where the basic idea is to mimic a virtual MPAC setup. By doing so, we can mimic MPAC setup with flexible probe configurations. Furthermore, a novel successive cancellation strategy and a closed-form algorithm are proposed to determine the probe locations and probe weights, respectively, which can significantly reduce the computational complexity associated with dynamic channel emulation. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is highly accurate and computationally efficient, compared to state-of-art solutions. Further, we apply our developed algorithm to emulate measured non-stationary channels and excellent emulation accuracy can be achieved. The proposed method can be employed for emulating dynamic spatial channels, which is of great importance for massive MIMO performance testing.},

  abstract     = {Recently, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has drawn much attention due to its capability of improving coverage and communication performance. The development of RIS-assisted communication technology relies on deep understanding of RIS channel characteristics. However, most of the existing investigations focus on the impact of RIS, ignoring the existence of local scatterers in the real propagation environment. The ideal propagation condition limits the accuracy and application of the developed channel model. In this paper, we aim to analyze the channel characteristics of RIS-assisted near-filed communication by considering different conditions of local scatterers. Specifically, we propose a three-dimensional (3D) RIS-assisted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel model based on a three-dimensional cylinder model, which considers line-of-sight, single-bounced at RIS (SBR) and double-bounced (DB) modes where radio waves reflect from RIS and scatterers near receiver. Based on the proposed channel model, we investigate some key statistical properties for SBR and DB propagation, including the time-frequency-space correlation function and Doppler power spectrum. From the simulation results, it is found that RIS element number, RIS horizontal and vertical locations, distribution of surrounding scatterers, and movement of Rx have significant impacts on channel characteristics. Finally, channel capacities of SBR and DB modes are calculated, where the large size and appropriate locations of RIS significantly improve the channel capacity of RIS-assisted communication. These numerical results and observations can be used for design of RIS-assisted near-field communication systems.},

By considering the factors of three-dimensional (3D) scattering space, 3D trajectory, and 3D antenna array, a non-stationary ray-based channel model for UAV-to-vehicle (U2V) mmWave communications is proposed. The computation and generation methods of channel parameters including inter-path and intra-path are developed and illustrated in detail. The inter-path parameters are calculated in a deterministic way based on the given geometric information. The parameters of intra-path rays are generated in a stochastic way based on the statistical properties, which can be obtained in advance by applying a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) on the massive ray tracing (RT) data of different typical scenarios. Meanwhile, a modified method of equal areas (MMEA) is developed to generate the random intra-path variables. To speed up the RT algorithm, the 3D propagation scenario is reconstructed based on the user-defined digital map. Moreover, the theoretical statistical properties of the proposed channel model, i.e., power delay profile (PDP), autocorrelation function (ACF), Doppler power spectrum density (DPSD), cumulative distribution function (CDF), and level crossing rate (LCR) are derived. Finally, a typical U2V channel under urban scenario at 28 GHz is generated and validated. Simulation results demonstrate that the PDP and DPSD of the proposed channel model are accorded well with the theoretical ones, and the ACF, CDF, and LCR are consistent with the measured ones as well.},

It causes random loss of the signal information, resulting in the poor direction of arrival (DOA) estimation performance. In this paper, we propose an efficient DOA estimation method under partially impaired antenna array elements, which work randomly. We first devise a strategy to detect the positions of randomly lost signal information corresponding to partially impaired antenna array elements and then formulate the problem of received signal recovery as low rank matrix completion. Afterwards, we utilize the recursive least squares (RLS) with the nulling antenna array for DOA estimation due to its fast convergence and low mean square error properties and place the nulls in the directions of received signals by adjusting the weight vectors adaptively. The reciprocal of the antenna array defines the output spatial spectrum, and the directions of the signals are estimated by finding the high peaks. We also investigate the mean and mean square performance of the RLS after recovering and de-noising the received signal. Simulation results show that the proposed method converges to optimal solution fast and outperforms the existing DOA estimation methods.},

Traditionally, CSI estimation at receiver and feedback to transmitter are separately designed, failing to maximize the estimation accuracy while minimizing the complexity/overhead. In this work, we propose a novel computation and communication efficient CSIT acquisition scheme, by jointly designing downlink CSI estimation and uplink feedback, which is inspired by randomized matrix approximation techniques. In the process of CSI estimation, we represent a large channel matrix with three sub-matrices by exploiting its inherent low-rank characteristic, and then estimate these small matrices separately. Our new estimator significantly reduces the computation complexity in massive MIMO CSI acquisition, whilst attaining the high accuracy. The convergence as well as the error bound of our CSI estimator is derived theoretically. In the following CSI feedback process, only partial elements of sub-matrices are reported to transmitter without further compression, and finally the full CSI is recovered accurately. This novel CSI feedback scheme, relying on the estimated CSI with special structure, greatly reduces both the communication overhead. Numerical simulations are provided to valid our joint CSI estimation and feedback scheme, which would have great potential in massive MIMO communications.},

In order to establish the practical interactions between the base station (BS) and the jammer, a Bayesian Stackelberg game is formulated, where the BS is the leader and the jammer acts as the follower. Specifically, with the help of a RIS-assisted transmitter, the BS attempts to reliably convey information to users with maximum utilities, whereas the smart jammer tries to interfere the signal reception of users with desired energy efficiency (EE) threshold. Since the BS and the jammer are not cooperative parties, the practical assumption that neither side can obtain the other&#39;s strategies is adopted in the proposed game, and the angular information based imperfect channel state information (CSI) is also considered. After tackling the practical assumption by using Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and the imperfect angular information by using the discretization method, the closed-form solution of both sides can be obtained via the duality optimization theory, which constitutes the unique Stackelberg equilibrium (SE).

In this study, we investigate the optimal pilot interval design for IRS-aided communication systems to reduce the channel estimation overheads. The channel coherent time depends on user equipment (UE) velocity. Therefore, the proposed method aims to find a pilot interval that balances accuracy of the IRS reflection coefficient with system throughput by considering UE velocity. In the proposed method, we identify the relationship between the mobility of the UE and complex spatial correlation of the channel matrix, and the transmission capacity in a time slot is formulated to maximize the achievable sum rate.

To reduce the detection complexity, this paper proposes an efficient DCI detection method, where a significance-test strategy is designed to detect the DCI formats. The significance-test strategy can forecast the DCI lengths without separately decoding the whole codeword, thus reducing the decoding complexity by several times. Moreover, the accuracy of the DCI detection is analyzed, with which the test scope of the test statistic is optimized for minimizing the decoding complexity on condition of meeting the detection accuracy requirements. Simulation results show that the proposed method significantly reduces the decoding complexity relatively to the existing two-stage detection schemes.},

  abstract     = {The explosive growth of Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications such as smart cities and Industry 4.0 have led to drastic increase in demand for wireless bandwidth, hence motivating the rapid development of new techniques for enhancing spectrum utilization needed by new generation wireless communication technologies. Among others, dynamic spectrum access (DSA) is one of the most widely accepted approaches. In this paper, as an enhancement of existing works, we take into consideration of inter-node collaborations in a dynamic spectrum environment. Typically, in such distributed circumstances, intelligent dynamic spectrum access almost invariably relies on self-learning to achieve dynamic spectrum access improvement. Whereas, this paper proposes a DSA scheme based on deep reinforcement learning to enhance spectrum and access efficiency. Unlike traditional Q-learning-based DSA, we introduce the following to enhance the spectrum efficiency in dynamic IoT spectrum environments. First, deep double Q-learning is adopted to perform local self-spectrum-learning for IoT terminals in order to achieve better dynamic access accuracy. Second, to accelerate learning convergence, federated learning (FL) in edge nodes is used to improve the self-learning. Third, multiple secondary users, who do not interfere with each other and have similar operation condition, are clustered for federated learning to enhance the efficiency of deep reinforcement learning. Comparing with the traditional distributed DSA with deep learning, the proposed scheme has faster access convergence speed due to the characteristic of global optimization for federated learning. Based on this, a framework of federated deep reinforcement learning (FDRL) for DSA is proposed. Furthermore, this scheme preserves privacy of IoT users in that FDRL only requires model parameters to be uploaded to edge servers. Simulations are performed to show the effectiveness of theproposed FDRL-based DSA framework.},

However, the BSA is computationally intensive owing to the high-dimensional matrix-to-matrix multiplication and matrix inversion. To address this issue, a BSA algorithm with high accuracy and low computational-cost using the submatrix multiplication (BSASM) is proposed in this paper. By appropriately adjusting the weight, which consists of a switch and a phase shifter, connected to each antenna, the SCM can be accurately reconstructed with low-dimensional matrix-to-vector multiplication and 2-dimensional matrix inversion, thus reducing the computational-cost significantly. After SCM reconstruction, various DOA estimation algorithms can be exploited to obtain the DOA information. Simulation experiments are conducted to verify the performance of the proposed algorithm. The results indicate that using a substantially lower computational-cost, BSASM can reconstruct SCM more accurately than BSA.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we study the problem of user association, i.e., determining which base station (BS) a user should associate with, in a dense millimeter wave (mmWave) network. In our system model, in each time slot, a user arrives with some probability in a region with a relatively small geographical area served by a dense mmWave network. Our goal is to devise an association policy under which, in each time slot in which a user arrives, it is assigned to exactly one BS so as to minimize the weighted average amount of time that users spend in the system. The above problem is a restless multi-armed bandit problem and is provably hard to solve. We prove that the problem is Whittle indexable, and based on this result, propose an association policy under which an arriving user is associated with the BS having the smallest Whittle index. Using simulations, we show that our proposed policy outperforms several user association policies proposed in prior work.},

Compared with existing work, a practical vulnerability-induced colluding attack model is considered, where the malicious participants with different vulnerability levels collude with each other to perform attacks, which makes the participant selection problem more challenging. To address this problem, according to the structural characteristics of the colluding attack model, we derive the necessary condition and sufficient condition of achieving the colluding possibility minimization of the selected participants. A novel resilient participant selection algorithm is developed based on the necessary condition and sufficient condition. The proposed algorithm can select participants to complete tasks with the time complexity &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$O(mn)$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; , where &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$m, n$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; are the numbers of participants and tasks, respectively. We analyze that the proposed algorithm achieves the colluding possibility minimization to defeat the vulnerability-induced colluding attack. It is also analyzed that the social cost of the proposed algorithm is smaller than existing algorithms in terms of the task-performing cost and the potential damage of the colluding attacks. Extensive real-world trace-based simulations are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and the correctness of the theoretical results.},

This action is combined with a wise analysis of the radio resources available for transmission, that identifies subchannels where collisions might occur, to avoid selecting them. Extensive simulations show that the accuracy in the prediction of the CAMs’ temporal pattern is excellent.

Effective incentive mechanisms often play an important role in guaranteeing high quality of services and wide involvement of workers. Much work has been carried out in this aspect to encourage workers to strenuously and truthfully provide high quality data. However, task quality does not only depend on workers’ subjective effort or truthfulness, but also workers’ distribution and task quality growth law. In this paper, we consider a scenario where worker arrivals are unevenly distributed and the growth of task quality conforms to the law of diminishing margin of workers’ efforts. We propose a Quality-driven Online Task-Bundling-based incentive mechanism (QOTB). The design objective is to maximize the social welfare while maximally satisfying the task quality requirements. In QOTB, we introduce Mental accounting Theory to build accounts for task execution profit and bonus, respectively, which are then used to derive the participation willingness of workers. We adopt task bundling to stimulate workers to change their original travel schedules for balancing the task participations according to the popularities of task locations and also the traveling cost. We present the detailed mechanism design of QOTB. We prove that the QOTB mechanism has desired properties of willingness truthfulness, individual rationality, and computation efficiency. We conduct extensive simulations and the results show that QOTB can effectively improve the social welfare while satisfying the task quality requirements.},

  abstract     = {Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET) is vital for supporting intelligent transport systems, such as traffic data sharing and cooperative processing in the modern city. However, data security and privacy are the critical factors restricting the development. To address these challenges, several certificateless conditional privacy-preserving authentication (CPPA) schemes with anonymity and traceability have been proposed. These schemes avoid complicated certificate management in the PKI framework and key escrow in the ID-based protocol. However, there still exist drawbacks such as computational complexity, high communication cost or security vulnerability. Recently, Ali et al. proposed an efficient certificateless CPPA (CLCPPA) scheme for VANETs, but we have found that this scheme fails to resist a signature forgery attack. To achieve a trade-off between security and efficiency, we first demonstrate the insecurity of Ali et al.’s protocol and then introduce a security-enhanced solution. To show the feasibility and utility of our proposal, we perform a security analysis in the security model. Moreover, we evaluate the performance via comparing it with other existing schemes. From the comparison results, we can find that our scheme is more efficient than prior state-of-art solutions, in terms of signing (improving 66.75%), the verification (improving 33.19%) and bandwidth requirement (reducing 14.75%). Therefore, our proposal is more suitable to be applied in VANETs.},

  abstract     = {For vehicle-to-network communications, handover (HO) management enables vehicles to maintain the connection with the network while transiting through coverage areas of different base stations (BSs). However, the high mobility of vehicles means shorter connection periods with each BS that leads to frequent HOs, hence raises the necessity for optimal HO decision making for high quality infotainment services. Machine learning is capable of capturing underlying pattern via data driven methods to find optimal solutions to complex problems, and much learning-based HO optimization research has been conducted focusing on specific network setups. However, attention still needs to be paid to the actual deployment aspect and standardized datasets or simulation environments for evaluation. This paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning-based HO algorithm using the input parameters that are configurable in the existing measurement report of cellular networks. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated using the well-known network simulator ns-3 with its official LTE module. A realistic network setup in the city center of Glasgow (U.K.) is configured with vehicle trajectories generated by the routes mobility model using Google Maps Directions API. Evaluation results reveal that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the A3 RSRP baseline with an average of 25.72% packet loss reduction per HO, suggesting significant improvement in quality of service of phone call and video streaming, etc. The proposed algorithm also has a small implementation cost compared to some state-of-the-art and should be deployed by a software update to a local BS controller.},

  abstract     = {Due to the deployment of 5G technology, the number of IoV (Internet of Vehicle) devices connected to the Internet will explosively grow. However, as a kind of edge network device, IoV devices also face some problems including weak password authentication, lack of security protection, and lagged firmware updating, which largely threaten the security and legitimacy of these devices. IoV device identification is important in discovering, monitoring, and protecting these devices. Although existing proactive identification methods based on device fingerprints can be used to identify the large-scale Internet-connected IoV devices, they can not meet the fine-grained requirements for security risk assessment. Due to the increase in the types and brands of IoV devices, the fingerprint granularity will be insufficient. In this paper, we proposed a retransmission-based TCP fingerprints for large-scale fine-grained proactive device identification. Firstly, a probing scheme was designed to obtain TCP retransmission packet and increase the granularity space of traditional TCP fingerprint by selecting the multi-group features of TCP retransmission messages. Then, according to the bagging strategy of ensemble learning, a combined classifier with five predominant machine learning algorithms was generated. The experimental results showed that the identification accuracy and recall of IoV devices respectively reached 96.7% and 95.2%.},

Hence, we investigate the physical layer security of the downlink in IRS-aided non-orthogonal multiple access networks in the presence of an eavesdropper, where an IRS is deployed for enhancing the quality by assisting the cell-edge user to communicate with the base station. To characterize the network&#39;s performance, the expected value of the new channel statistics is derived for the reflected links in the case of Nakagami- &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$m$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; fading. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed network is evaluated both in terms of the secrecy outage probability (SOP) and the average secrecy capacity (ASC). The closed-form expressions of the SOP and the ASC are derived. We also study the impact of various network parameters on the overall performance of the network considered. To obtain further insights, the secrecy diversity orders and the high signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) slopes are obtained. We finally show that: 1) the expectation of the channel gain in the reflected links is determined both by the number of IRS elements and by the Nakagami- &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$m$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; fading parameters; 2) If the Nakagami- &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$m$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; parameter is no less than 2, the SOP of both User 1 and User 2 becomes unity, when the number of IRS elements tends to infinity; 3) The secrecy diversity orders are affected both by the number of IRS elements and by the Nakagami- &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$m$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; fading parameters, whereas the high-SNR slopes are not affected by these parameters.

In this context, the collaborative beamforming design is very challenging, since it constitutes a large-dimensional nonlinearly constrained optimization problem. The paper develops a new technique for tackling these critical challenges in fog computing. We show that all the associated constraints can be efficiently dealt with maximizing the geometric mean (GM) of the user throughputs (GM-throughput) subject to the affordable total transmit power constraints. To elaborate, the GM-throughput maximization judiciously exploits the fronthaul links and the RRHs’ caches by relying on our novel algorithm, which evaluates low-complexity closed-form expressions in each of its iterations. The problem of F-RAN energy-efficiency is also addressed while maintaining the target throughput. Numerical examples are provided for quantifying the efficiency of the proposed algorithms.},

  abstract     = {This paper explores the feasibility and scope of co-channel coexistence between a low data rate Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) secondary network and a digital television (DTV) broadcast network operating in the same area. Since DTV receivers do not transmit, neither the presence nor the impact of interference from the secondary network on these DTV receivers can be known. Consequently, conventional spectrum sensing techniques cannot be employed effectively. This paper proposes to compensate the lack of feedback by combining the available information about population distribution in the region - ranging from coarse population density estimates to accurate geospatial maps - with better estimation of interference using a data-driven technique called Ordinary Kriging. Radio Environment Maps constructed using the Kriging method from field-reported observations from the secondary nodes are used to obtain better accuracy than the conventional statistical models. The estimates are then used to compute communication parameters for each secondary link in terms of power, number of active subcarriers, and active time slots, while keeping the average interference in the DTV network within threshold bounds. Thus, the viability of such co-channel license-exempt operation of secondary networks in the DTV black and grey spaces for low data rate applications in densely populated urban areas and higher data rate capabilities for sparsely populated rural areas is established.},

While the RSS of a wireless signal can be conveniently accessed, using it to estimate location is non-trivial in the presence of multipath propagation, shadowing and radio interference. Auxiliary information, such as the indoor building map and user&#39;s orientation information, potentially can help to improve localization performance. As the indoor layout is usually known as a priori, a user&#39;s moving direction or orientation in a given indoor map may contain valuable information to assist for reducing location ambiguities at estimation, typically when the radio signal channel is corrupted with noise. In this paper, we propose a double-layer hidden Markov model (DHMM) within a Bayesian learning framework for combining user orientation information and processing RSS data in the localization process to deal with RSS fluctuations induced by human body shadowing and multipath interference. Simulation and experimental results show that incorporating user orientation can potentially provide promising indoor positioning results.},

  abstract     = {Security issue in underwater visible light communication (UVLC) arises mainly due to the scattering effect wherein numerous photons are statistically generated when a light beam strikes a water molecule. This paper considers an underwater communication scenario wherein a floating vehicle (FV) transmitter that is equipped with multiple light-emitting diodes (LEDs) communicates with the two legitimate near-end and far-end underwater vehicles (UVs) in presence of an eavesdropper. In particular, two non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technology-based optimal LED selection (OLS) and suboptimal LED selection (SLS) schemes are proposed to select a LED that can transmit the information with the highest secrecy rate against active/passive eavesdropping attacks. Furthermore, the FVT transmits the information to both UVs with the selected LED only. Utilizing the successive interference cancellation (SIC) characteristic, this paper derives the closed-form secrecy outage probability expressions for both single-LED and multi-LED transmission strategies for both known and unknown CSI. The security performance of the proposed multi-LED NOMA-UVLC is compared with the conventional single-LED NOMA-UVLC under the effects of air bubbles for both fresh and salty water types. In addition, the validity of the numerical results is verified through Monte-carlo simulation analysis.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we investigate non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) assisted secure computation offloading under the eavesdropping-attack, in which a malicious node overhears the edge-computing user&#39;s (EU’s) offloading transmission to the edge-computing server (ES), and NOMA is used for the EU&#39;s offloading and meanwhile for providing artificial jamming to the eavesdropper. Since multi-user simultaneous transmission over a same frequency channel can be enabled by NOMA, a wireless user (WU) can form a NOMA pair with the EU to provide cooperative jamming to the eavesdropper while also gaining an opportunity of sending its data. Focusing on the EU-WU pair with the fixed WU&#39;s energy-provisioning, we exploit the physical layer security to quantify the EU&#39;s offloading throughput with the help of WU&#39;s jamming. We then study the joint optimization of the EU&#39;s computation offloading and the EU-WU&#39;s NOMA transmission for minimizing the EU&#39;s total energy consumption subject to its latency-requirement in completing the computation-task. By utilizing the feature of analytical solution of the WU&#39;s transmission, we then investigate the WU&#39;s optimal energy-provisioning for the EU-WU pair, such that both the EU and WU can benefit from the cooperative jamming in a fairness manner. Specifically, we formulate the EU-WU&#39;s cooperation as a Nash bargaining game. By identifying the monotonic feature of Nash bargaining problem, we propose a polyblock approximation based algorithm for determining the WU&#39;s optimal energy-provisioning to achieve the win-win solution for the paired EU and WU. Finally, we investigate the scenario of multiple EUs and WUs, and aim at finding the stable pairing between the EUs and WUs, such that no individual EU (or WU) would like to change its partner. An efficient algorithm, which is based on the Gale-Shapley theory while exploiting the quantitative feature of EUs’ and WUs’ net-rewards, is proposed to achieve the stable EU-WU pairings. Numerical results are provided to validate our proposed algorithms and demonstrate the advantage of our proposed NOMA assisted computation offloading via cooperative jamming.},

  abstract     = {Computation offloading is an effective method in mobile edge computing (MEC) to relieve user equipment (UE) from the limited computation resource and battery capacity. Meanwhile, simultaneous wireless information and power transmission (SWIPT) can be applied to MEC to extend the operating time of the equipment. However, in multi-user network environment, diverse computation task requirements and changeable network channel states make it challenging to obtain offloading strategy timely and accurately. To address the issue, we propose an intelligent computation offloading scheme (iCOS) based on enhanced priority deep deterministic policy gradient (EPDDPG) algorithm to minimize the energy consumption of all the UEs by jointly optimizing the offloading decision, the central processing unit (CPU) frequency and the power split ratio in a dynamic SWIPT-MEC network. In particular, we improve the traditional fully-connected network structure to obtain both discrete and continuous action outputs, and accelerate neural network parameter updates by using prioritized experience tuples. Furthermore, we use dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) technology to dynamically adjust the CPU frequency of local computing, and employ SWIPT technology to balance the charging and communication according to the obtained strategy. Simulation results show that the algorithm proposed in this paper can effectively reduce the energy cost of UEs, and complete more computation tasks within the delay limit.},

  abstract     = {Future communication networksrequire higher bandwidth, greater coverage, and better throughput. The Space-Air-Ground Integrated Network (SAGIN) has the advantage of wide-area coverage and can cover global communications. It can meet the needs of network resources for maritime activities and remote mountainous areas, which is of great significance to the realization of a new generation of communications networks. With the development of the network and the emergence of delay-sensitive applications such as the Internet of Things, improving the delay performance of the system has received extensive attention. SAGIN involves multiple networks and is more complex than other networks. If there is no reasonable management between different networks, it is easy to lead to difficult link deployment and high time delay. On the basis of research and customization of SFC technology, it can provide a wide range of services and other advantages. It has significant performance in application scenarios involving multi network integration. In order to solve the above problems, this paper studies the SAGIN architecture of SFC based on business types. A service function chain mapping method based on delays prediction is proposed. Calculate the delay of the deployment path and select the path with the lowest delay as the SFC mapping path. The service model is constructed according to the mapping path, and the network slices are divided based on the service type. The simulation results show that the SFC mapping algorithm based on time delay prediction is compared with the traditional SFC mapping scheme.

  abstract     = {In this article, we explore the fundamental limits of the 3-dimensional (3D) localization of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in conjunction with the effects of 3D antenna radiation patterns. Although localization of UAVs has been studied to some extent in the literature, effects of antenna characteristics on 3D localization remains mostly unexplored. To study such effects, we consider a scenario where a fixed number of radio-frequency (RF) sensors equipped with single or multiple dipole antennas are placed at some known locations on the ground, and they derive the time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) measurements from the time-of-arrival (TOA) data collected for the UAV that is also equipped with a dipole antenna. We then use these measurements to estimate the 3D location of the UAV, and to derive the Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) on the localization error for various orientations of the dipole antennas at the transmitter and the receiver. Namely, we consider vertical-vertical (VV), horizontal-horizontal (HH), and vertical-horizontal (VH) radiation patterns in a purely line-of-sight (LoS) environment and a mixed LoS/Non-line-of-sight (NLoS) environment. We show that the localization accuracy changes in a non-monotonic pattern with respect to the UAV altitude and identify the respective critical altitudes for each of the VV, VH and HH orientations. Subsequently, we propose a multi-antenna signal acquisition technique that mitigates the accuracy degradation due to the antenna pattern mismatches, and we derive the localization CRLB for the multi-antenna scenario. Our numerical results characterize achievable localization accuracy for various antenna configurations, UAV heights, and propagation conditions for representative UAV scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Vehicular networks are envisioned to deliver data transmission services ubiquitously, especially in the upcoming autonomous driving era. Accordingly, the high data traffic load poses a heavy burden to the terrestrial network infrastructure. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) show enormous potential to assist vehicular networks in providing services. In a dense UAV-assisted vehicular network with a large number of users, spectrum sharing is leveraged for alleviating the spectrum scarcity. However, the increasing data traffic still leads to the UAV energy consumption problem. This paper considers a specific network scenario where a UAV transmits its cached content files to vehicular users over UAV-to-vehicle (U2V) links while vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) links reuse the U2V spectrum for safety-critical message exchanges. To improve the UAV&#39;s energy efficiency while guaranteeing users’ quality of service (QoS), we jointly optimize content placement, spectrum allocation, co-channel link pairing, and power control, which are the key factors affecting energy efficiency and QoS. The joint optimization problem is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem, which is solved by combining Hungarian and DDQN. We perform system performance evaluations, demonstrating that our approach can not only improve the UAV&#39;s energy efficiency while satisfying the users’ QoS requirements but also increase the timeliness of making decisions.},

  abstract     = {An emerging computational paradigm, named federated edge learning (FEL), enables intelligent computing at the network edge with the feature of preserving data privacy for edge devices. Given their constrained resources, it becomes a great challenge to achieve high execution performance for FEL. Most of the state-of-the-arts concentrate on enhancing FEL from the perspective of system operation procedures, taking few precautions during the composition step of the FEL system. Though a few recent studies recognize the importance of FEL formation and propose server-centric device selection schemes, the impact of data sizes is largely overlooked. In this paper, we take advantage of game theory to depict the decision dilemma among edge devices regarding whether to participate in FEL or not given their heterogeneous sizes of local datasets. For realizing both the individual and global optimization, the server is employed to solve the participation dilemma, which requires accurate information collection for devices’ local datasets. Hence, we utilize mechanism design to enable truthful information solicitation. With the help of correlated equilibrium , we derive a decision making strategy for devices from the global perspective, which can achieve the long-term stability and efficacy of FEL. For scalability consideration, we optimize the computational complexity of the basic solution to the polynomial level. Lastly, extensive experiments based on both real and synthetic data are conducted to evaluate our proposed mechanisms, with experimental results demonstrating the performance advantages.},

  abstract     = {In the cooperative vehicle infrastructure system, the road side unit (RSU) equipped with a mobile edge computing (MEC) server and sensors could provide vehicle infrastructure cooperation services for vehicles, such as optimization and cooperative driving, enhanced visibility, and so on. In view of this, the MEC server needs to fuse the sensing information from sensors on the vehicles and RSU, respectively. In the case of bad channel conditions, uploading the raw sensing information from the vehicles results in high uplink transmission latency. To deal with it, the vehicles can process the information locally and just deliver the results to the RSU. However, due to the limited computing resources on the vehicles, the processing accuracy of the raw information on the vehicles is lower than that on the MEC server. Besides, processing locally leads to higher vehicle energy consumption. Thus, in this paper, we aim to jointly optimize execution latency, processing accuracy, and energy consumption of the MEC-based cooperative vehicle infrastructure system. Firstly, we design the terminal machine learning task model and the edge machine learning task model on the vehicle side and RSU side, respectively. Then, we formulate a long-term multi-objective optimization problem. Owing to the stochastic traffic and time-varying communication conditions, we reformulate it as a Markov decision process and propose a two-stage deep reinforcement learning-based offloading and resource allocation (TDORA) strategy to determine the task offloading and the transmit power of each vehicle. Simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed strategy.},

  abstract     = {From the fourth generation (4G) of cellular systems onward, wireless personal devices (WPDs) support multi-input multi-output (MIMO) communication. However, the impact of MIMO communication on the electromagnetic field (EMF) of WPD users has yet to be fully understood and analyzed at the system level. In this paper, we first provide a generic model for assessing the individual exposure dose of multi-antenna WPD users in a multi-user multi-carrier communication system. An optimization framework for minimizing this exposure dose is then developed based on our exposure model. This framework helps us to identify a new criterion, i.e., the ratio between the normalized exposure dose and the channel to noise ratio (CNR), as the main system level criterion for minimizing the individual exposure dose of multi-antenna WPD users. This criterion is further integrated in the design of two novel centralized resource allocation schemes that take advantage of the multiple antennas at the WPD to minimize the per-user exposure dose, when full or limited knowledge of each user channel is available. Our new schemes can significantly reduce the individual exposure dose of WPD users (by approximately 80%) in comparison with the most relevant existing resource allocation schemes. Our results also provide insights into the logarithmic relationship between the per-user exposure dose and the number of receive antennas (or the number of time slots), and how such a parameter can be exploited to further reduce the exposure and/or provide a higher SE while maintaining a low exposure dose.},

  abstract     = {Due to the forecasted fast increasing cellular traffic and the already highly congested licensed spectrum, it is critical to exploit and utilize the unlicensed spectrum resources for the fifth-generation (5G) and beyond networks. A challenging problem is the coexistence of 5G and other networks with fair, reliable, and efficient sharing of the unlicensed spectrum. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-enhanced distributed spectrum sharing scheme for coexisting multiple operators and multiple WiFi APs. We design a novel lightweight and efficient consensus mechanism, named Proof of Strategy (PoG). In this consensus mechanism, the problem of spectrum sharing is used as a consensus puzzle, and the part of the unlicensed spectrum is used as the ‘fee’ of miners. With such a design, the computing overhead of the consensus process is expected to be reduced significantly. We develop a non-cooperative game to analyze the behavior of the miners and obtain a symmetric Bayesian Nash equilibrium under the uniform distribution of mining cost estimation. It can be found mathematically and experimentally that the strategy of the winner tends to maximize the system revenue by sharing the unlicensed spectrum resource. Furthermore, to reduce the impact of heavy interactions on system throughput, the operation of WiFi APs in the proposed scheme can be adaptively switched between ‘contention mode’ and ‘blockchain mode’ according to the network traffic load. The dynamic behavior is constructed as an evolutionary game, and the existence and uniqueness of equilibrium points are proved by theoretical analysis. Simulations demonstrated the fairness and effectiveness of the proposed blockchain-based scheme and the mode switching method for distributed spectrum sharing by heterogeneous wireless networks.},

In this paper, we propose a joint pilot design and channel estimation based on deep residual learning in order to mitigate the effects of pilot contamination under the consideration of hardware impairments. We first investigate a conventional linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) based channel estimator to suppress the interference caused by pilot contamination. After that, a deep learning based pilot design is proposed to minimize the mean square error (MSE) of LMMSE channel estimation, which is utilized to the joint pilot design and channel estimator for transfer learning approach. For the channel estimator, we use a deep residual learning which extracts the features of interference caused by pilot contamination and eliminates them to estimate the channel information. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed joint pilot design and channel estimation method can effectively reduce the effect of pilot contamination as well as outperforms the conventional approach in multi-cell massive MIMO scenarios. Moreover, the joint pilot design and channel estimation method using transfer learning further enhances the estimation performance when the prior knowledge of pilot contamination cannot be exploited.},

This paper investigates a user-centric dynamic base station (BS) clustering design for a hybrid network where THz, mmWave, and sub-6GHz BSs coexist. Invoking the proposed clustering model, the BS cooperation within each band is made possible by considering long term channel variations and all the surrounding BSs within a cluster with tunable size. A typical user is associated with the best BS cluster, from either a sub-6GHz, mmWave or THz tier based on the maximum signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) criterion or the maximum rate criterion. Using tools from stochastic geometry, we assess the performance of the proposed user-centric hybrid system in terms of SINR and rate coverage performances, while accounting for: band specific propagation models, directional beamfroming, and BSs random locations. The accuracy of the analytical results is validated with Monte-Carlo simulations. The obtained results recognize a clear coverage/rate trade-off where a high fraction of THz BSs improves the rate significantly but may degrade the coverage performance. Thus, with carefully planned networks, enabling user-centric BS cooperation for hybrid wireless systems can achieve ultra-high rates while maintaining sufficient coverage in sixth-generation (6G) networks.},

  abstract     = {The recently proposed dual active protocol stack (DAPS) handover (HO) is one of the mobility enhancements that can effectively reduce the handover interruption time (HIT) in 5G networks. By using a DAPS solution, users can be connected to both the source cell and target cell during the HO execution phase, and thereby 0 ms of HIT becomes possible. However, the DAPS HO procedure may fail in 5G networks due to the channel characteristics of millimeter-wave (mmWave) signals. Since mmWave links are vulnerable to blockages, the received signal quality may degrade suddenly, which gives rise to an abrupt outage before DAPS HO can be completed. In this paper, a novel learning-based DAPS HO technology named intelligent DAPS (I-DAPS) HO is proposed to avoid sudden radio link failure (RLF) while providing a high data rate. The proposed I-DAPS HO uses a double deep Q-network (DDQN) deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework, where blockage predictions are made based on past received signal data such that RLFs can be actively avoided. The performance evaluation demonstrates that the proposed I-DAPS HO scheme can effectively avoid RLF and improve the throughput performance compared to advanced 5G HO schemes.},

  abstract     = {Providing seamless connectivity to unmanned aerial vehicle user equipment (UAV-UE) is very challenging due to the encountered line-of-sight interference and reduced gains of down-tilted base station (BS) antennas. For instance, as the altitude of UAV-UEs increases, their cell association and handover procedure become driven by the side-lobes of the BS antennas. In this paper, the performance of cellular-connected UAV-UEs is studied under 3D practical antenna configurations. Two scenarios are studied: scenarios with static, hovering UAV-UEs and scenarios with mobile UAV-UEs. For both scenarios, the UAV-UE coverage probability is characterized as a function of the system parameters. The effects of the number of antenna elements on the UAV-UE coverage probability and handover rate are then investigated. Moreover, a lower bound on the handover probability is derived as a function of the number of antenna elements and the UAV-UE mobility speed. Results reveal that the UAV-UE coverage probability under a practical antenna pattern is lower than that under a simple antenna model. Moreover, vertically-mobile UAV-UEs are susceptible to altitude handover due to consecutive crossings of the nulls and peaks of the antenna side-lobes. The effect of altitude handover is also shown to be effectively mitigated by serving UAV-UEs cooperatively from multiple ground BSs.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we establish a novel framework for a multi-user mobile edge computing (MEC) network in which a set of users with high downlink rate demands and a set of users with intensive computation tasks can collaborate to achieve a mutually-beneficial scenario such that completion time of the tasks is reduced and the base station (BS) can send more information at a higher rate to the downlink users. Specifically, by leveraging non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) for uplink and downlink traffic, the user with the computation task can offload shares of the computation task to the edge cloud and the downlink user. At the same time, this user forwards the information it receives from the BS to the downlink user. In this set up, we jointly optimize the communication resources, computational resources at the edge cloud and user devices, pairings among the two sets of users, the shares of computation tasks, and relay bits to minimize the total task completion time while satisfying downlink users’ incentive requirements. For a network with a single computation demanding user and a single downlink user, the optimal solution to the problem is provided. For a network with multiple users, the problem is non-convex and computationally challenging. Hence, we propose an efficient, low complexity algorithm that utilizes the bottleneck matching algorithm, convex optimization, and the block coordinate descent scheme to obtain a locally-optimal solution. Simulation results demonstrate that, as compared with the state-of-the-art, the total task completion time is greatly reduced (32%–51%), and a large computational energy savings at the edge cloud (38%–55%) is achieved. Simultaneously, the downlink users’ rates improve compared to the orthogonal transmission.},

The UAV is deployed as a flying base station to communicate with wireless users in the presence of an eavesdropper in the cell. We consider two types of users: the ground users (GUs) served by the UAV and the D2D users that communicate directly with one another. Our aim is to maximize the total energy efficiency (TEE) of all D2D pairs while guaranteeing the quality of service (QoS) requirements and secrecy rates of all GUs and D2D users via joint power control and channel allocation. The considered TEE maximization problem is a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem, which is difficult to solve. Therefore, we propose a method that consists of outer and inner loops. In the outer loop, Dinkelbach&#39;s algorithm is utilized to transform the original fractional programming problem into a subtractive form. In the inner loop, we employ the alternating optimization method and divide the equivalent optimization problem into two sub-problems: power allocation and channel allocation. Solving the two sub-problems directly using standard convex optimization software may have high complexity. Therefore, we also propose a low-complexity algorithm using the Lagrangian dual and Kuhn—Munkres algorithm to obtain the optimal power allocation in closed-form and the optimal channel allocation, respectively. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm converges in a small number of iterations. Furthermore, the proposed approach shows its superior performance compared with other benchmark methods.},

Channel extrapolation, used by many prediction methods, suffers from a limited prediction horizon in difficult radio environments. The predictor antenna (PA) concept provides the prediction horizons required for efficient transmission to fast-moving vehicles by measuring the channel ahead of time with an extra antenna placed on the vehicle. This paper presents a general framework that addresses the practical signal processing challenges of the PA concept. It is adaptable to a vast variety of vehicular deployment, mobility, and communication scenarios. A new theoretical prediction normalized mean-squared error (NMSE) expression is derived based on the presented framework. The framework is demonstrated by applying it to extensive channel measurements and comparing the PA predictions to Kalman-based channel predictions and outdated channel estimates. By studying the impact of vehicular velocity and radio environment on the prediction performance, it is shown that PA prediction is weaker at low velocities, where Kalman prediction methods are sufficient, but is uncontested at high velocities in environments without a dominating path. At high velocities in dominating path environments, the Kalman predictor provides usable predictions, but it is still outperformed by the PA predictions.},

We considered three layers system, where each device offloads its generated tasks in each time slot to any selected layer for computation. On its arrival at such a selected layer, the task is only accepted if the queue size is below the pre-defined threshold, otherwise, such a task is offloaded to the next layer. Tasks were classified into class 1 and class 2 tasks following tasks’ quality of service requirements. We adopted stochastic geometry, parallel computing and queueing theory techniques to model the performance of the considered integrated edge-fog-cloud computing environment and obtained analysis for various performance metrics of interest. The obtained analyses demonstrate the importance of multi-layer and multi-class edge computing systems towards improving the experience of both delay-sensitive and mission-critical applications in any task offloading environment.},

Incorporating the channel response, a particular spectral precoder following the general form is then designed to maximize the ADR under a fixed transmitted power. When a small out-of-band power proportion is required to guarantee spectrum compactness, the proposed pre-equalized and spectrally-precoded OFDM system can provide much higher ADR per unit bandwidth than pre-equalized OFDM, spectrally-precoded OFDM, and nonprecoded OFDM. When the low-complexity receiver is mandatory, a systematically pre-equalized and spectrally precoded OFDM system is also developed to achieve enhanced ADR, extremely high spectrum compactness, and low-complexity receiver operation by trading transmission power on cancellation subcarriers.},

The effects are evaluated in terms of received downlink (DL) signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) and the corresponding ergodic capacity bound. A simulated velocity of 150 km/h is used with a carrier frequency of 2.18 GHz. Maximum ratio (MR) and a codebook-based precoders are used to evaluate single-user transmission; and zero-forcing (ZF), regularized zero-forcing (RZF), and minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) precoders are used to evaluate multi-user transmission with up to nine active users in a cell. Furthermore, predictor antenna predictions are evaluated as a mean of combating channel aging. It is also investigated how the predictor antenna can be used during data reception. Simulations show that outdated channel estimates significantly reduce the SINR and consequently the capacity for all investigated transmission techniques. Basic predictor antenna predictions outperform the use of outdated channel estimates for delays larger than 0.6 ms. In single-user transmission, channel prediction can improve the capacity by 6–14%. The gain from multi-user transmission typically disappears when using outdated channel estimates older than 1 ms. In contrast, the use of predictor antennas enables MIMO for these high-mobility users, which is demonstrated to increase the capacity bound by 100% compared to 1 ms old channel estimates.},

We consider practical communication scenarios with limited spectrum resources, and the cochannel interference arising from the aggressive reuse of frequency severely degrades the system offloading performance. To enhance the system performance, we provide three CAP selection criteria to choose one best CAP among multiple ones. Specifically, criterion I maximizes the computational capability at the CAP, criterion II minimizes the interfering power, while criterion III maximizes the instantaneous channel gain of data link. In time-varying channel environments, the CAP selection may be outdated, which deteriorates the system performance. For the three criteria, we evaluate the system outage probability in the outdated channel state information (CSI) by taking into account the latency, energy consumption and data rate, and provide the analytical and asymptotic expressions of outage probability, from which we obtain some critical insights on the system design. Simulation results are finally demonstrated to verify the proposed studies. In particular, criterion III under the perfect CSI can achieve the system whole diversity order coming from multiple CAPs.},

  abstract     = {In a vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) based on IEEE 802.11p, the performance of the communication link is heavily influenced by interference. To quantify the impact of interference, analytical models usually explicitly or implicitly assumed the interference range beyond which interference is ignored. We find that the potential maximum interference range should be related to the minimum interference power that the device can perceive. However, most previous works on VANET performance modeling simply assumed a fixed interference range. The most recently proposed effective interference range dependent on the signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) threshold may appear to exceed the potential maximum interference range, resulting in an overestimation of the impact of interference. This paper proposes the SINR related Effective Distance Constrained by the Maximum interference range-based (SED-CM) model for IEEE 802.11p VANET performance evaluation on the Highway. First, we give the potential maximum interference range setting by studying the empirical distribution of interference distance corresponding to the minimum interference power in NS2 simulation. The performance metrics are then derived. The proposed SED-CM model is further extended to the intersection scenario. We conducted extensive NS2 simulations to evaluate the proposed model and compare it with three typical models. Results show that the SED-CM model presents the best evaluation ability. Moreover, we experimentally analyzed the effect of vehicle speed on the performance of VANET by mapping the vehicle speed to the vehicle density. Results show that a faster beacon rate is required to meet the reliability requirement of safety applications with the increase in vehicle speed.},

  abstract     = {Visible light communication (VLC) is being envisioned as an enabling technology for the physical layer of the sixth generation (6G) of communication networks which promises to support the massive connectivity requirements of the Internet of things (IoT). Due to its ability to safely function in areas that are otherwise susceptible to electromagnetic interference (e.g., aircraft, hospitals, etc.), VLC is a popular candidate for intravehicular communication systems in flights, ambulances, etc. However, the achievable data rate in VLC systems is severely limited by the low modulation bandwidth of the light sources. This limitation is ameliorated by using non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) to multiplex users in the power domain. In this paper, we propose to enhance the fairness among users in terms of their error performance and the achievable data rate in a NOMA-VLC system. Based on numerical and simulation results, we show that the fair power allocation (FPA) scheme not only provides significantly higher fairness but it also entails better error performance, improved energy efficiency, and enhanced system throughput as compared to the existing power allocation schemes. We also demonstrate that the FPA scheme exhibits superior performance even when the system parameters, like the number of users, transmitter semi-angle, and detector field-of-view, are changed. We conclude that the FPA scheme is a promising technique for the efficient implementation of NOMA in 6G-VLC broadcasting systems.},

Before performing scheduling itself, we exploit statistical Channel State Information (CSI) to create clusters of spatially compatible User Equipmentss (UEss). This structure, combined with the usage of Zero-Forcing precoding, allows us to reduce the scheduler complexity by considering each cluster as an independent virtual RL scheduling agent. Next, we apply a new learning-based scheduler aiming to optimize the desired system performance metric. Moreover, only scheduled UEss need to feed back instantaneous equivalent CSI, which also reduces the signaling overhead of the proposal. The superiority of the proposed framework is demonstrated through numerical simulations in comparison with reference solutions.},

Caching at mobile user devices by leveraging D2D communications relieves the heavy load on backhaul links and enhances users’ quality of service. Therefore, in a cache-enabled clustered D2D network, we analyze the probability of successful transmission and propose a jointly optimizing bandwidth partitioning and caching policy strategy to solve the average energy consumption minimization problem. To simultaneously have the clustered and bounded characteristics of D2D communication in real hotspots areas, we use Matérn cluster process (MCP) to model the cache-enabled clustered D2D network. For a given D2D receiver (DR), we derive the successful transmission probability of getting its requested content. Moreover, leveraging the analysis of successful transmission probability, a joint bandwidth partitioning and caching policy optimization problem is formulated to reduce average energy consumption. Considering the complexity of directly solving the optimization problem, two sub-problems are decoupled and solved iteratively. The optimized solutions of bandwidth partitioning and caching policy sub-problems are obtained by taking the derivative and adaptive mutation particle swarm optimization (AMPSO) algorithm, respectively. The simulations show the influence of the related parameters on system performance and illustrate that the strategy to jointly optimize bandwidth partitioning and caching policy can significantly reduce energy consumption.},

In this paper, we aim to further decrease UAV energy consumption while minimizing UAV task completion time. We propose a novel UAV utility function to describe task completion time for data acquisition and energy consumption for propulsion and receiver&#39;s circuits. Then, we formulate a mixed-integer nonconvex utility maximization problem, involving joint optimization of UAV trajectory, velocity, acceleration, task completion time and scheduling of IoT devices for data uploading. To tackle this problem, we decompose the original problem into two sub-problems and propose a two-layer joint task time and trajectory optimization (JTTTO) iterative algorithm, which converges in polynomial time. Accordingly, we apply block coordinate descent (BCD) and successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithms to optimize UAV trajectory, and bisection search algorithm to minimize task completion time, respectively. Simulation results show that the proposed data acquisition scheme significantly decreases the UAV&#39;s energy consumption while minimizing task completion time, compared with the other time-minimization schemes.},

The objective of the precoder design is to maximize the ergodic sum-rate under total power constraint. Based on the minorize-maximize (MM) algorithm, a stationary solution of the ergodic sum-rate maximization problem can be obtained. The stationary solution is shown to be the same as the optimal solution to a stochastic weighted minimum mean square error (SWMMSE) problem. Further, we establish the approximations for rate expressions with deterministic equivalent. The deterministic equivalents of ergodic rates are only related to the precoding matrices and statistical CSI. According to these closed-form rate expressions, we propose a linear precoder design algorithm and obtain tractable expressions for precoding matrices.

The BS in the decentralized algorithm consists of multiple processing units (PUs), and each PU separately estimates the channels of a group of users, by employing the proposed D-VBL algorithm. To reduce channel estimation error, the PUs exploit the structured sparsity inherent in multi-user mMIMO channels by exchanging information among themselves. We investigate the proposed C-VBL and low-complexity D-VBL algorithms and show that i) they substantially outperform the state-of-the-art centralized and decentralized algorithms in terms of the normalized mean squared error and the bit error rate. This is because they beneficially exploit the inherent channel sparsity, while the existing state-of-the-art solutions fail to do so.

  abstract     = {Inspired by the individual advantages of spatial modulation (SM), space shift keying (SSK), and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technologies, this research designs NOMA-SM/SSK amalgamation models with a general number of users. Based on the number of RF chains, they are classified into multi-RF (MRF) and single-RF (SRF) models. We first present a spectral-efficient MRF model and then propose a new energy-efficient generalized SRF model denoted as SRFGen. In SRFGen, all users jointly choose a shared transmit antenna (TA) and independently select their modulation symbols. The SRFGen&#39;s flexibility produces several special cases covering the literature on SRF models and resolves their limits. Among the scenarios, an SRF NOMA-SSK supports multi - SSK signals and is proposed to reduce interference and detection processes. Then, introduce a low complexity TA index detector and an adaptive and fair power allocation algorithm. The spectral efficiency (SE) of the MRF and SRFGen is analyzed with lower bounds for both Gaussian and finite-alphabet inputs. Using the SE analysis and bit-error-rate (BER) simulation, the NOMA-SM/SSK models are evaluated regarding users’ rates, sum-rate, ergodic capacity, and BER. The results show that the MRF grants high SE, whereas the SRFGen provides flexibility in trading-off features like SE, BER, users’ fairness, and detection complexity. The outcomes also reveal the superior performance of the presented SRF models compared to the literature SRF models. Besides, the results reinforce the superiority of NOMA-SM/SSK over OMA-SM.},

  abstract     = {Meta-surfaces intend to improve the performance of future wireless networks significantly by controlling the wireless propagation and shaping the radio waves according to the generalized Snell&#39;s law. A recent application of meta-surfaces are reconfigurable intelligent surfaces that are mainly proposed for the reflection and steering of the impinging signal. In this article, we introduce randomly reconfigurable surfaces (RRSs) aiming to diffuse the incoming wave and characterize the performance of an RRS-assisted communication network. To facilitate the performance analysis of an RRS-assisted network, first, we present novel closed-form expressions for the probability density function, the cumulative distribution function, the moments, and the characteristic function of the amplitude of the distribution of the sum of double-Nakagami- &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$m$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; random vectors, whose amplitudes follow the double-Nakagami- &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$m$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; distribution, and phases following the circular uniform distribution. We also consider a special case of this distribution, namely the distribution of the sum of Rayleigh-Nakagami-m random vectors. Then, we exploit the obtained expressions to investigate the RRS-assisted composite channel, assuming that the two links undergo Nakagami- &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$m$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; fading. Specifically, closed-form expressions for the outage probability, the average received signal-to-noise ratio, the ergodic capacity, the bit error probability, the amount of fading, and the channel quality estimation index are provided to evaluate the performance of the considered system. Finally, these metrics are also derived for the practical special case where one of the two links undergoes Rayleigh fading, implying that this link is non-line-of-sight.},

On the basis of the a posteriori channel model, we consider the robust precoder design by maximizing an upper bound of the expected weighted sum-rate under a total power constraint. We derive two concave minorizing functions of the objective function. With these minorizing functions and the minorize-maximization (MM) methodology, we derive two iterative algorithms that converge to stationary points of the optimization problem.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a framework of the mutual information-maximizing (MIM) quantized decoding for low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes by using simple mappings and fixed-point additions. Our decoding method is generic in the sense that it can be applied to LDPC codes with arbitrary degree distributions, and can be implemented based on either the belief propagation (BP) algorithm or the min-sum (MS) algorithm. In particular, we propose the MIM density evolution (MIM-DE) to construct the lookup tables (LUTs) for the node updates. The computational complexity and memory requirements are discussed and compared to the LUT decoder variants. For applications with low-latency requirement, we consider the layered schedule to accelerate the convergence speed of decoding quasi-cyclic LDPC codes. In particular, we develop the layered MIM-DE to design the LUTs based on the MS algorithm, leading to the MIM layered quantized MS (MIM-LQMS) decoder. An optimization method is further introduced to reduce the memory requirement for storing the LUTs. Simulation results show that the MIM quantized decoders outperform the state-of-the-art LUT decoders in the waterfall region with both 3-bit and 4-bit precision over the additive white Gaussian noise channels. For small decoding iterations, the MIM quantized decoders also achieve a faster convergence speed compared to the benchmarks. Moreover, the 4-bit MIM-LQMS decoder can approach the error performance of the floating-point layered BP decoder within 0.3 dB in the moderate-to-high SNR regions, over both the AWGN channels and the fast fading channels.},

  abstract     = {Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) combined with orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) technique can dramatically increase the achievable rate of visible light communication (VLC) systems. The channel in a VLC system with light-emitting diode (LED) luminaires is generally low-pass, which highly limits the achievable rate of practical VLC systems. This aspect has largely been ignored in the analysis for MIMO-OFDM VLC systems. As wide parts of the bandwidth at higher frequencies are severely attenuated, the choice of the power loading on every frequency bin has a large impact on the achieved bit rate. Thus, in this paper, we propose a two-dimensional water-filling (2D-WF) power allocation algorithm that operates both in frequency and space domains to efficiently improve the rate achieved by MIMO-OFDM VLC systems over low-pass VLC channels. The achievable rates and optimal bandwidths of a MIMO-OFDM VLC system are derived analytically using the proposed 2D-WF power allocation algorithm and five conventional power allocation strategies, including uniform (UF) power allocation, pre-emphasis (PE) power allocation, beamforming (BF) power allocation, and two kinds of one-dimensional water-filling (1D-WF) power allocation. Our simulation results show that the achievable rate of a MIMO-OFDM VLC system in a typical indoor environment can be significantly degraded by the low-pass effect. The proposed 2D-WF power allocation outperforms all other schemes in terms of achievable bit rate.},

The evaluation is based on the concept of a truncated octahedron that is the fundamental three-dimensional (3D) shape that models the basic cell in an entirely aerial cellular structure with UAV nodes only. The spatial locations of the aerial users, are modeled as a 3D Binomial Point Process (BPP). Subsequently, stochastic geometry analysis in a reference truncated octahedron located at the origin is performed and exact expressions for the distances between aerial users, are derived. To this end, expressions for evaluating the volume of the regions of the 3D cell in which an aerial user may fall, are derived. Then, by defining the signal-to-interference-plus-noise (SINR) ratio at the reference UAV-base station (UAV-BS) receiver, a performance analysis in terms of coverage probability is conducted under two interference scenarios, i.e., a pure intra-cell interference and an intra- plus inter-cell interference case. As intermediate step in the coverage probability analysis, expressions for relevant distance distributions and the Laplace transform of the aggregate interference power distribution are derived. For the sake of completeness, coverage probability analysis under intra-cell interference is also performed and compared to a 3D cell modeled as a sphere. The analytical expressions are also compared to simulation results to validate the accuracy of the proposed framework and reveal valuable insights.},

The sensor fusion is intended to combine the data of these sensors to perform a robust environment perception. Multi-object tracking algorithms have a suitable software architecture for sensor data fusion. Several multi-object tracking algorithms, such as JPDAF or MHT, have good tracking performance; however, the computational requirements of these algorithms are significant according to their combinatorial complexity. The GM-PHD filter is a straightforward algorithm with favorable runtime characteristics that can track an unknown and time-varying number of objects. However, the conventional GM-PHD filter has a poor performance in object cardinality estimation.

These cyber attacks include random attacks, false data injection (FDI) attacks and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. The MSIS detector computes the operator norm of the normalized innovation (residual) sequence within a sliding time window and triggers the alarm if the value is above the preset threshold. For a quadrotor undergoing rapid turns in a complex trajectory, the detector observes a reduced false alarm rate as compared to other state estimation-based detectors. To address the initial estimation error problem, we implement an iteration procedure to initiate and calibrate the detector. By evaluating the sample covariance of the normalized innovation sequence, the MSIS detector has the capability to isolate cyber attacks. Finally, simulation results of a quadrotor in a periodic, complex trajectory flight are provided to verify the effectiveness of the MSIS detection and isolation method.},

Specifically, by combining a super-twisting second-order sliding mode (SOSM) strategy and a disturbance observer (DO), we design a super-twisting SOSMDO platoon controller. We also derive some design conditions of the controller and observer gains. Using the Lyapunov methodology, we theoretically prove under the design conditions the finite-time convergence of the super-twisting SOSMDO to the platooning equilibrium state and its closed-loop stability to the disturbances. Extensive simulations have been conducted and the results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed control approach in terms of inter-vehicle spacing, velocity tracking, and platoon robustness.},

  abstract     = {As for fuel cell hybrid electric vehicle equipped with battery (BAT) and ultracapacitor (UC), its dynamic topology structure is complex and different characteristics of three power sources induce challenges in energy management for fuel economy, power sources lifespan, and dynamic performance of the vehicle. In this paper, an energy management strategy (EMS) based on a hierarchical power splitting structure and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is proposed. In the higher layer strategy of the proposed EMS, the UC is employed to supply peak power and recover braking energy through the adaptive filter based on fuzzy control. Then, the integrated DRL and equivalent consumption minimization strategy framework is proposed to optimize the power allocation of fuel cell (FC) and BAT in the lower layer, to ensure the highly efficient operation of FC and reduce hydrogen consumption. And the action trimming based on heuristic technique is proposed to further restrain the adverse effect of sudden peak power on FC lifespan. The simulation results show the proposed EMS can make the output of FC smoother, improve its working efficiency to alleviate the stress of BAT, and increase by 14.8% compared with the Q-learning strategy in fuel economy under WLTP driving cycle. Meanwhile, the obtained results under UDDSHDV show fuel economy of the proposed EMS can reach dynamic programming (DP) benchmark level of 89.7 &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\%$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; .},

  abstract     = {This article presents the feasibility of a flyback charger for electric vehicles (EV) based on silicon-carbide (SiC) devices. The flyback topology is simplest, but its device voltage stresses are strongly affected by the transformer leakage inductance. To reduce the device voltage stresses by recovering the energy stored in the transformer leakage inductance, an active-clamp circuit and active snubber circuit are adopted in both sides of the transformer. Also, the active-clamp circuit helps to reduce the switching losses by making zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) condition. By deriving the loss equations of switching devices and transformer as a function of the switching frequency and magnetic flux swing, design optimization considering loss and volume is attempted. The snubber capacity and diode voltage stress are quantitatively suggested through the analysis of the power absorbed by the active snubber. Based on the analysis, a 3.3 kW/100 kHz prototype is designed and experimented to show the feasibility. Test results demonstrate 96.7% peak efficiency and 96.4% full load efficiency at 330V output voltage.},

  abstract     = {Solid-state transformers (SST) are emerging technologies to replace the conventional low-frequency main transformer (MTR) in railway vehicles. In order to isolate the load side from the AC 25 kV high-voltage (HV) side and to reduce the whole size of the SST, HV insulation and high-frequency transformers should be used in DC/DC converters. Furthermore, due to the severe constraint of installation space and difficulty of heat dissipation management in the bottom of railway vehicles, high-power density and minimum transformer loss should be considered. To satisfy such design requirements of the proposed SST for railway vehicles, high efficiency integrated transformers, which inherently have leakage inductance, are proposed for dual-active-bridge (DAB) converters in this paper. In order to obtain appropriate equivalent leakage inductance for the DAB converters, a calculation methodology for the leakage inductance has been introduced and verified by simulation. Two separated winding structures in the center-core are adopted to improve the core loss, and appropriate winding turns with 60 kV HV insulation capability are selected, according to the proposed design procedure of the integrated transformers. In order to compare the proposed transformers with the conventional transformer having additional inductors and to verify the major characteristics of the transformers, two 125 kW proposed transformers and conventional transformers have been built and evaluated by an 250 kW SST module, operating at 10 kHz switching frequency. Under a 125 kW full-load condition, 99.7% transformer efficiency was obtained by the proposed integrated transformers, which are 4.7% smaller and 7.0% lighter than the conventional transformer. As a result, 26°C maximum temperature improvement has been obtained and 60k V HV insulation capability has been satisfied by the proposed integrated transformers.},

This paper proposes a comprehensive system that integrates MOD and PD with VA-GA near-field communication (NFC). A common high-frequency aided carrier is used not only for NFC, but also for MOD and PD. In addition, an array of dual-purpose detection coils is proposed as a sensor for MOD and PD. As a result, the three functions listed above share numerous components and circuits, greatly simplifying the system structure. Furthermore, because the high-frequency aided carrier can operate with or without a power carrier, the preceding three functions are independent of system power status. The proposed method has been validated using a 3.3 kW WEVC prototype operating at 85 kHz. The experimental results show that the proposed system is capable of performing both online and offline NFC, MOD, and PD with high sensitivity while having no impact on wireless charging efficiency.},

  abstract     = {There is recognized interest in in-wheel motors for vehicle traction. Studies have gradually focused the design of in-wheel motors on electro-mechanical vibration, subject to the demand of driving comfort. It is crucial to model, analyze, and minimize the air-gap exciting force, the dominant source of vibration. In order to qualitatively and quantitatively study the air-gap vibrational exciting force and evaluate its characteristic for an in-wheel outer-runner permanent magnet synchronous machine (PMSM), this research proposes an air-gap permeance model (APM) and a unique adaptive reluctance network model (ARNM). In the process of motor design, APM is a quick means of determining dominant radial force density (RFD) harmonics and minimizing specific components that may produce considerable vibration. Morphing surface-mounted magnets and nonuniform air-gap length are guided by design optimization which complicates the analysis. Yet, proposed ARNM can account for this geometry variation and handle deformed gap geometry by using modified equation-based local permeance and residual flux. The speed and accuracy of proposed model are verified through the comparison of flux density and force mapping data between the calculation by proposed analytical model and the simulation by finite element tools. A 3-kW prototype is fabricated and tested to explore the effectiveness of ARNM-based performance prediction.},

To generate diverse image data, image generation techniques using deep learning, such as a generative adversarial network, can be used. However, because these methods require a large number of training data and a significant calculation time, they are unsuitable for generating training data for machine learning. In this article, we propose an image data augmentation model based on the statistical properties of the training data. With the proposed method, each image is divided into sub-regions based on the correlation calculated using a set of images. The image of each sub-region is modeled through a Gaussian mixture, and data augmentation is conducted by generating images based on this model. The proposed method does not require a large number of training data and can generate data within a relatively short calculation time. The proposed method is applied to the task of road environment recognition. The experiment results showed that the accuracy was improved through image augmentation using the proposed model.},

In this paper, implementation of the control scheme is demonstrated on an all-wheel-drive test platform. Both centralized and agent-based MPCs for vehicular stability are compared for their control performances as well as computational costs on embedded hardware. It is shown from experimental results that agent-based MPC is more flexible and computationally efficient in handling vehicle active safety challenges while gives no compromise to control performances compared to their holistically formulated counterparts.},

The antenna is composed of two pillbox reflector beamforming networks (BFNs) and a series-fed microstrip line based dual CP leaky-wave antenna (LWA) array, which has a symmetrical structure and can obtain both left hand circular polarization (LHCP) and right hand circular polarization (RHCP) by switching the exciting current direction of the microstrip line. Besides, a shorted stub is loaded in the LWA to suppress the open-stop band (OSB), and thus achieve the broadside radiation and good impedance matching of the LWA. To realize the dual-polarized radiation characteristic with low-cost passive beam scanning capability, two pillbox BFNs are connected at both sides of the LWA to share the LWA aperture. The two different BFNs can excite different CP radiation patterns. A prototype of the proposed antenna is fabricated in the frequency band 23.5–24.5 GHz, and the measured results approve that the proposed antenna can realize ±36° beam scanning range with −4.0 dB crossover level, and the gain is higher than 17.7 dBi in the operating band. The advantages of the proposed antenna, including low-profile, low-cost, passive beam scanning ability, and dual circular polarization, make it an attractive choice for low-cost millimeter-wave radar applications.},

Nevertheless, the quantitative relationship between driving behaviors and vehicle fuel consumption remains obscure. Addressing this critical missing link will contribute to the improvement of transportation sustainability, as well as understanding drivers’ behavioral diversity. This study proposed an integrated microscopic driver behavior and fuel consumption model to assess and predict vehicle fuel economy with naturalistic highway and local commuting traffic data. Through extensive Monte Carlo simulations, significant correlation results are revealed between specific individual driving preferences and fuel economy over drivers’ frequent commuting routes. Correlation results indicate that the differences in fuel consumption incurred by various driving behaviors, even in the same traffic conditions, can be as much as 29% for a light-duty truck and 15% for a passenger car. A Gaussian Process Regression model is further trained, validated, and tested under different traffic and vehicle conditions to predict fuel consumption based on drivers’ personalized behaviors. Such a quantitative and personalized model can be used to identify and recommend fuel-friendly driving behaviors and routes, demonstrating a strong incentive for relevant stakeholders.},

  abstract     = {3D LiDAR maps are playing a more and more important role in intelligent vehicle localization. In this paper, the proposed SeqPolar localization method consists of two parts. The first part is a novel node-based LiDAR map representation method, termed polarized LiDAR map (PLM), and the second is a map matching algorithm based on a second-order hidden Markov model (HMM2) for vehicle localization. Unlike existing 3D LiDAR map, which is usually constructed by accumulating 3D LiDAR clouds collected at different times, the proposed polarized LiDAR map is generated from a set of nodes. Each node consists of three elements: a polarized LiDAR image, scene features extracted from the polarized LiDAR image, and sensor pose. The polarized LiDAR image encodes 3D coordinates and reflectivities of the 3D LiDAR cloud using a multi-channel image format, a more concise, straightforward, and structured representation of the 3D LiDAR cloud. In the localization step, we propose an HMM2-based method to match a sequence of input polarized images within the map nodes and find the nearest node from the PLM. Afterward, the vehicle is readily localized from the matched map node with 3D registration. The proposed SeqPolar localization method has been validated with the actual field dataset and the public KITTI database. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed HMM2-based matching method can achieve up to 98% accuracy to find the nearest node from PLM. Moreover, the SeqPolar localization method based on the pre-built PLM can achieve 30-centimeter localization accuracy in average on both test datasets.},

Strong nonlinearity, coupling characteristics, parametric uncertainties, external disturbances, and complicated driving scenarios put forward great challenges in estimation, control, and optimization of autonomous vehicles. Multi-dimension information utilization offers an effective solution to cope with the foregoing challenges. The presented research proposes a path planning and tracking framework for optimal design and regulation of control variables for collision avoidance and active guidance system, aiming to improve tracking performance and system robustness. For path planning approach, a virtual harmful potential field in 3 dimension (3D) is built to provide a collision-free trajectory as a reference path for path following, depending on vehicle kinematic model and boundary conditions of roads. A linear parameter-varying, polytopic vehicle lateral model is developed to address the issues of time-variable longitudinal speeds and preview distance on vehicle lateral stability management. Further, a strong robust gain-scheduling path following control approach based on linear matrix inequality methodology is proposed to tackle problems relating to characteristics of temporal variations, parametric uncertainties and external disturbances. Comparisons study under the TruckMaker/Xpack4-RapidECU joint HIL platform demonstrate that both tracking precision and high robustness to parametric uncertainties and external disturbances are superior than model predictive control method.

To solve this, in this paper we present a new advanced AIM approach based on end-to-end Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) and trained using Curriculum through Self-Play , called advanced Reinforced AIM ( adv. RAIM). adv. RAIM enables the control of CAVs at intersections in a collaborative way, autonomously learning complex real-life traffic dynamics. In addition, adv .RAIM provides a new way to build smarter AIMs capable of proactively controlling CAVs in other highly complex scenarios. Results show remarkable improvements when compared to traffic light control techniques (reducing travel time by 59% or reducing time lost due to congestion by 95%), as well as outperforming other recently proposed AIMs (reducing waiting time by 56%), highlighting the advantages of using MADRL.},

  abstract     = {This work focuses on the dissipative analysis and quantized sampled-data control design issues for T-S fuzzy networked control system (TSFNCS) under stochastic cyber-attacks (SCAs), which have strong application backgrounds and significant theoretical research value in the field of network security. For this work, a novel time-delay-product relaxed condition (TDPRC) is introduced, which can obtain the slack constraints based on the delay information. Then, by fully considering the delay and sampling time point information, an improved boundary looped-functional (BLF) is developed to acquire more information on the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF). In addition, based on the relationship between the sampling moments &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$(t_{k+1}-t)\eta ^{T}_{3}(t)$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; and &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$(t-t_{k})\eta ^{T}_{4}(t)$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; in &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$V_{c}(x_{t})$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; , the obtained constraints may be further relaxed. Next, a new criterion and the corresponding algorithm are established using reciprocally convex matrix inequality (RCMI), proper integral inequalities, and the linear convex combination method (LCCM). In addition, a new quantitative sample data (QSD) controller under SCA is designed to ensure that TSFNCS is asymptotically stable (AS) and dissipative. Finally, the experiment of the truck-trailer system (TTS) dynamics equations proves the correctness of the theory proposed in this paper.},

In the frame of Global Chassis Control, it proposes a hierarchical control approach focuses on compensating the chassis dynamics against driver disturbances. It is based on a supervisory structure consists of two main levels, a global controller for regulating chassis variables and a local controller to each suspension system. Both controllers are designed using a fractional-order robust controller, namely CRONE controller, to provide an optimized solution for the performance-robustness tradeoff. The main objective is to improve ride comfort for passengers while respecting road holding and handling criteria. In contrast to other studies, random road disturbances are considered to investigate the limits of the proposed approach. Analysis in frequency and time domain has been done to evaluate the performance and robustness of the designed controller. Simulation results based on a full nonlinear 14 degree of freedom vehicle model show that the proposed strategy can effectively improve the ride quality in the field of interest where a significant performance in driver disturbance rejection is reported.},

  abstract     = {Thelast decade has witnessed growing research interests in the path-planning problem for unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) equipped with RGB-D cameras or LiDARs. However, apart from their extremely high cost, these sensors may be obscured by obstacles, which makes them impractical for many complex scenarios. Besides, most of the existing works for path planning have not considered energy efficiency for UGVs that are usually constrained by limited on-board batteries. Distinct from existing methods, this work presents a vision-based unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted cooperative system for multiple UGVs. The proposed system harnesses the broad vision of UAV and operates in both general outdoor and global positioning system (GPS)-denied indoor environments. In sharp contrast to the conventional heuristic algorithms such as the rapidly exploring random tree (RRT) algorithm and the Dijkstra methods, the proposed energy-efficient path planning for UGVs is formulated as a non-convex optimization problem by considering the collision-aware obstacle-avoidance. More specifically, the proposed path-planning scheme contains two stages, namely the semantic segmentation that localizes UGVs and obstacles in the environment by exploiting the wide-angle camera mounted on the UAV, followed by the trajectory generation in which a disciplined convex and concave programming (DCCP) algorithm is devised for the non-convex energy-minimization problem. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the UAV-UGV cooperative system and the proposed DCCP-based path-planning scheme.},

Since passenger comfort plays a critical role for self driving vehicle, we propose a comfort model that captures different aspects: planar and vertical accelerations and the contribution of different frequency components.

This paper proposed a scalable cascade modular path following control strategy for the newly designed gantry virtual track train (G-VTT) based on preview &amp; tracking controller, focusing on the lateral control for low-speed turning manoeuvre. The mathematical characteristics of the 2-norm was utilized to establish a local tracking objective function (LTOF) to find the optimal lateral acceleration (OLA) of the tracking point in the preview window and calculate the optimal wheel steering angle (WSA) to achieve the optimal local trajectory. Considering the lag time T d , the yaw stability and path following ability of the vehicle are contradictory in some cases, so the damping adjustment factor λ was proposed to optimize the damping characteristics and the time-delay stability factor ξ was proposed to evaluate the time-delay stability. The influence of the key parameters, preview time T p , T d , ξ and λ , on the stability and following ability were analyzed by frequency domain analysis method, and the optimal region of ξ and λ was obtained to instruct the configuration of λ and T p . Finally, steady-state and dynamic forward predictive models were proposed to compensate for the oscillation caused by the lag time. The effectiveness of the proposed control strategy, forward predictive models and the configuration method of λ and T p were verified by theoretical analysis and numerical simulation.},

The on-ramp merging control and the PHEV energy management are co-optimized such that the DRL policy directly outputs the power split between the engine and the electric motor. The testing results show that DRL can be successfully used for co-optimization, leading to collision-free on-ramp merging. When compared with sequential approaches wherein the upper-level on-ramp merging control and the lower-level PHEV energy management are performed independently and in sequence, we found that co-optimization results in economic but jerky on-ramp merging while sequential approaches may result in collisions due to neglecting powertrain power limit constraints in designing the upper-level on-ramp merging controller.},

For a half bogie which is a rigid coupled structure with a separate levitation unit at each endpoint, the effects of track irregularities hamper the synchronization of the two units. Motivated by the aforementioned, this paper establishes a newly nonlinear model for the half bogie considering irregularities, internal and external disturbances. Based on this model, a prescribed-time synchronization controller (PTSC) considering input constraints is designed while two adaptive disturbance observers (ADOs) are combined to address track irregularities and disturbances. To reduce the actuating times caused by synchronization, a lazy cooperation mode is adopted by independently introducing an event-triggered mechanism for each levitation unit. Theoretical analysis establishes the stability of the whole control scheme and demonstrates that the tracking errors and estimate errors can be arbitrarily small within a prescribed time, which can be determined by users through a parameter, and the synchronization is achieved. Numerical simulations compared with other two control schemes verify the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme, where both the ideal irregularity model and the field data measured from the Shanghai commercial line are tested.},

  abstract     = {Due to the gap between calculation-intensive and latency-sensitive features of self-driving tasks and the vehicle&#39;s limited computation and storage resources, the development of autonomous vehicles is situated in a bottleneck. Fortunately, multi-access edge computing (MEC) architecture offers a promising measure to bridge this gap. It brings resources proximity to mobile devices at the network edge to support task offloading. Nonetheless, it introduces the problem of insecure wireless communication. Beyond that, the autonomous vehicle also has strict requirements on latency and energy consumption of task offloading technique owing to its safety-related and electricity-driven characteristics. Many scholars have studied the related problems widely. Nevertheless, few papers combine these three significant factors, namely information security, task latency and energy consumption. Thus, we put forward a mobility-ware task offloading scheme in cellular vehicle-to-everything system, which carefully considers these three requirements together. In this scheme, a time approximation algorithm is proposed to tackle the channel condition variations caused by the vehicle movement. Small-cell base station proactively sends artificial noise to debase wiretapper decoding capability and further prevent data exchanged between vehicles and MEC from being eavesdropped at the physical layer. Moreover, the optimal offloading proportion is found to minimize the weighted sum of latency and energy consumption. Experimental performances validate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed task offloading scheme.},

To solve the problem caused by unbalanced back-EMF waveform in conventional doubly salient machines, this paper presents a novel doubly salient wound field machine with balanced and symmetrical back-EMF waveform as starter generator in automobile application. The robust structure and the controllable flux are inherited, while the magnetless feature makes it promising for cost-sensitive applications. The proposed machine can be operated as an assistant motor for torque boosting at start-up stage, as well as a power recycling generator for battery charging at steady state. It is revealed that the proposed wound field machine exhibits similar cost, comparable torque density, improved torque ripple, and higher efficiency than the switched reluctance machine. Finally, the proposed prototype is fabricated, and dynamic experiment is conducted to validate the feasibility for automobile starter generator application.},

In this work, we propose a new 3-dimensional (3-D) dynamic non-wide-sense stationary (non-WSS) cluster-based geometric model for UAV multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels. We assume that a few non-isotropic scatterers are distributed around the terrestrial receiver and have a probabilistic movement behavior. Meanwhile, we consider that the UAV flies at a varying speed, and we design a non-stationary mobility model with acceleration. The proposed channel model performs the birth-death evolutionary process of clusters based on a Markov model, and the time-variant multipath component (MPC) parameters (e.g., angle of arrival/departure (AoA/AoD), power, and delay) are obtained. In addition, we derive the space-time correlation function, mean Doppler spread, and root-mean-square doppler shift spread of the UAV MIMO channels, and provide the quasi-stationary interval. We also investigate the impact of some key model factors on the statistical properties by numerical simulations. Finally, we compare the space-time correlation functions and the second-order statistical properties between the proposed model and the UAV channel measurement results. The close agreements between the numerical simulations and field measurements have validated the proposed model.},

  abstract     = {With the deep integration between the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and wireless communication, UAV-based air-to-ground (AG) propagation channels need more detailed descriptions and accurate models. In this paper, we aim to conduct cluster-based characterization and modeling for AG channels. To our best knowledge, this is the first study that concentrates on the clustering and tracking of multipath components (MPCs) for time-varying AG channels. Based on measurement data at 6.5 GHz with a bandwidth of 500 MHz, we first estimate potential MPCs utilizing the space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE) algorithm. Then, we cluster the extracted MPCs by employing K-Power-Means (KPM) algorithm under multipath component distance (MCD) measure. For characterizing time-variant clusters, we exploit a clustering-based tracking (CBT) method, which efficiently quantifies the survival lengths of clusters. Ultimately, we establish a cluster-based channel model, and validations illustrate the accuracy of the proposed model. This work not only promotes a better understanding of AG propagation channels but also provides a general cluster-based AG channel model with certain extensibility.},

This paper designs a low-complexity scheme to achieve the balanced tradeoff between the sum-rate and power consumption in a RIS-assisted NOMA system, which can be measured by energy efficiency. To solve the formulated problem effectively, the original non-convex problem is first decomposed into two subproblems, i.e., beamforming optimization and phase shift optimization. Alternating optimization is proposed to solve these two subproblems iteratively. In particular, successive convex approximation (SCA) is utilized to convert the non-convex constraints to convex ones. The provided simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can achieve superior performance on energy efficiency compared to the random phase shifts and orthogonal multiple access (OMA) schemes.},

However, the increased number of users in mMIMO systems significantly affects performance of the existing approximate matrix inversion based and matrix inversion less iterative symbol detection techniques. Conventional detection algorithms cannot learn the inter-relations of input-output parameters based on available data without having specific mathematical models of communication scenarios. Moreover, existing deep learning (DL) based symbol detection models lack in-network compression, resulting in large training time and high computational load while expected to be deployed in a low latency communication system. In this article, a sparse refinement architecture is proposed for symbol detection in uplink mMIMO. The proposed DL architecture requires less trainable parameters as compared to a conventional fully connected detection network and refines the estimated symbol vector in each layer. Convergence of the proposed symbol detection technique is analytically justified. An expression for the approximate upper bound on the BER is derived which is supported by simulations.

In order to derive the closed-form expression of the probability distributions, tree-coding is used to encode each entry of the analog precoders and combiners with a binary number. Through iterations, optimal analog precoders and combiners will be obtained when its probabilities are sufficiently high.

  abstract     = {Machine learning has provided great potential in intelligent signal processing, e.g., channel estimation and signal detection. But still, it is difficult to deploy deep neural network (DNN) on low-cost and low-power edge devices, e.g., in both training and inference phases. For one thing, the training of massive network parameters incurs a huge computational complexity and rarely becomes feasible; and for another, even a trained DNN involves still high computations and demands considerable storage size. In this work, we present a tiny machine learning (Tiny-ML) approach for hardware-efficient channel estimation and signal detection. The key innovation of our Tiny-ML is that we replace each large dense layer of DNN with three small cascading sub-layers; and therefore, the computation/storage of a large matrix is replaced with that of small ones. To enable the lightweight training of our Tiny-ML, a novel rank-restricted back-propagation algorithm is further designed. Numerical simulations demonstrate the advantages of our new method. Without sacrificing the estimation and detection accuracy, our Tiny-ML attains an acceleration of &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\rm {\mathbf {2.5\sim\!3\times }}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; in model training and &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\rm {\mathbf {\sim\!4.5\times }}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; in model inference, as well as a substantial storage reduction of &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\rm {\mathbf {\sim\!4.5\times }}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; , when compared to classical fully-connected (FC) DNN.

We provide a new perspective on the problem and show that the processing time (delay) at the relay can be exploited to improve the system’s security. We show that the FD AF relay channel can be seen as an intersymbol-interference (ISI) channel, hence, the discrete-Fourier transform (DFT) can be used for data modulation and demodulation to convert the frequency-selective channel into flat-fading channel per sub-channel/sub-carrier. By exploiting the fact that the channel memory needs to be cleared by inserting the cyclic-prefix, Alice injects an artificial-noise (AN) signal that hurts the eavesdropping nodes only. The strength of this AN signal and its interference rank are controlled by the relay’s processing time.},

A preamble design technique for accurate timing estimation in cellular systems with high mobility, such as autonomous driving and unmanned aerial vehicles, is proposed herein. A generalized Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequence is defined and decomposed into multiple short subsequences to reduce the Doppler effect on the timing estimation. The performance loss caused by the short sequence length is compensated by combining the subsequences using the repetition property of the ZC sequence. The properties of autocorrelation and cross-correlation of the generalized ZC sequence that employs a receiver processing (RP) scheme (subsequence decomposition and combining) are analyzed in the presence of Doppler. Finally, the suitability of the proposed sequence with the RP scheme, for accurate timing estimation in multicell environments with a high Doppler, is demonstrated using simulation results.},

  abstract     = {From adapting to the propagation environment to reconstructing the propagation environment, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) changes the design paradigm of wireless communications. To reconstruct the propagation environment, joint beamforming of RIS and multi-input multi-output (MIMO) is crucial. Unfortunately, due to the coupling effect of the active beamforming of MIMO and passive beamforming of RIS, it is difficult to find the optimal solution to the joint beamforming problem, so a serious performance loss will be caused. In this paper, inspired by the end-to-end (E2E) learning of communication system, we propose the E2E learning based RIS-aided communication system to mitigate the performance loss via deep learning techniques. The key idea is to simultaneously optimize the signal processing functions at base station (BS), RIS, and user, including active beamforming for BS and user, passive beamforming for RIS. This way is able to avoid the performance loss caused by alternately optimizing each function of the RIS-aided system. Specifically, we firstly utilize a deep neural network (DNN) to realize the modulation and beamforming for BS and utilize another DNN to realize the demodulation and combining for user. Then, the RIS passive beamforming is also represented by trainable parameters, which could be simultaneously optimized with the DNNs at BS and user. Simulation results show that the proposed E2E learning based RIS-aided communication system could achieve the better bit error rate (BER) performance than traditional RIS-aided communication systems.},

In this paper, we propose a model-free method adopting the deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm (DDPG) with feedforward neural networks (NNs) to solve the downlink max-min power control problem in CF massive MIMO systems. Our result shows that compared with the conventional convex optimization algorithm, the proposed DDPG method can effectively strike a performance-complexity trade-off obtaining 1,000 times faster implementation speed and approximately the same achievable user rate as the optimal solution produced by conventional numerical convex optimization solvers, thereby offering effective power control implementations for large-scale systems. Finally, we extend the DDPG algorithm to both the max-sum and the max-product power control problems, while achieving better performance than that achieved by the conventional deep learning algorithm.},

In this sense, clustered federated learning is proposed to group user devices with similar preference and provide each cluster with a personalized model. This calls for innovative design in edge association that involves user clustering and also resource management optimization. We formulate an accuracy-cost trade-off optimization problem by jointly considering model accuracy, communication resource allocation and energy consumption. To comply with parameter encryption techniques in FL, we propose an iterative solution procedure which employs deep reinforcement learning based approach at cloud server for edge association. The reward function consists of minimized energy consumption at each base station and the averaged model accuracy of all users. Under our proposed solution, multiple edge base station are fully exploited to realize cost efficient personalized federated learning without any prior knowledge on model parameters.

At the receiver, the complex envelope samples of a burst signal acquired by multiple antennas are decomposed into in-phase and quadrature samples, which are then structured into a high-dimensional data array. To learn the modulation patterns from received signals, we develop a deep network, namely three-dimensional MIMO-OFDM convolutional neural network (MONet). With cuboidal convolution filters, the proposed MONet allows the network to capture underlying features as intra- and inter-antenna correlations at multi-scale signal representations. Relying on simulations, MONet achieves the classification accuracy of over 95% at 0 dB SNR under various channel impairments and shows the robustness with different MIMO antenna configurations.},

Determining the appropriate transmission rate to satisfy this ultra-reliability constraint requires deriving the statistics of the channel in the ultra-reliable region and then incorporating these statistics into the rate selection. In this paper, we propose a framework for determining the rate selection for ultra-reliable communications based on the extreme value theory (EVT). We first model the wireless channel at URLLC by estimating the parameters of the generalized Pareto distribution (GPD) best fitting to the tail distribution of the received powers, i.e., the power values below a certain threshold. Then, we determine the maximum transmission rate by incorporating the Pareto distribution into the rate selection function. Finally, we validate the selected rate by computing the resulting error probability. Based on the data collected within the engine compartment of Fiat Linea, we demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed methodology in determining the maximum transmission rate compared to the traditional extrapolation-based approaches.},

This correspondence studies the IRS-aided multiuser multi-input single-output (MISO) downlink multicast beamforming. Depart from the conventional (rank-one) beamforming, the Alamouti-aided rank-two beamforming is employed at the base station (BS), and a joint optimization of the rank-two beamforming and the IRS phase shift is formulated to minimize the transmit power with guaranteed signal-to-noise ratio at the users. This power minimization problem is nonconvex. To tackle it, we custom-derive a proximal distance algorithm (PDA) with generalized power method (GPM) to iteratively optimize the beamformer and the phase shift. Both PDA and GPM can be performed very efficiently than the semidefinite relaxation method. Simulation results demonstrate that the rank-two beamforming attains much lower porwer than the rank-one beamforming with reduced computation complexity.},

At the transmitter, we construct the chaotic phase vector with chaotic sequences having different initial values, which are then combined with the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) matrix and a conjugate phase matrix of an eigenvalue matrix to compose a precoder. After precoding, the user data are modulated by the chaotic circulant matrix and transmitted over multiple subcarriers. At the receiver, reverse operations are conducted. Subsequently, we derive the theoretical bit error rate (BER) over V2V channels, the spectrum efficiency and the computational complexity. Simulation results validate the theoretical analysis, and demonstrate that the OFDM-PC-CSK system outperforms the counterpart schemes with better reliability and security performances over V2V channels.},

Although the scheme offers low compression rates and lends itself to joint source-channel coding, it suffers from a large delay in the encoding phase. The delay is imposed by several tentative encoding-decoding procedures performed at the encoder to search for the minimum compression length. In this work, we apply machine learning to provide a highly accurate estimate of the proper compression length. The encoder starts its search from this estimated length, thus the delay of turbo source coding will decrease considerably. The preliminary results show a four-fold reduction in the encoding delay at the expense of a negligible increase in the compression rate.},

Moreover, to ensure fresh data collection while providing sustainable energy support to a large set of IoT devices, a required number of UAVs should be deployed to carry out these two tasks efficiently and promptly. Indeed, the data collection requires that UAVs first make Wireless Energy Transfer (WET) to supply IoT devices with the necessary energy in the downlink. Then, IoT devices perform Wireless Information Transmission (WIT) to UAVs in the uplink based on the harvested energy. However, it turns out that when the same UAV performs WIT and WET, its energy usage and the data collection time are severely penalized. Worse yet, it is difficult to efficiently coordinate between UAVs to improve the performance in terms of WET and WIT. This work proposes to divide UAVs into two teams to behave as data collectors and energy transmitters, respectively. A Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) method, called TEAM, is leveraged to jointly optimize both teams’ trajectories, minimize the expected Age of Information (AoI), maximize the throughput of IoT devices, minimize the energy utilization of UAVs, and enhance the energy transfer. Simulation results depict that TEAM can effectively synchronize UAV teams and adapt their trajectories while serving a large-scale dynamic IoT environment.},

  abstract     = {Automotive radar is a critical feature in advanced driver-assistance systems. It is important in enhancing vehicle safety by detecting the presence of other vehicles in the vicinity. The performance of radar detection is, however, affected by the interference from radars of other vehicles as well as the variation in the target radar cross-section (RCS) due to varying physical features of the target vehicle. Considering such interference and random RCS, this work provides a fine-grained performance analysis of radar detection. Specifically, using stochastic geometry, we calculate the meta distribution of the signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio that permits the reliability analysis of radar detection at individual vehicles. We also evaluate the delay aspect of radar detection, namely, the mean local delay which is the average number of transmission attempts needed until the first successful target detection. For a given target distance, we obtain the optimal transmit probability that maximizes the density of successful detection while keeping the mean local delay below a threshold. We also provide several system design insights in terms of the fraction of reliable radar links, transmission delay, the density of vehicles, and congestion control. Finally, leveraging the derived framework, we present an online algorithm to select the transmit probability in a distributed manner, particularly when system parameters such as vehicular density and interferer locations are unknown to individual vehicles. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed online framework for selecting the optimal transmit probability within a deadline of 0.1 ms, which is critical for sustaining automotive safety applications and services.},

To encourage the content caching of D2D users, a blockchain incentive scheme is proposed; the game theory is introduced to optimize the benefits for both the edge computing server (ECS) and D2D users in the blockchain network. In Stackelberg game, D2D users act as followers. After the successful implementation of the cache strategy, D2D users are rewarded by the system, which is a new block mining process. In this process, the required computing power is provided by the ECS. Therefore, D2D cache users need to pay the cost to purchase computing power from the ECS. As the game leader, the ECS prices the computing resources, and D2D users adjust their caching strategies based on the price. In this paper, we propose four algorithms based on different pricing methods and different cache reward methods. Simulations are performed to compare the cache quality and cache content dispersion of the four algorithms. The results show that the uniform pricing scheme with a linear reward relationship is more suitable for the scenarios that require higher cache quality, and the discriminatory pricing scheme with a nonlinear reward relationship is more suitable for the scenarios that require more evenly cache content distribution.},

Furthermore, we investigate the max-min computation efficiency problem under the secure computation rate requirements, by jointly optimizing the local computing frequencies and transmission power of IoT devices, time-slot assignment, and phase beamforming of the RIS. To solve the formulated non-convex problem, we further develop an iterative algorithm, in which the Dinkelbach-type method and block coordinate descent (BCD) technique are utilized to tackle the fractional objective function and coupled optimization variables, respectively. In particular, the successive convex approximation (SCA) and penalty function-based methods are exploited to solve the transmit power control and reflecting beamforming optimization subproblems, respectively, and the closed-form expression for local computing frequencies optimization subproblem is derived. Numerical results quantify the performance gain achieved by the proposed RIS-assisted secure MEC networks, when compared to existing benchmark methods.},

In this respect, a critical network parameter, Clear Channel Assessment (CCA) threshold, plays a vital role as it dictates whether a node is allowed to transmit after sensing the channel. In this paper, we propose to use Deep Q-network (DQN) under two learning patterns to select the CCA threshold of devices. We further consider Transmit Power Control (TPC) in conjunction with CCA threshold selection to improve the capacity of a WiFi network. The simulation results show that our approach is capable of selecting the optimal CCA threshold for each device.

Caching, however, imposes a new networking user Key Performance Index (KPI), which is the probability of user satisfaction. In other words, how likely is it that the user will obtain the necessary information from the network? Such probability depends on the type of transmission, (i.e., half duplex or full duplex) and on many elements related to the caching system, including the way the information is cached or the popularity of the cached information. The analysis of those elements produces different modes of operation. To evaluate the new KPI, the probabilities of each mode of operation must be extracted from the transmission and caching conditions. This paper presents a thorough analysis of those probabilities, including the relevance of the relationship between caching policies, content popularity and transmission types. Such relationships allow the smooth evaluation of user satisfaction under different conditions.},

In this paper, we propose an air-and-ground cooperative wireless sensor network (AGWSN), wherein several UAVs are deployed as aerial access points (AAPs) to assist the terrestrial access point (TAP) for data collecting. The positions of the AAPs can be modified to approach the cell-edge SDs, therefore reducing the energy of the SDs expended in uploading data. To fully exploit the potential of the AGWSN, we formulate a joint AAP position optimization, channel allocation, and power control problem to minimize the total power consumption of all SDs subject to their decoding threshold. To solve the formulated problem, we first analyze the optimal user pairing rule in each cell and based on the rule propose a maximum-weighted-independent-set inspired algorithm for the AAP position optimization. Then, we remodel the channel allocation problem as an interference minimization problem and devise a K-CUT based algorithm to solve it. We further propose a low-complex iterative algorithm to obtain the optimal transmission power for each SD. The performance of the proposed algorithms is evaluated via theoretical analysis and numerical simulation. Simulation results indicate that if the intracell and intercell interference are not well coordinated, the superiorities of the AGWSN cannot be developed, and its performance is even worse than the traditional terrestrial network (TTN). Cooperated with our algorithms, the AGWSN significantly outperforms the TTN in terms of total power consumption and probability of successful decoding.},

  abstract     = {Offloading tasks to the mobile ad hoc cloud (MAHC) can improve the utility of mobile devices in scenarios without infrastructure. However, when multiple resource demanders (RDs) offload tasks to multiple resource providers (RPs) in the MAHC with task random generation, how to optimize the utility of RDs and the service quality of the MAHC is an issue worth researching. To this end, we investigate this issue from the stochastic game perspective. Firstly, we combine the obtained time, energy, and monetary revenue as the utility of each RD and construct the utility improvement of each RD as a static non-cooperative game. Secondly, according to the randomness of RD’s task generation, we transform the single-shot non-cooperative game into a stochastic game in an infinite time horizon to obtain the long-term utility. Thirdly, to reduce the computational complexity for achieving Nash equilibrium, we propose an action reduction alternate backward iteration algorithm according to the games characteristics and prove its convergence. Finally, we compare the utility obtained from the static game with the stochastic game, the numerical results indicating that the utility of each RD can be effectively improved by utilizing the stochastic game.},

However, existing solutions cannot satisfy the requirements of high throughput and low delay in high-density environments. In this article, we propose a timeslot-reserved MAC protocol to meet such demands for VANETs. This protocol provides distributed resource allocation and has two striking features: the high efficiency of handshake negotiation and the different solutions to disparate delay requirements of packets. In this protocol, a novel neighbor information table adds a new field of the needed number of frames in the future multiple frames. This reflects the reservation idea and reduces the number of negotiations between neighbor vehicles. The service applicant without enough timeslot resources is excluded from resource allocation negotiation, to decrease the invalid resource allocation. The resource-insufficient service channel and the resource-insufficient timeslot segments are also excluded from packet transmission, to further reduce the invalid resource allocation. Delay-sensitive packets and delay-tolerant packets select different kinds of timeslot segments, to satisfy different delay demands of different packets. Simulation results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed protocol in terms of throughput, delay, and packet loss rate.},

  abstract     = {Efficient connectivity in cellular-connected unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)s is limited by scarcity of the radio spectrum and strong inter-cell interference (ICI). To address these issues, we propose an aerial-terrestrial network non-orthogonal multiple access (ATN-NOMA) scheme. In this proposed scheme, we pair the aerial user (AU) and terrestrial user (TU) in a NOMA setting to leverage their asymmetric channel gains and rate demands in downlink communications. In ATN-NOMA, the strong ICI issue at the AU receiver is further managed by an elevation-angle based user association, equipping the AU with an adjustable beamwidth directional antenna, and forming a beamforming among the coordinated terrestrial base stations (BS)s. We then obtain the optimal beamwidth and suboptimal power allocation so that the TUs’ sum-rate is maximized subject to the AU’s Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirement. The corresponding optimization problem is non-convex in which we exploit the structure of the problem and apply successive convex approximation (SCA) to obtain a suboptimal solution. We then derive the statistical properties, which consequently enable us to estimate the aggregated ICI. In cases where no interfering BSs have the same elevation angle as the coordinated BSs, we further approximate the AU’s outage probability. We then compare the TUs’ sum-rate and the outage probability of the ATN-NOMA with multiple existing schemes. Extensive simulation results show that our proposed ATN-NOMA scheme outperforms existing schemes by 52-91% in terms of the sum-rate, and its analytical outage probability can be as low as the order of &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$10^{-17}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; .

The wireless channel is characterized by Nakagami- m fading under an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), while the PLC channels are characterized by Log-normal distribution with Bernoulli Gaussian noise including both background and impulsive noise components. New closed-form expressions for the outage probability, the asymptotic outage probability and ergodic capacity are derived and verified via extensive representative simulations. For more insights on the outage performance, we analyze the diversity order. Additionally, we proposed a power allocation optimization technique to achieve an outage-optimal performance. The results show that the system outage probability improves as the impulsive noise index and the arrival probability of the impulsive component of the PLC additive noise decrease, while their effect is negligible on the ergodic capacity. Finally, the performance of the proposed system is compared against a benchmark OMA-based system.},

Following the success in advancing many disciplines, deep learning (DL) brings revolutionary changes to WIR. However, most conventional DL-based methods only use single domain information of interference signals, such as time domain or frequency domain, resulting in low recognition performance under low interference-to-noise ratio (INR). To this end, we propose to exploit multi-domain information of interference signals to take full advantage of the complementarity between domains for WIR. We propose multi-domain networks (MDN) that consist of convolutional layers and transformers to simultaneously strengthen locality and establish long-range dependencies for extracting the features of each domain information. Additionally, to fuse the extracted features from multiple transformation domains together, we propose novel fusion mechanisms, which can be seamlessly incorporated into the MDN. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods notably boost recognition performance as compared to conventional methods for WIR.},

  abstract     = {The joint transmission scheme of polar codes and sparse code multiple access (SCMA) has been regarded as a promising technology for future wireless communication systems. However, most of the existing polar-coded SCMA (PC-SCMA) systems suffer from high latency caused by the feedback iteration and list decoding. In addition, the error performance of PC-SCMA systems is unsatisfactory for ultra-reliable transmission. Inspired by the compelling benefits of non-binary polar codes, in this paper, we design a non-binary polar-coded SCMA (NB-PC-SCMA) system with a free order matching strategy to address the issues of delay and reliability. Specifically, we first formulate a joint factor graph for NB-PC-SCMA and propose a non-binary successive cancellation list (NB-SCL) and damping based joint iterative detection and decoding (NSD-JIDD) multiuser receiver to improve the BER and latency performance. Then, a lazy-search based NB-SCL (L-NB-SCL) decoding is proposed to reduce the computational complexity by simplifying the path search pattern of the list decoder. After that, we modify the update of user nodes for SCMA detection to improve the convergence error and finally propose the improved NSD-JIDD (ISD-JIDD) algorithm, which can avoid redundant operations by exploiting L-NB-SCL decoding. Simulation results show that the proposed NB-PC-SCMA system achieves better bit error rate (BER) performance and considerable latency gain when compared to its counterparts. In particular, the proposed ISD-JIDD can achieve similar BER performance of NSD-JIDD with less complexity.},

In this paper, we propose resource allocation algorithms to increase the backhaul capacity of IAB network and evaluate the performance of IAB network through geometric analysis. First, we propose a centralized resource allocation (CRA) algorithm for the case that IAB donor is available to acquire entire channel state information (CSI) and traffic load information of each IAB node. However, in order to overcome the high propagation loss of mmWave band, a densification of IAB node is necessary, which may induce the high computational complexity and require tremendous amount of CSI feedback load for the CRA scheme. To address this challenge, we discuss the distributed resource allocation (DRA) framework which can be individually operated at the each IAB nodes. On the other hand, we investigate the IAB network to get the insights for the system design by applying geometric analysis. Taking the property of stochastic geometry and hybrid beamforming at mmWave band into account, we derive the tractable approximation of co-channel interference (CCI). This expression allows us to obtain the insights to avoid the effect of CCI. Finally, numerical results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm can improve the performance for IAB network and our geometric analysis is valid.},

  abstract     = {Mobile edge computing (MEC) which enables communication, computation and storage capabilities at the network edge, is an emerging paradigm for 5G and beyond 5G networks. Resource-limited mobile devices can offload their tasks to the MEC server to reduce computation latency and save energy consumption. However, limited wireless spectrum resources make it hard for MEC to guarantee low latency when a large number of users offload the computation tasks or download the computed results. Full-duplex (FD) communication that allows simultaneous transmission and reception of signals over the same frequency band is a promising solution to the shortage of spectrum resources. In this paper, we study a multi-user FD-MEC system involving all the phases of uploading, computing, and downloading. With the help of an FD-capable base station (BS), two half-duplex (HD) users can form an FD pair and share the same time-frequency resource for task uploading and result downloading. We formulate a latency minimization problem considering power control, time scheduling, offloading decision, and user pairing strategy, which is a mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem. The problem can be decomposed into two subproblems. The first subproblem is delay minimization for each possible FD pair, and the second one is to decide the offloading and user pairing strategy, and the user scheduling order. We analyze the problem in two cases: (1) the computing delay at the edge server is negligible and (2) the computing delay at the edge server is non-negligible. For both cases, the first subproblem is solved using a bisection algorithm. Then, we solve the second subproblem in the two cases by a relaxing-based algorithm and a concave-convex procedure (CCCP)-based algorithm, respectively. Finally, numerical results demonstrate that with our proposed strategies, the overall latency can be significantly reduced by integrating FD communication with the MEC system.},

Furthermore, we have carried out its Extrinsic Information Transfer (EXIT) chart analysis, and characterized the performance vs. the complexity of the proposed G-SCAN algorithm, and compared it to various soft- and hard-decision output benchmarks for a wide variety of different rate-matching modes and block lengths. Furthermore, in order to reduce the complexity of the proposed algorithm, a novel Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)-aided G-SCAN algorithm is also proposed, which facilitates early termination and improves the BLER performance.},

  abstract     = {In time-varying fading channels, channel coefficients are estimated using pilot symbols that are transmitted every coherence interval. For channels with high Doppler spread, the rapid channel variations over time will require considerable bandwidth for pilot transmission, leading to poor throughput. In this paper, we propose a novel receiver architecture using deep recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that learns the channel variations and thereby reduces the number of pilot symbols required for channel estimation. Specifically, we design and train an RNN to learn the correlation in the time-varying channel and predict the channel coefficients into the future with good accuracy over a wide range of Dopplers and signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). The proposed training methodology enables accurate channel prediction through the use of techniques such as teacher-force training, early-stop, and reduction of learning rate on plateau. Also, the robustness of prediction for different Dopplers and SNRs is achieved by adapting the number of predictions into the future based on the Doppler and SNR. Numerical results show that good bit error performance is achieved by the proposed receiver in time-varying fading channels. We also propose a data decision driven receiver architecture using RNNs that further reduces the pilot overhead while maintaining good bit error performance.},

  abstract     = {Hybrid multiple access schemes are considered potential technologies towards achieving optimal spectrum sharing for future heterogeneous networks. Multiple users are multiplexed on a single resource unit in the code domain for sparse code multiple access (SCMA) or power domain for power domain non-orthogonal multiple access (PD-NOMA) and in both domains for the hybrid power domain sparse code non-orthogonal multiple access (PD-SCMA). This allows for effective spectrum usage but comes at a cost of increased detection complexity resulting in loss of performance in terms of outages. It is therefore imperative to determine the user multiplexing capacity for effective performance. This work investigates codebook capacity bounds in small cells, pairing and power capacity bounds for the number of small cell user equipment’s (SUEs) and macro cell user equipment’s (MUEs) that can be multiplexed on a codebook for the developed PD-SCMA technology. Closed-form solutions for codebook, pairing and power multiplexing capacity bounds are derived. The performance of the system results into low outage when the system’s point of operation is within the multiplexing bounds. To alleviate the resource allocation (RA) challenges of such a system at the transmitter, dual parameter ranking (DPR) and alternate search method (ASM) based RA schemes are proposed. The results show significant capacity gain with DPR-RA in comparison with conventional schemes.},

  abstract     = {In cellular communication systems, it is conventional to assume the absence of a line of sight (LoS) path between the users and theirassociated access points (APs). This assumption however becomes questionable in the context of recent developments in the direction of cell-free (CF) massive MIMO systems. In the CF massive MIMO, the AP density is assumed to be comparable with the user density, which increases probability of existence of an LoS path between the users and their associated APs. In this paper, we analyze the performance of an uplink CF massive MIMO system, with a probabilistic LoS channel model. Here, we first derive the effective statistics of this channel model, and argue that their behaviour is fundamentally different from that of the conventional rich scattering channels. Utilizing these statistics, we next compare the rates achievable by CF massive MIMO systems, under both stream-wise and joint decoding at the central processing unit. Following this, we also discuss the centralized MMSE based data detection to obtain a complexity/ performance trade-off. Finally, using detailed Monte-Carlo simulations, we validate our analytical results, and evaluate the performance of the three data detection schemes.},

  abstract     = {Vehicle-to-everything communication (V2X) and mobile edge computing (MEC) have introduced significant technological innovations for autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs), enabling most driving task computations to be performed with edge servers with higher quality and effectively reducing computational power consumption for AGVs. For reducing more computational power consumption which can reach hundreds of watts, sending more offloading tasks to edge servers can result in high latency and congestion when the network resources are finite and even cause serious traffic accidents. Besides, in V2X network, multiple transmission paths, including vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) links and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) links, can provide more valuable resources for sending offloading tasks, but they increase the complexity of resource management. To improve the utilization efficiency of network resources and ensure low power consumption for AGVs, first, this paper analyzes mathematical models of bandwidth, delay and power consumption based on different computing modes and transmission paths. Second, we propose an allocation algorithm for network resource allocation, transmission paths and computing modes to minimize power consumption according to the states of the V2X-MEC network measured and predicted by the navigation and positioning system. Third, a traversal approach simplified by a road segmentation method is adopted to solve for the optimal parameters. Through simulations, we compare our solution against an allocation approach based on the shortest path method, minimum average delay method and game theory method to illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in reducing the power consumption and transmission delay of uplinks.},

  abstract     = {As the number of antennas increases, the massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system can precisely point to user equipments (UEs) with narrow beams. Accurate and timely channel state information (CSI) feedback is crucial to keep UEs in service. Mobile UEs, however, may suffer from the narrow beam nature of the massive MIMO system since UEs can move out of the beam coverage. When intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is applied to the massive MIMO system, the adjustment of the IRS cannot be frequent as the IRS is controlled remotely by the base station (BS). Limiting the number of CSI feedback and the number of both BS and IRS adjustments significantly reduces the overhead of transmission and computation to the system. In this paper, we consider the UEs’ mobility adaptation problem in an IRS assisted multiuser massive MIMO downlink system with infrequent CSI feedback. We propose a beam control method that adapts to UEs’ mobility. The problem is constructed as a sum rate problem where both the BS and IRS are taken into account to jointly optimize the beamforming matrices. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm can converge quickly and provide satisfactory performance for mobile UEs. At the same time, our proposed algorithm reduces the frequency of updating the beamforming matrices effectively both at the BS and at the IRS.},

  abstract     = {Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) have been actively researched as a potential technique for future wireless communications, which intelligently ameliorate the signal propagation environment. In the conventional design, each RIS element configures and reflects its received signal independently of all other RIS elements, which results in a diagonal phase shift matrix. By contrast, we propose a novel RIS architecture, where the incident signal impinging on one element can be reflected from another element after an appropriate phase shift adjustment, which increases the flexibility in the design of RIS phase shifts, hence, potentially improving the system performance. The resultant RIS phase shift matrix also has off-diagonal elements, as opposed to the pure diagonal structure of the conventional design. Compared to the state-of-art fully-connected/group-connected RIS structures, our proposed RIS architecture has lower complexity, while attaining a higher channel gain than the group-connected RIS structure, and approaching that of the fully-connected RIS structure. We formulate and solve the problem of maximizing the achievable rate of our proposed RIS architecture by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming and the non-diagonal phase shift matrix based on alternating optimization and semi-define relaxation (SDR) methods. Moreover, the closed-form expressions of the channel gain, the outage probability and bit error ratio (BER) are derived. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed RIS architecture results in an improved performance in terms of the achievable rate compared to the conventional architecture, both in single-user as well as in multi-user scenarios.},

We formulate minimization problems with the Sum-Mean-Square-Error (SMSE) at legitimate users as an objective function, and a lower bound for the MSE at eavesdroppers as a constraint. Security is achieved thanks to physical layer security mechanisms, namely MIMO beamforming and Artificial Noise (AN). Reliability is achieved by designing a system which is robust to two types of channel state information errors: stochastic and norm-bounded. We propose a coordinate descent-based algorithm and a worst-case iterative algorithm to solve these problems. Numerical results at physical layer and system level reveal the crucial role of robust designs for reliable MCC. We show the interest of both robust design and AN to improve the security gap. We also show that full BS cooperation in preferred for highly secured and reliable MCC but dynamic clustering allows to trade-off security and reliability against capacity.},

Physical-layer Security (PLS) mechanisms take advantage of unique features of the transmission media or of the user equipment to introduce an additional level of data protection. The physical-layer security (PLS) can be seen as the first level of defense. The noise-loop (NL) modulation is a PLS technique that intrinsically provides confidentiality. In this paper, we first provide the theoretical analysis to evaluate the reliability and security in multipath fading channels, and then the theoretical results are evaluated by experimentation. A Software Defined Radio (SDR) testbed that exploits the NL secure modulation was implemented and a measurement campaign has been carried out in an indoor environment, with passive and active malicious nodes. An evaluation of the complexity of the proposed system is also reported, showing that the NL has low hardware resource occupancy and low computational cost.

The larger number of packed antennas and the highly directional property of mmWave communications enable directional beamforming to achieve spatial diversity. Toward this end, we consider two different hybrid precoding schemes which are based on orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP). Users are assigned into different clusters and the base station (BS) transmits superposed signals that share the same precoding vector. Moreover, both fixed number of users per cluster and dynamic number of users per cluster are investigated. We aim to jointly optimize the user clustering, service scheduling, and power allocation strategy, in maximizing the proportional fairness (PF) among the users and exploring the multiuser diversity and multiplexing gain. Since the formulated joint user clustering, scheduling and power allocation problem is a mixed integer non-convex optimization problem, we propose a two-fold methodology. First, we apply a hybrid precoding and user clustering scheme, where the hybrid precoder is constructed by singular vector division (SVD) or minimum mean square error (MMSE). Then, with the obtained result, we approximate the proportional fairness power allocation problem by a sequence of Geometric Programming (GP) problems which are solved iteratively. The proposed scheme strikes a balance between the spectral efficiency and service fairness. Results show that the proposed MISO-NOMA scheme which is based on MMSE hybrid precoder and the proposed user scheduling and power allocation strategy under proportional fairness metric can outperform various conventional MISO schemes. Furthermore, our proposed dynamic number of users per cluster scheme outperforms the fixed scheme and can be considered as an upper bound in several aspects, including spectral efficiency and fairness.},

  abstract     = {Full-duplex (FD) systems have been introduced to provide high data rates for beyond fifth-generation wireless networks through simultaneous transmission of information over the same frequency resources. However, the operation of FD systems is practically limited by self-interference (SI), and efficient SI cancelers are sought to make the FD systems realizable. Typically, polynomial-based cancelers are employed to mitigate the SI; nevertheless, they suffer from high complexity. This article proposes two novel hybrid-layers neural network (NN) architectures to cancel the SI with low complexity. The first architecture is referred to as hybrid-convolutional recurrent NN (HCRNN), whereas the second is termed as hybrid-convolutional recurrent dense NN (HCRDNN).In the HCRNN, a convolutional layer is employed to extract the input data features using a reduced network scale. Moreover, a recurrent layer is then applied to assist in learning the temporal behavior of the input signal from the localized feature map of the convolutional layer. In the HCRDNN, an additional dense layer is exploited to add another degree of freedom for adapting the NN settings in order to achieve the best compromise between the cancellation performance and computational complexity. The complexity analysis of the proposed NN architectures is provided, and the optimum settings for their training are selected. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed HCRNN and HCRDNN-based cancelers attain the same cancellation of the polynomial and the state-of-the-art NN-based cancelers with an astounding computational complexity reduction. Furthermore, the proposed cancelers show high design flexibility for hardware implementation, depending on the system demands.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study the joint resource scheduling problem for multiplexing two distinct 5 G services: enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) and ultra-reliable low latency communications (URLLC). While eMBB services require high data rates, URLLC services lay more emphasis on extremely low latency and high reliability. To satisfy these heterogeneous requirements for eMBB and URLLC coexistence, we propose a risk-resistant scheme for resource allocation to both eMBB and URLLC traffic that aims to maximize the eMBB data rate, while considering the URLLC delay threshold violation to maintain URLLC delay requirements. Based on the M/G/1 queueing model, the URLLC packet latency target is realized by minimizing the average packet delay in violation cases, where “violation” is judged by introducing the “conditional value at risk (CVaR)” as a risk metric (i.e., “risk” here is defined as URLLC delay threshold violation). To solve the formulated problem, we transform it into two convex optimization problems to obtain a near-optimal resource allocation solution. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme improves the fairness among the eMBB users and eMBB throughput by &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$30\%\sim 34\%$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; compared to existing works, while satisfying the stringent URLLC delay requirements.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose an energy-efficient velocity control algorithm for a large number of UAVs based on mean field games. In particular, we first formulate the velocity control problem for a large number of UAVs as a differential game, where we jointly consider the energy consumption, channel capacity, and obstacle avoidance in the cost function. Meanwhile, the state dynamics are used to describe the motion of UAVs under the influence of the wind. Then we derive the corresponding mean field game for a large number of UAVs and solve it with the G-prox primal dual hybrid gradient (PDHG) method using its underlying variational primal dual structure. Scalability analysis shows that the computational complexity of the proposed method is unrelated to the number of UAVs. Based on the PDHG method, we conduct a comprehensive experiment where we analytically show the fast convergence of our energy-efficient velocity control algorithm by the convergence of the residual errors of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation and the Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equation. The experiment also shows that a large number of UAVs can avoid obstacles and provide communication services for the search and rescue team while minimizing their energy consumption.},

  abstract     = {Wireless underwater acoustic (UWA) networks serve several civilian and military applications. The multiple reflections and dispersion, along with the long propagation delay limit the sum rate of UWA networks. Earlier works discussed adding full-duplex (FD), relay assistance, and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) to enhance the system sum rate. Another challenge in UWA networks is the power limitation of devices. Hence, power optimization is crucial to maximize the energy efficiency. Furthermore, securing the UWA network against eavesdropping is essential to guarantee the confidentiality of communication. This work optimizes the power to maximize the secrecy sum rate (SSR) of a FD relay-assisted NOMA (FD-R-NOMA) underwater acoustic network subjected to an eavesdropper (Eve) attack. The network is studied in two states: when the network has or not the channel information (CI) of the threat. FD-R-NOMA UWA network shows to be more resilient to eavesdropping with higher secrecy energy efficiency when compared to the conventional half-duplex orthogonal multiple access network. Also, the results reveal that knowing the CI of the Eve improves the SSR of the network. Besides, the results show the effect of factors like the location of Eve, interference cancellation efficiency, noise in the environment, and sensor distributions in the system.},

On the other hand, deep learning has shown great potential in revolutionizing communications systems. In this work, we investigate the use of deep learning in communications systems subject to interference from radar systems. Specifically, we consider a single-carrier communications system. Linear frequency-modulated (LFM) and frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) are considered for radar. Several important system parameters, including the level of noise and interference, the radar interference coverage, the symbol duration, feature extraction methods and the number of hidden layers are investigated for the performance of the detector. Fully connected deep neural network (FCDNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) detectors are implemented, where principle component analysis (PCA) is applied to preprocess the observed signals for the FCDNN detector. Numerical results show that the learning-based detector achieves comparable performance in the radar-communication system to the traditional detector but without interference cancellation. Preprocessing the received signals with PCA can improve the performance of FCDNN when interference is strong. Also, LSTM shows more robust performance than FCDNN when the channel has time-related distortion.},

However, recent studies show that a very large surface is required for a RIS-assisted communications system; otherwise, they may be outperformed by the conventional relay. Furthermore, the performance gain of a RIS can be considerably degraded by hardware impairments such as limited-resolution phase shifters. To overcome those challenges, we propose a hybrid relay-reflecting intelligent surface (HR-RIS) architecture, in which a single or few elements serve as active relays, while the remaining only reflect the incident signals. We propose two HR-RIS architectures, namely, the fixed and dynamic HR-RIS. The joint transmit beamforming at the base station and hybrid relay-reflecting at the HR-RIS are designed based on alternating optimization and successive convex approximation methods.

Turbulence, scattering, and absorption phenomena generally can severely affect the performance of UWOC systems. The relaying methods have been shown as a promising technique to alleviate turbulence-induced and short-range fading. In this paper, under varying channel conditions, we present a unified framework to analyze the performance of multi-hop UWOC systems with both amplify-and-forward and decode-and-forward relaying techniques. In particular, for the end-to-end signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), we use the univariate and bivariate Fox-H functions to derive both the probability density function (PDF) and cumulative distribution function (CDF). Furthermore, for the performance of systems under both types of relaying techniques, we derive tight mathematical expressions for the outage probability and bit error probability. Besides, to highlight and provide some prominent engineering insights into the diversity order, an asymptotic analysis for the outage likelihood and average bit error rate (BER) is given. Consequently, results from Monte-Carlo simulations are used to verify the correctness of our derived mathematical expression.},

  abstract     = {In-band full duplex communication requires precise self-interference cancellation (SIC) to successfully decode the received desired signal. The existing neural network (NN) based SIC scheme uses offline trained NN to estimate the non-linear component of received self-interference (SI) over a static SI channel without additional NN training. For the time-varying SI channel, the NN-aided SIC method needs to retrain the NN during in-band full duplex communication to adapt time-varying channels. However, NN training is not fast enough to be done during full duplex communication. Thus, the SIC performance degrades. In this paper, we propose a digital SIC scheme using channel robust NN which takes estimates of linear SI channel coefficients as an input. It was found that the NN could learn the static part of the non-linear behavior of the SI channel well. Our solution can adapt the time-varying SI channel with only the channel coefficient estimation of linear components and a pre-trained NN. The proposed scheme can successfully reduce the SI to the noise floor for both time-invariant and time-varying SI channels.},

Since the deployment of 5G in many countries (i.e., 3.3–3.6 GHz), FSS is not the exclusive system in the C-Band anymore. In order to minimize the detrimental interference for the FSS to allowable levels, regional exclusion zones of maximum radiated power in 5G base stations (BS) are proposed and evaluated. In this paper, a measurement campaign has been carried out, and an analysis of the interference has been studied. A filtering model, namely Filter to Remove Broadband Interference 5G (FIREBRING), is proposed and analyzed concerning the carrier-to-noise ratio (C/N). Moreover, this paper focuses on the evaluation of the 5G interference into the FSS. The proposed solution deployed an Low-Noise Block (LNB) with a band frequency of 3.7 to 4.2 GHz to test the satellite down-conversion signal at the receiver. The paper offered a complete analysis of the 5G signal, taking into account the implications of out-of-band emissions, potentially LNB saturation into FSS receiver, and the repercussions of the deployment of the 5G BS active antenna systems. With the LNB and down-converter in place, it can be found that the signal interference between 1.450 GHz and 1.550 GHz, is nearly 18 dB.},

  abstract     = {Full-duplex communication offers enhanced spectral efficiency for relay deployment, but suffers from the inherent self-interference from the strong transmit signal coupling to the sensitive receive chain. In this article, we propose a self-energy recycling (S-ER) protocol for full-duplex multi-relay networks, in which the energy from self-interference is harvested back at the relay for future use. Furthermore, two amplify-and-forward (AF) relay selection algorithms, namely, partial relay selection (PRS) and full relay selection (FRS) are introduced to enhance the reliability of the proposed systems. For PRS, the best relay is selected based on just the knowledge of the channels from the source to all relays, while in FRS, the best relay is selected based on the end-to-end signal-to-noise ratio, which requires knowledge of all source-relay and relay-destination links. We provide a thorough analysis on the outage performance and the spectrum efficiency of the proposed algorithms in both cases: all channel gains are independently but non-identically distributed (i.n.d.) (case 1) or independently, identically distributed (i.i.d.) (case 2) Rayleigh random variables. It is shown that SER and FRS can significantly enhance the performance of FD networks and avoid the outage floor when the number of relays increases, while the outage probability (OP) in PRS case reaches an outage floor. In addition, the end-to-end signal-to-noise ratio in both cases can be minimized if an optimal power-splitting factor is selected. All analytical results are verified by Monte Carlo simulation.},

In this paper, we present and evaluate a novel data-driven solution, to reduce inter-frequency handover failures (HOFs), hereafter referred to as TORIS (Transmit Power Tuning-based Handover Success Rate Improvement Scheme). TORIS is designed by developing and integrating two sub-solutions. First sub-solution consists of an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based model to predict inter-frequency HOFs. In this model, we achieve higher than the state-of-the-art accuracy by leveraging two approaches. First, we devise a novel feature set by exploiting domain knowledge gathered from extensive drive test data analysis. Second, we exploit an extensive set of data augmentation techniques to address the class imbalance in training the HOF prediction model. The data augmentation techniques include Chow-Liu Bayesian Network and Generative Adversarial Network further improved by focusing the sampling only on the borderline. We also compare the performance of state-of-the-art AI models for predicting HOFs with and without augmented data. Results show that AdaBoost yields best performance for predicting HOFs. The second sub-solution is a heuristic scheme to tune the transmit (Tx) power of serving and target cells. Unlike the state-of-the-art approaches for HOF reduction that tune cell individual offset, TORIS targets the main cause of HOFs i.e., poor signal quality and propagation condition, by proactively varying the Tx power of the cells whenever a HOF is anticipated. Results show that TORIS outperforms the state-of-the-art HOF reduction solution and yields 40%-75% reduction in HOFs.},

  abstract     = {Most of beamforming methods rely on the proper estimation of the steering vectors of the incoming signals in order to calculate appropriate array feeding weights. However, this estimation is often performed on a theoretical basis, since most methods assume that the array elements radiate like isotropic sources and consider only the phase differences between them due to their different spatial positions. This is a rough estimation as it ignores both the non-isotropic radiation pattern of the array elements and the mutual coupling between them. To overcome these limitations, we use a different approach for the construction of steering vectors based on the embedded patterns of the array elements, extracted through full-wave analysis. This approach is used in this paper to modify two well-known beamforming methods, namely the null steering beamforming and the minimum variance distortionless response method. Both modified methods are applied to a realistic model of a microstrip planar antenna array, and thus, both the azimuth and polar angles of the main lobe and nulls directions are controlled (beamforming in 3D space). Extensive statistical analyses are performed by implementing several scenarios of escalating difficulty, in order to examine the performance and temporal response of the modified beamforming methods in comparison to the respective conventional methods and also in comparison to beamforming methods based on evolutionary techniques.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a model predictive current control (MPCC) method based on current augmenter prediction model (CAPM) appropriate for interior permanent magnet synchronous motor (IPMSM) under high-speed condition. The accuracy of CAPM is improved by considering rotor movement during one control period especially under high-speed condition. Meanwhile, the use of the permanent magnetic flux linkage is eliminated. In order to further improve the robustness of the MPCC method, an adaptive observer based on CAPM is designed to estimate the model error. The proposed adaptive observer also eliminates the use of the permanent magnetic flux linkage, so the whole implementation process of the MPCC method with adaptive observer is independent of the permanent magnetic flux linkage. Moreover, since the adaptive observer with fixed adaptive integral gain cannot achieve satisfactory performance under different operating conditions of the motor, this paper designs a calculation method for the variable adaptive integral gains by considering the current estimation error, the amplitude of current and the angular velocity of the IPMSM. Finally, the proposed method is validated by means of the experimental results on a 20-kW test platform.},

  abstract     = {Longitudinal velocity, lateral velocity, and front wheel steering angle are crucial states for vehicle active safety features. However, direct measurement of these variables requires expensive measurement instruments and can be easily affected by vehicle nonlinear dynamics, outliers and noise pollution. Moreover, unknown inputs bring great challenges to their accurate estimation. Therefore, this paper develops a novel robust unscented M-estimation-based filter (RUMF) for vehicle state estimation with unknown driver steering torque. The nonlinear system model is constructed based on the vehicle dynamics model. Unscented transformation (UT) and statistical linearization are implemented to transform the nonlinear process and measurement function into a linear-like regression form with data redundancy to achieve outlier suppression. Then, an M-estimation-based iterated algorithm is designed to address process uncertainty and innovation and observation outliers for robust vehicle state estimation. The iteratively reweighted least-squares (IRLS) method based on the M-estimation methodology is utilized for unknown input estimation. Simulations and experimental results compared with extended Kalman filter (EKF) and particle filter (PF) have verified the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed algorithm.},

Thus, the calculated singularity in the polar region, which is easy to see in the navigational frame, is suppressed. Considering the GPS measurements, the velocity errors are assumed in the GPS measurements. Since the characteristics of the observation vectors, the initial velocity error always exists during the whole alignment process. To address the initial velocity error, a simple method with the vector subtraction operation is used to construct the new observation vector. In the new observation vector, the initial velocity is eliminated. Thus, the initial velocity error is suppressed. To verify the performance of the proposed method, a virtual polar region method is proposed to transform the experimental data of the field tests in the low and middle latitude region. The simulation and field tests are shown that the proposed method can get more accurate alignment results than the traditional methods.},

Numerical simulation of radiated emissions from cables is time-consuming, which becomes insufficient to compute large numbers of cables for actual applications. Hence, this article proposes a fast prediction approach that can highly improve the computational efficiency. Since cables are often close to each other and arbitrarily bent in the real application due to confined working space, the influence of proximity effects caused by closely-spaced cables on radiated emissions is also considered in the calculation model by multi-transmission line and Hertzian dipole theories. Besides, an equivalent model is presented to characterize the measured motor impedance. On the basis of the proposed cables model, a complete motor driving system model is originally developed by integrating a radiated electromagnetic interference (EMI) source model of inverter and a load equivalent model of motor impedance. The system model is of vital value to identify the mechanism concerning radiated EMI issues on electric vehicles and efficiently evaluated in the end. Both numerical simulations and experiments are conducted for the validation of proposed approach, which show that the proposed approach can save over 90% computational time with desired evaluation accuracy.},

To properly combine the outputs of these model-based EKFs, a weighted probability of each model based on the stochastic process is designed, which reflects the characteristics of each of the kinematic and dynamic equations in real-time. Also, the observability of the proposed estimation algorithm is checked by observability functions of nonlinear systems. The estimation performance in various driving scenarios is verified using an experimental vehicle, and its superiority is confirmed through a comparative study. The proposed algorithm makes the following main contributions for estimating the vehicle sideslip angle: 1) the high optimality of estimation results and 2) the accurate estimation of tire cornering stiffness.},

However, existing energy harvesting shock absorbers (EHSAs) compromise suspension performance for high-efficiency energy harvesting and being only responsive to narrow-bandwidth vibrations. In this paper, we propose a new ball-screw-based EHSA design – inerter pendulum vibration absorber (IPVA) – that integrates an electromagnetic rotary EHSA with a nonlinear pendulum vibration absorber.We show that this design simultaneously improves ride comfort and energy harvesting efficiency by exploiting the nonlinear effects of pendulum inertia. To further improve the performance, we develop a novel stochastic linearization model predictive control (SL-MPC) approach in which we employ stochastic linearization to approximate the nonlinear dynamics of EHSA that has superior accuracy compared to standard linearization. In particular, we develop a new stochastic linearization method with guaranteed stabilizability, which is a prerequisite for control designs. This leads to an MPC problem that is much more computationally efficient than the nonlinear MPC counterpart with no major performance degradation. Also, the effect of different road preview configurations on control performance is investigated, which is shown to have a significant impact on the control performance. Extensive simulations are performed to show the superiority of the proposed new nonlinear EHSA and to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed SL-MPC.},

Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar with frequency diverse array (FDA) is capable of resolving targets in one directional beam with different ranges and velocities (Doppler shifts). Prevalent methods obtain target parameters in a sequential manner to get rid of exhausted multi-dimensional search, but they suffer from accumulated estimation errors. To tackle this issue, a tensor generalized weighted linear predictor (TGWLP) is devised for FDA-MIMO radar parameter estimation, where the parameters are estimated in a parallel manner. Tensor modeling of multidimensional FDA-MIMO radar signal is developed, so that the joint parameter estimation is casted into multiple-pulse-group version of three-dimensional (3D) HR problem associated to the mixed Swerling model. Pulse-group diversity is exploited to obtain precise velocity estimation. In the presence of targets with some identical parameters, the final estimations of unambiguous slant range, conic angle, and radial velocity of a moving target can be easily obtained after the parallel frequency estimations. Besides, all the parameter pairing is automatically achieved, which is free of the extra burden from pairing process. Furthermore, the identifiability of the proposed joint estimator is analyzed. Finally, theoretical analysis and simulations are included to demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve improved performance compared to the existing methods.},

Actual vehicle test data is examined by the algorithm to verify the control functions at an actual vehicle level. The developed anomaly detection algorithm demonstrates feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in detecting not only prior-known anomalies but also prior-unknown anomalies.

They represent a huge aggregate electricity consumption from the city power grid, while it is possible to make use of their batteries for supporting vehicle-to-grid (V2G) regulation service. Besides, there is a need to coordinate a collection of EVs in an intelligent manner through the smart transportation system in a smart city. In this paper, we propose a novel smart cross-system framework to support V2G regulation service in a smart city. Specifically, by considering electric buses (EBs) as a particular group of EVs with large battery packs installed and predictable operation schedules, we jointly solve the problems of EB allocation and scheduling with V2G regulation service. First of all, by using the deep learning approach, the short-term city traffic conditions can be predicted via the gated recurrent units (GRUs) neural network. With the predicted traffic conditions, we then formulate the EB allocation and V2G scheduling as a mixed-integer quadratic programming (MIQP) problem. In order to solve this problem effectively, we utilize the Lagrangian dual decomposition method to decouple the main problem into subproblems for EBs and devise a distributed algorithm to solve each subproblem. The simulation results show that our proposed approach is effective in EB allocation and V2G scheduling for the regulation service. Through efficient EB routing strategies under accurate predicted traffic conditions, the power fluctuations of the city power grid can be well flatten by providing the V2G regulation service.},

  abstract     = {Predicting the stay time of private cars has various applications in location-based services and traffic management. Due to the associated randomness and uncertainty, achieving the promising performance of stay time prediction is a challenge. We propose an RNN-based encoder model to solve this problem, which consists of three components, i.e., an encoder module, an exception module, and an MLP dropout. First, we encode the stay behaviour into hidden vectors at a specific time to avoid the effect of time sparsity. The encoder module utilizes a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to learn spatiotemporal features from the historical trajectory data, such as the inherent relationship between the stop points and corresponding stay time. We proved a linear relationship problem that cannot be ignored in the stay time prediction problem. In particular, we have added basic arithmetic logic units to the network framework to find linear relationships. By reconstructing the basic arithmetic and logical relations of the network, we have improved the ability of the neural network to handle linear relations and the extrapolation ability of the neural network. Our method can remember the number patterns seen in the training set very well and infer this representation reasonably. Moreover, we utilize the dropout technique to prevent the prediction model from overfitting. We perform extensive experiments based on a large-scale real-world private car trajectory dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves an RMSE of 0.1429 and a MAPE of 55.8533%. Furthermore, the results verify the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed model when compared with the benchmarks.},

Due to the multiple actuators of DM-PHEV and the limitation of network transmission rate, the control of MTP from electric driving mode (EM) to hybrid driving mode (HM) based on CAN bus inevitably induces random asynchronous delays. Firstly, the problem of MTP with CAN-induced delay is formulated and a mathematical model of MTP with asynchronous delays is built. In order to deal with the model uncertainty and the interference introduced by the measurement signals, ROHD controller is designed to achieve a fast, smooth and stable MTP in the presence of CAN-induced delays. Simulation and hardware-in-the-loop (HiL) test demonstrate that the torque demand and ride comfort of MTP with network-induced delays controlled by proposed controllers are better than those controlled by traditional robust controller.},

The high computation overhead and storage requirements also pose a significant challenge in message dissemination. To overcome these issues, we introduce a lightweight blockchain-based security protocol for secure communication and storage in SDN-enabled IoV, known as LBSV. The LBSV is a permissioned blockchain network that uses the proposed modified practical byzantine fault tolerance (mPBFT) consensus algorithm. Additionally, the SDN-enabled network exploits the blockchain framework and schedules different procedures. The secure message dissemination is achieved through various cryptographic functions (i.e., elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) and the secure hash algorithm (SHA256)). The security analysis shows that the LBSV withstands various cyberattacks regarding message dissemination privacy. The experimental results show that LBSV provides high performance with 85% less computational cost, 55% less storage and communication overhead and 90% less consensus delay compared with state-of-the-art schemes.},

  abstract     = {Self-driving vehicles are posing new challenges as the automation level defined in the SAE International standards for autonomous driving is increased. A pivotal task in autonomous driving is building a perception of the surrounding environment using optical sensors, which is a long-standing challenge and prompts us to explore the utilization of various sensors. Radar is an older and cheaper type of sensor than alternatives such as lidar for long-range distance coverage, and it is also competitively reliable and robust in adverse weather conditions. However, sparse data and noise are inherent challenges of radar. This study explores the dynamic Gaussian process for occupancy mapping and predicting a drivable path for a self-driving vehicle within the field of view (FOV) of a radar sensor. Gaussian occupancy mapping does not need abundant data for training and is a promising alternative to data-reliant deep learning techniques. The proposed technique optimizes parameters (variational and kernel-based) of the Gaussian process to determine the allowed region within the FOV limits by means of stochastic selection of functional points (pseudoinput) and tuning of threshold values. We have tested the proposed technique in experiments performed under different environmental conditions, such as various road and traffic conditions and diverse weather and illumination conditions. The results verify the efficacy of the proposed technique in diverse weather conditions for finding a drivable path for a self-driving vehicle, with the additional benefits of requiring only a low-cost apparatus and providing coverage of a long distance range.},

  abstract     = {Intelligent traffic light control is one of the modern approaches to solve traffic congestion, where reinforcement learning is a widely used method. Conventionally, reinforcement learning is used to determine whether to change the current phase (or choose a traffic phase) after each small interval. One major drawback of these approaches is that it makes the current traffic light phase duration uncertain before the current phase terminates. Directly determining the duration of the traffic light phase can effectively avoid this shortcoming. An adaptive traffic light timing system is proposed in this paper which can directly control the phase duration. In the proposed system, the Q-learning algorithm is employed and the action space is defined as all possible phase durations. In addition, the reward function is redefined to guide the agent to balance more traffic metrics, and the state is redefined to reduce the state space. Finally, the proposed system is evaluated by equal, unequal, and complex traffic scenarios. Results show that the proposed system has a better performance compared with other methods in controlling traffic lights, even on complex traffic scenarios.},

We first address the problem of lacking prior knowledge in unstructured environments by introducing a risk map that maps the density and motion of obstacles and the road to an occupancy risk. Model predictive control is then used to integrate trajectory planning and tracking control into one framework to bridge the gap between planning and control. Meanwhile, we use Gaussian Process (GP) regression to learn the residual model uncertainty for improving the model accuracy. An objective function considering both risks within the feasible region and vehicle dynamics is carefully formulated to obtain collision-free and kinematically-feasible local trajectories. Field experiments are performed on real unstructured environments with our automated vehicle. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for successful obstacle avoidance in various complex unstructured scenarios.},

Then, clustering by fast search and find of density peaks method (CFSFDP) based procedure for the classification of the lateral stability as ‘Absolutely stability’, ‘Nearly stability’ and ‘Hardly stability’ is applied. The brain emotional learning network combined with genetic algorithm (GA-BEL) model is used to train datasets to recognize vehicle stability categories during driving. For the different recognition results, a coordinated control strategy based on active front steering control (AFS) and direct yaw moment control (DYC) is designed finally.

In this paper, a passivity-based approach to stability analysis of vehicle platoons is presented. This is motivated by a case study of an adaptive cruise-controlled platoon. We link the string stability of the platoon to the output strict passivity of each subsystem (vehicle) in the string. We show that a sufficient condition for the platoon to be string stable is that the output strict passivity index of each vehicle in the string be lower bounded by one. For a linear time-invariant (LTI) system, this means the Nyquist plot of the transfer function of each subsystem is within the unit circle. Modeling the platoon as a cascade of LTI subsystems, we present a visual tool to assess string stability. By constraining the output strict passivity index of each subsystem in a string to unity through a two-stage control strategy, the condition for string stability is met. The proposed string stability control strategy, accounting for uncertainties and delays in the drive and sensory systems, is validated using numerical simulations.},

Considering the advantages of contactlessness and easy-to-collect of sound signals, a novel sound-based fault diagnosis method for RPMs is proposed. First, fractional calculus is introduced to wavelet packet decomposition energy entropy (WPDE). Fractional WPDE (FWPDE) is then proposed, which is verified to be a more effective tool for fault feature representation. Second, coarse-grain process is firstly introduced to FWPDE. Novel feature named multi-scale FWPDE is developed, which can significantly improve fault diagnosis accuracy. Third, to select optimal feature set and optimize the hyperparameters of support vector machine (SVM) at the same time, a synchronous optimization strategy based on binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO) is presented, which can further improve the diagnosis accuracy. The superiority and effectiveness of the proposed method are verified by comparing to some existing fault diagnosis methods. The diagnosis accuracies of reverse-normal and normal-reverse switching processes reach 99.33% and 99.67%, respectively. Especially, the proposed method is suitable for diagnosis of similar faults, which can also provide reference for similar research fields.},

  abstract     = {Spatial consistency is a basic physical characteristic of the wireless channel because the neighboring spatial positions share similar clusters, resulting in the spatial correlations of both large-scale parameters (LSPs) and small-scale parameters (SSPs). Although the existing geometry-based stochastic channel model (GSCM)-based channel simulator try to realize the spatial consistency of the channel parameters by the correlated map method or the sum-of-sinusoids (SOS) method, such a stochastic approach also results in that the change of cluster positions calculated by the SSPs appears considerable even in closely neighboring spatial positions, which violates the wide-sense stationary (WSS) conditions over a short distance. To further improve the cluster-level spatial consistency, we investigate the pattern of change of the root mean square (RMS)-delay spread (DS) and derive the continuity of RMS-DS in the entire space. Taking the continuity of RMS-DS as the optimization goal, we determine the change of clusters of the channel, i.e., cluster appearance and disappearance, when the spatial position of mobile terminal (MT) changes and propose the reference points (RPs) transition method. Specifically, we firstly choose the RPs in the target area according to the correlation distance, then generate the channels of RPs by the SOS method stochastically, and finally obtain the channel of MT through the transitions between the RPs deterministically. Simulation results demonstrate that the channel simulator with the proposed RPs transition method can achieve the spatial consistency of LSPs, SSPs, and clusters in the entire 2D or 3D space.},

  abstract     = {Artificial intelligence (AI)-powered autonomous vehicles (AVs) can integrate different machine learning (ML) techniques to build up a complex autonomous driving system. However, single AV intelligence is not enough to cope with ever-changing driving environments. The underlying reason is that, with current neural network design and training algorithms, it is challenging for the driving model to generalize to diverse driving environments all at once due to sample inefficiency and the curse of dimensionality. Powerful computing resources and massive amount of data can be used to train a good driving model offline. However, the driving model obtained offline might fail in corner case scenarios. In this paper, we propose an intelligence networking framework among AVs assisted by multi-access edge computing (MEC) with end-to-end learning for demonstration. In this framework, driving road is divided into segments and data is collected for each road segment separately. Assisted by MEC networks, a continuously updated driving model is produced in near real-time for each road segment when the environment changes. By dividing the road into segments, we aim to reduce the burden of generalization since a single model only needs to adapt to a specific road segment. Simulation results show that our solutions can produce updated driving model for each road segment to adapt to environmental changes better than the existing scheme. Upcoming AVs can then adapt to changing environments by downloading the updated driving model.},

  abstract     = {In order to improve the trajectory tracking accuracy and vehicle lateral stability, the paper proposes a lateral and longitudinal dynamics control framework of autonomous vehicles considering multi-parameter joint estimation. First, the multi-parameter joint estimation based on adaptive unscented Kalman filter (AUKF) is constructed to decouple and estimate the longitudinal position of vehicle&#39;s center of gravity (CG), tire-road friction coefficient (TRFC), tire cornering stiffness (TCS), tire vertical force (TVF) and road grade. Then, focusing on the large lateral acceleration condition, a lateral control based on the optimal front-tire lateral force is proposed by constructing the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) and combining the multi-parameter joint estimation. Additionally, a longitudinal control based on the drive and brake force compensation to realize the accurate speed tracking by combining road slop estimation is achieved. The fuzzy system employs the drive and brake force deviation as the input to implement the compensation of the throttle and brake. The proposed estimation and control framework are verified by co-simulation on PreScan and CarSim preliminarily. In order to further verify the effectiveness and practicability of algorithm, experiments are implemented on an autonomous vehicle platform, a hybrid Lincoln MKZ. Simulation and experimental results show that the proposed estimation and control framework possess excellent performance and enhance the tracking accuracy and lateral stability.},

  abstract     = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have enabled a broad spectrum of applications serving social, commercial, and military purposes. However, since UAVs use wireless communication technologies, they are highly vulnerable to security threats. Establishing trust with the base station is the most fundamental security aspect in UAV networks to mitigate these threats. However, due to a UAV’s constrained resources, deploying traditional trust establishment schemes in UAV networks becomes challenging. Further, this issue escalates as the number of UAVs increases. To address this issue, we propose an authentication cum attestation protocol for UAV swarms using an optimal communication trajectory, which can establish the required trust in a lightweight manner. Furthermore, our protocol uses Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) and thus guarantees physical security as well. We demonstrate that the proposed protocol is feasible, scalable, and secure using a formal Mao Boyd logic approach. Comparative analyses show that the proposed protocol outperforms the state-of-the-art.},

  abstract     = {The impact of Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications on platoon control performance is investigated. Platoon control is essentially a sequential stochastic decision problem (SSDP), which can be solved by Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to deal with both the control constraints and uncertainty in the platoon leading vehicle’s behavior. In this context, the value of V2X communications for DRL-based platoon controllers is studied with an emphasis on the tradeoff between the gain of including exogenous information in the system state for reducing uncertainty and the performance erosion due to the curse-of-dimensionality. Our objective is to find the specific set of information that should be shared among the vehicles for the construction of the most appropriate state space. SSDP models are conceived for platoon control under different information topologies (IFT) by taking into account ‘just sufficient’ information. Furthermore, theorems are established for comparing the performance of their optimal policies. In order to determine whether a piece of information should or should not be transmitted for improving the DRL-based control policy, we quantify its value by deriving the conditional KL divergence of the transition models. More meritorious information is given higher priority in transmission, since including it in the state space has a higher probability in offsetting the negative effect of having higher state dimensions. Finally, simulation results are provided to illustrate the theoretical analysis.},

We introduce the vehicle stop detection module in the pre-processing measurement procedure. During the back-end processing, if the vehicle is detected to be in a stopping state, we perform optimization based on the stop constraint to help eliminate the abnormal jitter of the estimated pose, thus ensuring the reasonability of the trajectory. Otherwise, besides the prior information, IMU measurement residual, and visual measurement residual utilized in VINS, vehicle orientation/velocity constraint built by Ackerman steering model is first exploited to constitute residuals. We minimize the sum of priors and Mahalanobis norms of three kinds of residuals to obtain a maximum posterior estimation, thus increasing system consistency and accuracy. The proposed approach is validated on public datasets and compared with state-of-the-art algorithms, which demonstrates that the motion constraint proposed in this paper improves the standard VINS performance and achieves significantly higher positioning accuracy.},

Most of the existing research on unsignalized intersection cooperation considers fixed lane direction, where only specific turning behavior of vehicles is allowed on each lane. Given that traffic volume and the proportion of vehicles with different turning expectation may change with time, fixed lane direction may lead to inefficiency at intersections. This paper proposes a multi-lane unsignalized intersection cooperation method that considers flexible lane direction. The two-dimensional distribution of vehicles is calculated and vehicles that are not in conflict are scheduled to pass the intersection simultaneously. The formation reconfiguration method is utilized to achieve collision-free longitudinal and lateral position adjustment of vehicles. Simulations are conducted at different input traffic volumes and turning proportion of incoming vehicles, and the results indicate that our method outperformances the fixed-lane-direction unsignalized cooperation method and the signalized method.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a stochastic stable control protocol for heterogeneous vehicle platoon subject to communication topologies change, external disturbance, and information delay. First, a random vehicle platoon system composed entirely of several pure electric vehicles is built. The random variation of data transmission link among the platoon in a natural traffic environment is considered and molded by the Markov chain combined with the directed graph method. The influence of delays and discrete data in wireless communication, road slope, and air resistance on the vehicle platoon is also considered by introducing the external interferences and equivalent information delays. Additionally, to ensure the vehicle platoon’s inner-vehicle stability, the variable-gain distributed controller is proposed based on the Markovian jumping system stability theory and &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$ H_\infty$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; control.

In order to develop this analysis, a methodology that returns the life cycle cost of each proposed case is presented. The methodology includes the optimization of the diesel generator and lithium-ion battery sizing. A scenario based on a real railway line is introduced, and the obtained results are compared to a traditional diesel-electric railway vehicle to develop a techno-economical discussion. The best lithium-ion battery technologies are found to be LTO and NMC, and the most appropriated strategy a state-machine controller optimised by a genetic algorithm approach. The best case obtains a life cycle cost reduction of the 4.0% and diesel savings of the 13.7% compared to a traditional diesel-electric railway vehicle.

  abstract     = {The use of multiple low-power fuel cells (FCs), instead of a high-power one, in the powertrain of a FC-hybrid electric vehicle (FC-HEV) has recently received considerable attention. This is mainly due to the fact that this configuration can lead to higher efficiency, durability, and reliability. However, the added degrees of freedom require an advanced multi-agent energy management strategy (EMS) for an effective power distribution among power sources. This paper puts forward an EMS based on game theory (GT) for a multi-stack FC-HEV with three FCs and a battery pack. GT is a well-approved method for characterizing the interactions in multi-agent systems. Unlike the other strategies, the proposed EMS is equipped with an online identification system to constantly update the time-varying characteristics of the power sources. The performance of the suggested strategy is investigated through two case studies. Firstly, a comparative study with two other EMSs, dynamic programming (offline), and a competent rule-based strategy (online), is conducted to realize the capability of GT. Secondly, to justify the necessity of online system identification, the degradation effect of each power source on the EMS performance is examined. The carried-out studies show that the total cost (hydrogen consumption and degradation) of the proposed strategy is almost 6% better than the rule-based EMS while keeping a reasonable difference with dynamic programming. Moreover, health unawareness of power sources can increase the hydrogen consumption up to 7% in the studied system.},

However, the design of suitable control strategies is critical to take full advantage of the additional degree of freedom and limit the principal causes of fuel cell degradation, such as transient operation and start-up/shut-down cycles. This paper studies the energy management of fuel cell-ultracapacitor-battery hybrid vehicles, investigating different criteria for fuel cell operation to find the best trade-off between hydrogen consumption and the number of start-up/shut-down cycles. In particular, the investigated control criteria are fixed-setpoint and charge-balancing operation. A third strategy is considered as a reference for potential performance improvements of predictive energy management. The study reveals that, in fuel cell-ultracapacitor-battery vehicles, the only significant source of fuel cell degradation are start-up/shut-down cycles. Here, harmful transients are limited because ultracapacitors enable stationary fuel cell operation without compromising battery life. Moreover, the investigation shows that the ultracapacitor and battery systems can sustain short driving cycles alone, avoiding fuel cell starts to preserve its life. The simulation results indicate that the fixed-setpoint strategy yields a better trade-off between hydrogen consumption and start-up/shut-down cycles than the charge-balancing one. Additionally, the study demonstrates that a predictive energy management strategy can significantly reduce degradation without hindering system efficiency.},

  abstract     = {This article proposes a predictive energy management strategy of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles by real-time optimization and data-driven calibration. The powertrain modelling and physical constraints, including engine, battery, and generator, are simplified by polynomial fitting approximations, which reserve the system nonlinearities with acceptable accuracy. To mitigate the control complexity, the physical constraints of engine, generator, and battery, are merged into a unified one by methodical derivatives. The nonlinear model predictive control problem is established, and the continuation/ general minimal residual (C/GMRES) algorithm is proposed for real-time optimization. Since the original C/GMRES algorithm can only deal with the equality constraints, the external penalty method is adopted for inequality constraints handling. To tackle the parameters’ tuning difficulties, the Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithm is proposed. Based on the prior knowledges of closed-loop experiments, the map between parameters and objective can be described by Gaussian process, and the control parameters can be optimized with few evaluations in BO. Moreover, owing to the real-time applicability of C/GMRES algorithm, the time of closed-loop experiments is reduced so that the calculation time of BO calibration can be saved, exhibiting the superior design for predictive energy management. Simulation and hardware-in-the-loop validations are carried out and verify the energy-saving effectiveness and real-time applicability for proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {The papers in this special section focus on innovative electrified vehicles. According to the “Global EV Outlook 2021” of International Energy Agency (IEA), ten million electric cars were on the world’s roads in 2020. It was an important year for the electrification of mass market transportation with the share of 4.6% of total car sales around the world, despite of Covid-19 pandemic and its related economic downturn and lockdowns. Nevertheless, the challenge remains enormous to reach the target of 230 million EVs on the world’s roads by 2030, according to the IEA Sustainable Development Scenario. In addition to technologies related to road vehicles, the electrification of railway vehicles, air and water vehicles also requires fast development to combat the global climate change. Papers included in this special section were presented at the IEEE Vehicle Power and Propulsion Conference (VPPC).},

Because synthetic aperture radar (SAR), which is used for satellite image acquisition and its related signal processing, is dealing with large volumes of image data, corresponding on-demand adaptive methods for SAR image processing are essentially required for stabilized surveillance services under the consideration of data burst situations. Thus, an adaptive vision algorithm for ship detection which is one of major tasks in SAR image processing researches is proposed based on Lyapunov optimization framework, which maximizes the detection performance while satisfying stability conditions. The high-performance filters are utilized for precisely recognizing the targets whereas they introduce relatively larger delays (i.e., tradeoff exists between performances and delays). Therefore, the proposed Lyapunov optimization-based adaptive filter selection algorithm is designed based on the characteristics. Our data-intensive performance evaluation results prove that the proposed algorithm achieves desired performance improvements.},

Most of prior works deploy UAVs based on user locations and explore the benefits of UAV caching under static content library. Motivated by this observation, we further consider heterogeneous user activity level and dynamic content library. We formulate a joint optimization problem of UAV deployment and content placement to minimize the average request delay, which is proved to be NP-hard. To tackle this problem efficiently, we decompose this optimization problem into two sub-problems, UAV deployment problem and content placement problem. Specifically, we first jointly consider user activity level and user locations for UAV deployment using weighted K-means method. After the UAV deployment, we propose a Q-learning algorithm to learn the content placement directly, rather than estimating the content popularity first, which is not effective when content library is dynamically changing. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the benchmark algorithms when dynamic content library and heterogeneous user activity level are considered.},

Simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) is an efficient solution for fully autonomous and sustainable communication networks. In this paper, application of SWIPT in networks employing cooperative NOMA (CNOMA) is investigated with imperfect channel state information (CSI). Performance of the CNOMA network with SWIPT is investigated in a multi-tier downlink scenario with macro-base stations (MBSs) and femto-base stations (FBSs). The distribution of MBSs and FBSs follow Poisson point process model. Unlike solution in the existing literature, instead of using only the superimposed signal for energy harvesting (EH), in this work, the cooperating node/user employs EH using interference from the adjacent base stations. Expressions for outage probability and throughput are derived at the user pair (comprising a cell-center user and a cell-edge user) served using NOMA. Comparison of the proposed EH system with the existing solutions is highlighted. Monte Carlo simulations are carried out to validate the analytical results.},

Considering a two-way wireless powered interference channel, in this study, we present a simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT)-then-wireless information transfer (WIT) protocol. In this protocol, transmitters perform SWIPT, and receivers receive both information and energy simultaneously in the forward link (FL). Then, the receivers perform WIT using the harvested energy in the backward link (BL). To maximize the weighted sum rate of the FL and BL, we jointly optimize the transmit power and energy harvesting (EH) ratio according to time switching and power splitting policies. To solve this non-convex optimization problem, we propose an iterative power control and energy harvesting algorithm based on dual methods that reduce computational complexity. The results show that the proposed algorithm finds the optimal transmit power and EH ratio suitably and thus maximizes the weighted sum rate. Consequently, the proposed SWIPT-then-WIT protocol expands the achievable rate region significantly compared with conventional schemes that do not adaptively control the transmit power and EH ratio.},

The existing channel estimation methods for RIS-aided millimeter-wave systems assume that the RIS is ideal without blockage. However, in practice, RIS may be blocked by the rain, snow, or dust, which will cause absorption and scattering of the incident/reflected signals and change the channel characteristics. In this paper, we formulate the system model of RIS-aided multi-user communications considering the blocked RIS. Then, we propose a variational Bayesian based channel estimation algorithm that is robust to RIS blockage, where we can simultaneously estimate the channel information and the RIS blockage.

In the design of the proposed scheme, we consider fairness that all the users have higher secrecy rates as compared to those given by a competing orthogonal multiple access (OMA) scheme. Despite its importance, the fairness aware design has remained rarely touched since it is mathematically intractable. This work shows that this problem can be efficiently solved by utilizing a deep neural network as the precoder for the information and AN signals even without resorting to some assumptions such as a large antenna array and/or a high signal-to-noise ratio. We will also propose an adaptive mode that switches the access protocol from the OMA scheme to the NOMA scheme only when the fairness is met. Performance of the proposed secure NOMA scheme will be extensively evaluated and compared with existing NOMA and OMA schemes. The comparisons clearly show that the sum secrecy rate can be significantly improved while guaranteeing the fairness, which however cannot be achieved with the existing NOMA scheme.},

We first design an analytical framework for evaluating vehicle tracking systems based on the extended Kalman filter. A simple, yet effective, metric that quantifies the vehicle tracking performance is derived in terms of the angular derivative of a dominant spatial frequency. Second, an RSU selection algorithm is proposed to select a proper RSU that enhances the vehicle tracking performance. A joint vehicle tracking algorithm is also developed to maximize the tracking performance by considering sounding samples at multiple RSUs while minimizing the amount of sample exchange. The numerical results verify that the proposed vehicle tracking algorithms give better performance than conventional signal-to-noise ratio-based tracking systems.},

  abstract     = {To reduce the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) loss of analog directional modulation (DM) with finite radio frequency (RF) phase shifters (PSs), a hybrid analog and digital (HAD) DM with mixed PSs is proposed. Using the law of large numbers, the closed-form expressions of SINR performance loss (PL), secrecy rate (SR), and bit error rate (BER) are derived. In accordance with the closed-form expression of SINR loss, it is clear that the SINR PL at desired receiver (Bob) gradually decreases as the fraction &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\eta$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; of the low-resolution phase shifter decreases, where &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\eta$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; is defined as the ratio of the number of low-resolution shifters to the total number of shifters. The simulation results show that the SINR PL, SR PL, and BER gradually decrease as the number of quantization bits increases. When the fraction of low-resolution shifters is equal to 50%, 2 bits is sufficient for low-resolution shifters to achieve a SINR PL less than 0.5 dB and a negligible BER degradation. Also, when the number of quantization bits of low-resolution shifters is equal to 2, the SR PL is about 0.3 bits/s/Hz. Thus, compared with analog DM, the HAD DM structure strikes a good balance between PL and circuit cost.},

Existing works focus on linear array which can only find 1-D angle information. In this paper, we focus on bistatic MIMO radar where both the transmitter and receiver are equipped with uniform planar arrays (UPAs) which can find full angle information of targets. To overcome the gridding effect, we use atomic norm minimization (ANM) to formulate a gridless model which is equivalent to a semidefinite programming (SDP). By solving the SDP we can obtain the angle estimates without discretizing the 4-D angle space. An alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) based implementation is also derived to reduce the computational complexity of the proposed method. Simulation results show that our proposed method can break through the gridding limitation to achieve a high estimation accuracy while enjoying low computational complexity.},

From the baseline successive refinement algorithm, which gives a sub-optimal solution for the power minimization problem under the signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) constraint at each user, several optimization techniques are proposed to reduce the computation complexity while maintaining the algorithm-level performance. To reduce the number of required multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations, we first simplify the complicated matrix inversion by utilizing the channel hardening effect. We also present the two-phase refinement process for the group-level optimization of phase-shift elements, further relaxing the computation complexity as well as the processing latency. Applying the proposed optimization techniques, as a result, numerical results show that the fully-optimized algorithm can reduce the computational costs by up to 89.4% while showing less than 1 dB power loss, leading to the practical solution for the next-generation IRS-aided communication.},

This correspondence investigates the average throughput in a UAV-enabled cognitive radio network, where the UAV is regarded as a dedicated secondary user to enhance the network coverage and spectral efficiency. Based on the probabilistic line-of-sight channel, we exploit the joint design of UAV trajectory and resource allocation to maximize the average throughput under the constraints of co-channel interference and completion time. The original problem is a mixed integer non-convex problem which is generally NP-hard. We first decompose the primal problem into a bilevel programming problem, and then propose an efficient high-quality algorithm based on the particle swarm optimization approach. The optimized trajectory reveals the trade-off between throughput and co-channel interference. Numerical results verify the superiority of the proposed algorithm as compared to other benchmark schemes.},

Specifically, we consider two scenarios where &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$L$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; used by the PPM at a transmitter Alice for communicating with a receiver Bob is known and unknown to the warden Willie, respectively. In the former scenario, our numerical examination obtained based on our analysis indicates that the optimal &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$L$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; is generally 2, which is mainly due to the fact that Willie’s detection performance increases with &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$L$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; when he knows it.

In this system, a source transmits its packets to a near IoT user via direct transmission and a far IoT user via selective relaying transmission under practical conditions of imperfect successive interference cancellation and cochannel interference. We derive the closed-form and asymptotic expressions for the average block-error-rate (BLER), throughput, and the goodput of the considered system over Rayleigh fading channels. To further improve the considered system, we formulate the system throughput maximization problem. Numerical results show that our proposed system outperforms the orthogonal multiple access and conventional NOMA-CDRT ones in terms of both BLER, system throughput, and goodput. In addition, by jointly optimizing power allocation coefficients and channel coding ratios, the system throughput performance is maximized. Furthermore, for a given block-length, the proposed system with short messages achieves superior latency and reliability compared to the long-message one.

Furthermore, for negligible thermal noise, we provide simplified single-integral expressions to compute the outage probability in a multi-carrier network. Numerical results demonstrate the performance of the proposed user-pairing scheme and validate the accuracy of the derived expressions.},

We formulate an energy efficiency (EE) maximization problem, and we design an iterative solution to handle this optimization problem. This solution can provide an offline benchmark but might not be suitable for online power control, therefore, we employ our proposed deep learning model. The proposed deep learning model consists of two main pipelines, one for the deep feature mapping where we stack our self-attention block on top of a ResNet to extract high quality features, and focus on specific regions in the data to extract the patterns of the influential factors (interference, quality of service (QoS), and the corresponding power allocation). The second pipeline is to extract the shallow modality features. Those features are combined and passed to a dense layer to perform the final power prediction. The proposed deep learning framework achieves near optimal performance, and outperforms traditional solutions and other strong deep learning models such as PowerNet and the conventional convolutional neural network (CNN).},

Based on the parameter estimates, the predicted mean square error (PMSE) of the channel estimate is minimized to determine a preferred sounding beam for the next channel use, of which the index is fed back to the transmitter via a limited-rate channel.

One of the prerequisites for developing large-scale FVNs is ensuring the security and privacy of the entire network environment. However, the existing schemes proposed for FVNs exist considerable calculation and communication costs and/or security vulnerabilities. Therefore, to promote efficient FVN authentication, we propose a lightweight security protocol using self-certified public key cryptography. In the protocol, the trusted authority does not need to participate in the authentication process between the vehicle and the fog node online. And the vehicle can dynamically update its login password and pseudonym, without performing complicated interactive steps with the trusted authority. In addition, our protocol supports batch verification, which significantly improves the system authentication efficiency. A detailed security analysis reveals that our protocol can meet the security requirements of vehicular networks while resisting the common types of attack. Calculation and communication overhead comparisons further prove that our protocol exhibits better performance than related schemes.},

This paper proposes a new framework to optimize collectively the propulsion power and the three-dimensional (3D) trajectory of a solar-powered, fixed-wing UAV on a disguised tailing and video surveillance mission. The multi-objective optimization strikes a balance between distance keeping, elevation variance, and power efficiency. A key aspect is that we develop a new propulsion power model of the fixed-wing UAV by analyzing the forces undergone while the UAV is ascending or descending. Another important aspect is a series of non-trivial reformulations, which convexify the multi-objective problem progressively with increasingly tightening linear approximation and solve the problem with a polynomial time-complexity. Our algorithm can control the trajectory of the UAV on-the-fly. Simulations confirm that the algorithm outperforms existing schemes in terms of visual disguise and power efficiency. The fixed-wing UAV also demonstrates its advantage of energy efficiency and sustainability to elongate the surveillance mission, over its rotary-wing counterpart.},

Acquiring knowledge regarding the number of active devices and their latency-reliability requirements becomes essential to optimize resource allocation in heterogeneous networks. Due to the inherent heavy computation overheads, the conventional centralized decision-making approaches result in large latency. The distributed computing and device-level prediction of network parameters can play a significant role in designing mission-critical IoT applications operating in dynamic environments. This paper considers the medium access control (MAC) layer of heterogeneous networks employing a framed-ALOHA-based restricted transmission strategy to enhance reliability. We present a statistical learning-based device-level network exploration mechanism in which end-devices use their transmission history to predict different network parameters. The IoT devices share the learned parameters with the base station (BS) to identify different groups presented in the network. The simulation results show that the mean square error (MSE) in predicting different network parameters can be reduced by increasing the history window size. In this regard, the optimal size of the history window under the given accuracy constraints is also determined. We demonstrate that the proposed device-level network load prediction mechanism is more robust as compared to the BS-centered approach.},

It enables data transmission by reflecting the incident radio signals. In this paper, we propose a communication mode selection scheme for IoT devices that can communicate using either active transmission or backscattering. In the active transmission mode, the IoT devices can transmit data over narrowband subcarriers using power-domain non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). In the backscattering mode, which operates over shorter distance than active transmission, nearby user equipment (UE) devices are used as relays. The UEs receive the backscattered signals from the IoT devices and forward them to the base station. We formulate a connection density maximization problem to select the communication mode used by each IoT device. We determine the IoT device pairing for active transmission mode with NOMA and UE-IoT device association for backscattering mode. The formulated problem is a binary integer programming problem. Although it can be solved optimally, the optimal algorithm incurs exponential computational complexity. Hence, we propose a low-complexity suboptimal algorithm to solve this problem. Results show that our proposed algorithm can enhance the connection density of narrowband IoT systems by up to 64% when compared with using single communication mode.},

Thereby, it is crucial to enable timely exchange of information over the dynamic cyber-physical-social system enabled by the AVs. In this paper, we consider age of information (AoI)-centric real-time information dissemination over vehicular social networks (VSNs), where the AoI captures the freshness of received data packets. We first propose a mathematical framework based on the mean-field theory (MFT) to analyze the network AoI (NAoI) of VSNs, namely AoI for the AV that lastly receives the information update in the network. The proposed analytical framework considers both the social features of vehicular networks, which are characterized using the scale-free network theory, and the underlying wireless communication process to evaluate the NAoI. Then, we further consider joint optimization of the information update rate at the source node and the transmit probabilities at the AVs for minimization of the average peak NAoI (PNAoI), i.e., the time average of peak values occurred in the evolution of the NAoI, which is solved via a novel parametric optimization scheme. Both analytical and simulation results show that compared with several baseline schemes, the proposed scheme can exploit the scale-free feature of the VSNs to significantly lower the average PNAoI by up to 96 &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\%$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; .},

In this paper, an analytical framework is presented for the effect of link disruption on reliable data delivery and performance of LTP in Mars communications. The analysis focuses on how various link disruptions affect the number of transmission attempts, the consequent round-trip time (RTT) of data exchange, and the resulting goodput performance of LTP for reliable data block delivery in Mars communications. The analytical framework is validated by means of realistic data block transmission experiments using a PC-based experimental infrastructure, and it can be used to predict the performance of LTP over a deep-space vehicle communication channel in presence of link disruption.},

  abstract     = {With the development of new radio (NR) technologies, sidelink (SL) transmission plays a more vital role in supporting low latency, higher reliability vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications. Compared with the Long-Term Evolution (LTE), NR V2X aims to support enhanced V2X use cases with more stringent latency and reliability requirements. 3GPP introduces NR V2X distributed resource allocation to fulfill the low latency requirement to reduce the delay caused by requesting transmission resources from gNB. In distributed mode, UEs autonomously select resources without the scheduling from gNB. NR V2X introduces the physical sidelink feedback channel (PSFCH) to enhance transmission reliability. This paper presents the resource allocation mechanism for NR V2X distributed mode. Since the SL feedback channel is a new feature different from LTE V2X, we discuss the potential enhancements on resource allocation utilizing SL feedback channel to improve the reliability. This paper proposes a Receiver Grant-based resource allocation, which allows the receiver to send the grant with the feedback channel. By allowing the transmitter to indicate the pre-selected resources before the end of the previous reservation, the receiver can inform the transmitter about the collided resource selection through the PSFCH. The analytical models for NR V2X distributed mode with the feedback channel are also provided for UE to estimate the collision ratio. The simulation results and the analytical model show that the proposed Receiver (Rx) Grant-based resource allocation improves transmission reliability in terms of collision ratio. For future advanced V2X use cases, the analytical models provide an evaluation method and help UE make decisions to meet the reliability requirements.},

In this paper we propose a novel skeleton-based positioning and reference point deployment for hybrid wireless localization (S-PDH) that utilizes the spatial skeleton of indoor layout to improve location estimation accuracy. Firstly, we adopt an automatic map analysis algorithm to generate appropriate reference points (RPs) from the spatial skeleton of indoor layout. Secondly, we propose a novel clustering algorithm to consider both spatial layout and RSS information in order to enhance the accuracy of RP matching. Those outlier RPs resulting poor performance will be replaced by appropriate deployment of BLE APs. Finally, the cluster-based positioning algorithm is presented to estimate the target’s location. Compared to existing methods, both the simulation and experimental results show that the proposed S-PDH system can achieve better positioning accuracy along with the benefits of automatically generating the spatial layout information for wireless indoor localization.},

  abstract     = {The ability to determine the location of a sensor node in a wireless sensor network is essential in many applications. We propose a received signal strength (RSS) based cooperative localization technique. The target nodes, whose locations are unknown during the deployment phase, communicate with the anchor nodes (whose locations are known) and the neighboring target nodes to localize themselves. In the proposed technique the target nodes behave as pseudo anchor nodes after they have localized themselves. It is observed that in such cooperative techniques the localization error propagates from one iteration to the next. We mitigate this error propagation by eliminating the network edge nodes from updating their location information after the first iteration. We propose two distributed edge node detection techniques: quadrant method (Quad) and geometric dilution of precision (GDOP) based method. Extensive simulations have been carried out, on uniform anchor and non-uniform network topologies, to analyze the performance of the proposed edge detection techniques and the iterative localization algorithm. The proposed localization algorithm is compared with state of the art localization techniques using simulations as well as experiments, and is shown to achieve improved localization accuracy.

  abstract     = {In view of the rapid development of edge computing and vehicular network, edge-assisted vehicular crowdsensing system has brought significant benefits to Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). To satisfy the requirements of ITS applications, a substantial number of sensed data are generated continuously, which incurs considerable communication and computation delays. In addition, with fast-moving vehicles and the sheer amount of data, data loss becomes an issue during the process of data uploading. To deal with these challenges, this paper aims to propose a cost-and-quality aware data collection scheme for edge-assisted vehicular crowdsensing system, so as to satisfy the accuracy and timeliness requirements of ITS applications without overloading the network. Particularly, we design a functional architecture for edge-assisted vehicular crowdsensing system, where vehicular sensing, data uploading and sensing parameter adjustment interwork to enable ITS applications. Based on the architecture, two effective algorithms are proposed, which are adaptive clustering and online sensing parameter adjustment. Adaptive clustering algorithm can support reliable and timely data uploading by taking into account the cluster stability and the communication reliability during the process of clustering vehicles. Online sensing parameter adjustment algorithm can guide the actions of intelligent vehicles based on the real-time traffic condition, which can achieve a tradeoff between sensing accuracy and communication overhead. In order to evaluate the performance of our scheme, we develop a simulation platform in which all the components in the system are built. By conducting extensive simulation, the superiority of the proposed scheme is validated.},

  abstract     = {A challenge for rescue teams when fighting against wildfire in remote areas is the lack of information, such as the size and images of fire areas. As such, live streaming from Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), capturing videos of dynamic fire areas, is crucial for firefighter commanders in any location to monitor the fire situation with quick response. The 5G network is a promising wireless technology to support such scenarios. In this paper, we consider a UAV-to-UAV (U2U) communication scenario, where a UAV at a high altitude acts as a mobile base station (UAV-BS) to stream videos from other flying UAV-users (UAV-UEs) through the uplink. Due to the mobility of the UAV-BS and UAV-UEs, it is important to determine the optimal movements and transmission powers for UAV-BSs and UAV-UEs in real-time, so as to maximize the data rate of video transmission with smoothness and low latency, while mitigating the interference according to the dynamics in fire areas and wireless channel conditions. In this paper, we co-design the video resolution, the movement, and the power control of UAV-BS and UAV-UEs to maximize the Quality of Experience (QoE) of real-time video streaming. We applied the Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Actor-Critic (AC) to maximize the QoE of video transmission from all UAV-UEs to a single UAV-BS to learn the dynamic fire areas and communication environment. Simulation results show the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm in terms of the QoE, delay and video smoothness compared to the Greedy algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Cooperative Vehicle-Infrastructure System (CVIS) can provide innovative services for traffic management and enable trips to be safer, more coordinated, and smarter. In the CVIS, the vehicles upload crowd sensing data to the Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC) server for quick data fusion and informed decision-making. However, with the ever-increasing number of vehicles, the VEC server cannot undertake massive computation-intensive tasks due to the limited edge computing capabilities. In this paper, we propose a reverse offloading framework that can fully utilize the vehicular computation resource to relieve the burden of the VEC server and further reduce the system latency. Under the proposed offloading framework, the binary reverse offloading (BRO) and partial reverse offloading (PRO) strategies are designed for two types of tasks, i.e., non-partitioned tasks and partitioned tasks. We formulate the system latency minimization problem by optimizing reverse offloading decisions, and the communication and computation resources allocation. Due to the non-convex and existing variables coupling, the original problem is transformed into the equivalent weighted-sum optimization problem. Based on the alternative optimization, we decouple the weighted-sum optimization problems into the two subproblems, and the closed-form expressions of transmission power and computation frequency of vehicles and RSU are derived. Low complexity greedy based efficient searching (GES) algorithm and joint alternative optimization based bi-section searching (JAOBSS) algorithm are proposed for BRO and PRO strategies, respectively. The algorithm complexity and performance bounds are analyzed. Simulation results show that the proposed GES algorithm can achieve optimal performance with low complexity. Besides, the proposed GES and JAOBSS algorithms can significantly improve the performance compared with other baseline schemes by 6.14% and 13.46% at least.},

The inherent openness of the wireless environment makes security in 5G unprecedentedly urgent to be addressed. Accordingly, the physical layer security (PLS) technique exploits the randomness characteristics of the wireless channel to fulfill security and confidentiality of information transmission. Different from many current works, which ignored the significance of security in uRLLC, this paper studies secrecy improvement strategy design in uRLLC scenarios. First, we propose suitable performance metrics for evaluating PLS of uRLLC and make a compromise between reliability, latency, and security, while maximizing the network throughput. Next, we identify the key challenging issues for achieving PLS in the context of uRLLC, and discuss the role of cooperative communication and mobility in terms of possible solutions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to make a trade-off among reliability, security and network throughput. Simulations validate the theoretical analyses.},

  abstract     = {In the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) scenarios, vehicles are equipped with computing resources to support vehicle-oriented IoV applications. Meanwhile, these computing resources can be also leveraged to enhance the task processing performance for the devices in Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) scenarios, and alleviate the load of edge servers. Existing research works rarely consider the resource utilization of moving vehicles, which can be an important complement to the MEC schemes with the assistance of parked vehicles. In this paper, a joint task offloading and resource allocation scheme is proposed for a parked-and-moving-vehicles-assisted MEC scenario consisting of multiple devices, parked vehicles, and moving vehicles covered by a Base Station (BS) equipped with an edge server. The tasks of the devices can be either offloaded to the BS or further offloaded from the BS to the vehicles. The service time that a moving vehicle can provide its task offloading service before it moves out of the coverage of the BS, are taken into account of our system model. The aim of our scheme it to minimize the total priority-weighted task processing delay for all the devices through offloading the tasks to the edge server or to the vehicles, allocating the wireless channels of the BS, and allocating the computing resource of the edge server and the vehicles. A generalized benders decomposition and reformulation linearization-based iterative algorithm is designed to obtain the optimal solution to the optimization problem, and a two-stage heuristic algorithm is also given to provide near-optimal solutions with low computational complexity. The simulation results demonstrate the superiority of our scheme in seven different scenarios by comparing it with three other schemes.},

  abstract     = {Social media traffic constitutes the highest percentage of Internet traffic. Such traffic is largely facilitated by mobile devices, which imposes a huge traffic load on backhaul links in 5G networks, and can in turn affect the quality of service. This traffic load can be alleviated by using vehicular networks as a traffic offloading platform. In particular, vehicles can act as a resourceful asset for edge caching, thus enabling data acquisition from nearby caching nodes rather than the remote backhaul servers. In this paper, we propose the Predictive Proactive Caching Framework (PPCF), which exploits the daily driving routine and predictable behavior of users to pre-cache the data at parked vehicles for the requesters to proactively acquire as they pass by. PPCF is composed of a cache placement module and a prediction module. The former aims at maximizing cache hits by assigning replicas to caching spots that yield maximum certainty in their spatiotemporal availability for requesters. To estimate such availability, the prediction module aims at making accurate travel time predictions by proposing the use of a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network trained using particle swarm optimization (PSO-LSTM). The predicted average travel time is then used to estimate a personalized travel time for users by considering their different driving behaviors. Extensive simulations demonstrate the ability of the proposed framework to achieve significant improvements in its targeted objectives compared to other prominent caching and prediction schemes in vehicular networks.},

As a security inspector, roaming authentication ensures that legitimate users can access the network securely. However, today’s roaming authentication protocols authenticate users with the help of centralized authentication servers, leading to the risk of the single point of failure and roaming fraud. The massive device access in 5G networks further exacerbates the losses when problems occur. In light of it, we propose a decentralized fraud-proof roaming authentication framework based on blockchain. We leverage smart contracts to implement a roaming authentication protocol, including user/AP registration, authentication, and revocation. For higher efficiency, we utilize the Bloom filter for the revocation process. In addition, we design an unforgeable and undeniable billing scheme based on hash chain technology. Security and performance analysis show that the proposed roaming authentication scheme can provide the required security features while incurring an acceptable authentication delay.},

  abstract     = {The stochastic properties of vehicles’ arrival process and the high-speed mobility of vehicles lead to dynamic changes in the topology of vehicular networks, affecting the data download experience of users, especially for large files. In this paper, a novel elastic-segment-based vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) cooperative strategy (ESCS) is proposed to reduce the impact of the density of vehicles on achievable throughput. The achievable throughput and optimal parameters of the proposed system are analyzed. The strategy takes the impact of the density of vehicles on the data download process as the key element for consideration. The density of vehicles has a great influence on the distance between vehicles, and further affects the transmission data rate. To solve the problem of low transmission data rate induced by the density of vehicles, the sizes of the elastic-segments are optimized according to the distance between the vehicles. Owing to the stochastic process of the distance between vehicles, it is particularly challenging to derive a closed-form expression for the achievable throughput. To tackle this problem, we develop a new V2I/V2V cooperative model to adapt to the general two-way lanes, analyze the distribution and mobility of vehicles, and derive a closed-form expression for the achievable throughput, as a function of V2I effective transmission range, the V2V effective transmission range, and other system parameters. We then optimize V2V effective connection range and the vehicle density to maximize the achievable throughput. Simulation results show that the proposed strategy significantly improves the throughput compared with the existing cooperative strategy, especially in the scenario of high vehicle density.},

  abstract     = {A well-designed carrier tracking loop in a receiver of the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is the premise of accurate positioning and navigation in an aircraft-based surveying and mapping system. To deal with the problems of Doppler estimation in high-dynamic maneuvers, the interest on maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE) is increasing among the academic community. Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) method is usually regarded as an effective and promising approach to obtain the solution of MLE, but the computation of Hessian matrix loads a great burden on the algorithm. Besides, a poor performance on convergency in final iterations is the common failing of LM implementations. To solve these problems, an LM method based on Gauss-Newton and a Quasi-Newton (QN) method based on Hessian approximation are derived, making the computation cost of Hessian decline from O(N) to O( 1 ) . Then, on the basis of these two methods, a closed carrier loop with adaptive LM-QN algorithm is further proposed which can switch between LM and QN adaptively according to a damping parameter. Besides, an ideal LM with super-linear convergence (SLM) is constructed and proved as a reference of the convergence analysis. Finally, through the analyses and experiments using aircraft data, the improvements on computation cost and convergence are verified. Compared with scalar tracking and vector tracking, results indicate a magnitude increase in the precision of LM-QN loop, even though more computation counts are needed by LM-QN.},

  abstract     = {Sparse code multiple access (SCMA), as a codebook-based non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technique, has received research attention in recent years. The codebook design problem for SCMA has also been studied to some extent since codebook choices are highly related to the system’s error rate performance. In this paper, we approach the SCMA codebook design problem by formulating an optimization problem to maximize the minimum Euclidean distance (MED) of superimposed codewords under power constraints. While SCMA codebooks with a larger MED are expected to obtain a better BER performance, no optimal SCMA codebook in terms of MED maximization, to the authors’ best knowledge, has been reported in the SCMA literature yet. In this paper, a new iterative algorithm based on alternating maximization with exact penalty is proposed for the MED maximization problem. The proposed algorithm, when supplied with appropriate initial points and parameters, achieves a set of codebooks of all users whose MED is larger than any previously reported results. A Lagrange dual problem is derived which provides an upper bound of MED of any set of codebooks. Even though there is still a nonzero gap between the achieved MED and the upper bound given by the dual problem, simulation results demonstrate clear advantages in error rate performances of the proposed set of codebooks over all existing ones not only in AWGN channels but also in some downlink scenarios that fit in 5G/NR applications, making it a good codebook candidate thereof. The proposed set of SCMA codebooks, however, are not shown to outperform existing ones in uplink channels or in the case where non-consecutive OFDMA subcarriers are used. The correctness and accuracy of error curves in the simulation results are further confirmed by the coincidences with the theoretical upper bounds of error rates derived for any given set of codebooks.},

This paper formulates beam alignment errors for the uniform linear array at the base station as a function of the link parameters by using the Cramér Rao lower bound of angle-of-arrival estimates and proposes a tractable array pattern approximation to better reflect the effects of such alignment errors. Utilizing stochastic geometry and the statistics of the Student’s t -distribution, a novel and robust analytical technique is developed to obtain the downlink SNR and rate coverage probabilities due to beam misalignment, assuming a single antenna at the user. We show that beam alignment errors significantly affect the achievable SNR and rate for non line-of-sight (NLOS)/distant users whereas the effect is negligible for LOS/nearby users. It is also illustrated that the effects of alignment errors cannot be mitigated only by increasing the number of antennas. We also show that our proposed array pattern approximation better captures the effects of beam alignment errors as compared to the widely used flat-top pattern.},

  abstract     = {Generalized quadrature spatial modulation (GQSM) seamlessly amalgamates the generalized spatial modulation (GSM), quadrature spatial modulation (QSM) and vertical Bell Laboratories layered space-time (V-BLAST) techniques. In contrast to traditional multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) schemes transmitting information bits only through the constellation defined on the complex plane, GQSM transmits additional information bits implicitly by selecting the transmit antenna (TA) activation pattern. The philosophy of QSM is that of separating the indices of the real and the imaginary parts of the transmit symbols, which increases the attainable throughput. In this paper, we analyze the inherent benefits of GQSM in terms of throughput. More specifically, we first derive the achievable rate expression of the recent GQSM scheme and unveil the condition for GQSM to approach the maximum rate. Furthermore, we compare the rate of the GQSM scheme to that of other transmission schemes and reveal the conditions for the GQSM’s maximum throughput to exceed that of the benchmark schemes. Simulation results show that when the number of TAs is 40 and quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) is adopted, the rate of the GQSM scheme may reach 150% of that of V-BLAST. Additionally, a pair of low-complexity detectors are conceived-one based on ordered successive interference cancellation (OSIC) and another one on the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates a wireless powered unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication network with backscatter and caching technologies. Specifically, we assume a self-energized UAV with a cache memory is deployed as a flying backscatter device (BD), term the UAV-enabled BD (UB), to relay the source’s signals to the destination. Whereas the source S can act as a wireless charging station or a base station to supply power or transmit information to the UB using the dynamic time splitting (DTS) method. The UAV utilizes its harvested energy for backscattering (i.e., passive communication) and transmit information (i.e., active communication) to the destination. In this context, we aim to maximize the total throughput by jointly optimizing the DTS ratio and the UB’s trajectory with caching capability at the UB. The formulation is troublesome to solve since it is a non-convex problem. To find solutions, we decompose the original problem into two sub-problems, whereas we first optimize the DTS ratio for a given UB’s trajectory and the UB’s trajectory optimization for a given DTS ratio. By using the KKT conditions, a closed-form expression for the optimal value of the DTS ratio is obtained, greatly reducing the computation time. Moreover, the solution of the second sub-problem can be acquired by adopting the successive convex approximation (SCA) technique. Consequently, an efficient alternating algorithm is proposed by leveraging the block coordinate descent (BCD) method. To show the advantages of the proposed BCD-based algorithm, we also provide the solution of the original problem applying the inner approximation (IA) method. Finally, the intensive numerical results demonstrate that our proposed schemes achieve significant throughput gain in comparison to the benchmark schemes.},

In practice, phase shifts at the base station and the IRSs are digitally controlled and have discrete values. The channel state information (CSI) feedback also has a limited rate. This work analyzes the spectral efficiency performance of an IRS based mmWave network in which the beamsteering codebooks are used for the passive precoding and analog precoding, and the zero-forcing precoder is used for digital precoding. To capture the features of mmWave channels and reflect the impact of passive and analog precoding, a channel correlation based codebook is employed to quantize the effective channels. Upper-bounds are derived for the spectral efficiency losses due to finite-resolution beamsteering codebooks and limited CSI feedback. It is found that the spectral efficiency loss due to finite-resolution beamsteering codebooks does not depend on the transmit power in large signal-to-noise ratio regimes, while the spectral efficiency loss due to limited CSI feedback increases with the transmit power. Then, the asymptotic performance is analyzed when the numbers of transmit antenna elements and reflecting elements go to infinity. Simulations verify the derivations and findings.},

  abstract     = {As more and more people choose high-speed rail (HSR) as a means of transportation for short trips, there is ever growing demand of high quality of multimedia services. With its rich spectrum resources, millimeter wave (mm-wave) communications can satisfy the high network capacity requirements for HSR. Also, it is possible for receivers (RXs) to be equipped with antenna arrays in mm-wave communication systems due to its short wavelength. However, as HSRs run with high speed, the received signal power (RSP) varies rapidly over a cell and it is the lowest at the edge of the cell compared to other locations. Consequently, it is necessary to conduct research on RX beamforming for HSR in mm-wave band to improve the quality of the received signal. In this paper, we focus on RX beamforming for a mm-wave train-ground communication system. To improve the RSP, we propose an effective RX beamforming scheme based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL), and develop a deep Q-network (DQN) algorithm to train and determine the optimal RX beam direction with the purpose of maximizing average RSP. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed scheme has better performance than the four baseline schemes in terms of average RSP at most positions on the railway.},

A random complex multiplicative factor comprehensively models the non-ideal nature of the power amplifier (PA), data converters (ADCs/DACs), and phase shifters (PSs) used in the transmitter radio frequency (RF) chain at the BS with the ideal mmWave channel. An effective noise term in the received signal with impairments is introduced, and the power of the same is derived. The effect of scattering of mmWave due to rainfall is taken into consideration. Two separate cases with the above-discussed impairments of (A) single user (SU) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system and (B) multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO) system are conceived. Both perfect and imperfect knowledge of the scattering parameters is considered. A linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) channel estimation with the above impairments at the BS in the presence of rainfall scattering is performed. For both SU-MIMO and MU-MIMO systems, the spectral efficiency (SE) is evaluated for different rainfall rates at two carrier frequencies, viz. 38 GHz and 75 GHz. The channel estimate’s mean square error (MSE) for ideal and hardware impaired systems is evaluated at various rainfall rates. The performance of channel estimation is evaluated with numerical simulation.},

In particular, we aim to optimize the bandwidth allocation to the sensing function and the communication function of the JSC nodes. To improve the allocation efficiency while benefiting the spatial diversity advantage of the DJSC systems, the objective is to maximize the sum of sensing performances, i.e., estimation rates, communication performances, i.e., communication data rates, and fairness of all the users.

To reach the green design target in the concept of wireless communication networks, this paper maximizes the system’s energy efficiency (EE) using joint system-level optimization. First, the closed-form expressions of the harvested energy and achievable data rate are first derived. Then, we formulated the EE maximization problem by jointly optimizing user equipment (UE) pilot transmission time allocation, the received PS ratios, a base station (BS) transmit power allocation, and a number of BS antennas while considering the minimum data rate as user’s quality-of-service (QoS) requirement and the maximum BS power transmission constraint. However, the formulated EE maximization problem is non-convex and non-linear which is difficult to solve. Hence, we propose an efficient low-complex alternative optimization (LCAO) algorithm to solve the non-convex problem iteratively with an acceptable computational complexity level. Simulation results are provided to evaluate the derived closed-form expressions and validate the proposed LCAO algorithm’s efficiency. The optimality, convergence, and complexity of the LCAO algorithm are analytically investigated. Results indicate that the proposed LCAO algorithm outperforms the equal power allocation (EPA) scheme by 15% better EE gain and 4% better than the max-min fairness scheme when the BS power transmission capacity is higher than 3 (Watt).},

  abstract     = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) control information delivery is a critical communication with stringent requirements in terms of reliability and latency. In this context, link adaptation plays an essential role in the fulfillment of the required performance in terms of decode error probability and delay. Link adaptation is usually based on channel quality indicator (CQI) feedback information from the user equipment that should represent the current state of the channel. However, measurement, scheduling and processing delays introduce a CQI aging effect, that is a mismatch between the current channel state and its CQI representation. Using outdated CQI values may lead to the selection of a wrong modulation and coding scheme, with a detrimental effect on performance. This is particularly relevant in ultra reliable and low latency communications (URLLC), where the control of the reliability can be negatively impacted, and it is more evident when the channel is fast varying as the case of UAVs. This paper analyzes the effects of CQI aging on URLLCs, considering transmissions under the finite blocklength regime, that characterizes such communications type. A deep learning approach is investigated to predict the next CQI from the knowledge of past reports, and performance in terms of decode error probability and throughput is given. The results show the benefit of CQI proposed prediction mechanism also in comparison with previously proposed methods.},

In this paper, a hybrid satellite-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) relay network (HSURN) is proposed where the UAV relays (URs) employ CoMP transmission to serve the terrestrial users (UEs). Furthermore, all UEs associated with the CoMP-URs form a single NOMA cluster. For this model, an optimization problem is formulated subject to the minimum quality of services (QoSs) requirements of the UEs, transmission power budgets and, successive interference cancellation (SIC), to select URs and allocate their transmission powers for the energy efficiency (EE) maximization. With this insight, first, a computationally efficient sub-optimal UR selection scheme is proposed. Then, the powers are allocated to the selected URs via the Lagrange multipliers optimization (LMO) method. Due to the non-convex nature of the considered problem, it is relatively difficult to be solved. Hence, a metaheuristic teaching-learning-based optimization (TLBO) algorithm is employed to achieve an efficient solution. Simulation results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed sub-optimal relay selection scheme and the TLBO-based power allocation method compared to the LMO conventional method. Besides, the obtained results also reveal that the CoMP-NOMA transmission in the proposed scenario significantly improves the spectral efficiency (SE) and outage probability (OP) of the system compared to non-comp NOMA transmission case.},

To address this issue, two novel fixed low complexity MPA detectors are proposed by utilizing the sparse feature of codewords, which are based on the serial schedule strategy in order to accelerate their convergence.

To further improve the bit error ratio (BER) performance, an improved MDMPA (IMDMPA) is proposed, in which, the VNs associated with the target user are always allowed to participate in the iterative propagation of message. An efficient linear squares (LS) channel estimation scheme is also derived based on block pilots by stacking all the received signals at the same subcarrier together. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed MDMPA and IMDMPA detectors significantly reduce the computational complexity of the original MPA, but with comparable decoding capabilities, and the proposed LS channel estimator can closely approach the corresponding lower bound over frequency selective channels.},

In this way, evaluating the statistical properties of the air-to-ground (AtG) channel in different built-up propagation environments with regard to the operating frequency is crucial for performance analysis of airborne platform-assisted communications. In this paper, we construct a framework for the line-of-sight (LoS) probability based on the intrusion ratio of obstacles within the first Fresnel zone, yielding an analytical expression for the LoS probability that is sensitive to the operating frequency, the transmitter and receiver heights, the horizontal distance between them, and three other parameters depicting the statistical properties of the urban environment. The model developed is accurate enough to capture scattering mechanisms such as reflection and diffraction, while being sufficiently flexible mathematically to allow, based for instance on powerful analytical tools such as stochastic geometry, a seamless and physically meaningful system-level performance evaluation of modern wireless networks in the presence of airborne platforms.},

  abstract     = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) play a critical role for 5 G/B5G communications. In this paper, we investigate the physical layer security issue for ground transmissions with the help of a UAV. Specifically, we consider the scenario without direct transmissions and employ the UAV as a mobile relay to amplify and forward the confidential information. Meanwhile, the receiver transmits cooperative jamming attempting to disrupt eavesdropping. We investigate the UAV deployment and receiver jamming strategy jointly for the optimized secrecy rate, while considering the channel uncertainties. In particular, for the case of complete channel state information (CSI), the jamming power is obtained by bi-section search, and we propose a data-trained deep neural network (DNN) to approximate the optimal UAV deployment. Meanwhile, for the case with partial CSI, we design a deep Q network (DQN) to learn the optimal UAV deployment, due to the increased complexity to determine the jamming strategy with channel statistics. Simulation results demonstrate that both the learned DQN and trained DNN model effectively approximate the optimal deployment of the UAV. Moreover, compared with the baselines, our proposal significantly improves the security performance of legitimate transmissions.},

  abstract     = {A forward error correction (FEC) and unity-rate coded (URC) autoencoder (AE)-assisted communication system is proposed for the first time, which relies on soft iterative decoding for attaining a vanishingly low error probability. The AE-demapper is specifically designed for directly calculating the extrinsic logarithmic likelihood ratios (LLRs), which can be directly entered into the URC decoder for soft iterative decoding. This avoids the potential degradation due to the conversion of symbol probabilities to bit LLRs. A comprehensive capacity analysis of the AE is performed, which demonstrates the capacity advantage of the AE-aided constellation design over its conventional quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM)/ phase shift keying (PSK) counterpart. Furthermore, we carry out its EXtrinsic Information Transfer (EXIT) chart analysis, which indicates that as a benefit of our URC, the EXIT curve always reaches the [1,1] point of perfect convergence, leading to a vanishingly low error probability. More explicitly, our bit error ratio (BER) and block error ratio (BLER) results demonstrate that the proposed FEC-URC-AE system achieves significant iterative gains both in additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and Rayleigh channels, outperforming both its model-based FEC-AE and its conventional coded QAM/QPSK counterparts.},

  abstract     = {Different from conventional reflecting-only metasurfaces, intelligent omni-surfaces (IOSs) are capable of reflecting and transmitting the received signals simultaneously. As such, users located at the both sides of IOSs can be served efficiently. In this paper, a novel IOS-enhanced aerial secure offloading system is proposed in the presence of multiple ground eavesdroppers. Specifically, the IOS is adopted to prevent information leakage, improve legitimate reception quality and expand the security deployment range of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). To maximize the secrecy energy efficiency (SEE) of the considered system, a non-convex resource allocation problem is formulated by allocating computing frequency, determining offloading strategy, controlling transmit power, designing phase shifts, and deploying UAV locations. The formulated problem is non-trivial and challenging to be solved directly due to the highly coupled variables. To tackle this issue, the alternating optimization technique is invoked to decouple the original one into five subproblems, and then the computing and communication settings are alternatively optimized using a low complexity iterative algorithm. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that: i) In terms of the SEE performance, our IOS-enhanced aerial secure offloading system significantly outperforms the benchmark schemes; ii) Compared with reflecting-only surfaces, IOSs can take full advantage of the flexible deployment ability of UAVs, such that their secure offloading space can be considerably expanded.},

In this paper, we present a novel secure UAV-assisted mobile relaying system operating at THz bands for data acquisition from multiple ground user equipments (UEs) towards a destination. We assume that the UAV-mounted relay may act, besides providing relaying services, as a potential eavesdropper called the untrusted UAV-relay (UUR). To safeguard end-to-end communications, we present a secure two-phase transmission strategy with cooperative jamming. Then, we devise an optimization framework in terms of a new measure &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$-$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; secrecy energy efficiency (SEE), defined as the ratio of achievable average secrecy rate to average system power consumption, which enables us to obtain the best possible security level while taking UUR’s inherent flight power limitation into account. For the sake of quality of service fairness amongst all the UEs, we aim to maximize the minimum SEE (MSEE) performance via the joint design of key system parameters, including UUR’s trajectory and velocity, communication scheduling, and network power allocation. Since the formulated problem is a mixed-integer nonconvex optimization and computationally intractable, we decouple it into four subproblems and propose alternative algorithms to solve it efficiently via greedy/sequential block successive convex approximation and non-linear fractional programming techniques. Numerical results demonstrate significant MSEE performance improvement of our designs compared to other known benchmarks.},

However, performing FL tasks may not be feasible due to the unavailability of terrestrial communications and the battery limitation of FL users. To address these issues, we make use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and wireless powered communications (WPC) for FL networks. In order to enable sustainable FL solutions, the UAV equipped with edge computing and WPC capabilities is deployed as an aerial energy source as well as an aerial server to perform FL tasks. We propose a joint algorithm of UAV placement, power control, transmission time, model accuracy, bandwidth allocation, and computing resources, namely energy-efficient FL (E2FL), aiming at minimizing the total energy consumption of the aerial server and users. The E2FL overcomes the original nonconvex problem by an efficient algorithm. We show that sustainable FL solutions can be provided via UAV-enabled WPC through various simulation results. Moreover, the outperformance of E2FL in terms of energy efficiency over several benchmarks emphasizes the need for a joint resource allocation framework rather than optimizing a subset of optimization factors.},

  abstract     = {The new generation of communication technologies are constantly being pushed to meet a diverse range of user requirements such as high data rate, low power consumption, very low latency, very high reliability and broad availability. To address all these demands, fifth generation (5G) radio access technologies have been extended into a wide range of new services. However, there are still only a limited number of applications for radio frequency (RF) based wireless communications inside aircraft cabins that comply with the 5G vision. Potential interference and safety issues in on-board wireless communications pose significant deployment challenges. By transforming each reading light into an optical wireless access point (AP), light-fidelity (LiFi), could provide seamless on-board connectivity in dense cabin environments without RF interference. Furthermore, the utilization of available reading lights allows for a relatively simple, cost-effective deployment with the high energy and spectral efficiency. To successfully implement the aeronautical cabin LiFi applications, comprehensive optical channel characterization is required. In this paper, we propose a novel Monte Carlo ray-tracing (MCRT) channel modelling technique to capture the details of in-flight LiFi links. Accordingly, a realistic channel simulator, which takes the cabin models, interior elements and measurement based optical source, receiver, surface material characteristics into account is developed. The effect of the operation wavelength, cabin model accuracy and user terminal mobility on the optical channel conditions is also investigated. As a final step, the on-board direct-current biased optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (DCO-OFDM) performance is evaluated by using obtained in-flight LiFi channels. Numerical results show that the location of a mobile terminal and accurate aircraft cabin modelling yield as much as 12 and 2 dB performance difference, respectively.},

Compared to its conventional symmetric-PM hybrid-magnetic-circuit (SH) counterpart, the proposed design benefits from the reduced usage of high coercive force (HCF) rare-earth magnet, alleviating the magnetic saturation to improve the flux regulation (FR) range, while the excellent load demagnetization withstand (LDW) capability can be still maintained. The topology evolution and operating principle of the proposed machine are introduced and described, respectively. Then, based on the combination of the magnetic equivalent circuit (MEC) method and Schwarz-Christoffel (SC) transformation, a hybrid analytical model is established to quantitatively reveal the mechanism of FR range extension, and facilitate the initial design of the machine. The electromagnetic characteristics of the proposed machine under different magnetization states (MSs) are investigated and compared with those of the conventional SH counterpart.

  abstract     = {The performance of train communication network (TCN) is one of the most important factors to ensure the safety of train operation, and there is a lack of research for the TCN performance currently. To master the state of TCN, a combined method to evaluate and predict the TCN performance is proposed in the paper. First, we select appropriate evaluation indexes and determine their comprehensive weights. Then, the evaluation model of TCN performance is established based on a multidimensional normal cloud model combined with weights. According to the evaluation results, the artificial neural network (ANN) is used to predict the TCN performance to realize the real-time evaluation. Finally, the effectiveness of the evaluation and prediction model of TCN performance is verified by the simulation result, which is obtained from the simulation platform of TCN. The results show that service quality for TCN has been effectively improved, which provides a theoretical reference for evaluation and prediction of TCN performance.},

  abstract     = {Due to the complexity of driving conditions and the increase of the driving range of electric two-wheelers and three-wheelers vehicles, the power battery string is in a long-period unbalanced discharge state, which affects the power output and even causes certain safety risks. A compact-size multi-winding transformer-based discharge equalizer is proposed to solve these problems and minimize the impact on the system volume by sharing the primary inductor with a boost discharger. When the boost converter is powering a load, the multi-winding transformer equalizer is driven by utilizing the square wave voltage generated on the inductor in the boost converter and produces multiple identical voltage levels to achieve voltage balance. Thus, the automatic balance can be achieved with only one winding and one diode for each module. An experimental prototype containing four batteries was established to verify the feasibility of the proposed method. Moreover, a quantitative comparison shows the proposed method obtain a more compact-size equalizer because of no need for a separate transformer, compared with the traditional equalization method based on the transformer.},

In this paper, the thermofluid behaviors of a 7-kW 4000-rpm AF-PMSM are numerically investigated based on a coupled model, and the computations are validated by thermal tests performed on the AF-PMSM prototype. To enhance the heat dissipation capacity of the rotor components, it is proposed a self-circulated oil hermetically cooling system, for which the cooling liquid circulates in a hollow shaft. During operation, the oil flow driven by the centrifugal blades forms a closed oil circuit, and can create an effective heat flow path from the hot areas to the cold regions. The oil cooling system is employed in the AF-PMSM to effectively maintain, and evenly distribute, the motor temperature rise. The cooling effectiveness is proved by fluid flow and thermal coupled analyses. To further improve the heat dissipation capacity, the self-circulated oil-cooling structure is modified based on the calculated fluid flow distribution. Finally, the structural parameters are optimized by Taguchi method to minimize both the temperature rise and the rotor weight increment, and the optimization results are numerically and experimentally validated.},

The aim of the introduced problem is to minimize a summation of component cost and operational cost with consideration of fuel cell (FC) degradation and cycle life of energy buffer. We propose to decompose the problem into two sub-problems that are solved by sequential convex programming. The delivered power satisfies a cumulative distribution function of the wheel power demand, while the truck can still traverse driving cycles with a similar speed and travel time without delivering unnecessarily high power. This allows to downsize powertrain components, including electric machine, FC and energy buffer. A case study considering different energy buffer technologies, including supercapacitor (SC), lithium-ion battery (LiB), and lithium-ion capacitor (LiC) is investigated in a set of trucking applications, i.e. urban delivery, regional delivery, construction, and long-haul. Results show that the power rating of the electric machine is drastically reduced when the delivered power is satisfied in a probabilistic sense. Moreover, the configuration with LiB as the energy buffer has the lowest expense but the truck with LiC can carry more payload.},

The phase voltage of D+ alternator is usually connected as auxiliary output, such as techometer; however, its wiring may short to ground through the vehicle frame due to the damage of the isolation. This would result in severe thermal events and safety issues. In this paper, a novel phase fault diagnose and protection method is proposed to prevent the thermal event and safety issue for phase auxiliary output fault in D+ alternator system of heavy duty vehicles. The method detects the voltage dip from D+ terminal without extra wiring or external components. Besides, prior art issues such as complex design, high noise sensitivity, and higher cost can be solved. The analysis and LTSpice simulation of D+ voltages in normal conditions and fault conditions set the foundation and parameter design for the proposed method. The experimental platform with a three-phase D+ alternator verified that the proposed method can diagnose and protect the ground fault while the alternator is generating power with rotating speed ranging from 2000 to 6000 rpm, and the AVR can stop the alternator output to prevent the thermal event. As soon as the fault is removed, the AVR can automatically reboot the system and return to a normal operation mode.},

To solve this problem, an adaptive attention-based bidirectional stateful encoder-decoder model is proposed for BER disturbances prediction. By persistently transferring the forward and backward states in a batch-to-batch mapping manner, the bidirectional stateful encoder can enhance the capture ability for disturbances. Additionally, an adaptive stateful decoder is used to dynamically synthesize the temporal correlation and contextual summarization to reduce the error accumulation in long-term forecasting. Through effective disturbance discrimination and accumulative error elimination, the proposed model can improve the overall prediction accuracy for BER disturbances.

The INS/odometer integration approach can dramatically improve the navigation performances compared with the standalone INS approach, however its positioning error is still gradually accumulating with time because of lacking external position correction. This paper proposes an approach to aid the INS/odometer integration by using vision positioning, where a UAV is used to carry the vision camera and helps to realize the positioning of the vehicle by image matching. The UAV vision positioning acts a role like GNSS and provides constant position correction for INS/odometer integration. A dual-rate Kalman filter is proposed and utilized to realize the data fusing of vision, INS and odometer. Simulation and filed tests show that the proposed approach can dramatically improve the autonomous navigation performances for land vehicles.},

Aiming to improve the stability of vehicles matching with MEW, this paper proposes an integrated control strategy that combines the active front steering and the active suspension systems. The integrated controller consists of feed-forward and feedback controllers. Firstly, the differential flatness system of the vehicle is constructed concerning the coupling among yaw, lateral, and roll motion. And the flatness based feed-forward control inputs of the desired front wheel angle and active roll moment are derived. At the same time, the backstepping-adaptive feedback controllers for yaw rate and roll angle are designed. Then, the feed-forward and feedback controllers are coordinated and their weight coefficients are adjusted according to the sideslip angle. Furthermore, this paper also adopts a nonlinear disturbance observer to estimate the vertical load of MEW. The influence of the vertical load is fully considered when estimating the equivalent cornering stiffness of each MEW, so as to realize the online adjustment of the controller parameters. Finally, the maneuver tests of step input steering and double lane change are simulated, respectively. The results show that the proposed control strategy yields a better control effect than the fuzzy-PID controller, and the performance of the vehicle matching with MEW has been significantly improved.},

In this study, a novel energy-regenerative semiactive secondary suspension system of HSTs and the corresponding control strategy, which have not been reported in the literature, were developed using the emerging electromagnetic damper cum energy harvester (EMDEH) with both vibration control and energy harvesting functions. The developed EMDEH can provide continuously tunable damping coefficients by semiactively controlling the duty cycle of an energy harvesting circuit. The mechanical behavior and energy performance of a full-scale EMDEH prototype were experimentally characterized via cyclic tests. An EMDEH simulation model was developed and verified through comparison with experimental results. A semiactive control strategy was designed to track the target force generated by a Linear–Quadratic–Gaussian (LQG) controller. Numerical simulations revealed that the semiactive EMDEH (SEMDEH) could reduce the car body vibration more effectively than the traditional passive dampers and fixed-duty-cycle EMDEH (FEMDEH) at train speeds of 200–350 km/h. Moreover, although the FEMDEH generated a greater power than the SEMDEH in the aforementioned train speed range, the SEMDEH could still generate powers of 25.89–153.19 W.},

To construct the strategy, a self-organizing map neural-network was utilized to recognize and group the speed patterns. The driving cycles corresponding to these speed patterns were reconstructed for solving the corresponding optimal equivalent factors. When applying the strategy on the road, the current vehicle speed pattern is recognized by using the historical vehicle speed data, and the corresponding optimal equivalent factor is adopted based on that pattern. Furthermore, to constrain the battery state of charge (SOC) to avoid exceeding the allowable values and to consider the hysteresis of engine starting, a fuzzy logic controller was used to dynamically adjust the minimum engine operation time. The simulated results indicated that the proposed ECMS improved the vehicle fuel economy by 7.87% and 6.23% over the conventional ECMS and the rule-based single-point strategy, respectively. Furthermore, the peak battery charging-current was reduced by 42.94% and 27.73%, and the peak discharging-current by 62.19% and 56.97%, respectively.

Precise stop control is an important function because trains stopping outside of the specification adversely affect passenger safety and punctuality of operation schedule. It is difficult to achieve high accuracy and precision for an ATO since trains are heavy, train control feedback loops involve several steps that cause various levels of time delay, and the actuation has nonlinear characteristics. Moreover, although existing studies propose algorithms to overcome some of the said challenges, few include experimental validations because access to the experimental environment is extremely limited.

In redundant MINS, the output of the redundant gyroscopes is estimated by the improved virtual gyro algorithm based on improved current statistical model and interacting multiple model Kalman filter (ICS-IMMKF). The weighted fusion algorithm is used to fuse the redundant accelerometer information, thus the virtual micro inertial navigation system (Virtual-MINS) is obtained. In the process of vehicle positioning based on virtual MINS, the centripetal acceleration is solved based on the kinematic constraints. Combined with the navigation information of Virtual-MINS and odometer (OD), the difference of centripetal acceleration and velocity are used as observation, and a Virtual-MINS/OD positioning algorithm based on kinematic nonholonomic constraints (NHC/Virtual-MINS/OD) is proposed. The simulation results show that the ICS-IMMKF algorithm can achieve high precision fusion of redundant gyro. In the test, azimuth maneuver is not constrained by the ground, therefore the ICS-IMMKF algorithm can obtain the azimuth rate with high precision. The experimental results show that the root mean square (RMS) of the East and North positioning errors, as well as the RMS of pitch, roll and azimuth estimation error based on the NHC/Virtual-MINS/ OD positioning algorithm are reduced to 34.15%, 22.65%, 55.11%, 64.93% and 41.37% of the NHC/#1-MINS/OD positioning algorithm, respectively.

Moreover, this study analyzes the difference in nonlinear disturbance produced by a state estimator under two conditions. The criteria for the nonlinear disturbance of the estimator are determined on the basis of the analysis. With such criteria and different types of nonlinear disturbance, an estimation strategy for multimodel information fusion under all working conditions is proposed to accurately estimate the classification of forward low-speed, high-speed, and reverse conditions. A genetic algorithm is used to optimize the proposed state estimation algorithm, which improves the accuracy at a low speed and the antinoise capability of high-speed driving and reversing. The estimation strategy for different speeds and ranges of the hitch angle is simulated and verified through the cosimulation of TruckSim and MATLAB/Simulink. Lastly, the state estimation strategy is used in the application layer to design a model predictive linear reversing controller for a semitrailer train to verify the improvement of the control effect of the estimation strategy. Simulation results show that the proposed multimodel information fusion estimation strategy can accurately estimate the hitch angle under all working conditions and greatly improve the control effect of linear reversing trajectory tracking of a semitrailer train in the application layer.},

  abstract     = {Predicting individual vehicles’ future locations is of great significance in location-based services. Regularity and preference are two predominant features of individual vehicles for location prediction. However, these two features cannot be adequately captured with existing models based on raw trajectories, due to their oversimplified view. Modeling regularity and preference entails the following challenges: 1) how to design features to accurately reflect regularity and preference with raw trajectories; and 2) how to capture regularity and preference effectively based on sparse travel behaviors. To that end, first, we design four features to represent travel regularity and preference by conducting an in-depth correlation analysis on individual vehicle trajectories. Then, we incorporate these four features in context and propose a deep neural network to jointly capture regularity and preference via explicitly retrieving the context. Specifically, our proposed model extends LSTM with memory to store all the output hidden states, which provides long-term information for retrieval to overcome the vanishing sequential dependency in sparse scenarios. To fully capture regularity and preference for prediction, a backtracking attention mechanism is designed to aggregate all the relevant historical hidden states in memory with different weights based on the regularity and preference similarity. The weighted aggregation produces a new hidden state, which is used for the final prediction. Experiments on three real-world vehicle trajectory datasets containing over 10,000 individual vehicles show that our proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art models by 7%–10% in terms of prediction accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Benefitting from the outstanding capabilities of intelligent controlling and prediction, federated learning (FL) has been widely applied in Internet of Vehicle (IoV). However, applying FL into fog-computing-based IoV still suffers from two crucial problems: (i) how to achieve the privacy-preserving FL under the flexible architecture of fog computing with no assistance of cloud server, and (ii) how to guarantee the privacy-preserving FL to perform with high efficiency and low overhead in fog-computing settings. For addressing the above issues, we propose a practical framework, named Galaxy , the first of its kind in the regime of privacy-preserving FL under the setting of non-cloud-assisted fog computing. Based on the secure multi-party computation (MPC) technology, our framework satisfies the &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\boldsymbol{(T,N)}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -threshold property, permitting &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\boldsymbol{N}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; (a scalable number) fog nodes to cooperate with multiple users for implementing privacy-preserving FL, while resisting the collusion up to &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\boldsymbol{T}-\boldsymbol{1}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; fog nodes, and being robust to at most &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\boldsymbol{N}-\boldsymbol{T}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; fog nodes simultaneously dropping out. Besides, considering the practical scenario that low-quality data may negatively impair the FL model convergence, our scheme can handle users’ low-quality data while protecting all user-related information under our secure framework. Based on the above superior properties, our scheme can perform with high scalability, high processing efficiency, and low resource overhead, being practical for fog-computing-based IoV. Extensive experiment results demonstrate our scheme with high-level performance.},

  abstract     = {In an Internet of Vehicle (IoV) system, federated learning (FL) is a new approach to process real-time vehicle data in a distributed way, which can improve the driving experience and service quality. However, due to the high mobility and uncertainty of vehicles, the existing federated learning protocols are difficult to meet the full requirements from an IoV system, such as efficient resource allocation, high precision learning, and fast convergence of learning algorithm. To solve the above problems, in this paper, we propose a semi-synchronous federated learning (Semi-SynFed) protocol, to improve the performance of machine learning at Internet of Vehicles. In Semi-SynFed, we first select appropriate nodes to participate the aggregation by its computing capacity, network capacity and learning value of training samples. Meanwhile, the dynamic waiting time technique is designed to adjust the server waiting time at each round dynamically, which makes federated learning process work much more efficient. Finally, a dynamic aggregation scheme is designed to aggregate model parameters in an asynchronous way. To evaluate the reliability of Semi-SynFed, we establish a simulation of IoVs based on the real world data. In the comparative experiments, the results show that the Semi-SynFed outperforms the existing federated learning protocols in terms of convergence speed and resource consumption.},

More precisely, as opposed to static event-triggered communication mechanisms, a dynamic event-triggered communication mechanism (DECM) is devised to schedule the connected communications while avoiding the unnecessary information exchanges among UAVs, which reduces the communication burden and saves on the network resources. Meanwhile, the Zeno phenomenon is excluded in terms of guaranteeing that the period between two consecutive triggering communication is lower bounded by a positive constant. Moreover, the actuator fault, external disturbance as well as model uncertainty are treated as the lumped disturbances and estimated via the disturbance observer technique. By strict Lyapunov arguments, all closed-loop signals are proved to be uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) and the tracking errors of velocity and attitude converge to a residual set around origin. Finally, simulation results are presented to illustrate the validity and superiority of proposed event-based control scheme.},

Specifically, the proposed scheme designs a novel state representation mechanism, where the sensing data goes through the attention layer and the convolutional neural network (CNN) layer sequentially. The attention layer focuses on extracting the most important local information and then CNN layer takes a broad view to comprehensively consider the global information for a better representation. Furthermore, the proposed scheme jointly learns decision-making and motion-controlling, therefore, the relevance of these two modules is implicitly considered, which helps to achieve a better autonomous driving policy. Extensive simulation results show that the proposed scheme is better than classic control methods and some RL methods in terms of safety, velocity, etc. We also demonstrate the respective functions of the attention layer and the CNN layer through ablation studies. Finally, we construct a traffic scene with a real autonomous vehicle, and verified the feasibility of the proposed scheme.},

Tackling such challenges through customized edge computing services is the critical research in 6G Vehicle-to-Everything (6G-V2X) communication. V2X contributes detailed information about the current navigation of vehicles, automatic payments for toll roads, parking fees and other services. With the countless, unique, and personalized service requirements of AVs over computation-intensive applications, exploring the edge resources for the excellent Quality of Service (QoS) provision is the greatest concern. This paper proposes a Federated Learning and edge Cache-assisted Cybertwin (FLCC) framework for personalized service provision in 6G-V2X. Integration of cybertwin in 6G enables the connectivity of the physical system to the digital realm, allowing for adequate instantaneous wireless access. The FLCC jointly considers the edge cooperation and optimizations through the proposed Federated Multi-agent Deep Reinforcement Learning based (FM-DRL) algorithm. The FM-DRL algorithm balances the FLCC’s learning accuracy. It minimizes the time and cost by taking the factors such as cybertwin association, training data batch size, and bandwidth. Finally, caching is performed using the Federated Reinforcement Learning-based Edge Caching (FREC) algorithm to obtain the desired datasets required that train the model for providing personalized 6G-V2X services for the AVs. Numerical studies and simulation results reveal that the proposed system outperforms the baseline learning approaches by 17.6%.},

In this paper, we propose a cybertwin-driven learning-based transmission scheduling mechanism for software-defined vehicular networks, which can adaptively select/adjust transmission control methods, i.e., loss-based, delay-based and hybrid ones, to suit to the time-varying network environment. In particular, we first analyze the dynamic network characteristics of three realistic vehicular network scenarios in terms of network throughput, round-trip time (RTT) and RTT jitter. Furthermore, we propose a novel transmission scheduling model and formulate the SDVN transmission scheduling issue as a linear programming problem. To obtain the optimized scheduling policies and guarantee the effectiveness of transmission control, we further propose a Cybertwin-driven and Deep Reinforcement Learning based transmission control solution (TcpCDRL). Specifically, TcpCDRL is featured with: (i) using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to adaptively adjust transmission control policy, (ii) using cybertwin-driven transmission controlling to improve the policy-making effectiveness and timeliness.

  abstract     = {Roadside Unit (RSU) plays an important role in Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) service on the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). Due to the limitation of the existing network architecture, the RSU management technology either cannot fulfill the time location-varying service demands or consumes a large number of resource to cover the interested area. To mitigate the gap between the stringent V2X requirements and the limited available resource, a cybertwin-based IoV architecture is proposed to facilitate the RSU management and achieve always-on V2X services. Two types of RSUs, i.e., static RSU (sRSU) and mobile RSU (mRSU), are applied in infrastructure-assisted V2X communications. To evaluate the performance of cybertwin-based RSU deployment and scheduling, the utility maximization problem with coverage constraints is formulated. A three-stage hybrid RSU management strategy is proposed considering the different granularity of service loads. First, sRSUs are deployed to satisfy the basic service demands in different areas. Second, mRSUs are flexibly selected and managed to adapt to real-time variations of service loads. Finally, the RSUs are scheduled based on the real-time load prediction. The case study of Wuxi city illustrates that the proposed solution outperforms the existing strategy in terms of the deployment utility, response ratio, and adaptiveness to demand dynamics.},

  abstract     = {With the development of 6G wireless communication technologies, various resource-intensive and delay-sensitive vehicle application tasks are generated. These application tasks can be offloaded to Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) which deploys computing resources at the edge of networks. Besides, the recent proposed Cybertwin, as the digital representation of the complicated physical end-systems, can help the terminals obtain the required services from networks. Vehicles enabled by Cybertwin can offload their tasks to MEC and achieve better performance. In this paper, we focus on the study of a hybrid energy-powered multi-server MEC system with Cybertwin. Vehicles enabled by Cybertwin and edge servers send the current network status and unprocessed vehicle application tasks to the macro base station (MBS) to achieve the better allocation of resources. Energy harvesting (EH) devices are deployed on edge servers to form a “green energy-grid” hybrid energy supply model. We formulate a stochastic offloading optimization problem, and the goal is to minimize the system cost. The stochastic optimization problem is decomposed into three sub-problems. Then, we design an efficient multi-vehicle task offloading (EMT) algorithm to achieve the trade-off between system cost and task queue length. Theoretical analysis shows that EMT algorithm can optimize the total cost of the MEC system and guarantee the system performance. According to experimental evaluation, we verify the performance of the EMT algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Cybertwin is a promising networking paradigm that supports complex wireless interconnectivity and enhances reliable communications by using edge capability in different applications. However, the computation-heavy phased-array weight vector generation is the significant barrier for the implementation of physical layer security (PLS) for millimeter-wave (MMWV) communications in cybertwin-driven scenarios, like vehicle-to-everything (V2X) applications. In this paper, we propose a low-complexity phased-array PLS scheme in MMWV wireless communications for cybertwin-driven V2X applications. The computational complexity is much reduced in a cost-effective way, where the transmitting phased-array weight vectors are updated at the symbol rate by randomly swapping the pre-calculated initial weight vector elements instead of directly calculating a new weight vector. Performance evaluation shows the proposed scheme possesses a lower computational complexity than the compared PLS schemes. The simulation demonstrates that the constellations are scrambled at undesired directions, while the constellation at target direction remains clear and constant. Thus, the communication secrecy is preserved for the receiver at the target direction in cybertwin-driven vehicular communications. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves good security performances in terms of symbol error rate (SER) and secrecy outage probability.},

Particularly, considering the channel similarity between different satellite links versus the randomness difference in terrestrial links, it is challenging to reach the secure transmission in satellite and terrestrial links independently with limited resources. Considering the information exchange in the cybertwin space can support an information sharing between such physical entities, the secure transmission design by using the heterogeneous satellite-terrestrial resources can be conducted from a global perspective. With the channel feedback information of vehicles gathered at the cybertwin, the co-channel interference caused by the spectrum sharing is leveraged to assist the implementation of secure transmissions in the integrated satellite-terrestrial vehicle network. Specifically, the problems of maximizing the secrecy rate of satellite-to-vehicle link and the terrestrial BS-to-vehicle link are formulated, respectively. To solve such two problems, we propose two corresponding beamforming optimization approaches, where semi-definite relaxation (SDR) and semi-definite programming (SDP) are adopted due to the non-convexity. In addition, the tightness of SDR is proved and the complexity of proposed approaches is also analyzed. Finally, extensive numerical simulations are carried out and results show the effectiveness of our proposed approach.},

To tackle the conflict between the resource-hungry V2X applications and the resource-constrained vehicles, most works focus on the computation offloading problem, which is significant to V2X applications by bringing computation tasks from the vehicles to the edge or cloud infrastructure. However, the dynamic network conditions caused by the mobility of vehicles will bring task migration and huge additional costs, resulting in poor latency performance. Motivated by the aforementioned problem, a traffic routing-based computation offloading scheme in cybertwin-driven IoV for V2X applications is proposed, in which cybertwin represents the network hardware devices and the network software functions. Moreover, according to the cybertwin-driven IoV network architecture, the traffic routing-based computation offloading problem is formulated. Finally, to avoid the inconsistency between the data transmission direction and the vehicle’s movement direction, the enhanced Heterogeneous Earliest Finish Time (eHEFT) algorithm is designed, which introduces the gradient routing into the traditional HEFT algorithm. Performance evaluation results validate that the proposed joint optimization scheme is indeed capable of reducing latency.},

To deal with diverse computation tasks, we explore a mixed-offloading paradigm to support the coexistence of partial and binary offloading modes. Specifically, devices harvest energy from an access point (AP) via wireless power transfer (WPT) and utilize the harvested energy to execute their computation tasks using partial or binary offloading. Based on a practical non-linear energy harvesting model, a residual energy maximization problem is formulated by jointly optimizing the transmit power of the AP, the offloading power of devices, the time allocation on WPT and task offloading, and the task partitions and the binary offloading decisions of devices, which turn out to be a non-convex mixed-integer non-linear programming problem. Thus, we develop an efficient dual-layer optimization algorithm by decomposing the optimization problem into an inner and outer layer structure that aims to obtain resource allocation and offloading decisions.

Closed-form expressions for the average block error rate (BLER) with random and optimal phase shifts are derived. To gain some useful insights, an asymptotic analysis is carried out, based on which the diversity gain is achieved. Numerical results show that, at high signal-to-noise ratio, users with random phase shift achieve significant performance improvements in the performance gap between direct and non-direct links from a source when compared with that of the optimal phase shift. In addition, the proposed system outperforms its orthogonal multiple access counterpart in terms of both BLER and throughput. Furthermore, optimal channel coding rates of users can maximize the system throughput performance. Monte Carlo simulations are presented to corroborate the theoretical analysis.},

We first propose a preliminary scheme, and then further devise a series of improved approaches used in the novel two-stage solution, including stages of initial and residual CFO estimation. For Stage 1, we devise two useful estimation algorithms, respectively. Especially, the latter approach using the frequency-domain received signal avoids intensive computation of the cost function. For Stage 2, we derive a closed-form formula used in the iterations to estimate the residual CFO. It can be shown that the proposed schemes not only provide a performance comparable to that of the non-blind least square-based scheme, but also enjoy much lower computational complexity compared with the conventional exhaustive search approach. The conducted computer simulation results verify the superior performance of the blind CFO estimation for UFMC.},

  abstract     = {Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) can provide efficient usage for both spectrum and hardware resources. A critical challenge, however, is to design the dual-functional waveform for simultaneous radar sensing and communication. In this paper, we propose a sparse vector coding-based ISAC (SVC-ISAC) waveform to simultaneously provide low sidelobes for radar sensing and ultra reliability for communication transmission. The key idea of the proposed waveform is to embed the communication information into the support of one sparse vector and transmit a low-dimensional signal via the spreading codebook. We derive a closed-form expression of the ambiguity function for the proposed SVC-ISAC waveform, and prove that it exhibits low sidelobes in the delay and Doppler domains, regardless of the distribution of the transmitted bit stream. In addition, the information decoding at the communication receiver is solved through the support identification and sparse demapping. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed waveform improves the reliability while consistently suppressing the sidelobe levels.},

Under this setup, instead of eavesdropping the ST over all frequency bands (FBs), E proactively jams over certain undesirable FBs, i.e., jams certain SRs via E-SRs and E-IRS-SRs links, to deliberately force the ST reallocating more transmit power over the unjammed (eavesdroppable) desirable FBs. Then as a reward, E itself can achieve better eavesdropping over those FBs accordingly. Our objective is to maximize the sum ergodic eavesdropping rate of E, by jointly optimizing the set of jammed FBs, the jamming power allocation of E and the reflection coefficients at the IRS. A two-stage optimization procedure is proposed: i) given each possible jammed set, the jamming power allocation and the reflection coefficients are optimized via successive convex approximation and alternative iterations; ii) the optimal and sub-optimal jammed sets are further determined using the exhaustive search and the designed heuristic scheme. Results show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme compared to competitive benchmarks.},

In particular, for either the hard deadline or the linear penalty functions, we derive the structure of an optimal stopping rule and propose an iterative method to approximate the optimal rule.

Then, a structured orthogonal matching pursuit (S-OMP) algorithm is proposed to efficiently solve the problem by utilizing the structure of the channel matrix in row and column without a priori knowledge of the angular spread.

In this study, we use a neural network (NN) to adaptively learn the unique measurement patterns observed at different indoor environments and produce enhanced ranging outputs from raw FTM measurements. Moreover, the NN is trained based on an unsupervised learning framework, using the naturally accumulated sensor data acquired from users accessing location services. Therefore, the effort involved in collecting training data is significantly minimized. The experimental results verified that the collection of unlabeled data for a short duration is sufficient to learn the pattern in raw FTM measurements and produce improved ranging results. The proposed method reduced the errors in raw distance measurements and well-calibrated ranging results requiring the collection of ground truth data by 47–50% and 17–29%, respectively.

Yet, their effective deployment brings out many challenges, including their optimal 3D placement, coverage optimization, backhaul constraints, etc. Hence, we tackle these challenges by proposing a new framework for 3D positioning of an ABS swarm in order to extend the coverage of ground base stations (GBS). Unlike existing work that ignore ABS’s limited backhaul capacity and how it restraints the number of users that can be served, we consider a multi-hop backhaul scheme that allows ABSs to remain connected to the core network through the GBSs directly, or other deployed ABSs. Under this setup, we aim to maximize the number of served UEs, by optimizing the ABS’s placement, jointly with their association with UEs and backhauling base stations. Besides, our framework, named ASF for Adaptive Social Spider Optimization based framework, uses machine learning techniques to predict the users’ mobility and enable ABSs to adjust their position according to their spatial distribution. Simulations show that ASF framework significantly improves the cellular network’s coverage and provides access to 92% of mobile users, as compared to other benchmark schemes that only serve 79% and 58% of users.},

  abstract     = {Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and backscatter communication are two emerging technologies for low-power communication. In this paper, we consider a NOMA backscatter system, where signals from two backscatter devices are multiplexed on a frequency resource block using NOMA in each time slot. Our objective is to maximize the average energy efficiency by optimizing backscatter device pairing, reflection coefficients of backscatter devices, and the transmit power of the reader. We formulate the average energy efficiency maximization problem subject to the minimum circuit power and the minimum data rate requirements of the backscatter devices, and the transmit power constraint of the reader. The formulated problem is nonconvex. To obtain a suboptimal solution for this problem, we use alternating optimization technique and decompose the problem into two subproblems. The subproblems are solved by using fractional programming, Dinkelbach’s algorithm, and successive convex approximation method. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm converges quickly to a suboptimal solution. Our proposed algorithm outperforms several baseline algorithms, including the genetic algorithm, fixed device pairing scheme, conventional device pairing scheme, maximum transmit power allocation scheme, and random reflection coefficient selection scheme, in terms of the average energy efficiency. The optimality gap of our proposed algorithm is investigated by comparing with the optimal scheme, in which the optimal device pairing is obtained based on exhaustive search.},

This problem is very important for the forthcoming applications that depend on accurate location information, since malicious attacks can potentially lead to disastrous consequences without the consideration of the security aspect. Therefore, this work proposes a new scheme for attacker detection based on generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) applied after a preliminary location estimate is obtained based on a simple geometric approach. The detected attacker is then removed from the localization process, which is converted into a generalized trust region sub-problem (GTRS) framework by applying the law of cosines (LC) and solved efficiently via bisectioning. The work also introduces theoretical bounds on the probability of detection in closed-form and studies the performance of the proposed algorithm from computational complexity, success in attacker detection, and localization accuracy perspectives. Our simulations corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, offering good localization accuracy and detection performance even in noisy environments},

Among various localization methods, the most popular ones are Time-Of-Arrival (TOA), Time-Difference-Of-Arrival (TDOA), Angle-Of-Arrival (AOA) and Received Signal Strength (RSS) based. Since the Cramér-Rao lower bounds (CRLB) of these methods depend on the sensor geometry explicitly, sensor placement becomes a crucial issue in source localization applications. In this paper, we consider finding the optimal sensor placements for the TOA, TDOA, AOA and RSS based localization scenarios. We first unify the three localization models by a generalized problem formulation based on the CRLB-related metric. Then a u nified op t imization fra m ework for o ptimal s ensor placemen t (UTMOST) is developed through the combination of the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and majorization-minimization (MM) techniques. Unlike the majority of the state-of-the-art works, the proposed UTMOST neither approximates the design criterion nor considers only uncorrelated noise in the measurements. It can readily adapt to to different design criteria (i.e. A, D and E-optimality) with slight modifications within the framework and yield the optimal sensor placements correspondingly. Extensive numerical experiments are performed to exhibit the efficacy and flexibility of the proposed framework.},

  abstract     = {Content prefetching at road side units (RSUs) in vehicular networks can improve users’ experience by reducing the average data access latency. Prefetching algorithms proposed in the literature usually rely on a fixed modulation scheme, that corresponds to the lowest possible data rate for RSU-to-vehicles transmission. As a consequence, the network bandwidth is often inefficiently used. In this article, we propose to study the problem of efficient content broadcasting in vehicular networks and express it as a joint data-prefetching and broadcast transmission scheduling optimization problem, subject to cache size constraints and transmission rate adaptation constraints. In our study we consider a highway scenario covered by several RSUs, and take into account the deadline requirement of interactive applications. We express the problem as an integer linear programming problem, and solve it using a heuristic algorithm that determines: the content prefetching schedule, the broadcast transmission schedule and the rate adaptation schedule sequentially. Simulation results show that, i) it is beneficial to use adaptive rates to broadcast data instead of relying on single-rate with unicast transmissions; ii) using vehicular trajectories and content popularity in conjunction yields better results than simply relying on content popularity for content prefetching and caching; and iii) this holds even with inaccurately predicted vehicle locations and with delay-sensitive contents.},

We are committed to taking advantage of these two trends to explore a novel multi-tier edge computing scenario with hierarchical task offloading and green energy provisioning via leveraging the energy harvesting (EH) technique. Specifically, we focus on the key problem of joint task offloading and energy scheduling in such green multi-tier edge computing systems. We aim to minimize the task execution cost by jointly considering the system cost that covers latency, energy consumption, and cloud rental fees. By formulating the problem as a stochastic optimization problem, we invoke the Lyapunov technique to decompose the long-term optimization problem into a series of one-slot optimization problems which only use the current system information. To solve the one-slot optimization problem which is a mixed-integer linear problem (MILP) proved to be NP-hard , we first relax the integer variables into real ones to obtain the optimal fractional solutions. Considering the capacity of the physical resources of each edge server, we propose a resource-constrained randomized dependent rounding algorithm to properly round up or down the fractional variables to get a feasible yet near-optimal solution.

However, their limited capacity, e.g., battery, forces the design of an edge-assisted solution, where heavy tasks are offloaded to the edge cloud. To solve the problem of task offloading from UAV to the closest edge computation, many proposals have appeared, mainly based on a Reinforcement Learning (RL) formulation. While these solutions successfully learn how to reduce task completion time in the UAV context, some limitations appear when these models are applied in real scenarios, given the memory-hungry nature of RL. To this end, we propose a simple yet effective formalization that still enables a learning process, but reduces the required information and the training time. Our evaluation results confirm our hypothesis, showing a marked improvement when compared to other RL-based strategies and deep learning-based solutions.},

  abstract     = {Traffic awareness is the prerequisite of autonomous driving. Given the limitation of on-board sensors (e.g., precision and price), remote measurement from either infrastructure or other vehicles can improve traffic safety. However, the wireless communication carrying the measurement result undergoes fading, noise and interference and has a certain probability of outage. When the communication fails, the vehicle state can only be predicted by Bayesian filtering with a low precision. Higher communication resource utilization (e.g., transmission power) reduces the outage probability and hence results in an improved estimation precision. The power control subject to an estimate variance constraint is a difficult problem due to the complicated mapping from transmit power to vehicle-state estimate variance. In this paper, we develop an estimator consisting of several Kalman filters (KFs) or extended Kalman filters (EKFs) and an interacting multiple model (IMM) to estimate and predict the vehicle state. We propose to apply deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for the transmit power optimization. In particular, we consider an intersection and a lane-changing scenario and apply proximal policy optimization (PPO) and soft actor-critic (SAC) to train the DRL model. Testing results show satisfactory power control strategies confining estimate variances below given threshold. SAC achieves higher performance compared to PPO.},

This work proposes a novel deep learning approach for performing robust semantic segmentation of aerial scenes captured by UAVs. In our setup, the power-constrained drone is used only for data collection, while the computationally intensive tasks are offloaded to a GPU cloud server. Our architecture performs robust semantic segmentation by learning the segmentation maps from jointly utilizing of aerial scenes along with the respective “elevation maps” in a semi-supervised approach. We propose a three-tier deep learning architecture, wherein the first module aims at preliminary feature extraction from aerial scenes using a backbone feature extractor. The second module captures the spatial dependency between the aerial scenes and their respective elevation maps to obtain better semantic information, which is achieved by a bi-directional LSTM. The third module is aimed at enhancing the performance of semantic segmentation through a semi-supervised approach with an encoder to generate segmentation maps and a decoder to reconstruct feature maps. This semi-supervised feature learning ensures robust extraction along with scalability. The proposed architecture was validated on real-world aerial datasets and achieves state-of-the-art results for aerial image segmentation.},

  abstract     = {The robot’s mobility and intelligence have expanded its application in recent years. Specifically, indoor tracking is a fundamental function of public service robots in nursing homes, hospitals, and warehouses. Existing vision-based tracking requires visual information, which may be unavailable and introduce privacy issues in practical deployment. To this end, in this paper, we propose &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\mathsf {LTrack}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; , a long-range tracking system based on LoRa, an emerging low-power wide-area networking (LPWAN) technology, with a single transceiver pair. Note that commodity LoRa devices cannot estimate the angle of arrival (AoA) of signals due to hardware limitations. We design a virtual circular antenna array in the mobile rotating anchor via a lightweight hardware modification to multiplex the only RF channel in the low-cost LoRa device. The difference of time of flight (TDoF) measured in the circular antenna array is fused with the rotating orientation to estimate the target AoA. We also redesign and optimize the primitive LoRa ranging engine based on systematic analysis. Further, we present a real-time mobile target tracking algorithm based on the Doppler frequency shift to combat the uncertainty introduced by the target movement. We have developed the prototype of &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\mathsf {LTrack}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; , which consists of a mobile rotating anchor, a LoRa tag, and a commercial robot. The system is evaluated in both LOS and NOLS indoor scenarios.

However, the problem relating to parallel offloading and load balancing with multiple cooperative MEC servers and massive delay-sensitive execution workloads remains to be investigated. In this paper, we study a joint parallel offloading and load balancing policy for such an MEC system. We formulate a long-term system average-cost (i.e., weighted sum of energy consumption and execution delays) stochastic programming problem under MU battery level stability and delay constraints. Our aims include optimizing the data sizes for uplink offloading transmissions for optimized communication and computation resource allocation among multi-users, and maximizing the computation capability utilization of cooperative MEC servers by load balancing. To solve this problem, we first design a Lyapunov-based centralized cost management algorithm (LYP-CCMA) to obtain the optimal system average-cost under the battery level stability constraints. Further, we propose two algorithms based on alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to implement distributed resources allocation. Simulation results verify our analysis and demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed schemes over several baseline schemes.},

  abstract     = {In wireless sensor networks (WSNs), sink node mobility has been considered an efficient way to alleviate excessive data forwarding at nodes close to the sink node. Since the mobile sinks (or collectors) move around the network collecting data from the sensor nodes, the need for multi-hop forwarding of sensor data is reduced. In WSNs with mobile collectors, efficient path planning of mobile collectors is a major challenge where many algorithms have been proposed. However, they do not consider tracking performance degradation during flight due to environmental factors such as wind, waves, and obstacles. Tracking control algorithms have been proposed to correct the paths of mobile collectors, but existing work do not consider the possibility of collisions between multiple collectors. In this paper, we propose a distributed control approach that can improve tracking performance of mobile collectors while avoiding collisions in unknown and uncertain WSN environments. The proposed algorithm uses a potential field of attraction and repulsion to control individual mobile collector input, which enables mobile collectors to adjust their trajectories with online learning in a distributed fashion. From the theoretical analysis, the upper bound of tracking error and the conditions of the system parameters to guarantee the desired tracking error set by the operator are derived. The simulation results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of tracking error, collision rate, system stability, and convergence.},

In order to meet the huge demand for wireless communications in maritime environment, mobile edge computing (MEC) is considered as an effective solution to provide powerful computing capabilities for maritime terminals of resource scarcity or latency sensitive. A basic technology to implement MEC is virtual machine (VM) multiplexing, through which multi-task parallel computing on a server is realized. In this paper, a two-layer unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) maritime communication network with a centralized top-UAV (T-UAV) and a group of distributed bottom-UAVs (B-UAVs) is established and MEC is used on T-UAV. We aim to solve the latency minimization problem for both communication and computation in this maritime UAV swarm mobile edge computing network. We reformulate this problem into a Markov decision process (MDP), since it is a non-convex and multiply constrained but has the characteristics of MDP. Based on this MDP model, we take deep reinforcement learning (DRL) as our tool to propose a deep Q-network (DQN) and a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithms to optimize the trajectory of T-UAV and configuration of virtual machines (VMs). Using these two proposed algorithms, we can minimize the system latency. Simulation results show that the given solutions are valid and effective.},

Mobile edge computing driven by powerful computing capability and edge intelligence is taken as a promising solution, especially for the resource-constrained and delay-sensitive maritime IoT users. In this paper, we study the optimal edge server selection problem for ship IoT users to jointly minimize the latency and energy consumption for task offloading. Specifically, we first propose a novel space-air-ground-edge (SAGE) integrated maritime network architecture to offload computation-intensive IoT services at sea. Then, the latency and energy consumption of data transmission and processing during offloading are modelled. Based on the models, the edge server selection problem is formulated into a Multi-Armed Bandits learning problem, with considering the task latency requirement and energy budget. To achieve the optimal solution, a novel algorithm, referred to as UCB1-ESSS, is developed, which links the latency, energy consumption, and network constraints by introducing both reward and cost. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve considerably lower offloading latency and weighted latency-energy cost compared with the traditional algorithms under different QoS requirements, which proves the efficacy of theproposed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {With the widespread of commercial communication equipment, WiFi signals are ubiquitous in human life. Therefore, utilizing WiFi signals to implement intelligent sensing applications is an inevitable trend. In WiFi sensing applications, through-the-wall crowd counting is a challenging problem. In the through-the-wall scenario, the wireless signal transmitted through the wall will carry a lot of noises and is severely attenuated. Therefore, the influence of human activities on the wireless signal is difficult to extract. To solve this problem, we propose TWCC, a through-the-wall crowd counting system using ambient WiFi signals. TWCC utilizes commercial WiFi equipments to extract the phase difference data of the channel state information (CSI) and transform it to sense the environment. First, TWCC preprocesses the data to remove uncorrelated noise, and then combines the sub-carrier correlation to achieve through-the-wall human detection. When people exist, TWCC extracts features from four domains as feature groups, namely time domain, subcarrier domain, frequency domain, and time-frequency domain. Then TWCC uses different backpropagation (BP) neural networks for the features of the four domains and combines with weighting and threshold judgment to realize the through-the-wall crowd counting detection. Extensive real-world experiments show that TWCC achieves an average recognition accuracy of about 90% and maintains strong robustness to different speeds and environments.},

  abstract     = {The user-centric cooperative transmission provides a compelling way to alleviate frequent handovers caused by an ever-increasing number of randomly deployed base stations (BSs) in ultra-dense networks (UDNs). This paper proposes a new user-centric cooperative transmissions-based handover scheme, i.e., the group-cell handover (GCHO) scheme, with the aim of reducing the handover rate in UDNs. In the proposed scheme, the boundary of the cooperating cluster depends on the distance among the user equipment (UE) and cooperating BSs. The new scheme captures the dynamicity and irregularity of the cooperating cluster topology resulting from randomly distributed BSs. Based on stochastic-geometry tools where BSs locations are modeled as the Poison point process (PPP), we derive an analytical expression of the handover rate for the UE with an arbitrary movement trajectory. Furthermore, a GCHO skipping (GCHO-S) scheme is proposed to minimize the handover cost, i.e., the percentage of time wasted in handover signaling in user-centric cooperative transmissions scenarios. The numerical results show that the GCHO scheme decreases the handover rate by 42.3% and 72.7% compared with the traditional single BS association and fixed-region cooperative network topology handover approaches, respectively. Moreover, under the same group-cell size and constant velocity, the GCHO-S scheme diminishes the handover cost by 50% against the GCHO scheme.},

  abstract     = {5G and beyond networks should efficiently support services with stringent and diverse QoS requirements. This includes services for verticals that demand Ultra Reliable and Low Latency Communications (URLLC). Scheduling strongly impacts the communication latency, and 5G NR introduces grant-free scheduling to reduce the latency at the radio level. Grant-free scheduling can use shared resources and the transmission of K replicas per packet to increase the packet delivery ratio and efficiently utilize the spectrum. Previous studies have shown that existing 5G NR grant-free scheduling has limitations to sustain URLLC requirements for aperiodic (or uncertain) and deterministic traffic that is characteristic of verticals such as Industry 4.0 or manufacturing. In this context, this paper proposes and evaluates a novel grant-free scheduling scheme that can efficiently support deterministic and aperiodic uplink traffic. The scheme avoids packet collisions among UEs sharing resources using a priority-based contention resolution process that relies on the transmission of announcement messages in minislots and a local channel sensing process. This study demonstrates that the proposed sensing-based grant-free scheduling scheme outperforms current 5G NR grant-free scheduling implementations, and can support a higher number of UEs with URLLC and deterministic requirements with a considerably lower number of radio resources.},

  abstract     = {M2M communication in the LTE network is gaining attention with a growing number of connected devices and adaptation of new emerging technologies. Usually, the traffic generated by M2M devices is heterogeneous in terms of packet size, intensity, strict delay, and throughput requirements. The M2M traffic generally flows in the uplink direction. It imposes several challenges in designing scheduling for uplink in the LTE network. The research community proposed various solutions regarding the QoS handling in M2M communications. Allocating the resources based on the QoS of machine type communications (MTCs) has a challenge in deciding on devices’ priority. This work applies game theory to control devices’ strategic behavior claiming a false priority. In this paper, a Quality-of-Service aware uplink packet scheduling scheme is proposed using a combinatorial game. The packet scheduling problem is modeled as an Auction game that handles the scheduling in both Time-Domain and Frequency-Domain. The packet scheduler uses the QoS requirement as an allocation metric, and a power control mechanism is applied to control the devices’ strategic behavior. Simulation is performed in MATLAB R2019b. The performance of the proposed schemes is evaluated in terms of the total system utility in QoS satisfaction against standard schedulers like Round Robin and Proportional Fair schedulers and some other schedulers proposed in the literature.},

In the performance evaluation, the resolution of proposed method is first compared with the theoretical angular resolution limit (ARL). It is shown that the proposed estimator reaches the Chernoff ARL. The probability of resolution (PoR) is then investigated and compared with typical and state-of-the-art DoA estimators in various conditions. The numerical results show that the DLDC-SFPR achieves 0.4 ° resolution with 90% PoR to distinguish 2 targets at signal to noise ratio (SNR) of 7 dB if the targets are on-gird. In the case of any-angle, the same resolution and probability are achieved at SNR = 12 dB. The proposed method is robust to multi-target concurrent cases, and outperforms the existing reported approaches. Two procedures, uniform scanning and progressive scanning, are proposed for wider FoV applications.},

For UAV signal collection, a detection-vector optimization problem can be addressed by introducing a serial of transformations into a second-order cone programming problem. Furthermore, the UAV-ground NOMA communication is summarized into a max-min problem in terms of UAV’s energy efficiency (EE), which is a fractional mixed-integer non-convex problem and has been widely recognized as hard work. Thus, a two-step solution is proposed. Firstly, we transfer the max-min fractional problem into a subtractive one. After that, the transformed problem is further divided into three sub-problems, which are used for jointly performing UAV trajectory optimization, NOMA scheduling optimization, and NOMA power allocation. In addition, the non-convexity of the above-mentioned problem is well solved by using the proposed iterative algorithm, achieving a rapid convergence. Numerical results illustrate the superiority of the proposed EE-NOMA scheme, which achieves three times higher energy-efficient than the conventional spectrum efficiency scheme, and NOMA is shown to globally outperform the orthogonal multiple access in UAV EE circumstance.},

  abstract     = {A zero forcing (ZF) assisted single layer beamforming is developed for spatial modulation (SM) and space shift keying (SSK) modulation multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems, termed as SZF-SM/SZF-SSK, to achieve both transmit beamforming and receive diversity gain in this paper. Specifically, the proposed SZF-SM/SZF-SSK maps part of the bits to spatial domain, simultaneously forming a ZF precoding assisted single layer data both in multiple input single output (MISO) and MIMO systems, that differs greatly from conventional ZF beamforming assisted MIMO systems. With MISO configuration, the ZF precoder of SZF-SM/SZF-SSK converges to the maximum ratio transmission (MRT), achieving only the transmit beamforming gain. With MIMO configuration, SZF-SM/SZF-SSK tranceiver could be further modified along with the MIMO channel to achieve single layer transmission and joint detection, attaining both the transmit beamforming and receive diversity gain in SM-MIMO system. The theoretical analysis and the simulation results of the proposed SZF-SM/SZF-SSK with MISO and MIMO configurations are presented in this paper respectively, which show an attractive performance gain over the conventional SM/SSK. Compared with the conventional ZF beamforming assisted MIMO systems and some other CSI assisted SM-MIMO schemes, the proposed scheme exhibits better performance, especially under highly correlated MIMO channels, rendering a new and practical way to achieve low rank MIMO transmission with good performance and high data rate.},

  abstract     = {Geo-localization services are an important functionality in cellular networks. Besides, the use of Ultra Dense Networks and small cells, in current and future cellular networks, greatly increases the complexity of centralized localization approaches. Consequently, we propose a Self-Synchronization Positioning Estimation (SSPE) algorithm that estimates the transmitter position in a distributed fashion. The proposed SSPE algorithm reaches consensus for the posterior distribution of the transmitter position rather than on the final estimates. Such consensus ensures that the proposed SSPE algorithm converges to the centralized Direct Positioning Estimation (DPE) approach, which has the best performance of all localization approaches. We show that the proposed algorithm is related to the Iterative Positioning Estimation (IPE) algorithm, since both exploit the self-synchronization mechanism. As a result, the improvements and extensions for IPE, previously studied in other works, can be directly applied to the proposed SSPE algorithm. In addition, the proposed algorithm is able to localize the transmitter even when it is not time synchronized with the network as it is usually the case. The performance of the algorithms is numerically assessed through Monte-Carlo simulations by the mean distance error and mean range offset error. Finally, we not only show that our approach gets close to the DPE performance after a few iterations, but also that it converges for different logical network configurations.},

However, the presence of channel correlation poses significant challenges on the analysis of block error rate (BLER), which is the most fundamental performance metric in short-packet communications. For tractability, Mellin transform is first invoked to derive the BLER in terms of the representation of an infinite summation. This result then enables the asymptotic analysis of BLER with useful insights, including the diversity order, the negative impact of correlation and the extension to infinite blocklength regime. Furthermore, to implement the infinite series representation of BLER, an effective truncation approach is proposed with controllable calculation accuracy. More importantly, our analytical results lay the foundation for the optimal system design. In the end, extensive Monte Carlo simulations verify our analysis.},

Consequently, in this study, we investigate the hybrid FSO-mmWave systems from a physical-layer security point of view in the presence of different types of eavesdroppers, where the communication between two legitimate peers takes place over both FSO and RF links simultaneously. In particular, exponential atmospheric turbulence and Weibull fading channels are considered for FSO and mmWave links, respectively. We examine practical scenarios to eavesdrop the legitimate communication, and discuss the effects of random radio power of mmWave link and optical irradiance of FSO link on the probability of achieving a secure transmission. The impact of the fundamental physical layer parameters on the secrecy performance of the hybrid system is analyzed by obtaining analytical derivations of the probability of strictly positive secrecy capacity (SPSC) for different types of eavesdroppers, namely RF-, FSO- and Hybrid-Eve.

In order to solve these problems, this paper proposes a precise 3D indoor localization and trajectory optimization framework that uses the combination of sparse Wi-Fi Fine Time Measurement (FTM) anchors and built-in sensors (3D-LOWS). The inertial navigation system (INS) mechanization, multi-level constraints and observed values are integrated by the adaptive unscented Kalman filter to eliminate effects of cumulative error, indoor magnetic interference, and diversity of handheld modes. The Wi-Fi based ranging and landmark detection information is used to provide an accurate absolute reference to the built-in sensors based method. In addition, this paper proposes and evaluates two different trajectory optimization algorithms and compares the improved localization performance. The comprehensive experiments indicate that the proposed 3D-LOWS is proved to achieve accurate and stable 3D indoor positioning and trajectory optimization performance under complex indoor environments using sparse wireless stations.},

  abstract     = {Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) constitute a revolutionary technique of beneficially reconfiguring the smart radio environment. However, despite the fact that wireless propagation is of time-varying nature, most of the existing RIS contributions focus on time-invariant scenarios for the following reasons. Firstly , it becomes impractical to instantaneously feed back the control signal based on the doubly selective non-line-of-sight (NLoS) fading scenario. Secondly , channel estimation conceived for the high-mobility and high-dimensional RIS-assisted links has to take into account the spatial-domain (SD), time-domain (TD), and frequency-domain (FD) correlations imposed by the angle-of-arrival/departure (AoA/AoD), the Doppler and the orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) operations, respectively, where none of the existing solutions can be directly applied. Thirdly , it is far from trivial to maximize the NLoS channel powers on all subcarriers by a common set of RIS reflecting coefficients. Fourthly , in the face of double selectivity, it becomes inevitable to encounter either inter-symbol interference (ISI) or inter-channel interference (ICI) during the signal detection in the TD or in the FD, respectively. Against this background, firstly , we focus our attention on line-of-sight (LoS) dominated unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) scenarios. Secondly , we conceive new minimum mean squared error (MMSE) channel estimation methods for doubly selective fading, which perodically transmit pilot symbols embedded into the TD and FD over the SD in order to beneficially exploit the correlations in the three domains. Thirdly , the RIS coefficients are optimized by a low-complexity algorithm based on the LoS representation of the end-to-end system model. Fourthly , tailor-made interference cancallation techniques are devised for improving the signal detection both in the FD and in the TD. Our simulation results are examined in six frequency bands licensed in 5 G, which confirms that the employment of RIS is capable of achieving substantial performance improvements.},

  abstract     = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled wireless power transfer (WPT) is a viable solution to remotely charge several energy receivers (ERs) in areas with intermittent access to a source of energy. However, given the limited available energy in the on-board battery of the UAV, which is mainly required to suffice propulsion energy consumption, the UAV struggles to roam seamlessly for long intervals. A key challenge is thus to efficiently use the limited battery energy, and accordingly prolong the UAV’s endurance, via controlling the underlying associated parameters such as cruising velocity. To further extend the battery lifetime, the UAV can also harness other sources of sustainable energy, such as sunlight, via solar energy harvesting. This paper studies a UAV-enabled WPT system, where a rotary-wing UAV transfers radio frequency (RF) wireless energy to several ERs at known locations. To offer uninterrupted seamless service, the UAV also harvests solar energy using solar panels. Considering the propulsion energy consumption of the UAV, we maximize the minimum average power received among all ERs over a finite cycle duration by jointly optimizing the UAV’s time allocation between harvesting and charging, flight trajectory as well as velocity, and transmit power allocation. Due to the non-convexity of the problem, we utilize the block coordinate descent (BCD) and successive convex approximation (SCA) methods. Numerical results show that the proposed solution outperforms benchmark schemes.},

With the advent of 5G, many emerging vertical industry applications have put forward demands for timing accuracy over air interface. High Precision Timing method over Air Interface based on PHY Layer Signals (TAP) is proposed for mobile networks. It is designed to provide microsecond level timing accuracy at a relatively low cost compared to the existing timing methods, such as GNSS, NTP, PTP, etc. The purpose of this paper is to comprehensively improve TAP, including timing accuracy, stability and compatibility, so as to promote its practical application. This paper proposes improvements to TAP from four aspects: timing algorithm, timing pilot signal, terminal timing process and timing parameters determination. We improve the TAP’s deficiencies in delay estimation, delay compensation accuracy and real-time matching of timing information. We implement the workflow of TAPv2 for UE based on FPGA. Finally, we settle the problem of TAP parameters determination by applying a DQN method. The simulations and tests not only show that the DQN model can effectively determine the TAP parameters, but also show TAPv2 can achieve higher accuracy and stability than TAP in multiple scenarios based on the interaction with baseband.},

  abstract     = {Power control in massive multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems is an appealing technique to improve network performance and reliability. The traditional methods to solve such problems are based on the convex optimization theory, which incurs high computational complexity. In contrast, this work leverages deep neural networks to maximize the minimum data rate of the downlink users in the massive MIMO network. Based on the different setups in the practical systems, namely in-distribution case , weakly out-of-distribution case , and out-of-distribution case , we propose three approaches to solve them. Specifically, first, we establish a densely connected neural network for solving the power control problem. Then, for the case where the test data and training data come from the same distributions (the in-distribution case ), we use the established neural network to obtain an approximately optimal power control strategy, and propose a self-training-based algorithm to use the unlabeled samples collected in the actual system to further improve the system performance. For the case that the test data and training data come from different distributions and a small amount of labeled target domain data can be obtained (the weakly out-of-distribution case ), we propose a pre-training and fine-tuning algorithm to solve the problem. For the issue that we can not obtain the labels of the target domain data (the out-of-distribution case ), we transform the problem into a covariate shift problem and propose an algorithm by weighting the loss function. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed schemes not only match the optimal solution well but also have low online inference complexity.},

  abstract     = {Faster-than-Nyquist signaling (FTNS) has emerged as a promising technique to increase communication capacity in bandwidth-limited channels. However, the presence of FTN-induced inter-symbol interference (FTN-ISI) in the received observations, is detrimental to channel estimation (CE) and data detection in terms of computational complexity and performance. This paper copes with these problems by incorporating linear pre-equalization (LPE) and composite precoding formed by linear spectral precoding and Tomlinson-Harashima precoding (THP), into the FTNS. Specifically, LPE completely pre-equalizes the FTN-ISI, while spectral precoding resolves the LPE-caused signal spectral broadening by introducing proper artificial ISI, which is pre-equalized by THP. Channel-induced ISI, as the only ISI component in the observations, is estimated and equalized using the classical frequency-domain low-complexity schemes. We show that there are four advantages of the LPE-aided CE over the CE designed for the FTN transmissions without FTN-ISI pre-equalization, namely lower pilot overhead, simpler yet optimal pilot sequence design, lower mean-squared error of CE, and more robust against the FTN-ISI. Simulation results show that our scheme improves the performance of CE and detection, compared to existing FTN frequency-domain CE and equalization schemes.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a channel allocation algorithm for heterogeneous multi-cell cognitive radio 5G networks. The proposed algorithm considers channel-availability and channel-demand heterogeneity across CR cells. We use the theory of continuous-time Markov chains to develop mathematical expressions for channel availability and channel demand. Both expressions are incorporated in a binary integer program to find the optimal channel allocation. Further, we equip the proposed channel allocation algorithm with a novel interference domain identification scheme to detect interference range overlaps between cognitive radio cells. This scheme is essential for channel allocation, as it plays an important role in avoiding inter-cell interference. Our simulation results show significant performance gains compared to existing algorithms overlooking channel-availability. Furthermore, we use the theory of Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition to develop a framework for transforming centralized channel allocation algorithms into distributed ones. Through simulation experiments, we demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework.},

  abstract     = {Due to the non-uniform geographic distribution and time-varying characteristics of the ground traffic request, how to make full use of the limited beam resources to serve users flexibly and efficiently is a brand-new challenge for beam hopping satellite systems. The conventional greedy-based beam hopping methods do not consider the long-term reward, which is difficult to deal with the time-varying traffic demand. Meanwhile, the heuristic algorithms such as genetic algorithm have a slow convergence time, which can not achieve real-time scheduling. Furthermore, existing methods based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) only make decisions on beam patterns, lack of the freedom of bandwidth. This paper proposes a dynamic beam pattern and bandwidth allocation scheme based on DRL, which flexibly uses three degrees of freedom of time, space and frequency. Considering that the joint allocation of bandwidth and beam pattern will lead to an explosion of action space, a cooperative multi-agents deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) framework is presented in this paper, where each agent is only responsible for the illumination allocation or bandwidth allocation of one beam. The agents can learn to collaborate by sharing the same reward to achieve the common goal, which refers to maximize the throughput and minimize the delay fairness between cells. Simulation results demonstrate that the offline trained MADRL model can achieve real-time beam pattern and bandwidth allocation to match the non-uniform and time-varying traffic request. Furthermore, when the traffic demand increases, our model has a good generalization ability.},

For the subsequent environment mapping, we then introduce a novel state model for mapping diffuse and specular scattering, which allows efficient tracking of individual scatterers over time using interacting multiple model (IMM) extended Kalman filter and smoother. Also the related measurement selection and data association problems are addressed. We provide extensive numerical indoor mapping results at the 28 GHz band deploying OFDM-based 5G NR uplink waveform with 400 MHz channel bandwidth, covering both accurate ray-tracing based as well as actual RF measurement results. The results illustrate the superiority of the dynamic tracking-based solutions, compared to static reference methods, while overall demonstrate the excellent prospects of radio-based mobile environment sensing and mapping in future mm-wave networks.},

Moreover, the two-dimensional spatial smoothing method is introduced to construct a smoothed received signal, which helps to tackle the rank deduction problem rooted in the equivalent one-snapshot received signal from the sum-difference co-array. Subsequently, the joint DoD and DoA estimates can be obtained by extracting the three-way tensor model. Furthermore, co-array Cramer-Rao Bound (CRB) for the bistatic co-prime MIMO radar is provided.

Two legitimate users of U1 and U2 are far from the multi-antenna base station (BS). Thus, a relay with multi-antenna is used to enhance communication and obtain diversity gain. In the first stage, the BS transmits the superimposed signal to the relay via NOMA. Meanwhile, U1 generates the jamming signal to the eavesdropper (Eve). In the second stage, the relay forwards the signal to two users while the BS transmits the jamming signal to disrupt the eavesdropping. It is assumed that the Eve has strong eavesdropping ability. Thus, we need to introduce jamming to guarantee security. Furthermore, we use U1 instead of a full-duplex (FD) relay to send the jamming signal in the first stage to avoid self-interference. To measure the secrecy performance, a closed-form expression of secrecy outage probability (SOP) is derived for the two users.

  abstract     = {In Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) broadcast channels (BCs), the transmitter simultaneously broadcasts signals to multiple receivers at same frequency band, resulting in that the communication capacity is affected by both interference, channel fading and random noise. Although channel fading can be mitigated by transceivers, the signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) of the practical communication system is still dynamically changing due to the randomly changing noise. Traditional MIMO transceiver optimization algorithms can not flexibly adapt to the dynamic changes of SNR, resulting in large performance degradation. In this paper, we comprehensively consider signal power and signal space dimensions of the received signal in MIMO BCs, and propose two transceiver optimization algorithms which can dynamically adapt to the variance of SNRs. In the proposed algorithms, SNR is adopted to be an adjustment factor to cope with its variance. When SNR is low, i.e, large noise, the algorithm parameters are automatically adjusted so that the signal power is preserved as much as possible to combat the loss of communication capacity caused by large random noise. Correspondingly, under the condition of high SNR environment, the algorithm parameters are adjusted automatically to effectively compress the inter-user-interference (IUI) and intra-user-inter-stream-interference (ISI) by optimizing signal space dimensions. Simulation results show that in different SNR environments, the proposed algorithms can automatically adjust the focus of optimization, so that the optimization of signal power and signal space dimensions can automatically adapt to different SNRs. Compared with traditional transceiver optimization algorithms, the proposed algorithms can improve the communication capacity within a large dynamic range of SNR.},

It is non-trivial to reveal the impact of multipath propagation and fast time-scale fading on mmWave-based localization, and gain guidelines for harnessing NLOS propagation. In this paper, we aim to provide a unified framework for performance analysis of mmWave-based UE localization and channel estimation. Firstly, closed-form Cramer-Rao lower bounds for UE localization and channel estimation, respectively, are derived to shed lights on their performance limits. Secondly, the effect of system elements (e.g., channel correlation and fast time-scale fading) on UE localization performance is quantitatively analyzed. In addition, information contribution from NLOS channel is quantified to reveal the impact of multipath propagation on UE localization. Finally, we show that the NLOS propagation-caused localization error can be alleviated by using a NLOS model folding-based localization scheme 1 , which strikes a balance between computational complexity and localization performance.},

The two other proposals are based on a suboptimal Maximum Ratio Combining (MRC) detection method. We present a new analysis of the MRC detector in the uncorrelated Rayleigh fading channel and identify the system operational scenarios for which the MRC performance is nearly identical to the ML performance. Our proposals — a hybrid MRC-ML method and an MRC scheme with rank reduction — are inspired by this analysis.

Most of the existing studies on the performance assessment of RIS-empowered wireless systems ignore the impact of the aforementioned phenomena. Motivated by this, the current contribution presents a theoretical framework for statistically characterizing cascaded composite turbulence and misalignment channels. More specifically, we present the probability density and cumulative distribution functions for the cascaded composite turbulence and misalignment channels. Building upon the derived analytical expressions and in order to demonstrate the applicability and importance of the extracted framework in different use cases of interest, we present novel closed-form formulas that quantify the joint impact of turbulence and misalignment on the outage performance for two scenarios, namely cascaded multi-RIS-empowered free space optics (FSO) and terahertz (THz) wireless systems. For the aforementioned scenarios, the diversity order is extracted. In addition, we provide an insightful outage probability upper-bound for a third scenario that considers parallel multi-RIS-empowered FSO systems. The obtained results highlight the importance of accurately modeling both turbulence and misalignment when assessing the system performance.},

  abstract     = {Optical wireless communication (OWC) over atmospheric turbulence and pointing errors is a well-studied topic. Still, there is limited research on signal fading due to random fog in an outdoor environment for terrestrial wireless communications. In this paper, we analyze the performance of a decode-and-forward (DF) relaying under the combined effect of random fog, pointing errors, and atmospheric turbulence with a negligible line-of-sight (LOS) direct link. We consider a generalized model for the end-to-end channel with independent and not identically distributed (i.ni.d.) pointing errors, random fog with Gamma distributed attenuation coefficient, double generalized gamma (DGG) atmospheric turbulence, and asymmetrical distance between the source and destination. We develop density and distribution functions of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) under the combined effect of random fog, pointing errors, and atmospheric turbulence (FPT) channel and distribution function for the combined channel with random fog and pointing errors (FP). Using the derived statistical results, we present analytical expressions of the outage probability, average SNR, ergodic rate, and average bit error rate (BER) for both FP and FPT channels in terms of OWC system parameters. We also develop simplified and asymptotic performance analysis to provide insight on the system behavior analytically under various practically relevant scenarios. We demonstrate the mutual effects of channel impairments and pointing errors on the OWC performance, and show that the relaying system provides significant performance improvement compared with the direct transmissions, especially when pointing errors and fog becomes more pronounced.},

  abstract     = {Satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks have been introduced as enhanced approaches to provide dynamic control, massive connections and global coverage for future wireless communication systems. This paper considers a coordinated satellite-UAV communication system, where the UAV performs the environmental reconnaissance task with the assistance of satellites in a hostile jamming environment. To fulfill this task, the UAV needs to realize autonomous trajectory control and upload the collected data to the satellite. With the aid of the uploading data, the satellite builds the environment situation map integrating the beam quality, jamming status, and traffic distribution. Accordingly, we propose a closed-loop anti-jamming dynamic trajectory optimization approach, which is divided into three stages. Firstly, a coarse trajectory planning is made according to the limited prior information and preset points. Secondly, the flight control between two adjacent preset points is formulated as a Markov decision process, and reinforcement learning (RL) based automatic flying control algorithms are proposed to explore the unknown hostile environment and realize autonomous and precise trajectory control. Thirdly, based on the collected data during the UAV’s flight, the satellite utilizes an environment situation estimating algorithm to build an environment situation map, which is used to reselect the preset points for the first stage and provide better initialization for the RL process in the second stage. Simulation results verify the validity and superiority of the proposed approach.},

For these two structures, the finite resolution analog precoder is realized through a low-power switches and inverters (SI) network. In the NOMA system, multiple users are first paired according to their channel correlation and gain difference. Following this, we propose hybrid precoding schemes for the low-power SI-based HP structures. Then, a power allocation (PA) problem is formulated to maximize the energy efficiency of the system, subject to per-cluster’ power constraints and per-user’ quality of service constraints. To solve the non-convex PA optimization problem, we devise a suboptimal solution with two-stage PA strategies. Furthermore, the PA problem aiming at conditionally maximizing the spectrum efficiency is also analyzed. Simulation results show that the proposed mmWave-NOMA can achieve higher energy efficiency than the existing mmWave-NOMA scheme and the conventional mmWave orthogonal multiple access scheme.},

In this algorithm, the course angle is unknown, and non-Gaussian measurement noise caused by measurement outliers is considered. The cooperative localization model is reconstructed, and a filtering algorithm is derived whose performance will not be affected by the unknown course angle. Moreover, the maximum information potential (MIP) criterion is introduced into a recursive model to deal with the non-Gaussian measurement noise in a complicated underwater environment. Simultaneously, the kernel bandwidth is adaptively adjusted by the innovation matrix and the measurement error covariance matrix. The proposed algorithm can accurately estimate the variation of the unknown course angle without expanding the dimension of state under the condition of non-Gaussian measurement noise. Finally, the proposed algorithm is verified through field experiments. The results show that the proposed algorithm has higher accuracy and robustness than other existing algorithms.},

This paper focuses on the driveline oscillation of a series-parallel hybrid vehicle on launch condition. An analytic model of driveline torsional vibration considering disturbance brought by nonlinear backlash is established and simplified for the convenience of controller design. Based on the simplified model, a feedforward control strategy is proposed to suppress HEV launch vibration. However, the control effect will deteriorate sharply with the increase of equivalent backlash in the driveline system. To improve vibration attenuation performance, a feedback compensator is established and incorporated into the control system, with a robust sliding mode observer which is designed to estimate unknown disturbances as feedback signal. Numerical simulation is applied to validate vibration attenuation performance of the feedforward-feedback hybrid control strategy. Simulation results demonstrate that the feedforward-feedback control strategy has better robustness to cancel the unwanted effects of disturbance brought by nonlinear backlash compared with other control methods, which can be regarded as an effective approach to attenuate driveline oscillation and thus improve ride comfort on launch condition.},

To solve the null power phenomenon and transfer power pulsation phenomenon in DWC scheme, this paper proposes a new magnetic coupler array to implement continuous charging and reduce the output power variation. The transmitters are placed with a proper interval to eliminate the adjacent coupling and enlarge the coil array’s effective length. ANSYS Maxwell is utilized to demonstrate the finite element analysis (FEA) of the DWC system. A larger receiver coil is designed to significantly mitigate power pulsation and increase the magnetic coupling as the receiver moves along the array.

Traditional two-stage cascaded AC/DC converters are widely used for these applications due to their ease of implementation and simple control schemes. With the objective of improving the power density of the APUs, the proposed converter achieves reduction in the number of active power devices along with a smaller DC link capacitance by implementing an unconventional structure with a bandpass filter, to allow only the required frequency components to transfer the rated power. To accurately characterize the proposed converter, a detailed formulation of the filter design for the circuit along with mathematical derivation of the control scheme is presented. In terms of achieving enhancement in the overall efficiency, a comparative study is presented that focusses on the conduction and switching losses incurred in the proposed topology as compared to the state of the art (SOA) two-stage AC/DC conversion topologies. The analyses portray efficiency improvement of 0.8% for a 6 kW rated load, with significant reduction in active device losses. Additionally, to support the formulations and derivations, simulation studies and experimental verifications are also presented. The results show an input power factor of 0.9918 (lagging) with a conversion efficiency of 97.6%, a tightly regulated output voltage with less than 1% peak-peak ripple and the input current total harmonic distortion (THD) of as low as 1.57%.},

  abstract     = {Over the past decade, consumer vehicles have increasingly begun to resemble computers on wheels, with many newer vehicles containing over 100 independent electronic control units (ECU) that make independent decisions within the vehicle. Cost and power constraints for the vehicle significantly constrain processing capabilities and limitations on practical cybersecurity measures that may be employed in the vehicle today. Also, as automotive manufacturers are continuous integrators, many legacy communications links within vehicles were originally designed as standalone entities that assumed internal trust of communications between ECUs by virtue of closed bus structures and an emphasis on reliability, but not security. This paper presents a low-cost authentication mechanism to significantly improve message validation on wired message buses such as the Controller Area Network (CAN) bus by employing a co-channel underlay watermark that arrives time-aligned with the primary bus messages. Concept validation using a gate-level Simulink / HDL Coder simulation provided initial feasibility, while a complete CAN bus hardware testbed was constructed with a custom CAN transceiver built on a Red Pitaya software defined radio (SDR) connected to multiple commercial CAN transceivers to validate backwards compatibility. This testbed incorporates a custom transmission security (TRANSEC) engine that supports dynamic variation of the watermark, further improving security during deployment. Finally, this custom CAN testbed with the watermarking CAN transceiver was tested across a range of operational conditions, with initial performance results presented and discussed. Future work describes potential for near-term ruggedization and productization of the watermarking CAN transceiver.},

A CAV platoon is a network of connected autonomous vehicles that communicate together to move in a specific path with the desired velocity. Failure in a physical component of a vehicle, or failure in the form of an internal delay, a cyber-attack, or a communication time-delay affects the safety and security of the CAV platoons. In this paper, we use measurements from sensors available in CAV platoons to identify transmissibility operators, which are used for health monitoring, fault localization, and fault mitigation in the platoon. We first consider the case of vehicle-to-cloud communication (V2C) to monitor the platoon’s health. Then, we assume that the platoon loses communication with the cloud, and we monitor the health of the platoon based on vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication. We apply the proposed technique to a model of the platoon obtained using the bond graph approach, and an experimental setup consisting of three connected autonomous robots.},

  abstract     = {In order to solve the manual labelling, long-tail effect and driving conservatism of the existing decision-making algorithm. This paper proposed an integrated decision-making framework (IDF) for highway autonomous vehicles. Firstly, states of the highway traffic are extracted by the velocity, time headway (TH) and the probabilistic lane distribution of the surrounding vehicles. With the extracted traffic state, the reinforcement learning (RL) is adopted to learn the optimal state-action pair for specific scenario. Analogously, by mapping millions of traffic scenarios, huge amounts of state-action pairs can be stored in the experience pool. Then the imitation learning (IL) is further employed to memorize the experience pool by deep neural networks. The learning result shows that the accuracy of the decision network can reach 94.17%. Besides, for some imperfect decisions of the network, the rule-based method is taken to rectify by judging the long-term reward. Finally, the IDF is simulated in G25 highway and has promising results, which can always drive the vehicle to the state with high efficiency while ensuring safety.},

First, a unified framework is proposed for accomplishing resilient vehicle platooning, which empowers longitudinal vehicle state estimation, anomaly signal estimation and compensation, and adaptive platoon controller design to be addressed in a comprehensive way. Second, a novel scalable platooning control design approach is developed to guarantee desired platoon stability and resilience over generic communication topologies and various spacing policies. A salient feature of the approach is that the design procedure does not depend on any global information of the associated topology, and thus preserves essential scalability for large and/or size-varying platoons. Third, it is shown that the proposed longitudinal platooning control approach is promising for performing flexible cooperative maneuvers such as platoon splitting and merging that are beyond the capacity of most existing longitudinal platooning strategies. Finally, simulation results for different platoon maneuvers are elaborated to substantiate the efficacy of the proposed approach.},

The family of interacting multiple model (IMM) filters has shown to provide very effective and accurate state estimation in systems whose behavior patterns change significantly over time. The main reason for the improved performance of IMM filters compared to single model approaches is the mode mixing, which constantly aligns the different models. This paper proposes an innovative way for the mode mixing, when the state-vectors of the models are of different size. The proposed mixing approach consists of two parts: firstly mixing the common states and secondly weighting between original and mixed states based on the model probabilities. Results from artificial simulations and real world measurement setups are shown to demonstrate the validity of the approach. Compared to previously suggested solutions, the proposed approach is more general and the overall complexity of the mode mixing step is reduced, which is the main contribution of the presented paper.},

It is widely acknowledged that the model-based control strategies have excellent potential on path following, but their effect is seriously affected by the parametric uncertainty. To solve this problem, an adaptive constrained path following control scheme considering the influence of parametric uncertainty is proposed for autonomous electric vehicles. Firstly, an adaptive feedback control law and its update law are proposed to deal with the variation of tire cornering stiffness during vehicle path following process. Secondly, a constraint function for lateral displacement error during path following process is designed to further improve driving safety. And then, the closed-loop stability of the proposed control scheme is proved. Finally, the validation is implemented by simulation and experiment, the results show that the proposed control scheme is effective under different working conditions. The maximum lateral displacement error is reduced to 0.0297m by using the proposed scheme in the experiment. The proposed scheme might provide a theoretical reference for control practice of autonomous vehicles.},

  abstract     = {The around view monitor system (AVM) has been widely used in passenger vehicles. However, for articulated engineering vehicles (AEV), AVM is difficult to directly apply due to the long body and the articulation angle. In this paper, a flexible technique for variable-angle around view monitor system (VAVM) towards the AEV is proposed, which includes static calibration and dynamic execution. In the static calibration stage, the camera poses in the vehicle coordinate system with the joint of AEV as the coordinate origin can be calibrated using irregularly placed multiple checkerboards without knowing their relative position. This flexible calibration approach makes the variable-angle mapping from the fisheye image to the bird’s eye view image can be directly obtained by updating the camera poses on the tractor according to the articulation angle when the AEV turns. In the dynamic execution stage, an optimization algorithm based on minimizing the photometric error is designed to reduce the cumulative error of the angle sensor. Finally, all the bird’s eye view images are mosaiced and fused to a variable-angle around view image (VAVI). The experimental results show that the VAVM can output globally balanced and seamless VAVIs under different angles and visual environment conditions. Furthermore, the practicability of VAVM is also demonstrated by a real AEV.},

  abstract     = {The pantograph-catenary system is used in modern electrified railways to power electric trains. Common sense is that the increase of train speed leads to a deterioration of the interaction performance. But recent studies indicate that a higher speed may result in a better performance in some local speed regions. This paper is the first attempt to provide a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon. A validated pantograph-catenary model is built to reproduce this phenomenon. Referring the definition of critical speed in moving load problems, the catenary&#39;s critical speed is defined. The wavelength components can be extracted through the Fourier transformation to the contact wire&#39;s vertical mode shape. The speed that satisfies the resonance condition can be regarded as the potential critical speed. The corresponding contact wire amplitude is further evaluated to determine the critical speeds at a given mode. The analysis indicates that a good interaction performance happens when the speed falls in the transition procedure between the critical two speeds. Based on this idea, a simple indicator that describes the overall contribution of all modes subjected to a moving pantograph at a given speed is proposed to facilitate the determination of the local optimal speed. The variation of the proposed indicator with respect to the speed shows good consistency with the trend of the simulation results. The main finding in this paper can be used in the design phase to determine the optimal speed of the pantograph-catenary system in a local speed range.},

This study proposed an adaptive speed planning method of CAVs based on multi-light trained deep reinforcement learning (DRL), aiming to improve the fuel economy and comfort of CAVs. By setting a reasonable reward function, the training algorithm takes the key environmental information received by the vehicle as inputs, and finally outputs the acceleration that maximizes the cumulative reward. The results show that the trained DRL agent can adapt to variable scenarios with traffic lights, and quickly solve the approximate optimal speed trajectory. Multi-light DRL models save 6.79% fuel compared with single-light ones and have better performance on fuel economy and computational efficiency than a non-RL method using multi-light optimization.},

  abstract     = {As an emerging concept in the intelligent transportation system (ITS), Opportunistic Autonomous Vehicle Platoon (OAVP) enables autonomous vehicles to self-organize a temporary platoon and travel together. Whereas, electing the platoon leader is a crucial issue to be solved in this scenario. The platoon leader not only suffers from more wind resistance but also spends more computation resources in dealing with tremendous information obtained from the surrounding environment. Hence, vehicles tend to be a follower rather than a leader. In this paper, we propose a reputation-based leader election system for OAVP named RLE, which contains two sub-systems: leader election and incentive mechanism. In the former one, a reputation-based election scheme is first constructed to elect a relatively trustful leader according to the reputation value recorded on the blockchain. The proposed scheme integrates previous experience with recommendations from other members. In the second sub-system, an incentive mechanism is designed to stimulate platoon members to participate actively in the process of election, which is based on the recorded real-time fuel economy among vehicles participating in a platoon. Security analysis shows that the system is sufficient to deal with potential security threats. Experimental results based on the simulated platform demonstrate the practicality and feasibility of our solution.},

The underlying technical requirement to achieve this benefit is formulated by the notion of string stability, requiring the attenuation of the effects of disturbances in upstream direction. However, wireless communication delays significantly compromise string stability. In addition, the time delay is uncertain due to the inherent characteristics of wireless communication. Therefore, a controller design method is desired for a string-stable cooperative adaptive cruise control system, which considers uncertain communication delays. To this end, the string stability requirement is integrated into a μ synthesis approach. Being different from only considering the upper bound of the time delay, the whole range of time delays is taken into account in the controller design. Therefore, the proposed method allows for CACC system behaviour predictable, and rigorously guarantee string stability for all possible uncertain delays. The results are validated with simulations.},

  abstract     = {Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology enables bidirectional energy flow between the electric vehicle and power grid thereby making the electric vehicle as a virtual power plant. This seamless exchange of energy flow is possible only when the entities involved communicate wirelessly in a secured manner. In order to ensure privacy-preserving in the V2G communication, development of a novel key establishment protocol is an active area of research. This article presents a lightweight mutual authentication and key establishment protocol for secure V2G communication among the electric vehicle user, charging station, and utility service provider. The correctness of the proposed protocol is verified using the formal method BAN logic, and many of its security threats are analyzed informally. Further, the protocol is compared for its security and efficiency with the related protocols in the literature under various aspects, and the comparison results show that our protocol outshines the others. The functional correctness of the protocol is also verified in Xilinx Zynq-7000 series FPGA board so that it can be deployed in any real-time applications.},

  abstract     = {A three-dimensional (3-D)-printed dual-fed dual-frequency dielectric antenna is investigated for vehicular communications. It combines a dielectric resonator (DR) antenna (DRA) and a dielectric lens antenna (DLA) for the low and high frequency bands, respectively. Both of the antenna parts share the same dielectric body that has three different effective dielectric constants. The DRA is excited by a vertical conducting adhesive strip on its sidewall, whereas the DLA is fed by a separate embedded slot-coupled cylindrical DRA. To verify the idea, a dual-frequency dielectric antenna operating at S - and X -bands is designed and fabricated with a 3-D printer. The S -parameters, radiation patterns, antenna gains, and antenna efficiencies of the two antenna parts are measured, and reasonable agreement between the measured and simulated results is found. The prototype has wide measured S - and X -band 10-dB impedance bandwidths of 40.2% and 19.5%, respectively. Also, its measured isolation between the two ports is desirably over 40 dB across the two bands. The measured peak antenna gains are given by 5.8 and 12.0 dBi in S - and X -bands, which are suitable for short-distance vehicle-to-basestation and long-distance vehicle-to-satellite communications, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Scenario-based proving ground testing has been established as the standard test environment for the homologation of driver assistance systems. These test procedures are described, for example, in the New Car Assessment Programme test catalog, which only considers a limited number of possible scenarios. Furthermore, pedestrian targets are, among others, used to test assistance systems for protection against vulnerable road users (VRUs). However, these targets also have the disadvantage that they only represent humans in a simplified way and cannot depict realistic movement patterns. On the other hand, simulation has been established as an efficient means of realizing scenarios in a reproducible, time- and cost-saving manner. However, simulation has a major disadvantage: it can only represent reality to a limited extent, e.g., in the influence of human factors in response to hazardous situations. To bridge the gap between simulation and real-world testing, we introduce MiRE, a mixed reality environment for testing automated driving functions. In MiRE, real entities meet in a virtual environment and take advantage of real and simulated test procedures. This paper presents MiRE, a proof of concept based on a modular architecture. The goal is to use it to evaluate the feasibility of testing in mixed reality – by comparing it to proving ground testing. Preliminary results show that MiRE is a suitable environment for testing complex scenarios where the real vehicle and VRUs can safely interact in safety-critical situations and produce realistic results.},

However, the driving simulation.s Level of Detail (LOD) can affect the users. perception of driving scenarios and make an experimental campaign.s outcomes unreliable. This paper proposes a study investigating possible correlations between driver.s behaviors and emotions, and simulated driving scenarios. Four scenarios replicating the same real area were built with four LODs from LOD0 (only the road is drawn) to LOD3 (all buildings with real textures for facades and roofs are inserted together with items visible from the road). 32 participants drove in all the four scenarios on a fixed-base driving simulator; their performance relating to the vehicle control (i.e., speed, trajectory, brake and gas pedal use, and steering wheel), their physiological data (electrodermal activity, and eye movements), their subjective perceptions, opinions and emotional state were measured. The results showed that drivers. behavior changes in a very complex way. Geometrical features of the route and environmental elements constrain much more driving behavior than LOD does Emotions are not affected by LODs. Generally, different signals showed different correlations with the LOD level, suggesting that future studies should consider their measures while modeling the virtual scenario. It is hypothesized that scenario realism is more relevant during leisurely environmental interaction, whilst simulator fidelity is crucial in task-driven interactions.},

  abstract     = {This work aims to prevent Traffic Accident (TA) and ensure drivers’ and pedestrians’ life and property safety. A TA prevention and prediction system is established based on Digital Twins (DTs) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Firstly, the double-scale decomposition equation decomposes the original TA Time Series Data (TSD) into multiple sub-layers. The Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) network is used to predict the low-frequency sub-layers. Then, the double-scale LSTM network prediction model is constructed based on the prediction results. Secondly, a Particle Filter (PF) is proposed based on target block tracking and improved resampling against the possible occlusion problem in target tracking. The proposed PF can improve particle dilution. Finally, the proposed target tracking algorithm and DTs are combined and applied to TA processing, and a motor vehicle road TA-oriented video analysis system is designed. Then, the proposed system is tested. The results corroborate that the proposed research model can effectively predict the TSD of TA compared with other models and has strong robustness. Compared with the original LSTM model and Stacked Auto Encoders (SAEs) prediction model, the prediction accuracy of the proposed model is improved by 6% and 8%, respectively. Besides, the training and prediction time of the proposed model is less than the original LSTM and SAEs models. The optimized Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) model makes the target identification easier. Additionally, the proposed model has good generalization performance. In short, the proposed system can effectively improve the efficiency of TA handling and ensure accuracy and fairness, which provides some data support for applying DTs in intelligent transportation.},

While ethnographers have qualitatively described regional differences in driving style, data-driven statistical models might help computer-driven cars drive like locals and recognize how local drivers might be signaling through hand/body movement and motion of their vehicles. To this end, we have created an experimental system and method to profile driving behavior and interaction using a multi-participant virtual reality (VR) driving simulation environment. The system was designed to be portable and to support cross-cultural experimental deployments. We aim to make sure the system is operational and functional, can model diverse scenarios, generates data fit for analysis, and captures expected behaviors.

While recent resource allocation techniques aiming to individually maximize either spectral efficiency (SE) or energy efficiency (EE), this paper considers an SE-EE trade-off based technique for a hybrid TDMA-NOMA system. This design offers an additional degree of freedom in resource allocation. The proposed design is formulated as a non-convex multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem. The MOO framework is reformulated as a single-objective optimization (SOO) problem by combining the multi-objectives through a weighted-sum objective function. With this, each of the original objectives is assigned with a weight factor to reflect its importance in the design. Then, the sequential convex approximation (SCA) and a second-order cone (SOC) approach are jointly utilized to deal with the non-convexity issues of the SOO problem. Simulation results reveal that the proposed trade-off based design strikes a good balance between the objective functions, while meeting the instantaneous requirements of the system.},

We consider a target tracking example, which is a typical application of MTC networks. Specifically, as a type of MTC devices, smart sensors each have the ability of perception, calculation and communication and all of them can form a sensor network. In this network, its sensors and transmission channels are vulnerable to FDI attacks, resulting in the degradation of system estimation performance. In order to maximize the estimation error covariance of MTC network, the attacker needs to decide which sensors and channels to intrude due to limited energy budget. The estimation error covariance of the MTC network is calculated, based on which a convex optimization problem to obtain the optimal attack strategy is proposed. Simulation results demonstrate that the optimal attack strategy maximizes the transient mean-square deviation and estimation error covariance of the MTC network.},

  abstract     = {Range-based positioning using wireless signal has gained remarkable attention in past decades. Accurately extracting the distance information, i.e., estimating parameters of individual multipath, is of interest. It has been shown that diffuse multipath component (DMC) in wireless propagation channel has significant influence on channel estimation and, thus, the ranging performance. In addition to specular component (SC), DMC should be considered in order to improve the estimated accuracy of channel paths’ parameters and, thus, the ranging performance. In this paper, we extend the quasi-maximum likelihood space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE) algorithm by incorporating an autoregressive moving average (ARMA) filter to estimate the channel parameters under the presence of DMC. The parameters of both DMC and SC are estimated in an iterative approach, where the DMC is assumed as colored noise and the ARMA-filter is used to estimate the contributions from DMC. The validation of the algorithm based on measured data shows that both SC and DMC can be accurately estimated by the proposed approach. A comparison with standard SAGE and AR-SAGE is conducted, where the results reveal that the proposed method outperforms other two approaches in terms of ranging accuracy.},

This paper studies the reliability performance of a downlink LEO-Sat communication system, where the orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) scheme is employed to combat severe Doppler effect. Further, the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) based cooperative transmission is developed, in order to compensate for the large margin of path-loss caused by the long transmission distance. In particular, the closed-form expression for the outage probability of the OTFS based LEO-Sat transmission is derived, where the novel moment matching approach is used to closely approximate the PDF of a sum of shadowing Rician (SR) variables. Further, the condition of using UAV cooperation is obtained so that the positive reliability gain is guaranteed. Finally, both the theoretical analysis and simulation results show that, the OTFS scheme can significantly outperform the traditional OFDM scheme, while demanding to carefully address the trade-off between reliability improvement and implementation complexity determined by modulation size.},

However, noncoherent two-phase TWR (2P-TWR) has not been compared with three-phase TWR (3P-TWR), and several unanswered questions remain. In this paper, we focus on the noncoherent detection of the relay with the decode-and-forward technique. For the noncoherent maximum-likelihood detector at the relay, we propose a distance measure for the transmitted signals of the two terminal nodes. For 2P-TWR, we propose that the signal constellation of one terminal node is the signal constellation of the other terminal node rotated by an angle. Using the proposed distance measure, we obtain the optimal angles and thus resolve those unanswered questions pertaining to 2P-TWR. Finally, noncoherent 3P-TWR was found to significantly outperform noncoherent 2P-TWR in simulations and distance analyses.},

In this correspondence, we combine the advantages of both UAV and URLLC to investigate the resource allocation for a URLLC-enabled two-way UAV relaying system. Our goal is to maximize the transmission rate of the backward link with the constraint of URLLC requirement for the forward link. The optimization is non-convex and difficult to solve. Therefore, the optimization variables are divided to several blocks, and three sub-problems are formulated and solved. Finally, an iterative algorithm is proposed to solve these sub-problems alternately.

Specifically, we propose to use pilots that are not only orthogonal within a cluster but also minimally correlated across clusters. We show that pilot sets that form mutually unbiased orthonormal bases (MUOB) minimize both inter- and intra-cluster pilot contamination. This also allows us to optimally choose the number of pilots needed to serve a given number of user equipments (UEs) within a DAA-mMIMO system. Following this, we develop an access point (AP) centered UE clustering algorithm to optimally cluster UEs for MUOB pilot allocation. Our experiments reveal that in a DAA-mMIMO system, MUOB not only offers better fairness compared to the traditional orthogonal pilot reuse scheme in terms of channel estimation error and per-UE throughput, but also delivers a higher sum system throughput.},

In this correspondence, we propose a pair of low-complexity generalized approximate message passing (GAMP)-based frequency-domain equalization (FDE) algorithms for MFTN systems operating in multipath channels. To mitigate the ill-condition of the resultant equivalent channel matrix, we construct block circulant interference matrices by inserting a few cyclic postfixes, followed by truncating the duration of the inherent two-dimensional interferences. Based on the decomposition of the block circulant matrices, we develop a novel frequency-domain received signal model using the two-dimensional fast Fourier transform for mitigating the colored noise imposed by the non-orthogonal matched filter. Moreover, we derive a GAMP-based FDE algorithm and its refined version, where the latter relies on approximations for circumventing the emergence of the ill-conditioned matrices. Our simulation results demonstrate that, for a fixed spectral efficiency, MFTN signaling can significantly improve the bit error rate (BER) performance by jointly optimizing the time- and frequency-domain packing factors. Compared to its Nyquist-signaling counterpart, our proposed MFTN systems employing the refined GAMP equalizer can achieve about 39% higher transmission rates at a negligible BER performance degradation.},

  abstract     = {In the face of the unprecedented demand for higher data rates while coping with the constraints from physical size (i.e., windward area), it is profitable to deploy compact planar arrays (CPAs) on the base stations (BSs). But massively densified antenna deployment not only leads to antenna mutual coupling (MC), but also consumes additional energy due to the equipment of more radio frequency (RF) chains. This paper studies energy efficiency (EE) optimization for massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) wireless systems with a CPA in the presence of MC. In comprehensive consideration of the spectral efficiency (SE) and power consumption, a joint optimization problem of beamforming and antenna subset (AS) is proposed. Our motivation is to relieve the effects of MC and reduce the relevant energy consumption by constructing irregular AS. Particularly, considering the nonconvexity of the objective and the discrete 0-1 constraints, an available iterative algorithm, named the energy-efficient beamforming and AS (EE-BF&amp;AS) algorithm, is developed. Numerical results illustrate that when MC is modeled, the proposed EE-BF&amp;AS algorithm outperforms conventional related approaches in EE. By using the AS switching strategy, the irregular AS can be constructed to make MC less serious and let the relevant energy consumption decrease.},

In LA, an accurate estimation of the link performance is required to optimally determine the MCS level. In this correspondence, a high-accuracy machine-learning (ML)-aided link-level performance-prediction method for coded multiple-input–multiple-output (MIMO) systems is proposed. The basic concept of this scheme is to apply the ML model to train the relation between the inputs, such as the channel matrix and signal-to-noise ratio, and the output of the block-error rate (BLER). Specifically, we predict the index of the quantized BLER value using a random forest classifier. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme is able to accurately predict the link performance of MIMO systems and outperforms the conventional link performance-prediction schemes.},

Unmanned aerial vehicle ( UAV ) mounted base stations and computing facilities can be used to provide better wireless connectivity and computing services to edge VR users to meet their computing needs and reduce the end-to-end latency. We propose a novel UAV assisted mobile edge computing ( MEC ) network to enable high-quality mobile 360-degree video VR applications by leveraging UAVs to provide the required communication and computing needs. Then, we formulate the joint UAV placement, M EC and radio resource allocation, and 360-degree v ideo content layer assignment ( UAV-MV ) problem, which aims to select the allocation of computing and communications resources and the location of the UAVs such that the delivered quality of experience ( QoE ) is maximized across the mobile VR users, given various system constraints. We show that the problem is NP-hard, and decompose it into three lower-complexity subproblems that we solve sequentially. We design an approximation algorithm with performance guarantees that solves the UAV-MV problem based on the solutions to the three subproblems. Our simulation results show that the average QoE enabled by the proposed algorithm is 15% and 90% greater relative to two competitive reference methods.},

It has emerged as a promising system wherein various data authentication techniques have been introduced using clumsy certificate management and Diffie-Hellman (DH) assumption. However, in the presence of quantum cryptanalysis, DH-type problems could be solved in polynomial-time. In this paper, a novel certificateless data authentication protocol is designed, enabling security features in open wireless communication in the IoV. The proposed protocol resists a quantum attack using lattice cryptography. Further, a reliable blockchain mechanism is shown to provide vehicles’ trustworthiness in batch data verification. Rigorous formal analysis shows the ability of the proposed algorithm to resist existential unforgeability against the chosen-message attack. Nonetheless, the developed protocol supports other essential security functionalities, including unlikability, conditional-traceability, anti-replay, and data authenticity. Performance analysis exhibits the simulation orchestration and shows the way the proposed protocol outperforms other related techniques in energy consumption, data computation, communication, and cryptographic key storage overheads.},

  abstract     = {Federated Edge Learning (FEL) enables a massive number of edge devices (e.g. smart phones) to train machine learning models collaboratively. Due to the inherent unreliability of participating edge devices and the unpredictable network conditions, the final model accuracy is largely determined by the communication time between edge devices and the parameter server (PS). However, there exists very limited work to quantify the influence of the communication time in FEL and show how to minimize its negative impacts from a theoretic perspective. In this paper, we are among the first to develop a formal model of the communication time in FEL and its influence on the final model accuracy. In our work, the set of edge devices involved in each global iteration is defined as the ECP (Engaged Client Pool) . We model the communication time cost as a function with respect to the response time distribution of individual devices and the ECP size. By incorporating communication time cost into the convergence rate analysis, we propose the ECPA and H-ECPA algorithms to automatically adjust the size of the ECP so as to maximize the model accuracy in both homogeneous and heterogeneous networks. We also analyze how the tail shape of response time affects the convergence rate, and prove that the heavy tail shape can significantly lower the model accuracy. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments with real datasets, and the results confirm the correctness of our analysis and demonstrate the superiority of our proposed algorithms.},

This task, however, requires the battery level of devices. However, in practice, it is impractical to obtain an accurate battery level or channel state information from all devices, especially in large-scale networks. To this end, we present a number of approaches to construct set covers. We first propose a Two-Phase Algorithm (TPA) that requires devices to first determine their probability of being active in each time slot. This probability is then used by a Hybrid Access Point (HAP) to construct set covers. We then introduce learning approaches based on Gibbs and Thompson sampling. The Gibbs sampling based algorithm, aka GB, allows a sink/gateway to learn the best set cover to use over time. Similarly, our Thompson sampling solutions, namely TS-Random and TS-CB, construct set covers iteratively based on the probability that a device successfully monitors static targets. The numerical results show that GB performs better than TS-CB initially but has similar performance to TS-CB in the long term.},

This paper presents a space-based analysis of the BS on/off control system to which a stochastic geometric approach is applied. In particular, we derive the approximated closed-form expression of the coverage probability of a homogeneous network (HomNet) with the user-number threshold-based BS on/off control. Moreover, the optimal user-number threshold for maximizing coverage probability is analytically derived. In addition to HomNet, we also derive the approximated closed-form expression of the coverage probability and the optimal user-number thresholds for a heterogeneous network (HetNet). The results show that HetNet, the analysis of which seems intractable, can be analyzed in the form of a linear combination of HomNets with weighted densities. In addition, the optimal user-number threshold of each tier is obtained independently from other tiers. The modeling and analysis presented in this paper are not only limited to the case of user-number threshold-based on/off control, but also applicable to other novel on/off controls with minor modifications. Finally, by comparing the analytical results with the simulated results, the theoretical contributions of this study are validated.},

In this paper, we address the content distribution scheduling problem in mmWave vehicular networks. It has been challenging for all vehicles in the same network to complete content downloading due to the limited communication resources of roadside units (RSUs) and the high mobility of vehicles. We propose a joint vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) scheduling scheme to minimize the total number of content distribution time slots from a global optimization perspective. In the V2I phase, the RSU serially transmits integrity content to vehicles, which are selected according to the vehicular network topology and transmission scheduling scheme. In the V2V phase, full-duplex communications and concurrent transmissions are exploited to achieve content sharing between vehicles and improve transmission efficiency. Performance evaluations demonstrate that our proposed scheme reduces the number of time slots and significantly improves system throughput when compared with other schemes, especially under large-size file transfers and a large number of vehicles.},

We derive the expressions for the average offloading capacity gain and average energy consumption, and formulate an efficiency function optimization problem. The problem is efficiently solved by the greedy strategy-gradient descent based caching solution and long tail distribution based heuristic caching solution.

It is assumed that GBSs are distributed by a Poisson point process (PPP) on the ground, and the location of UAVs is modeled as a Poisson hole process (PHP) at a certain altitude. Based on the preserving neighbor hole approximation method, the nearest distance distribution functions are derived. With the strongest average received power association policy, we provide the distribution functions of serving distances and the user association probabilities. Then, the coverage probability of the considered network is derived. The coverage performance of two special cases, the mmWave terrestrial cellular network and the UAV-assisted mmWave cellular network with PPP model, are also derived. In addition, the analysis framework is extended into the scenario where UAVs have different altitudes. Through simulations, optimal key ABS parameters maximizing the coverage probability are demonstrated. It also unveils that the proposed UAV-assisted mmWave cellular network can enhance the coverage probability via carefully designing of system parameters.},

  abstract     = {Explorations on the Lunar Far-side Surface (LFS) have recently developed rapidly with various landers, cruisers, and orbital space vehicles. Research on relay satellites with Earth-Moon Libration Point (EMLP) orbits has aroused widespread interest in supporting these probe missions, i.e., “Queqiao” spacecraft, due to their particular relative positions in the Earth-Lunar system. For example, a Halo orbital relay satellite at the Earth-Moon L2 point can provide more transmission opportunities for communication nodes on LFS to the destination nodes on the Earth. However, a single Halo orbital spacecraft could not provide all-time connections for the cislunar communication with its limited coverage on the LFS. In this paper, we proposed a dual-relay Halo orbit constellation for the cislunar communication network, providing high-proportion coverage on the LFS at any time using an analytical method of the grid point. Based on the proposed constellation, we designed an energy efficiency-optimal relay selection algorithm for the nodes on the LFS to return data back to the Earth by solving a MIP (Mixed-Integer-Programming) problem with collaborative considerations of source and relay node’s power allocation. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has the maximum energy efficiency (EE) while ensuring the user’s quality of service, compared with the algorithm of Spectrum Efficiency Maximization (SEM).},

  abstract     = {The fifth generation (5G) cellular networks aim to deliver data with low/ultra-low latency to users and support diverse services which require two main types of resources: communication and computing resources. These motivated the development of the Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) paradigm because it can execute tasks’ computation closer to users to reduce latency. To satisfy quality of services (QoS) requirements of different applications, both communication and computing resources in 5G MEC systems can be hard partitioned or soft partitioned among multiple network slices where each slice supports one or more services. A typical soft partition approach is using scheduling. Furthermore, packets in the multi-resource system can either be scheduled individually for each resource using a discrete resource scheduling approach or scheduled collectively only once by combined resource scheduling. In this paper, we propose a combined resource scheduler, called Extended Weighted Fair Queueing with Latency Constraint (EWFQ/LC), to schedule packets among network slices subject to system fairness and their latency constraints. By exploiting the virtual finish time feature inherent in weight fair queueing, EWFQ/LC schedules packets according to the fairness when their latency constraints can be met while according to these latency constraints when they are possibly violated. Based on simulations of realistic heterogeneous traffic scenarios, we show that EWFQ/LC reduces latency by as much as 73% compared to scheduling each resource discretely and maintains latency satisfaction ratio above 90%. More importantly, EWFQ/LC is able to accomplish these improvements with greater fairness in resource consumption especially under heavy traffic conditions, i.e., traffic with stricter latency constraints do not excessively over-consume resources of other traffic classes.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies joint cache placement and cooperative multicast beamforming to provide content-centric data services for mobile users in the integrated satellite-terrestrial network (ISTN). Specifically, in the ISTN, users requesting the same content are arranged into a multicast group and served by the cache-enabled base stations (BSs) and low earth orbit (LEO) satellite via cooperative beamforming. To maximize the network utility that takes network throughput and backhaul traffic into consideration, the cache placement, LEO satellite and BS clustering, and multicast beamforming are jointly designed and formulated as a two-timescale optimization problem. However, the original problem is anti-causal since the cache placement strategy and content delivery policy are coupled in different timescales. By utilizing historical information, we propose a two-step scheme to decompose the problem into a short-term content delivery subproblem and a long-term cache placement subproblem. As the former subproblem is nonconvex with mixed-integer variables and coupling constraints, we transform it into an equivalent problem and propose a penalty concave-convex procedure based algorithm to solve it. To address the latter subproblem, a centralized iterative algorithm and a distributed alternating algorithm with low complexity are developed, respectively. Simulation results validate that the proposed schemes can effectively enhance the network throughput and reduce the backhaul traffic compared with benchmark scheme.},

  abstract     = {With emergence of self-driving vehicles and multimedia rich Internet of Things (IoTs), Inter-Vehicular Communication (IVC) is at rise. IVC has the potential to radically improve the efficiency, safety, and comfort of everyday road travel without needing expensive roadside infrastructure. Nevertheless, a proficient way to quantify and price the multimedia services provided through IVC are yet to be fully investigated. The primary objective of this paper is to develop a Quality of Experience (QoE)-centric pricing model for the multimedia services provided through IVC by seamlessly integrating the multimedia QoE pricing concept. The developed model aims to motivate multimedia-driven vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication by allowing the end-user vehicles to achieve higher QoE and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) by incentivizing neighboring vehicles participating in relaying the multimedia content. Utility maximization between the base station seller, relaying vehicle and the mobile user consumer is modeled using the proposed economic pricing orchestration. Realistically, we translate the three-party interaction into a four-stage Stackelberg game. In addition, we derive the Nash Equilibrium using backward induction and provide an algorithm for future implementation reference. Simulation studies demonstrate the efficacy of developed model and reveal that all three parties achieve reasonable utilities where the Stackelberg equilibrium exists stably.},

However, centralized authentication introduces single point of failure. Meanwhile, the real-time participation of the home operator and the trust relationship between the foreign operator and the home operator are difficult to guarantee. In this paper, by adopting blockchain and smart contracts, we propose a secure and efficient access control scheme of user subscription data in roaming scenarios. We further design a flexible user authentication scheme, which utilizes derivable tokens based on the proposed access control scheme. By using blockchain to store and manage user subscription data, access control can be decentralized without any trusted third party. Besides, by implementing automatic verification of access privilege through smart contracts, the limitation of the home operators’ real-time participation is eliminated. In addition, to further improve security and reduce the on-chain storage overhead, we optimize the data encryption and storage scheme utilizing threshold secret sharing. Our security and performance analysis show that the proposed user subscription data access control scheme for roaming service provides high-level security while causing acceptable time and storage overhead.},

  abstract     = {Target approaching is an essential ability in marine applications, such as underwater rescue. The recent advances in autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) make them ideal options to deliver the target approaching in anchor-free environments, where no device with a known position (anchor) is pre-deployed. To approach a moving target, the trajectory planning of AUVs is an indispensable technical guarantee. However, due to the lack of anchors and the error accumulation during the navigation, the position errors of AUVs grow without bound and degrade trajectory planning performance. Thus, an AUV localization procedure is required and should be used in combination with the trajectory planning. In this paper, we research the multiple-AUV trajectory planning based on AUV cooperative localization and propose a framework named multiple-AUV cooperative localization based trajectory planning (MCLTP). Under MCLTP, scalable cooperative localization for multiple AUVs (SCLMA) and trajectory planning for multiple AUVs (TPMA) algorithms are derived. The design of SCLMA focuses on improving the localization accuracy by alleviating the accuracy degradation caused by the accumulated errors in the inertial measurements. TPMA formulates the trajectory planning into a convex optimization problem with balanced target detection probability and tracking accuracy. Furthermore, the considerations of the practical constraints, such as the kinematic and communication limitations of AUVs, collision and obstacle avoidance, make TPMA reliable in the complex marine environments. Simulation results reveal the advantages of the proposed methods by comparisons with the state-of-the-art alternative algorithms.},

Further, several of them also assume perfect knowledge of channel-state-information (CSI). In this paper, we formulate a joint uplink and downlink resource allocation scheme, which assigns both power and channel resources to D2D pairs and cellular users in an underlay network scenario. The objective is to maximize the overall network rate while maintaining fairness among the D2D pairs. In addition, we also consider imperfect CSI, where we guarantee a certain outage probability to maintain the desired quality-of-service (QoS). The resulting problem is a mixed integer non-convex optimization problem and we propose both centralized and decentralized algorithms to solve it, using convex relaxation, fractional programming, and alternating optimization. In the decentralized setting, the computational load is distributed among the D2D pairs and the base station, keeping also a low communication overhead. Moreover, we also provide a theoretical convergence analysis, including also the rate of convergence to stationary points. The proposed algorithms have been experimentally tested in a simulation environment, showing their favorable performance, as compared with the state-of-the-art alternatives.},

  abstract     = {Wireless communication in vehicular networks is highly vulnerable to electromagnetic interference, which seriously undermines the communication effectiveness. Thus, interference estimation and elimination are essential in vehicular communications. To solve the multitasking problem of interference estimation and cancelation within the transformation domain of vehicular communications where they are divided into the consistency and inconsistency based on the different conditions of spectrum sensing, the present study proposes an iterative Bayesian sparse learning approach for simultaneous interference recovery and elimination which applies multiple Bayesian learning for measured signals, and the structured sparse learning method for simultaneous interference mitigation with signal recovery. Furthermore, the updating optimization based on Bayesian estimation framework is performed to facilitate the learning process and improve the performance of interference estimation and signal reconstruction. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms achieved more rapid convergence and more accurate recovery (31.84% and 27.88% higher in spectrum sensing with consistency and inconsistency, respectively) than conventional algorithms. During all iterations, the proposed algorithms, because of updating optimization, were more robust than conventional ones, but the computational complexity remained largely the same. To explore the correlation between the parameters and the interference recovery performance, we performed experiments, which revealed linear, logarithmic, and exponential regression correlations for particular forms of interference. We also compared the demodulation performance of the proposed algorithm with existing methods, and it turned out the proposed algorithm also obtained higher gains on average in the bit error rate.},

We mathematically analyze our proposed channel estimator and find the statistics of the channel estimation errors. These statistics are incorporated into our proposed equalizers to deal with the imperfect channel state information (CSI) effect. We revisit the channel equalization problem for FBMC-based massive MIMO, address the shortcomings of the existing equalizers in the literature, and make them more applicable to practical scenarios. The proposed receiver in this paper consists of two stages. In the first stage, a linear combining of the received signals at the base station (BS) antennas provides a coarse channel equalization and removes any multiuser interference. In the second stage, a per subcarrier fractionally spaced equalizer (FSE) takes care of any residual distortion of the channel for the user of interest. We propose an FSE design based on the equivalent channel at the linear combiner output. This enables the applicability of our proposed technique to small and/or distributed antenna setups such as cell-free massive MIMO. Finally, the efficacy of the proposed techniques is corroborated through numerical analysis.},

The base station with a single radio frequency chain implements the double-beam NOMA transmission by adopting the beam-splitting technique. We develop a unified theoretical performance analysis framework for the proposed scheme, while taking into account the spatially random users, link blockage model, and general distance-based user pairing strategy. By using tools from stochastic geometry, we derive the exact expressions of the coverage probability and the sum rate of the proposed scheme under both the LoS exponential and ball models. We further derive the corresponding upper bound to simplify the analytical expressions.

To address this problem, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), as a promising technique, can intelligently reflect the received signals between UAV and GT to significantly enhance the communication quality. Under this deployment of RIS-assisted UAV, we intend to jointly optimize the 3D-space of the UAV and the phase-shift of the RIS to maximize the data transferring rate of the UAV, while minimizing the UAV propulsion energy. The joint problem is non-convex in its original form and difficult to be timely solved by using traditional method, like successive convex approximation (SCA). Therefore, to facilitate the online decision making to this joint problem, we leverage deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to learn the near-optimal solution, and the well known Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithms are ultilized.

On the other hand, traditional multi-carrier modulation suffers a prohibitive complexity, which can not be implemented with colorred current available silicon technologies. This work proposes a cost-effective way to implement multi-carrier modulation, namely multi-layer quadrature (MLQ) modulation, which requires only two oscillators. As an application example, we apply MLQ modulation to a complementary coded code division multiple access (MLQ-CC-CDMA) system, whose multi-carrier transmission is based on MLQ modulation to mitigate ISI and multi-user interference (MUI) with ideal auto- and cross-correlations of complementary codes. Compared to a frequency domain (FD) CC-CDMA system, MLQ-CC-CDMA has a lower RF complexity. Compared to OFDM direct sequence (DS) CDMA and single carrier frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA) CDMA schemes, MLQ-CC-CDMA achieves a higher spectrum efficiency (SE) and a lower bit error rate with Rake and minimum mean square error (MMSE) detection due to its powerful multipath and multi-carrier diversity gains.},

  abstract     = {Efficient millimeter wave (mmWave) beam selection in vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication is a crucial yet challenging task due to the narrow mmWave beamwidth and high user mobility. To reduce the search overhead of iterative beam discovery procedures, contextual information from light detection and ranging (LIDAR) sensors mounted on vehicles has been leveraged by data-driven methods to produce useful side information. In this paper, we propose a lightweight neural network (NN) architecture along with the corresponding LIDAR preprocessing, which significantly outperforms previous works. Our solution comprises multiple novelties that improve both the convergence speed and the final accuracy of the model. In particular, we define a novel loss function inspired by the knowledge distillation idea, introduce a curriculum training approach exploiting line-of-sight (LOS)/non-line-of-sight (NLOS) information, and we propose a non-local attention module to improve the performance for the more challenging NLOS cases. Simulation results on benchmark datasets show that, utilizing solely LIDAR data and the receiver position, our NN-based beam selection scheme can achieve 79.9% throughput of an exhaustive beam sweeping approach without any beam search overhead and 95% by searching among as few as 6 beams. In a typical mmWave V2I scenario, our proposed method considerably reduces the beam search time required to achieve a desired throughput, in comparison with the inverse fingerprinting and hierarchical beam selection schemes.},

Our objective is to maximize the energy efficiency (EE) of the proposed framework by jointly optimizing base station (BS) clustering, user association, sub-carrier assignment and power allocation. The formulated problem is proved to be NP-hard. By analyzing the structure of the original problem, we decouple it into power allocation sub-problem and sub-carrier assignment sub-problem. For the power allocation sub-problem, we propose sequential minimization technique and Zoutendijk feasible direction method to find the optimal power allocation with fixed sub-carrier assignment. For the sub-carrier assignment sub-problem, we propose genetic algorithm (GA) to represent the BS clustering and sub-carrier assignment, and design two GA based joint optimization frameworks. One is using the power allocation algorithm for fitness evaluation and guiding the evolution of GA. Another is optimizing these two sub-problems in an iterative manner, whereas the optimal sub-carrier assignment is updated timely as any change of the power allocation. Numerical results validate the feasibility, fast convergence, and flexibility of the proposed algorithm, and is superior to conventional MSCA or CoMP enabled HetNets.},

In this paper, we consider cellular connected UAVs (C-UAVs) that are served by massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) links to extend coverage range, while also improving physical layer security and authentication. We consider Rician channel and propose a novel linear precoder design for transmitting data and artificial noise (AN). We derive the closed-form expression of the ergodic secrecy rate of C-UAVs for both conventional and proposed precoder designs. In addition, we obtain the optimal power splitting factor that divides the power between data and AN by asymptotic analysis. Then, we apply the proposed precoder design in the fingerprint embedding authentication framework, where the goal is to minimize the probability of detection of the authentication tag at an eavesdropper. In simulation results, we show the superiority of the proposed precoder in both secrecy rate and the authentication probability considering moderate and large number of antenna massive MIMO scenarios.},

The cell search is an essential function for a User Equipment (UE) to be initially associated with a base station, and is also important to further maintain the wireless connection. Unlike the former generation cellular systems, the 5G UE faces with an additional challenge to detect suitable beams as well as the cell identities in the cell search procedures. Herein, we propose and implement new channel-learning schemes to enhance the performance of 5G beam index detection. The salient point lies in the use of machine learning models and softwarization for practical implementations in a system level. We develop the proposed channel-learning scheme including algorithmic procedures and corroborative system structure for efficient beam index detection. We also implement a real-time operating 5G testbed based on the off-the-shelf Software Defined Radio (SDR) platform and conduct intensive experiments with commercial 5G base stations. The experimental results indicate that the proposed channel-learning schemes outperform the conventional correlation-based scheme in real 5G channel environments.},

Additionally, the opportunistic scheduling scheme is employed, where the optimal relay and the optimal user are selected from the alternative nodes with the maximum instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio. Thereafter, the analytical expressions including ergodic capacity and average symbol error rate (SER) are derived. More specifically, we also present the asymptotic behavior of the average SER at the high signal-to-noise ratio (SRN) regime. The theoretical analysis is validated by the numerical results. Moreover, the results also reveal that the performance of the system can be improved by increasing the number of relays and users under different channel parameters and various modulation schemes.},

  abstract     = {The performance of the recently proposed orientational beamforming (OBF) system for ultra-wideband (UWB) signals degrades seriously in multiuser situation. Although various techniques have been proposed in the literature to suppress multiuser interference in the time-hopping UWB system, there has been no research on interference suppression in the OBF UWB system. In this paper, we propose a nonlinear OBF system via a modified radial basis function (RBF) neural network, named the RBF-OBF system, to reject orientational UWB interferences caused by multiuser transmission in the OBF system. The RBF neural network is selected mainly because of its simple structure, convenient training process, and fast convergence speed. However, the conventional Euclidean-distance-based RBF neural network is not suitable for the training process used in this work, as the training samples are noiseless orientational steering vectors in frequency domain. Therefore, a modified RBF neural network is proposed in this paper, which evaluates the similarity between an input vector and the center vector of a hidden layer neuron by their signed complex correlation coefficient. Numerous simulations demonstrate that compared to the conventional OBF system, the proposed RBF-OBF system can significantly reduce the bit error rates (BERs) under different noise and interference situations. The BER reduction rate of the proposed RBF-OBF system is higher than 92% in additive white Gaussian noise channel and higher than 89% in line-of-sight multipath channel.},

However, most of the existing detection schemes in MIMO enabled NOMA systems focus mainly on the spatial structure in user activity induced by multiantenna reception, while the temporal correlation in user activity has rarely been incorporated for further performance improvement. To address this issue, we propose a novel Multiuser Detection framework in MIMO enabled NOMA (MDMN), which explicitly integrates the temporal correlation in user activity into the detection process to improve the user detection accuracy. Specifically, we first formulate multiuser detection with multiantenna reception in MDMN as a block CS problem, by exploiting the spatial correlation in user activity. Furthermore, through incorporating the temporal correlation in active user sets into block CS, an adaptive CS algorithm based on subspace pursuit is developed for MDMN, named spatial-temporal correlation enhanced adaptive subspace pursuit (STASP). In particular, STASP does not require any prior knowledge of the user sparsity, as the cross validation designed in STASP can properly terminate the algorithm. The superior performance of the proposed MDMN framework and the corresponding algorithms is corroborated by extensive simulation results.},

Furthermore, for improving the decoding performance we design an adaptive encoder which encodes the source packets with dynamic encoding probabilities.

Cognitive radio (CR) has the potential to overcome the issue of spectrum scarcity. By making use of the CR technology, secondary users (SU) can access a radio frequency spectrum other than 802.11p through spectrum sensing. Majority of low complex existing algorithms are based on energy detection that are considering the static environment of SUs. In practice, the algorithms, which considers mobility are mainly focused on low vehicle speed. However, the combined effect of primary user (PU) activity statistics and SU mobility has not been tackled while evaluating the performance of opportunistic spectrum access. In particular, this work considers the joint impact of PU activity and vehicle mobility on spectrum sensing performance by considering single lane and double lane vehicular scenarios. We also evaluate the impact of traffic densities on sensing performance. The main contribution of this work is to show the impact of PU activity statistics on sensing performance by deriving analytical expressions for miss-detection probability.

In multi-connectivity, a mobile user equipment (UE) communicates with multiple base stations simultaneously, where each base station provides a cell group as radio resources to the UE. In this paper, we design an online control policy for downlink transmission in a multi-connectivity environment. Our control policy aims to split incoming traffic of packets into multiple base stations and jointly determine the state of each cell group. Our design constraints include periodical traffic splitting and distributed cell group state decisions subject to limited cell group decision opportunities. Designing control policies that meet these constraints poses significant challenges. By applying the Lyapunov optimization method, we develop a joint control algorithm for real-time traffic splitting and cell group state decisions to satisfy the imposed constraints. Our proposed algorithms are robust and simple enough to be implemented in a real network. We confirm through analysis and simulation that our algorithm achieves optimal performance and outperforms other competitive schemes in terms of the balance between power consumption and queue length.},

  abstract     = {Most works in the literature on parameter estimation with multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems are limited to estimating only the direction of arrival (DOA), and/or based on the far-field assumption. However, the joint estimation of DOA and range is an important challenge for near-field (NF) applications. In addition, backscatter coefficient estimation, as one of the most important parameters of radar systems, has been neglected in existing works. In this paper, the joint estimation of the DOA, range and reflectivity is presented for a MIMO array in the NF. By employing the symmetry property in the array, first, two special spatial expressions based on fourth-order and second-order statistics from the received data are defined so that the output of the first expression lacks targets’ range information. By collecting the information of all the sensors and calculating all the interactions between the transmit and receive sensors based on the first expression, a spatial cumulant matrix is constructed. In two different approaches, with/without the use of eigendecomposition, the virtual steering vectors are extracted. Next, DOAs are estimated by a one-dimensional (1D) spectral search. The second expression, which contains both angle and range information, is used to construct several covariance submatrices and then to construct a covariance matrix with a size corresponding to the array’s dimensions. Then, corresponding ranges are estimated by employing estimated DOAs, eigendecomposition and 1D spectral searches. Finally, the equations required to estimate the reflectivity are derived. The simulation results show the remarkable performance of the proposed method in terms of computational time and estimation accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Millimeter wave (mmWave) communication is one of the critical technologies of the fifth generation mobile communication. It can meet the increasing demand for high-speed railway (HSR) communications services. However, configuring mmWave links, which can be more complicated than that at lower frequency band, is a large source of overhead due to a large number of antennas and high path loss. In this paper, we assume a hybrid frequency system model with both low-frequency band and high-frequency band in the HSR communication scene to meet high data-rate and reliability requirements. Then, we make use of low-band channel information and historical data as the prior information to aid non-uniform mmWave beam selections, which is called Low-Band-and-Historical-Data-Aided-Non-Uniform-Beams-Selection (LBHDANUBS) algorithm. Moreover, we take into account the frequency dependence and time dependence of the same channel to more accurately simulate the characteristics of HSR channels. LBHDANUBS algorithm can not only help to improve the accuracy of beam selections, but also reduce the beam overhead in the training phase and improve the stability of the system. Our simulation results further verify that the proposed scheme based on the low-band information and historical data is superior to the traditional method like exhaustive search and Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) algorithm.},

Multiple antennas make the identification problem more challenging. In this paper, we focus on the problem of detecting the number of transmit antennas in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) cognitive radio systems. A novel identification algorithm is proposed to determine the number of transmit antennas for MIMO systems in the presence of alpha-stable noise. We first introduce the correlation matrix based on the fractional lower order statistics (FLOS) and provide a particular structure of FLOS-based correlation matrix. Then, the eigenvalues of the FLOS-based correlation matrix are employed to construct a test statistic and the central limit theorem is exploited to obtain the decision threshold. Finally, the transmit-antenna number is detected using a serial binary hypothesis test. Simulation results are demonstrated to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed transmit-antenna number detection algorithm for MIMO systems in the presence of alpha-stable noise.},

In particular, cooperation is critical for vehicle-to-everything (V2X) applications that value quality-of-service foremost. However, cooperation is inefficient without strong trust bases. Recently, blockchain arises as a promising solution to decentralized trust, owing to its transparency and immutability. Therefore, we propose a WSP cooperation framework based on blockchain, which keeps a shared ledger on resource utilization. In this paper, we first study the WSP selection problem of vehicles by evolutionary game. Then, we make the blockchain public to vehicles to maintain its decentralization and enhance its security by crowdsourcing idle computing resources from vehicles. To deal with the mobility of vehicles, as well as to improve the consensus efficiency, we propose delegated proof-of-work (DPoW) scheme, which introduces delegate nodes for participating in the blockchain consensus on behalf of the vehicles. The alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) optimization framework is further used to derive optimal consensus parameters including block size, computing resource demand of delegate nodes, and prices paid for vehicles. We conduct extensive simulations to show the effectiveness of the proposed methods.},

In this paper, we analyze the physical layer security (PLS) of a downlink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) network through an IRS intended for assisting the wireless transmission, taking into account the external and internal eavesdropping scenarios. Considering the hardware limitations, a 1-bit coding scheme is utilized to investigate the secrecy performance of the IRS-aided NOMA (IRS-NOMA) network. Exact and asymptotic expressions in terms of the secrecy outage probability (SOP) and the effective secrecy throughput (EST) are presented, which are in consideration of the imperfect successive interference cancellation (ipSIC) and perfect SIC (pSIC). Based on the analytical results, the secrecy diversity orders are related to the number of reflecting elements and EST ceilings are observed in the high SNR regime. Monte Carlo simulations are presented to corroborate the correctness of the analyses and illustrate that the IRS-NOMA scheme is superior in the secrecy outage performance to the IRS-aided orthogonal multiple access scheme. In addition, the SOP performance enhancement through the increased number of reflecting elements and the improvement of EST through proper target secrecy rate are also evidenced by the simulations.},

  abstract     = {Information dissemination in vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) is inseparable from the interaction between vehicles and infrastructure. The trust authority (TA) often plays a pivotal role in VANETs and requires interaction with multiple vehicles. However, when the TA sends the same message to multiple vehicles, there are many redundancies, as it needs to negotiate with each vehicle and send them different ciphertexts. This greatly reduces the work efficiency of the TA. To the best of our knowledge, there is no research on the problem of redundancy that occurs when the same message is sent to multiple vehicles in VANETs. The proposed scheme adopts identity-based broadcast encryption (IBBE) technology, which is a secure data-sharing scheme suitable for the vehicle-to-infrastructure communication mode, in VANETs for the first time. Thus, with only one encryption, the TA can generate a fixed-length ciphertext for a group of vehicles. When there are new vehicles that subsequently request a service, the TA can assign encryption tasks to the proxy server. In terms of security, our scheme meets the particular requirements of VANETs. The encryption overhead of the sender and the length of the ciphertext were comparatively analyzed. The results demonstrated that the performance of the scheme improved significantly. Thus, our scheme can prevent redundancies and effectively improve the work efficiency of TA.},

  abstract     = {Rollover accidents are more likely to occur with Heavy-Duty Vehicles (HDV) due to the high center of gravity and large size. A dynamic rollover index ( RI ) can describe the transient nature and responses of vehicle states. This study proposes an improved RI to detect real-time rollover events in tripped and untripped conditions. The RI combines the roll-plane dynamics of the sprung and unsprung mass and even fully considers vehicle suspension dynamics under uncertain external road inputs. Moreover, a low-cost unknown input observer (UIO) is designed to estimate vehicle roll angle under the uncertain disturbance of road bank. The updating improved RI is in terms of quasi-constant parameters, estimated states and external perturbation. A parameter estimation algorithm based on the Normalized Least Mean Square (NLMS) is developed to observe unmeasurable and time-varying parameters. Furthermore, by investigating the thresholds of roll angle and lateral acceleration, a dynamic predictive rollover threshold is determined with state constraints. The results demonstrate that the proposed parameters estimator is capable of estimating the c. g. height, roll moment of inertial, suspension roll stiffness, and suspension roll damping within acceptable errors in different driving scenarios. Moreover, the improved RI can strictly detect rollover in a complex driving scenario. Finally, the proposed dynamic RI threshold reduces invalid rollover warnings, predicates the rollover risk and guarantees sufficient response time for controller delay.},

Besides, a handling inverse dynamics model, including time-varying vehicle speed, is established for the automated controller, and the Multi-stage Gaussian pseudo-spectral method (GPM) is designed to solve the optimal control problem. With a shared fuzzy controller based on the state assessment, the controller generates outputs that can relieve the driver&#39;s burden. Finally, the shared control framework is validated in both overtaking and emergency obstacle avoidance scenarios.

In order to reduce the voltage variation when PMSGs provide power for the rectifier load in diesel railway vehicles, an optimal method is presented to design a 9-phase PMSG. This optimal method not only ensures the open-circuit voltage of the generator equals the rated voltage of the load, but also it guarantees the PMSG has a low voltage change rate at the same time. In this paper, the saliency ratio range and the relationship between resistance of load and the induction of d -axis are derived according to the two-axis theory, when the PMSG has the negative or zero voltage change rate. Then based on the result of the derivation, by adding the I-shaped permanent magnet (PM) to the d -axis magnetic circuit of V-shaped interior PM rotor, a V-I-shaped PMSG is formed. After that, the Kriging method and the finite-element method (FEM) are used to establish a multi-objective function model. By calculating the minimum value of the multi-objective function, the construct dimension of the I-shaped PM is obtained. After the optimal design results are verified by the FEM, a 520 kVA 9-phase PMSG is manufactured to validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.},

Secondly, combined with the proposed preview model and considering the vehicle dynamic characteristics, an upper level controller of MPC is created to track the lateral deviation, heading angle deviation, sideslip angle and yaw rate to obtain the optimal solution of front wheel angle and additional yaw moment, which realize the control of handling stability while ensuring the trajectory tracking accuracy at same time.

Finally, through the co-simulation of MATLAB / Simulink and CarSim and the hardware-in-the-loop experiment, it is verified that the proposed integrated control strategy can effectively improve the path tracking accuracy and ensure the vehicle handling stability at high speed. Compared with the general MPC strategy, who does not control the sideslip angle and yaw rate with no preview model, the cumulative lateral tracking error of the integrated control is reduced by 51.9% and 87.7% respectively.},

First, we propose a Bayesian detector based on structured generalized likelihood ratio test (SGLRT), namely BSGLRT, criteria that requires no training data. Then, we present a detector based on the Bayesian unstructured generalized likelihood ratio test (BUGLRT) to reduce the three dimensions (range-angle-Doppler) search into one-dimension Doppler searches for low-complexity implementation in practical applications. Moreover, the robustness of the BSGLRT and BUGLRT detectors is also analyzed. Numerical results reveal that the proposed Bayesian detectors and estimators, i.e. BSGLRT and BUGLRT, outperform their non-Bayesian counterparts in Gaussian clutter with a small number of snapshots and/or low signal-to-clutter rate (SCR) for FDA-MIMO radar.},

In this context, vehicle-environment cooperative control can be integrated into next-generation vehicles to further improve the vehicle&#39;s performance, in particular energy efficiency. Accurate prediction of future velocity profiles on basis of IoVs can be a critical breakthrough, which can contribute much to vehicle operation efficiency promotion. In this paper, an integrated velocity prediction (IVP) method fully taking advantage of IoVs is proposed and demonstrated through a case study. In the IVP method, both the macroscopically and microscopically predicted velocity profiles are considered. The macroscopic velocity profiles are predicted via traffic flow analysis (TFA) in multi-access edge computing units (MECUs) which are situated alongside the route. Microscopic velocity profiles are forecasted through Mondrian forest (MF) algorithm in the on-board vehicle control unit (VCU). Final velocity prediction is generated through combination of the macroscopic and microscopic profiles in frequency domain in on-board VCU through fast Fourier transform (FFT) and inverse FFT. A case study validates the distinguished performance of IVP method and demonstrates its significant contribution to vehicle performance improvement.},

  abstract     = {The boom of electric vehicles (EVs) has urged new designs and applications of power conversion technologies. Power converters, as one of the most critical components in EV battery systems, have seen significant developments in recent years. However, thus far forward design approaches for power converter topologies have been widely adopted, which are based on engineers’ empirical knowledge and instinct. This has been deemed having low design efficiency with high randomness and limited applicability, due to the absence of a systematic guideline. This approach, though widely adopted, can no longer meet the increasingly stringent and diverse needs of today’s research and industry, with the emerging trend of renewable energy sources. Aware of these drawbacks, in this study, we propose a novel reverse design approach through establishing general polynomial relations between the topology and voltage gain of high-step-up converters, which are found to be functions of basic boost converters’ voltage gains. With this newly formed polynomial relation, a generalized approach to devising power converters for various industrial needs can be derived, which is baptized the General Polynomial Reverse Design (GPRD) approach. Three polynomial converters are derived as examples to validate the proposed method, whereby their functionality and performances are verified and tested by prototype experiments, which substantiate the proposed design theory.},

  abstract     = {Positioning technology is an important component of environmental perception and the basis of decision-making and motion control for intelligent vehicles. Current independent positioning methods inevitably have defects and poor environmental adaptability. To improve positioning accuracy and stability using low-cost sensors, a multi-sensor fusion positioning strategy for intelligent vehicles using global pose graph optimization is proposed in this paper. This strategy complements the advantages of multiple sensors to obtain global optimal positioning results, and it can cope with a variety of challenging working conditions. Considering the fast response of the inertial measurement unit (IMU) and the advantages of a camera without drift, this strategy realizes the tightly coupled fusion of vision and the IMU to obtain the optimal pose of visual-inertial odometry (VIO) by nonlinear optimization. Moreover, this strategy refines the modeling of the IMU, and proposes a keyframe selection strategy to deal with driving in a straight line without obvious feature changes, turning, and other driving conditions. Taking into account the versatility of the global positioning system (GPS) and the low cost of the network real-time kinematic (NRTK) positioning, the output of VIO and GPS/NRTK is adaptively fused through global pose graph optimization to maintain global consistency. Finally, the multi-sensor fusion positioning strategy is verified using the KITTI dataset on the ROS simulation platform. The results show that the multi-sensor fusion positioning strategy for intelligent vehicles has better accuracy and environmental adaptability at a lower cost than state-of-the-art strategies.},

Due to the complicated aging mechanism and realistic noise operation environment, direct predicting RUL with the measured data recorded in practice is challenging. In this work, a novel hybrid approach to forecasting battery future capacity and RUL is proposed by combining the improved variational modal decomposition (VMD), particle filter (PF) and gaussian process regression (GPR). The VMD algorithm is employed to decompose the recorded battery capacity data into an aging trend sequence and several residual sequences, where the number of modal layers is produced by the proposed posterior feedback confidence (PFC) method. The prediction models of PF and GPR algorithm are then respectively established to predict the aging trend sequence and residual sequences. Future capacity and RUL prediction experiments for battery pack and battery cells are performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid approach, and the compared experiment results demonstrate that the proposed approach offers wide generality and reduced errors.},

Sequentially, a fuzzy controller is developed based on analysis of control rules for different working conditions on the basis of the structure. Furthermore, the stability of the proposed strategy is strictly proven by Lyapunov’s stability theory and phase plane analysis. Finally, a coupled thermal management model is built in AMEsim, and co-simulation between MATLAB/Simulink and AMEsim is developed.

This limit misalignment may cause the dynamic wireless charging system to malfunction because of the large fluctuation in mutual inductance.

In the ARSC structure, the transmission coil is smaller than the receiving coil in size to smoothen the fluctuation in mutual inductance. The receiving coil consists of a large coil ( &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\boldsymbol{R}_{\mathrm {x1}}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; ) and a small coil ( &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\boldsymbol{R}_{\mathrm {x2}}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; ) and &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\boldsymbol{R}_{\mathrm {x1}}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; is reversely connected to &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\boldsymbol{R}_{\mathrm {x2}}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; in series. The purpose of this design is to further reduce the fluctuation in mutual inductance. A calculation method of mutual inductance is then proposed based on the vector potential to calculate the mutual inductance of the ARSC structure. The law of mutual inductance is analyzed by the proposed calculation method for the ARSC structure. Moreover, an optimization method of coil parameters is proposed to obtain quasi-constant mutual inductance. The ARSC structure and optimization method are not only simple but can also make the mutual inductance nearly constant. Calculation, simulation, and experimental results validating the proposed method and structure are shown.},

  abstract     = {The equivalent consumption minimization strategy (ECMS) has been considered as a practical energy management strategy for the hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) because it can be implemented in real time while providing satisfactory performance. However, it is still challenging to adjust an equivalent factor (EF) to its own optimal value in real time because the EF is fundamentally affected by the current driving condition. Although many adaptive ECMSs (A-ECMSs) have been developed to adjust the EF based on a charge-sustaining condition, they do not adequately respond to a change in the driving conditions. In this study, a novel ECMS for the HEVs is proposed to provide the near-optimal performance by considering actual driving conditions. First, the near-optimal condition for the EF is defined to consider a driving condition. Based on it, an iterative scheme is presented to numerically obtain the near-optimal EF. Then, the convergence analysis of the iterative scheme is conducted with practical considerations to implementing the proposed method into real-world applications. Simulation results show that the proposed strategy has better adaptability to changes in the driving conditions with a smaller loss of optimality than conventional A-ECMS which relies only on the charge-sustaining condition. The proposed strategy is also experimentally validated under real-world driving conditions.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous vehicles have been highlighted as a major growth area for future transportation systems and the deployment of large numbers of these vehicles is expected when safety and legal challenges are overcome. To meet the necessary safety standards, effective collision avoidance technologies are required to ensure that the number of accidents are kept to a minimum. As large numbers of autonomous vehicles, operating together on roads, can be regarded as a swarm system, we propose a bio-inspired collision avoidance strategy using virtual pheromones; an approach that has evolved effectively in nature over many millions of years. Previous research using virtual pheromones showed the potential of pheromone-based systems to maneuver a swarm of robots. However, designing an individual controller to maximise the performance of the entire swarm is a major challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based approach that is able to train a controller that introduces collision avoidance behaviour. To accelerate training, we propose a novel sampling strategy called Highlight Experience Replay and integrate it with a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm with noise added to the weights and biases of the artificial neural network to improve exploration. To evaluate the performance of the proposed DRL-based controller, we applied it to navigation and collision avoidance tasks in three different traffic scenarios. The experimental results showed that the proposed DRL-based controller outperformed the manually-tuned controller in terms of stability, effectiveness, robustness and ease of tuning process. Furthermore, the proposed Highlight Experience Replay method outperformed than the popular Prioritized Experience Replay sampling strategy by taking 27% of training time average over three stages.},

  abstract     = {As one of the most important systems of high-speed train (HST), bogie system matters when it comes to the safety and reliability of HST operation. In order to strengthen feature propagation and alleviate vanishing gradients problems in training deep-learning networks, a novel Dense-Squeeze Network based on one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (1D-CNN) is proposed for bogie fault diagnosis. On the one hand, dense blocks are capable of facilitating feature reuse and increasing the depth of feature propagation. On the other hand, the squeeze operation automatically measures the importance level of each feature channel, and then enhance the useful features and suppress the useless features for the current task. The experimental results tested by the HST model CRH380 A at different speeds verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, and the accuracy of fault diagnosis converges to 99.66%. Compared with other deep-learning-based methods, such as 1D-CNN, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and DenseNet, the superiority of the proposed scheme is demonstrated clearly.},

The objective is to reproduce customised vehicle motion profile that is statistically comparable to a human driver with a proper trade-off between vehicle speed-acceleration profile and tracking accuracy. A combined longitudinal and lateral MPC controller with a novel feature-based parametric cost function is designed to perform the path tracking task under different road conditions. A high precision data logging system is developed to collect human driving demonstration data. From the analysis of the collected data, relevant features are chosen based on their applicability to produce a customised motion profile while performing AV’s path tracking task. Next, a bi-level optimisation-based Inverse Optimal Controller (IOC) is designed to learn the cost function’s parameters using the human demonstration data. The outcomes of the study show that the proposed controller can effectively regenerate some characteristics of human driving, including speed, longitudinal and lateral accelerations, and yaw rate.},

In this paper, an intelligent speed control strategy for uncertain cut-in scenarios is established based on a basic autonomous driving system. This strategy judges cut-in maneuver from surrounding vehicles and outputs adaptive control action under current environment according to Q value of state-action pair based on a Q network. In addition, according to the analysis of cut-in scenarios, the Q network is trained based on a novel reinforcement learning method named as experience screening deep Q-learning network (ES-DQN). The proposed ES-DQN is an extension of double deep Q-learning network (DDQN) algorithm, and includes two parts: experience screening and policy learning. Based on the experience screened from the experience screening part, the proposed learning method can train an intelligent speed control strategy which has stronger adaptability and control effect in uncertain cut-in scenarios. According to simulation results, the proposed intelligent speed control strategy trained by ES-DQN has better performance under uncertain cut-in scenarios than DDQN method and traditional ACC strategy. Meanwhile, by adjusting weight value in reward function, the system can realize different control target.},

In particular, a Multi-intersection Vehicular Cooperative Control (MiVeCC) is proposed to enable cooperation among vehicles in a large area with multiple unsignalized intersections. Firstly, a vehicular end-edge-cloud computing framework is proposed to facilitate end-edge-cloud vertical cooperation and horizontal cooperation among vehicles. Under the framework, a two-stage reinforcement learning is implemented to obtain the optimal policy for vehicle control. To support RL in the proposed framework, a multi-vehicle state representation method and a safety-oriented value representation method are designed. The former structures the collected vehicle information, and the latter evaluates the traffic condition. A multi-intersection simulation platform is developed to evaluate the proposed scheme. Simulation results show that the proposed MiVeCC can improve travel efficiency at multiple intersections by up to 4.59 times without collision compared with benchmark methods.},

However, the long battery charging time and lack of sufficient charging infrastructure highly restrict the popularization of EVs. In this context, it is promising to establish battery charging and swapping systems (BCSSs) based on the concept of battery swapping services. To optimally achieve the combined operation of BCSSs, this paper proposes a hybrid swapped battery charging and logistics dispatch model in continuous time domain. Identifying the special structure of the mathematical models of the two problems, this paper innovatively formulated the swapped battery charging strategy as the rectangle packing problem and the battery logistics model as the vehicle routing problem. The two models are closely linked by the delivery time of transporting the well-charged batteries from battery charging stations to battery swapping stations. A hybrid optimal operation model of BCSSs is further formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming model by incorporating the interaction between the battery charging and battery logistics. Finally, case studies are conducted on several BCSSs and numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed model.},

It acquires the multi-modal data through a vehicle with six cameras and four LiDAR for a 360-degree field of view and collected 180 clips of 20-second synchronized images at 20 Hz and point clouds at 10 Hz. Particularly, we applied a 128-beam LiDAR to provide Hi-Res point clouds to better understand the 3D environment and sensor fusion.

Moreover, we provide four benchmarks for all tasks to evaluate algorithms and conduct extensive experiments of 2D/3D detection and segmentation on OpenMPD.

The CS obtains the strategy of taxi and adjusts the charging price to maximize its revenues.

With the responsibility of transporting passengers in a safe, comfortable and efficient way, the decision making method plays a critical position in the autonomous driving of high-speed trains. Focusing on solving the autonomous decision making problem, this paper proposes a novel learning based framework by combining the deep learning technology with the distributed tracking control approach. To cope with the data insufficiency problem in training the deep learning network, a generative adversarial network (GAN) based data argumentation scheme is proposed to generate data samples that have the same distribution with actual data samples, and a hybrid learning network is constructed to predict the speed trajectory from the multi-attribute data with both temporal sequences and static features. Then, based on the model predictive control (MPC) scheme, a distributed tracking control model is formulated to minimize the tracking deviations and balance the performance of punctuality, energy-efficiency and riding comfort. Further, the dual decomposition technique is adopted to deal with the coupling constraints for the safe distance headway such that the separation for the autonomous driving of high-speed trains is achieved. Finally, simulation experiments based on actual scenarios of the Beijing-Shanghai high-speed railway are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of our methods.},

  abstract     = {This paper develops a novel homography-based visual servo control method for the vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) tracking the trajectory of a 6 degrees of freedom (6-DOF) moving ship. Different from the classical homography-based visual servoing which is only suitable for the trajectory tracking of a planar moving target, an extended homography-based visual servoing framework is proposed to track the trajectory of a 6-DOF moving target regardless of its time-varying rotational motion. Taking entries in the homography matrix as feedback, the visual dynamics of UAV is established and decoupled into a translational motion sub-dynamics and an attitude sub-dynamics based on the hierarchical control strategy. In the translational motion subsystem, the robust controller is designed by embedding the nonlinear differentiator, the adaptive method, and a smooth saturation model in the backstepping control scheme. The saturation model is introduced to generate the constrained control inputs to ensure the nonsingular attitude extraction and help the visual points remain in the camera’s field of view (FoV) simultaneously. In the attitude subsystem, a robust state-constrained control method is proposed by utilizing a robust control barrier function (RCBF), the quadratic programming (QP) and a saturation model to guarantee the visibility, where RCBF can accommodate unknown dynamics. The theoretical analysis demonstrates the asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system. Simulations are carried out to further validate the controller performance.},

The optimum velocity profile is sought for a predefined road path from a specific starting point to a final one within specific and given boundaries and constraints in order to minimize the motion sickness and the journey time. An empirical approach based on British standard is used to evaluate motion sickness. The trade-off between minimizing motion sickness and journey time is investigated through multi-objective optimization by altering the weighting factors. The correlation between sickness and journey time is represented as a Pareto front because of their conflicting relation. The compromise between the two components is quantified along the curve, while the severity of the sickness is determined using frequency analysis. In addition, three case studies are developed to investigate the effect of driving style, vehicle speed, and road width, which can be considered among the main factors affecting motion sickness. According to the results, the driving style has higher impact on both motion sickness and journey time compared to the vehicle speed and the road width. The benefit of higher vehicle speed gives shorter journey time while maintaining relatively lower illness rating compared with lower vehicle speed. The effect of the road width is negligible on both sickness and journey time when travelling on a longer road. The results pave the path for the development of vehicular technologies to implement for real-world driving from the outcomes of this paper.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous pilot is crucial in integrally promoting the autonomy of an unmanned surface vehicle (USV). However, the integration mechanism of decision and control is still unclear within the entire autonomy. In this paper, by organically bridging path planning and tracking, an autonomous pilot framework with waypoints generation, path smoothing and policy guidance of a USV in congested waters is established, for the first time. Incorporating elite and diversity operations into the genetic algorithm (GA), an elite-duplication GA (EGA) strategy is devised to optimally generate sparse waypoints in a constrained space. The B-spline technique is further deployed to make flexibly smooth interpolation facilitating path smoothing supported by optimal sparse-waypoints. Seamlessly bridged by the parametric smooth path, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) technique is resorted to continuously extract in-depth pilotage policies, i.e., mappings from path tracking errors, collision risks and control constraints to continuous control forces/torques. Eventually, the entire spline-bridged EGA-DRL (SED) framework merits autonomous global-pilotage and local-reaction in an organically modular manner. Comprehensive validations and comparisons in various real-world geographies demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed SED autonomous pilot framework.},

  abstract     = {The energy management strategy is the key factor for hybrid vehicles since it determines how efficiently the engine power is transferred to the wheels. As a local-optimal and implementable strategy, the equivalent consumption minimization strategy is of great research interest. The equivalent factor and the gain coefficient of penalty function are two important parameters in the strategy that need to be determined in advance. It is challenging to choose these parameters to achieve minimum fuel consumption in different on-road driving cycles. For some off-road vehicles, such as wheel loaders, the loading cycle is highly repetitive. This brings a great opportunity to optimize these parameters cycle-to-cycle. In this study, an adaptive equivalent consumption minimization strategy is applied to a series hydraulic hybrid wheel loader. A cycle-to-cycle tuning scheme is developed where the equivalent factor and the gain coefficient of penalty function are optimized through repetitive loading cycles. The potential with parameter optimization in different loading cycles is identified. Results show a fuel-saving with the cycle-to-cycle optimization method of up to 6.36% in a 57 s loading cycle.},

  abstract     = {Given its ability to control and manipulate wireless environments, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), also known as intelligent reflecting surface (IRS), has emerged as a key enabler technology for the six-generation (6G) cellular networks. In the meantime, vehicular environment radio propagation is negatively influenced by a large set of objects that cause transmission distortion such as high buildings. Therefore, this work is devoted to explore the area of RIS technology integration with vehicular communications while considering the dynamic nature of such communication environment. Specifically, we provide a system model where RoadSide Unit (RSU) leverages RIS to provide indirect wireless transmissions to disconnected areas, known as dark zones. Dark zones are spots within RSU coverage where the communication links are blocked due to the existence of blockages. In details, a discrete RIS is utilized to provide communication links between the RSU and the vehicles passing through out-of-service zones. Therefore, the joint problem of RSU resource scheduling and RIS passive beamforming or phase-shift matrix is formulated as an optimization problem with the objective of maximizing the minimum average bit rate. The formulated problem is mixed integer non-convex program which is difficult to be solved and does not account for the uncertain dynamic environment in vehicular networks. Thereby, we resort to alternative methods based on Deep Reinforcement Learning to determine RSU wireless scheduling and Block Coordinate Descent (BCD) to solve for the phase-shift matrix, i.e., passive beamforming, of the RIS. The Markov Decision Process (MDP) is defined and the complexity of the solution approach is discussed. Our numerical results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach over baseline techniques.},

Platooning allows for increased road utilization and reduced fuel consumption due to short inter-vehicular distances. Safety in terms of guaranteeing no rear-end collisions is of utmost importance for platooning systems to be deployed in practice. We compare how safely emergency braking can be handled by emerging vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications on the one hand and by radar-based measurements of existing automatic emergency braking systems (AEBS) on the other. We show that even under conservative assumptions on the V2V communications, such an approach significantly outperforms AEBS with an ideal radar sensor in terms of allowed inter-vehicle distances and response times. Furthermore, we design two emergency braking strategies for platooning based on V2V communications. The first braking strategy assumes centralized coordination by the leading vehicle and exploits necessary optimal conditions of a constrained optimization problem, whereas the second – the more conservative solution – assumes only local information and is distributed in nature. Both strategies are also compared with the AEBS.},

The hybrid RFID tag operates in dual mode, which includes conventional RFID operation, and tag active transmission. The reader provides the carrier in conventional RFID communication, using which the tag performs backscatter modulation. In tag active transmit mode, the reader does not provide any carrier, and the tag synthesizes its own carrier for communication. The hybrid tag can communicate with the reader for a range of 21 in. A commercial seat belt sensor was integrated with the tag and a working prototype of the complete system was demonstrated. Time response is a critical parameter for the whole system to work coherently and hence the operational states were modeled for time estimation and address the key parameters. Individual subsystems within the tag and reader circuits are presented in detail to capture the complete system. The proposed system can reduce the effective on-time of the reader significantly and the analysis shows that the reader transmit time can be reduced as much as 90% compared to the conventional RFID reader. The system was validated by designing, fabricating, and testing of the tag and reader circuits within a lab environment.},

Each tier in the architecture consists of vertically interconnected node clusters that may be operated by different service providers. Blocks of IoT data are accepted by a cluster tier by tier, until they reach the top tier which adds them to the global blockchain and makes them available to client applications. To allow for large geographical coverage and reduce the dependency on any individual node in the cluster, clusters run a multiple entry version of the Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) consensus algorithm. We describe an analytical model of the system and find the optimal allocation of clusters and nodes within clusters for a given number of tiers and system coverage area. Our results show that the total number of orderers for given system coverage and total load are main predictors of the block linking time, and indicate that minimizing block linking time is easier to achieve with a smaller number of tiers and large number of clusters with a smaller number of orderers per cluster. These observations can be used as guidelines for planning and dimensioning of multi-tier cluster architectures that create and maintain blockchain structures in a given coverage area.},

  abstract     = {Automotive radars have faced to various jamming signals with different types and parameters. One counter measure is to identify the fine-grained modulation types of these jamming signals, which can provide supplementary information for intercepting. Most existing signal modulation recognition methods attempt to establish a machine-learning mechanism by training with a large number of annotated samples, which is hardly applicable in real-world electronic reconnaissance scenarios where only a few samples can be intercepted in advance. Few-Shot Learning aims to learn from base classes with many samples and infuse this knowledge to support classes with only a few samples, thus realizing model generalization. In this paper, inspired by the fact that the energy distribution of the signal of interest is always concentrated in time-frequency images, a novel few-shot learning framework based on foreground segmentation is proposed, which benefits from its powerful filtering to remove the noise and clutter from background. The experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve excellent performance for fine-grained signal modulation recognition even with only one support sample and is robust under different signal-to-noise-ratio conditions.},

The proposed framework determines the lower and upper dispatch limits of PV generation considering the worst-case realization of a) the minimum and maximum storage capacity of EVs, b) the minimum and maximum power dispatch of EVs, c) the lower and upper bounds for the arrival and departure times, and d) the available energy at arrival and departure times. The unbalanced operation of the distribution network as well as the uncertainty in the maximum PV generation and demand forecasts were considered. The problem formulation and solution approach are validated using the modified IEEE 34-bus and IEEE 123-bus distribution systems. The impacts of the budget of uncertainty and the vehicle-to-grid operation mode of EV clusters were addressed in the case studies. It is shown that integrating EVs with charging capability will increase the lower dispatch limit or increase the upper dispatch limit of the PV generation. Moreover, the increase in the budget of uncertainty will reduce the difference between the upper and lower dispatch limits by increasing the lower dispatch or decreasing the upper dispatch limit of the PV generation. Finally, it is shown that the vehicle-to-grid capability will reduce the total lower dispatch limit or increase the total upper dispatch limit of the PV generation in the operation horizon.},

To reflect real THz ultra massive MIMO communications, the characteristic of nano-material array antenna and the high loss of THz bands are considered in channel modeling. Based on the proposed geometry-based stochastic model (GBSM), power delay profile (PDP), space-time-frequency correlation function, and the Doppler power spectral density are derived and analyzed. Furthermore, the proposed model is validated by comparing the simulated results with the measurement reference. Influences of channel parameters, namely, antenna element spacing, carrier frequency, number and location of clusters, on the correlation functions are investigated. The results indicate that antenna element spacing and number of clusters have significant impacts on channel correlation, and the decreasing of correlation function becomes slower when antenna element spacing decreases. Moreover, location of clusters also affects the drop rate of correlation function. The influences of the number of clusters and concentration of intra-cluster multipath components (MPCs) on the Doppler power spectral density are analyzed. It is found that a larger number of clusters and a more concentrated distribution of intra-cluster MPCs increase the degree of Doppler spectrum variation. The proposed channel model and the corresponding statistical properties are insightful for designing and realizing THz ultra massive MIMO systems for 6G and beyond.},

Then, we statistically analyze the path loss and derive a closed-form expression for its probability distribution function (PDF). Utilizing the derived PDF, we derive an approximate closed-form bit error rate (BER) expression. We confirm the accuracy of derived BER expression through comparison with Monte Carlo simulation results and demonstrate the effect of transceiver and infrastructure parameters such as receiver aperture, pole height, car height, lateral shift, and spacing between light poles on the BER performance.},

We show that this class of fading models can be expressed in terms of a continuous mixture of an underlying Rician (or Rician shadowed) fading model, averaged over the phase distributions of the specular waves. The proposed model parameters can be adjusted to tailor the statistical distribution of the received radio signal power to a wide variety of wireless scenarios, some of which are not covered by other state-of-the-art stochastic wireless channel models. In this regard, we verify that the proposed models accurately fit experimental measurements for which their multi-modality cannot be properly captured by other current stochastic models. It is shown that the fluctuations of the specular components have a detrimental impact on performance, and it is formally demonstrated that the lower error rate is obtained when the signal power is concentrated on a single specular component, regardless of whether it fluctuates or not.},

  abstract     = {Considering the continuance feature of the spectrum idle state observed from our spectrum measurements, in this paper, we propose a novel SK ipping b A sed spec T rum s E nsing (SKATE) scheme for cognitive radio (CR) transmissions. Instead of sensing at each time slot, we skip the sensing process in some following slots if a band is captured in an idle state, so that the sensing cost could be reduced significantly. For the STAKE scheme, how to determine the number of slots to skip is the key, where more slots could bring more benefits, but also with a higher probability to cause collisions. Since the perfect knowledge on spectrum environment might be hardly obtainable in practice, to enable the device to predict the spectrum state effectively and achieve the optimal joint decision on both band selection and skipped slots, we develop a reinforcement learning (RL) based solution for the SKATE scheme to make it learn the optimal strategy asymptotically. Both real and simulated spectrum data are adopted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RL based SKATE scheme.},

Then, for the user uniformly distributing in the circular area, we prove that deploying the UAV anchors with symmetrical horizontal-angles and same distance to the area center can minimize or almost minimize the MSE lower-bound, whereas such distance needs to be determined, neither increasing nor decreasing it can always improve the average MSE. A problem to find such distance is formulated and furthermore converted to a form that can be solved by one-dimensional search, based on which, we propose to deploy the anchors where the minimum MSE lower-bound is achieved for minimizing MSE.

Given the major challenge due to incomplete knowledge (i.e., each agent knows only its own information), we establish an adversarial game with partial-observation feature to formulate an optimization problem, and propose a counterfactual regret minimization learning scheme to achieve the correlated equilibrium for both the UAV and attacker.

However, the error caused by non-line-of-sight (NLOS) propagation significantly affects the localization performance. In this paper, a novel method combining V2V communication and NLOS identification is proposed to improve accuracy of vehicle localization in NLOS scenarios. First, the algorithm identifies NLOS links with statistical methods. In this step, identification is conducted by decision theory or z-test, which depends on whether priori NLOS information is known or not. After that, NLOS links are discarded. Using the information including length of remaining links and GPS positions of surrounding vehicles, the estimated positions of target vehicles can be obtained by multilateration. It is shown by simulations that the proposed algorithm outperforms several classical methods in accuracy. Specifically, when priori NLOS information is available, 80% of vehicles have a localization error less than 5 m. For the case where NLOS information cannot be obtained, the algorithm still have good performance, and the ratio of vehicles having error within 5 m reaches 70%.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) unleashes the full potential of training a global statistical model collaboratively from edge clients. In wireless FL, for the scarcity of spectrum, only a fraction of clients are capable to participate in the FL training in each round. On the other hand, the performance of FL suffers from the label noise, which naturally exists in the dataset of each client. To alleviate the label noise issue, prior works proposed several client selection algorithms, where the privacy of raw data might be compromised when extra information exchange was introduced. To avoid extra information exchange in FL, we propose to leverage an algorithm that measures the noise ratio of each client based on a clean validation dataset. We then propose an online client selection framework, supported by Copeland score and multi-arm bandits, which can select the client set with low noise ratios efficiently. The proposed algorithm is performed in the server side, thereby it can be implemented in the basic FL framework seamlessly. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm spends less training time while guaranteeing the required accuracy compared to other baseline algorithms.},

In this correspondence, we propose a novel active RIS design to enhance the secure wireless transmission, where the reflecting elements in RIS not only adjust the phase shift but also amplify the amplitude of signals. To solve the non-convex secrecy rate optimization based on this design, an efficient alternating optimization algorithm is proposed to jointly optimize the beamformer at transmitter and reflecting coefficient matrix at RIS. Simulation results show that with the aid of active RIS design, the impact of “double fading” effect can be effectively relieved, resulting in a significantly higher secrecy performance gain compared with existing solutions with passive RIS and without RIS design.},

Existing stochastic geometry models for streets, e.g., Poisson line processes (PLP) and Manhattan line processes (MLP) lack an important aspect of city-wide street networks: streets are denser in the city center and sparse near the suburbs. Contrary to these models, the BLP restricts the generating points of the streets to a fixed radius centered at the origin of the Euclidian plane, thereby capturing the inhomogeneity of the streets with respect to the distance from the center. We derive a closed-form expression for the contact distribution of the BLP from a random location on the plane. Leveraging this, we introduce the novel Binomial line Cox process (BLCP) to emulate points on individual lines of the BLP and derive the distribution to the nearest BLCP point from an arbitrary location. Using numerical results, we highlight that the spatial configuration of the streets is remarkably distinct from the perspective of a city center user to that of a suburban user. The framework developed in this paper can be integrated with the existing models of line processes for more accurate characterization of streets in urban and suburban environments.},

An optimization problem to maximize ECT is also formulated, and then the optimal transmit power and block-length are obtained, respectively.

Reducing mutual coupling does not guarantee an eventual reduction of the overall correlation and vice versa. In general, it is not a trivial task to reduce mutual coupling and correlation simultaneously in arbitrary multipath environments. In this correspondence, a planar metamaterial structure (PMS) and an array-antenna decoupling surface (ADS) are applied to the antenna array for simultaneous reductions of correlations and mutual couplings. The PMS comprises regularly arranged metamaterial elements holding certain transmission features. The ADS placed between the PMS and array is a substrate with printed rectangular metal strips. A 1 × 4 patch array is taken as an example to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. According to the simulated and measured results, the combination of PMS and ADS can work together without interfering or affecting the matching condition of the antennas. As a result, the mutual coupling and overall correlation between the antenna elements are reduced in a general multipath environment.},

In this paper, we propose a novel decentralized Gaussian message passing (GMP) detection for the DBP architecture. Based on the message passing rule, each antenna cluster iteratively calculated the local means and variances which are fused to generate the global symbol beliefs for demodulation. The state evolution framework of the decentralized GMP algorithm is presented under the assumptions of large-system limit and Gaussian sources. Analytical results corroborated by simulations demonstrate that the nonuniform antenna cluster partition scheme exhibits a higher convergence rate than the uniform counterpart. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed decentralized GMP detection outperforms the recently proposed decentralized algorithms.},

Multiple V2V communications modes have been investigated for VANET, including dedicated short-range communications (DSRC) based on IEEE 802.11p and LTE-V2X, which are suitable for different packet transmission cases. In order to fully exploit the strengths of various modes, hybrid V2V communications strategies are designed in this paper, where each vehicle is allowed to choose different modes for different kinds of transmissions in separate frequency bands for transmission throughput improvement. Furthermore, since it is usually impractical to decide all the vehicles’ communications strategies globally due to high computational complexity and heavy overhead to broadcast the decisions, we model the selection of hybrid V2V communications strategies for vehicles as an evolutionary game. A strategy selection algorithm is then proposed, where each vehicle can select its hybrid V2V communications strategy locally based on its evaluation of the payoffs for different strategies and limited signalling from the base station. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can converge to an asymptotic stable state, which can improve the transmission throughput of vehicles, and is robust to the slight evaluation errors of payoffs and the strategy mutations of a few vehicles.},

The power supply for IoT devices is addressed by energy harvesting (EH) technology. However, the energy arrival model obeys the unknown energy arrival process. In addition, due to the dynamical changes of network state, it is crucial to study the access control in the MEC-based green IoT system. In this paper, we propose an MEC-based access control strategy to maximize the system utility for the green IoT system, considering the spectral efficiency and the successful access ratio from the perspective of operators and users respectively. Specifically, we model the access control problem as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP), and develop a novel centralized reward-based experience replay deep convolutional Q network algorithm (RCQN) to attain the optimal access control for EH IoT devices. Additionally, to enrich the prior knowledge of access control strategy, we design a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based energy prediction module to predict the energy state of IoT devices by learning the historical energy arrival information, whose output is taken as the state information of RCQN. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed LSTM-based RCQN access control algorithm significantly improves the system utility with a proper reward design and training mechanism.},

Due to limited onboard ISL terminals, the polling time division duplex (PTDD) mechanism is usually proposed for space link layer networking. By extending the polling mechanism to ground-satellite links (GSLs), a unified management system of the space segment and the ground segment can be realized. However, under the polling system how to jointly design the topology of ISLs and GSLs that are both time-slotted to improve data interaction has not been studied. In this paper, we formulate the topology design problem as an integer linear programming problem, aiming at minimizing the average delay of data delivery from satellites to ground stations while satisfying the ranging requirement for orbit determination. To tackle the computational complexity problem, we first present a novel modeling method of delay to reduce the number of decision variables. Furthermore, we propose a more efficient heuristic based on maximum weight matching algorithms. Simulation results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed methods for practical operation in GNSSs with time-slotted GSLs. Comparing the two methods, the heuristic can achieve similar performance with respect to average delay but with significantly less complexity.},

Fueled by this issue, we consider a hierarchical FL system and formulate a joint problem of edge aggregation interval control and resource allocation to minimize the weighted sum of training loss and training latency. To quantify the learning performance, an upper bound of the average global gradient deviation, in terms of the edge aggregation interval, the training latency, and the number of successfully participating devices, is derived. Then an alternative problem is formulated, which can be decoupled into an edge aggregation interval control problem and a resource allocation problem, and solved by an iterative optimization algorithm. Specifically, given the resource allocation strategy, a relaxation and rounding method is proposed to optimize the edge aggregation interval. The problem of resource allocation including training time allocation and bandwidth allocation is solved separately based on the convex optimization theory. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm, compared to the benchmarks, can achieve higher learning performance with lower training latency, and is capable of adaptively adjusting the edge aggregation interval and the resource allocation strategy according to the training process.},

Many devices, which are called the sources, are deployed in the sea to fulfill scientific, civilian, and military needs. If the locations of these sources are leaked, it will cause a serious economic and military crisis. Thus, in this context, the source location privacy protection becomes critical. In this paper, we focus on the source location privacy protection of underwater acoustic sensor networks (UASNs), where a multi-channel interference based source location privacy protection scheme (MCISLP) is proposed. The MCISLP mainly contains four steps. First, to enhance the sense of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) for nodes, a noise reduction method is proposed. Then, based on the previous step, an AUV movement prediction method for nodes is presented to ensure the success of packet transmission. After that, for the information exchange among nodes, given the interference of multiple underwater channels, this interference is then utilized to protect the source location privacy. Further, to reduce the channel interference on the source packet, the time slot control is added to weaken the influence. Last, the ant colony algorithm is adopted for the data collection of AUV.

  abstract     = {With the advent of smart vehicles, several new latency-critical and data-intensive applications are emerged in Vehicular Networks (VNs). Computation offloading has emerged as a viable option allowing to resort to the nearby edge servers for remote processing within a requested service latency requirement. Despite several advantages, computation offloading over resource-limited edge servers, together with vehicular mobility, is still a challenging problem to be solved. In particular, in order to avoid additional latency due to out-of-coverage operations, Vehicular Users (VUs) mobility introduces a bound on the amount of data to be offloaded towards nearby edge servers. Therefore, several approaches have been used for finding the correct amount of data to be offloaded. Among others, Federated Learning (FL) has been highlighted as one of the most promising solving techniques, given the data privacy concerns in VNs and limited communication resources. However, FL consumes resources during its operation and therefore incurs an additional burden on resource-constrained VUs. In this work, we aim to optimize the VN performance in terms of latency and energy consumption by considering both the FL and the computation offloading processes while selecting the proper number of FL iterations to be implemented. To this end, we first propose an FL-inspired distributed learning framework for computation offloading in VNs, and then develop a constrained optimization problem to jointly minimize the overall latency and the energy consumed. An evolutionary Genetic Algorithm is proposed for solving the problem in-hand and compared with some benchmarks. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of latency and energy consumption.},

  abstract     = {Internet of Vehicles (IoV) plays an indispensable role in intelligent transportation system (ITS). When the vehicle density is high, the performance of IoV suffers due to the broadcast storm problem. To address this issue, we propose a novel clustering approach using behavioral parameters and a current journey parameter. In this approach, we first calculate a cluster fitness score (CFS) for each vehicle in the network and select a vehicle with the highest CFS as a cluster head (CH). The CH then arranges two forms of communications which are contention free communication (CFC) and contention-based communication (CBC). In CFC, each cluster member (CM) broadcasts periodically without contending the channel access. However, in CBC, communicating parties like roadside units (RSUs), cluster heads (CHs), cluster members (CMs), and other vehicles contend to get the channel access. The contention window of CMs is also adapted to improve IoV performance. Additionally, our approach facilitates partitioning into sub-clusters and merging of sub-clusters based on the travel direction. Finally, we present the simulation results to demonstrate the improved performance of IoV.},

In this paper, we propose two pervasive scenarios including single edge scene and multiple edge scenes for deep integration of wireless communications and computation depending on real-time adaptive collaboration. Specifically, in the single edge scenario, a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based framework is invoked for collaboratively optimizing the task scheduling, transmission power and CPU cycle frequency under metabolic channel conditions. Meanwhile, in order to alleviate interference in multiple edge scenarios, we propose a multi-agent aided deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) algorithm to minimize total energy consumption and latency. Numerical experiments demonstrate these methods have substantial performance improvement in terms of saving system’s total overhead (i.e., energy consumption and delay) upon considering the task scheduling, transmission power, channel mutual interference and CPU cycle frequency against other conventional benchmarks.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning-based video streaming scheme for mobility-aware vehicular networks, e.g., vehicles on the highway. We consider infrastructure-assisted and mmWave-based scenarios in which the macro base station (MBS) cannot directly provide the streaming service to vehicles due to the short range of mmWave beams so that small mmWave base stations (mBSs) along the road deliver the desired videos to users. Motivated by the fact that a video stream consists of sequential chunks and smooth streaming has to be provided while users pass through multiple mBSs at high speed, the MBS proactively pushes some video chunks of the desired contents to mBSs. This is done to support vehicles that are currently covered and/or will be by each mBS. We formulate the dynamic video delivery scheme that adaptively determines 1) which content, 2) what quality and 3) how many chunks to be proactively delivered from the MBS to mBSs using Markov decision process (MDP). Since it is difficult for the MBS to track all the channel conditions and the network states have extensive dimensions, we adopt the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm for the DRL-based video delivery scheme. This paper finally shows that the DRL agentlearns a streaming policy that pursues high average quality while limiting packet drops, avoiding playback stalls, reducing quality fluctuations and saving backhaul usage.},

The new framework minimizes a quadratic penalty function which balances the energy consumption and fairness of the devices. Lyapunov optimization is first applied to eliminate the time coupling of the framework, leading to a mixed-integer program (MIP) of user association and offloading scheduling at every time slot. While solving the scheduling using linear programming, we convert the user association to a minimum cost maximum flow problem by interpreting edge servers and devices as two disjoint vertexes. We solve the minimum-cost maximum flow problem efficiently by using the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm. Corroborated by simulations, the proposed approach is asymptotically optimal and outperforms alternative approaches in terms of energy saving and fairness.},

  abstract     = {Mobile edge computing (MEC) has recently risen as a promising paradigm to meet the increasing resource requirements of the terminal devices. Meanwhile, small cell network (SCN) with MEC has been emerging to handle the exponentially increasing data traffic and improve the network coverage, and is recognized as one key component of the next generation wireless networks. However, with the growing number of terminal devices requiring computation offloading to the edge servers, the network would be heavily congested and thus the performance would be degraded and unbalanced among multiple devices. In this paper, we propose the joint admission control and computation resource allocation in the MEC enabled SCN, and formulate it as a stochastic optimization problem. The goal is to maximize the system utility combining the throughput and fairness while bounding the queue. We decouple the original problem into three independent subproblems, which can be solved in a distributed manner without requiring the system statistical information. An admission control and computation resource allocation (ACCRA) algorithm is designed to obtain the optimal solutions of the subproblems. Theoretical analysis proves that the ACCRA algorithm can achieve the close-to-optimal system utility and reach the arbitrary tradeoff between the utility and the queue length. Experiments are conducted to validate the derived analytical results and evaluate the performance of the ACCRA algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Delay-tolerant network (DTN) is a network that’s designed to operate effectively in heterogeneous networks that may lack continuous network connectivity. It is characterized by their lack of instantaneous end-to-end paths, resulting in difficulties in designing effective DTN routing protocols. Traditional routing algorithms largely rely on greedy schemes. Such schemes can not guarantee the packets will be eventually transmitted to their destinations, thereby presenting a poor transmission efficiency. Recently, the social-based method has attracted a large amount of attention in wireless network routing. It can use the community and the centrality information to increase the delivery rate of the whole network. Therefore, in this article, we introduce the social-based mechanism to our DTN routing design. Besides, how the distributed nodes can learn the collaboration strategies is another challenge. Inspired by the recent success of multi-agent learning in online control, we adopt a centralized training and distributed execution learning paradigm and design a hierarchical social-based DTN architecture. Based on this, we propose a collaborative multi-agent reinforcement learning (termed as QMIX) aided routing algorithm.},

This paper proposes a federated learning based blockchain-assisted message dissemination solution. Similar to the incentive-based Proof-of-Work consensus in blockchain, vehicles compete to become a relay node (miner) by processing the proposed Proof-of-Federated-Learning (PoFL) consensus which is embedded in the smart contract of blockchain. Both theoretical and practical analysis of the proposed solution are provided. Specifically, the proposed blockchain based federated learning results in more vehicles uploading their models in a given time, which can potentially lead to a more accurate model in less time as compared to the same solution without using blockchain. It also outperforms other blockchain approaches in reducing 65.2% of time delay in consensus, improving at least 8.2% message delivery rate and preserving privacy of neighbor vehicle more efficiently. The economic model to incentivize vehicles participating in federated learning and message dissemination is further analyzed using Stackelberg game. The analysis of asymptotic complexity proves PoFL as the most scalable solution compared to other consensus algorithms in vehicular networks.},

The satellite layer consists of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and Geosynchronous (GEO) satellites for long-distance and high-throughput data transmission with low latency. However, traditional ground routing strategies are not appropriate in ISN, considering the dynamic motion and different capabilities of satellites. Moreover, multi-type tasks need to be allocated with optimal inter-satellite transmission links (ISL) to ensure both the load balance of ISN and the quality of experience (QoE) of subscribers. In this paper, we combine the Software Defined Networking (SDN), AI technique, and fuzzy logic to optimize multi-task routing in ISN. The GEO satellites and the ground computing center (GCC) are set as the joint control plane. The load information of ISN at different times is collected by GEO controllers and made into a multi-D matrix. The GCC collects the historical traffic data from GEO controllers for convolutional neural network (CNN) model training and updating. The GEO satellites utilize the trained CNN model to make path allocation decisions and issue flow tables to LEO satellites. Further, considering the CNN judgment may contradict the user QoE, we use fuzzy logic to evaluate task requirements to improve the CNN output for optimal ISN path allocation. The simulation results demonstrate that the fuzzy-CNN based multi-task routing (FCMR) method has better traffic control performance and path finding flexibility under different ISN conditions.},

  abstract     = {In nonsaturated 802.11 distributed coordination function (DCF) networks, existing studies had observed a salient phenomenon: the maximum stable throughput may be far higher than the saturation throughput and last for a long duration (say, months). Such a maximum stable throughput is called the presaturation throughput peak. The long-duration peak suggests that 802.11 DCF networks may provide a far higher stable throughput than what we generally believe, without worrying about a sudden deterioration of quality of service (QoS). This paper is devoted to developing a general theoretical framework to predict the peak. In the framework, we define a backoff entropy to quantify the uncertainty of the inherent random backoff process of 802.11 DCF networks, and then innovatively introduce a BackoffEntropy-Peak linearity property (i.e., the peak is linearly proportional to the backoff entropy) for the peak prediction. This framework is applicable for a general configuration of contention windows (CWs). It enables us to reveal the most essential dependency of the peak on the initial CW size and the number of network nodes. Further, we design peak-based call admission control (CAC) schemes that can be performed quickly and easily, without requiring network performance measurements and complex calculations. We verify our framework and CAC schemes via widely adopted 802.11 DCF ns2 and ns3 simulators (mostly with typical 802.11 standard settings). Extensive simulations show that our framework and CAC schemes trade within 9% peak prediction errors for making 802.11 DCF networks provide high stable throughput with good QoS (such as short delay and low collision probability). This paper is the first to propose applying the information entropy to study the throughput-stability problem. We believe that this study makes a crucial breakthrough in thoroughly investigating nonsaturated performance and network stability of random access wireless networks.},

However, the existing time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA)-based worst-case solutions still have two issues: 1) Inaccurate objective transformations are introduced in some algorithms, which reduce the accuracy; 2) A method with higher accuracy is computationally intensive. This study proposes an accurate and simplified worst-case approximation method to tackle the troubles. Precisely, we first prove that the nonconvex worst-case objective is piecewise monotone to the NLOS bias. We further use monotonicity to derive an accurate and convex expression of the worst-case objective. Then, we propose simplified transformations to redefine the worst-case approximation problem with fewer constraints. Besides, we prove the effectiveness of the simplified transformations. Simulations and experiments demonstrate that the proposed method with moderate computation exhibits better performance than the state-of-the-art worst-case approximation algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Free-space optics (FSO)-based, low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite-assisted Internet of vehicles (IoVs) has recently attracted research efforts worldwide. For the majority of Internet applications, transmission control protocol (TCP) is one of the most widely deployed protocols. Nevertheless, a complete understanding of the TCP performance over FSO-based satellite-assisted IoVs networks is still lacking in the literature. This is a highly challenging issue, as a consequence of the non-trivial interdependencies between transmission losses caused by the dynamics/uncertainty of atmospheric last-mile channels and the buffer overflows on the Internet, as well as their joint impact on the TCP congestion control mechanisms. This paper offers a comprehensive analytical framework that allows assessing the TCP throughput performance under the joint impact of congestion losses occurred in the Internet and transmission errors at the last-mile link from the satellite-to-vehicle. Internet access for emerging unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is considered while the analysis can be also applied to other kinds of vehicles, which, in fact, require simpler channel models. The link-layer incremental redundancy hybrid automatic repeat request (IR-HARQ) protocol is employed at satellite-to-UAV channels to further improve the TCP throughput performance. Numerical results provide non-trivial findings and insights for the TCP performance in satellite/FSO-based IoVs, in which optimal UAV’s parameters are chosen to maximize the TCP throughput.},

  abstract     = {With the proliferation of electric vehicles (EVs), private charging pile (PCP) sharing networks are likely to be an integral part of future smart cities, especially in places with limited public charging infrastructure. However, there are a number of operational challenges associated with the deployment of PCPs in such a shared and untrusted environment. For example, how do we formulate efficient PCP sharing strategies in PCP sharing networks, while also taking into consideration the dynamic charging behaviors of EVs? Therefore, in this paper, we propose an energy b lockchain- b ased secure P C P sharing scheme (BBC) for PCP sharing networks. First, an energy blockchain-based framework is designed for PCP sharing networks to facilitate energy sharing services for EVs and PCPs, using both distributed ledgers and cryptocurrency. Then, we devise a reputation-based secure PCP sharing algorithm to improve consensus efficiency with smaller signature sizes. In addition, a distributed reputation mechanism is constructed to assess the trustworthiness of consensus nodes in blockchain, based on ratings, behaviors, and fading. We also model the interactions among EVs and cooperative PCPs as a joint coalition-matching game, and obtain the optimal strategies of PCPs and EVs by analyzing the Nash-stable coalitional structure and stable many-to-one matching pairs. Extensive simulations and the real-world implementation demonstrate that the proposed approach improves the utility of EV users and renewable energy efficiency in PCP sharing networks.},

In this paper, the user association, resource allocation (including bandwidth and power), and caching deployment are investigated in the heterogeneous Fog-RAN to consider energy efficiency and cross-tier interference mitigation. Specifically, the user association, resource allocation, and caching strategy are formulated as a non-convex optimization problem and then transformed into a convex problem, which can be solved by a proposed algorithm based on the concept of the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Then an ADMM-based algorithm is proposed to enhance the energy efficiency of the Fog-RAN.

In this paper, we propose a double auction mechanism to allocate the resources of the edge servers to the vehicles in order to complete the CDC tasks. Specifically, the vehicles use the PolyDot codes to manage the tradeoff between communication costs and recovery threshold. Given the requirements of various vehicles, the double auction mechanism matches the edge servers with the required resources to the vehicles. Besides, the double auction mechanism also determines the prices that the vehicles need to pay for the resources of the edge servers. The analyses show that the double auction mechanism satisfies the properties of individual rationality, incentive compatibility and budget-balance.

  abstract     = {This work addresses the problem of controller orchestration in Internet of Things (IoT)-based Service-Oriented Architecture. It focuses on the fundamental issues of heterogeneity and dynamism of hybrid edge-cloud networks involving both static and mobile IoT devices for provisioning IoT-based services. Due to the limited capacity of IoT devices, IoT-cloud services require the support of edge networks, termed as ‘Service Edge,’ for meeting their ultra-low latency requirements. In such complex and dynamic networks, software-defined networking (SDN) paradigm is utilized for efficient resource utilization and service-oriented network management. A significant problem in SDN is the controller placement problem. Although researchers proposed several controller placement schemes for SDN, the problem of multi-tier controller placement in hybrid cloud-edge networks has not yet been addressed. In this work, this problem is formulated mathematically and shown to be a variant of the well-known two-level capacitated facility location problem , which is NP-hard. Thereafter, COMET, a scheme based on coalitional game and social choice theory, is proposed to solve the problem in polynomial time. COMET is designed while considering varying loads on the switches due to the presence of mobile IoT devices. Simulations depict that COMET reduces network delay by 49.02% with a significant increase in resiliency compared to the state-of-the-art.},

In deriving the performance models, we consider two UAV distribution cases: general case and worst case, in which the locations of UAVs follow different distributions. Meanwhile, we introduce a line-of-sight (LoS) ball model to describe the LoS probability of the downlink channel between a BS and a UAV, and show that it has a good approximation to the ITU LoS model, and can largely simplify the derivation of the performance models. Monte Carlo simulation results are shown to validate the derived performance models. The impacts of major network parameters on the downlink transmission performance are investigated through numerical results.

  abstract     = {By leveraging the power of crowd, the prevalence of mobile devices in mobile crowd-sensing (MCS) networks helps and provides a wide range of sensing services through collecting and sharing sensing data. However, due to the diverse behaviours of mobile users, unreliable or malicious users and platforms could provide untrusted data, which affects the quality of sensing service. Besides, mobile users are reluctant to participate in sensing tasks without sufficient incentives. It is desirable to design a trust and incentive scheme to improve the service efficiency of MCS. In this paper, we propose a novel trust-driven contract incentive framework in MCS, which guarantees the service quality and stimulates mobile users to join sensing tasks. We first design a trust evaluation scheme between mobile users and sensing platforms based on the historical interactions to derive the reliability value of sensing platform. Then, the trust threshold is formulated to filter out malicious sensing platforms. By considering the privacy preferences of mobile users, we establish a contract incentive scheme to maximize the utility of both mobile users and sensing platforms. The design objective is to derive a set of optimal contracts under both discrete and continuous contract models. Meanwhile, the designed contracts guarantee the individual rationality (IR) and incentive compatibility (IC) properties. Finally, simulations are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed trust-driven contract incentive scheme, and results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can jointly improve the quality of sensing service and maximize the utilities of mobile users and sensing platforms.},

We demonstrate there exists an inevitable inter-user interference (IUI) due to the NOMA scheme, which causes an adverse effect on the performance of the secondary network. Hence, to achieve the improved performance and subsequently the low latency requirements, the wireless content caching is employed, whereby the relay can store the most popular contents of both the NOMA users. Further, the pertinent hybrid channels are characterized by the shadowed-Rician fading and Nakagami- &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$ {m}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; fading models.

Also, we carry out the asymptotic OP analysis at a high signal-to-noise ratio to present the insights on the attainable diversity orders. We manifest that zero diversity order results for both the schemes due to unavoidable IUI. However, one can anticipate the remarkable enhancement in the performance for CA TWR-NOMA scheme over its CF TWR-NOMA counterpart, owing to the reduced IUI and the efficient utilization of available spectrum resources.},

  abstract     = {This paper explores the near-field regional target localization problem with the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) assisted system. Traditional near-field localization strategies typically estimate the position of the target through line-of-sight (LOS) signals transmitted from the anchor node. In practice, accurate location estimation is a challenging issue when the LOS link between the anchor node and target may be unavailable due to the obstacle. To this end, this paper investigates the possibility to confirm the position of the target node consisted in an area of interest (AOI) by retrieving information from the RIS reflection signals. Specifically, we establish a general framework for RIS-assisted regional localization, which consists of RIS phase design and position determination. By defining the average localization accuracy (ALA) of the AOI, we first present a discretization method to design the RIS phase. Then, a robust phase design problem is formulated via transforming the AOI into an uncertainty model of position parameters, and an efficient iterative entropy regularization (IER)-based algorithm is proposed to solve it. Using the designed RIS phase, we develop a near-field target localization algorithm and discuss the power optimization problem for the RIS-assisted localization system (RALS). Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, in which both phase design strategies almost coincide with the optimal RIS phase, and the proposed localization method can attain the near-optimal localization performance by applying the designed RIS phase schemes.},

To enhance the secure communications of the cell-edge users, the multiple BSs employ coordinated beamforming with the aid of artificial-noise (AN) beamforming. We conduct a mathematically rigorous secrecy performance analysis of the considered system and obtain new accurate closed-form expressions of a lower bound on the ergodic rate of each LU and an upper bound of the ergodic rate of each eavesdropper without assuming asymptotes for any system parameter (except for the “worst-case” scenario with zero noise power). Then, a lower bound on the ergodic secrecy rate (ESR) of each LU follows. Based on the derived analytical results, we propose a low-complexity algorithm to optimize the channel sate information (CSI) feedback bits allocation for the channels of target signal link and inter-cell interference links. Furthermore, we develop explicit sufficient conditions on the set of system parameters under which there are at least two BSs to coordinated secure transmission. Through both theoretical analysis and numerical results, we can verify that the obtained analytical lower bound on ESR of each LU as a function of the set of power allocation coefficients is generally neither convex nor concave . Thus, we propose to employ some numerical method to find a sub-optimal power allocation solution. Finally, numerical results are also provided to validate our theoretical results and the proposed feedback bits and power allocation methods.},

  abstract     = {Highmobility is an important scenario for the 5G wireless communications. However, the high mobility results in serious time-varying fading, bringing challenges to the reliabilities of wireless transmission. Diversity technique is an essential method to overcome the effect of fading. It is noted that an LDPC (low-density parity-check) code is a concatenation of single parity-check codes (SPC) and repetition codes (REP) by a random interleaver, and a REP can be viewed as a typical example for achieving time/frequency diversity. Thus, it is appealing to jointly consider LDPC codes and diversity techniques. This paper presents parity-check coding transmit diversity (PCTD) schemes based on half-rate invertible LDPC codes, which are capable of achieving both diversity and coding gains from the time-varying fading channels. Besides, we investigate two types of PCTD schemes, and take into consideration two transmission modes, which are single-carrier (SC) and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) transmission modes. A chase combining based message passing algorithm (CC-MPA) is proposed for the proposed schemes, which can take full advantages of signal processing and coding gains. Furthermore, the Shannon limits of time-varying fading channels with BPSK signaling are deduced. Simulation results show that the proposed PCTD with CC-MPA algorithm can provide better BER performances than the classical time-domain diversity scheme in time-varying fading channels, which is appealing for the high mobility communications.},

  abstract     = {The combination of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-out (MIMO) system is regarded as a key enabling technology for beyond 5G networks, as it provides high data rate aerial links. However, establishing UAV-enabled mmWave MIMO communication is quite challenging due to the high hardware cost in terms of radio frequency (RF) chains. As a cost-effective alternative, a beamspace precoding with discrete lens arrays (DLA) architecture has received considerable attention. However, the underlying optimal design in beamspace precoding has not been fully exploited in UAV-enabled communication scenario. In this paper, the joint design of the UAV’s altitude and hybrid beamspace precoding is proposed for the UAV-enabled multiuser MIMO system, in which the DLA is exploited to reduce the number of the RF chain. In the proposed scheme, the optimization problem is formulated as a minimum weighted mean squared error (MWMSE) method. Then an efficient algorithm with the penalty dual decomposition (PDD) is proposed that aims to jointly optimize the altitude of UAV, beam selection and digital precoding matrices. Simulation results confirm the comparable performance of the proposed scheme and perform close to full-digital beamforming in terms of achievable spectral efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Massive Machine-Type Communication (mMTC) is proposed by ITU to provide a large scale of connectivity services for billions of machine-type communications devices (MTCDs) via cellular networks. However, MTCDs are generally energy-constrained, security capability limited and short-packet transmission dominated. It has great challenges for massive MTCDs to perform short-packet transmission simultaneously while guaranteeing the confidentiality and energy efficiency of the information transmission. In this paper, we investigate the energy-efficient secure short-packet transmission of Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) assisted mMTC networks, in which MTCDs aim to transmit secrecy messages to the destination base station via trusted relays with a passive eavesdropper present. To realize secure, reliable and energy-efficient transmission, we maximize the secrecy energy efficiency (SEE) by implementing joint relay and power level selection. Furthermore, we formulate a decentralized stateless Q-learning-based multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm for the dynamic and complex mMTC systems. The simulation results show that adopting the proposed decentralized MARL algorithm and relaying with NOMA can improve the performance of SEE while reducing information exchange overhead.},

  abstract     = {Electromagnetic interference causes considerable performance degradation on wireless communication systems. The performance degradation is largely affected by the characteristics of the interference. Impulse interference commonly occurs in industrial and automotive environments, where many closely located systems and electronic equipment coexist. In this work, we propose two novel algorithms for adaptive demodulation in impulse noise. The proposed methods compute appropriate log-likelihood ratios based on interference classification and estimation of Middleton’s Class A noise model as well as the symmetric &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\alpha$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -Stable (S &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\alpha$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; S) model. The analytical complexity and intractability of the S &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\alpha$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; S probability density function (PDF) makes real-time applications unfeasible. Therefore, the proposed algorithms are developed using two different techniques for approximating the S &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\alpha$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; S PDF. The approximations are achieved through interpolation via i) approximate closed-form expressions of the PDF for a specific parameter set and ii) via numerically pre-calculated look-up tables of the PDF for arbitrary parameter choices. The proposed adaptive techniques are shown to provide a performance gain in terms of bit error rate (BER) of up to 20 dB energy per bit to noise power ratio (Eb/N0), in comparison to traditional, non-adaptive, methods for varying levels of impulse interference. The performance loss of approximating the PDF in comparison to exact calculations amount to less than 8 dB Eb/N0, which is small in relation to the performance gain achieved in comparison to traditional methods. However, the complexity in terms of simulation execution time of the proposed approximate algorithms is reduced by up to a factor 250, compared to methods based on exact computation. The algorithms are validated using regular low density parity check (LDPC) codes, in addition to quasi-cyclic (QC)-LDPC and turbo codes. The proposed adaptive demodulation techniques can be used to improve decoding and demodulation performance in many real-life situations where non-Gaussian interference commonly occurs.},

  abstract     = {The time division multiple access (TDMA) technique has been applied in automotive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar. However, it suffers from the transmit energy loss, and as a result the parameter estimation performance degradation when the number of transmit elements increases. To tackle these problems, a transmit beamspace (TB) Doppler division multiple access (DDMA) approach is proposed. First, a phase modulation matrix with empty Doppler spectrum is introduced. By exploiting the empty Doppler spectrum, a test function based on sequential detection is developed to mitigate the Doppler ambiguity in DDMA waveform. Then, a discrete Fourier transform (DFT)-based TB in slow-time is formed. The proposed method can achieve waveform diversity in Doppler domain and generate a TB in slow-time that concentrates the transmitted power in a fixed spatial region to improve the transmit energy distribution for automotive MIMO radar, which is favored by medium/long range radar (MRR/LRR) applications. As compared to the conventional TDMA technique, the proposed TB DDMA approach can fully exploit the transmission capabilities of all transmit elements to ensure that the emitted power is efficiently used and inherits easy implementation.Moreover, the proposed TB DDMA method avoids the trade-off between the active time for each transmit antenna element and the frame time due to Doppler ambiguity mitigation. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed TB DDMA approach for automotive MIMO radar.},

  abstract     = {We recently proposed a direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation method for the coexistence of uncorrelated and coherent signals, which is related to the uniform linear antenna arrays with mutual coupling (MC) in the presence of unknown nonuniform noise. This technique, however, relies on the assumption of mixed signals and is not suitable for scenarios with purely coherent signals. This paper extends the mixed signal scenario to the purely coherent signals one on one hand, and on the other hand, allows us to directly adopt the ESPPRIT algorithm to perform DOA estimation in MC environments. To be specific, with the help of the least squares (LS) criterion, the nonuniform noise is first eliminated, and the traditional middle subarray scheme can then be employed to be immune to the influence of MC. Unlike the former operation, following a different line of attack the latter can make full use of the whole array and provide a larger array antenna aperture. Furthermore, we derive a new strategy to directly determine the DOAs without taking MC into account and performing spectral search. This brings substantial benefits to the DOA estimation accuracy and computational cost. The superiority of the proposed approaches is verified by numerical examples.},

To this end, we consider a WLMMSE MIMO transmission system with rectilinear or quasi-rectilinear (QR) signals over the uncorrelated Rayleigh fading channel and investigate the statistical properties of its SINR for an arbitrary antenna configuration with &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$N_t$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; transmit antennas and &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$N_r$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; receive ones. We first derive an analytic probability density function (PDF) of the SINR in terms of the confluent hypergeometric function of the second kind, for WLMMSE MIMO systems with an arbitrary &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$N_r$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; and &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$N_t=2, 3$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; .

The so-derived PDFs are able to provide key insights into the WLMMSE MIMO receiver in terms of the outage probability, the symbol error rate, and the diversity gain, all presented in closed form. In particular, its diversity gain and the gain improvement over the conventional LMMSE one are explicitly quantified as &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$N_r-(N_t-1)/2$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; and &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$(N_t-1)/2$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; , respectively.

The dependability analysis method for wireless communication in CBTC is critical and necessary to ensure the stable transmission of safety-critical information. However, most of the existing researches in CBTC lack a unified evaluation index to analyze the wireless communication dependability. In this paper, the dependability of wireless communication system in CBTC is established. To be specific, timeliness, integrity, security, and safety are used to describe the dependability of CBTC wireless communication system in our definition. The age of information (AoI) is used to quantitatively analyze the dependability in the CBTC wireless communication system. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed dependability analysis method, we quantitatively introduce the dependability of wireless communication system in CBTC with different scenarios, including packet-drop, re-transmission, handoff, and cyber-attack. Simulation results show that the designed dependability analysis method with quantized AoI can efficiently describe the dependability of CBTC wireless communication system in different scenarios.},

  abstract     = {In practical propagation environments, different massive MIMO users can have correlated angles in spatial paths. In this paper, we study the effect of angle correlation on inter-user channel correlation via a combination of measurement and analysis. We show three key results. First, we collect a massive MIMO channel dataset for examining the inter-user channel correlation in a real-world propagation environment; the dataset is now open-access. We observed channel correlation higher than 0.48 for all close-by users. Additionally, over 30% of far-away users, even when they are tens of wavelengths apart, have inter-user channel correlation that is at least twice higher than the correlation in the i.i.d. Rayleigh fading channel. Second, we compute the inter-user channel correlation in closed-form as a function of inter-user angle correlation, the number of base-station antennas, and base-station inter-antenna spacing. Our analysis shows that inter-user angle correlation increases the inter-user channel correlation. Inter-user channel correlation reduces with a larger base-station array aperture, i.e., more antennas and larger inter-antenna spacing. Third, we explain the measurements with numerical experiments to show that inter-user angle correlation can result in significant inter-user channel correlation in practical massive MIMO channels.},

  abstract     = {Due to the scarcity in the wireless spectrum and limited energy resources especially in mobile applications, efficient resource allocation strategies are critical in wireless networks. Motivated by the recent advances in deep reinforcement learning (DRL), we address multi-agent DRL-based joint dynamic channel access and power control in a wireless interference network. We first propose a multi-agent DRL algorithm with centralized training (DRL-CT) to tackle the joint resource allocation problem. In this case, the training is performed at the central unit (CU) and after training, the users make autonomous decisions on their transmission strategies with only local information. We demonstrate that with limited information exchange and faster convergence, DRL-CT algorithm can achieve 90% of the performance achieved by the combination of weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) algorithm for power control and exhaustive search for dynamic channel access. In the second part of this paper, we consider distributed multi-agent DRL scenario in which each user conducts its own training and makes its decisions individually, acting as a DRL agent. Finally, as a compromise between centralized and fully distributed scenarios, we consider federated DRL (FDRL) to approach the performance of DRL-CT with the use of a central unit in training while limiting the information exchange and preserving privacy of the users in the wireless system. Via simulation results, we show that proposed learning frameworks lead to efficient adaptive channel access and power control policies in dynamic environments.},

Specifically, we aim to solve a weighted sum rate maximization problem by jointly optimizing the digital precoding at the transmitter and the analog phase shifters at the IRS, subject to the minimum achievable rate constraint. To facilitate the design of an efficient solution, we first reformulate the original problem into a tractable one by exploiting the majorization-minimization (MM) method. Then, a block coordinate descent (BCD) method is proposed to obtain a suboptimal solution, where the precoding matrices and the phase shifters are alternately optimized. Specifically, the digital precoding matrix design problem is solved by the quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP), while the analog phase shift optimization is solved by the Riemannian manifold optimization (RMO). The convergence and computational complexity are analyzed. Finally, simulation results are provided to verify the performance of the proposed design, as well as the effectiveness of double-IRS in improving the spectral efficiency.},

The sea surface is represented using the sum of sinusoids (SoS) and modeled using the JOint North Sea WAve Project (JONSWAP) sea wave spectrum. The random behavior of potential scatterers along the sea surface, surface wave height, and their impact on the distribution of AoA is evaluated. For coherent scattering, initially, the scatterer distribution is computed for a single realization of the SoS, i.e., a sinusoidal surface. The result obtained is averaged to evaluate the characteristics of the ensemble-averaged SoS surface. For incoherent scattering, the acute randomness of the sea surface leads to every point along the SoS surface acting as a potential scatterer. The overall scattering for any given channel state would be an appropriate combination of coherent and incoherent components. A similar effect manifests itself in the distribution of the overall AoA. Further, the impact of factors such as acoustic signal frequency, wind speed, and the underwater (UW) channel geometry on the parameters of the overall AoA has been studied. The AoA model proposed in this work is general and widely applicable.},

We study a proportional-fair resource allocation (RA) problem, including slot resource allocation and precoding design in UC networks over consecutive time-slots. We formulate the proportional-fair (PF) resource allocation problem as a series of weighted sum-rate maximization problems and develop a two-stage heuristic RA scheme to solve the problem. The scheme adopts a user grouping process to decompose resource allocation problem into intra-group orthogonal resource allocation sub-problems. A modularity-based user grouping algorithm upon a constructed weighted digraph is proposed. Then, relying on the grouping results, a parallel distributed PFRA algorithm consisting of user selection process and a Signal to Leakage plus Noise Ratio (SLNR)-based precoding design is proposed to fulfil intra-group resource allocation. Rather than global channel state information (CSI) collected from the whole network, local CSI obtained cooperatively within each AP subset is utilized in the proposed resource allocation scheme. Numerical results confirm that the proposed RA scheme outperforms in throughput while maintaining comparable fairness among users.},

  abstract     = {Cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) is a promising candidate to support the requirements of the fifth-generation (5 G) and beyond networks. However, the capacity of the fronthaul network dramatically influences its performance. While wired fronthaul links can be seen as the optimal choice, they may not be practically feasible. Exploiting the enormous bandwidth available in the millimeter-Wave (mmWave) band to support the fronthaul links paves the way to achieve the full potential of CF mMIMO systems. In this paper, we investigate the uplink (UL) performance of CF mMIMO systems supported by mmWave-fronthaul networks. Using tools from stochastic geometry, we derive analytical expressions for both the distribution of the provided fronthaul capacity and the average UL data rates. We show that although increasing the density of blockages degrades the average UL data rates, increasing the density of CPUs can limit such effect. Moreover, the obtained results reveal that the network deployment should be adjusted according to the available fronthaul bandwidth and the density of blockages. In particular, for a given fronthaul bandwidth, increasing the density of APs beyond a certain limit would not achieve further improvement in the UL data rates. Besides, increasing the number of antennas per AP may even cause a degradation in the system performance.},

Furthermore, we present two theorems to quantify the achievable sum DoF of the proposed cached-aided RIA scheme for different system configuration. Moreover, the system configuration of the existing cache-aided RIA scheme with mixed CSIT can be treated as a special case in our paper.

  abstract     = {To address the limited driving range of electric vehicles (EVs) and promote EVs’ penetration, vehicular energy networks (VENs) have emerged and opened possibility to charge EVs in motion via dynamic wireless power transfer (DWPT) technology. However, security and efficiency concerns arise due to the untrusted operating environment and EVs’ selfish charging/discharging behaviors. Existing trust models rely on the personal recommendations from neighboring EVs to identify malicious entities in VENs, which may cause potential privacy breaches and data misuse for recommenders. Besides, it is challenging to optimally schedule EVs’ energy behaviors by considering complex interactions among three energy entities (i.e., energy nodes, charging EVs, and discharging EVs). To this end, by leveraging blockchain technology and game theory, this paper proposes a secure and efficient wireless charging scheme to address these issues in VENs. Firstly, a blockchain-based fine-grained access control mechanism with traceability and auditability is presented to enable EV users to fully control and audit their personal rating data usage during trust management by logging data activities and issuing access tokens into decentralized ledgers. In this manner, the privacy of recommenders can be preserved by fully controlling the access and usage of personal rating data. Furthermore, by introducing cooperative wireless energy transfer mode, a hierarchical game-based energy scheduling algorithm is developed to optimize the strategies of three energy parties tier by tier, while considering their cooperation and competition. Finally, extensive simulations are conducted, which demonstrate that the proposed scheme can effectively improve users’ utility and security of energy transmission for EVs, compared with existing representative approaches.},

  abstract     = {A novel ultra-wideband (UWB) reflectarray antenna for the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is introduced in this paper. By simply connecting the neighboring reflectarray elements, the proposed reflectarray antenna achieves a remarkable radiation pattern bandwidth of 20 GHz, ranging from 10 GHz to 30 GHz. To explain the operating principles of the proposed reflectarray antenna, the equivalent circuit (EQC) model of the unit cell is built, which also provides an efficient and rapid way to analyze the performance of the proposed reflectarray element. It is found from the EQC analysis that the connected elements can achieve better reflection phase responses than conventional separated elements, thereby improving the array bandwidth. As a proof of concept, a 503-element reflectarray antenna simultaneously covering the vehicle-to-satellite bands (12.25–12.75 GHz/14.0–14.5 GHz/19.6–21.2 GHz/29.4–31.0 GHz), the 24-GHz short-range vehicle radar band (24.25–26.65 GHz) and the 5G millimeter-wave band (27.5–28.35 GHz) is designed, fabricated, and characterized. The experimental results demonstrate that the presented reflectarray antenna can maintain undistorted beams, high antenna gain, low cross-pol level, and moderate aperture efficiency over a bandwidth of 100%, i.e., from 10 to 30 GHz. With its simple and planar aperture as well as excellent performance, the proposed reflectarray antenna can be a promising candidate for vehicles that require reliable high data-rate satellite links and 5G millimeter-wave connections simultaneously.},

However, fluctuation and nonlinearity occur during battery degradation, resulting in difficulties in both model adaptability and RUL prediction accuracy. To face the challenge, we propose a sequence decomposition and deep learning integrated prognostic approach for the RUL prediction of LIBs. Complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition and principal component analysis are applied to separate the local fluctuations and the global degradation trend from the battery aging data. The long short-term memory neural network combined with fully connected layers is designed as a transfer learning model. The hyperparameter optimization and finetuning strategy of the model is developed based on offline training data. In addition, to further realize the reasonable and effective LIB second-life applications, the RUL corresponding to different failure thresholds is predicted. The performance of the proposed integrated approach in degradation modeling and RUL prediction is evaluated on three publicly available LIB datasets with different degradation characteristics, as well as compared with other prediction algorithms under the same conditions. The illustrative results demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve accurate, adaptive, and robust prediction for both capacity trajectory and RUL.},

  abstract     = {Two-stage AC-DC converters are considered as a prominent solution for DC-type electric vehicle (EV) chargers. However, this kind of architecture suffers from high switching losses with large heatsink and DC-link capacitor volume. To relieve this issue, this paper presents a new hybrid modulation for DC-type EV chargers, where a two-phase clamped discontinuous pulse-width-modulation (DPWM) in the front-end circuit is cooperated with the variable frequency triangular-current-mode (TCM) zero voltage switching (ZVS) or its simplified implementation, i.e., boundary-ZVS (B-ZVS) strategy, in the back-end circuit. The former can stop the switching actions in the front-end stage during two-thirds of the grid period, while the AC currents are at their highest values, which can yield to the best switching loss reduction and deliver high power factor operation. Besides, TCM-ZVS or B-ZVS modulations can achieve ZVS turn-on action for all semiconductors during all operating range in the DC-DC stage to further reduce the power losses on the semiconductors. With such characteristics, the proposed strategies can reduce the switching losses of the system to the best extent, and thus allow an enhancement of the system power density by improving the power conversion efficiency. The proposed strategy is described, analyzed, validated, and benchmarked in a 5 kW SMD SiC MOSFET-based two-stage AC-DC converter. A 99% power efficiency can be achieved with the solution implementing the TCM-ZVS strategy at an output voltage of 400 V and rated power.},

This paper therefore focuses on the design of a virtual low-sidelobe beampattern in distributed phased-MIMO radar. An iterative framework with respect to subarray layout and receive weighting coefficients is proposed to minimize beampattern Peak Sidelobe Level (PSL) accounting for practical position constraints as well as the mainlobe level restriction. In each iteration, an efficient cyclic optimization algorithm based on the Coordinate Descent (CD) framework is developed to seek for the subarray layout through splitting high dimensional layout optimization problem into multiple one-dimensional optimization problems, and the SemiDefinite Relaxation (SDR) technique and rank one approximation are explored to design weighting coefficients. Numerical simulations are provided to assess the performance of the proposed algorithms in term of the achieved beampattern under different constraints and parameter settings.},

However, existing methods cannot effectively detect the rail-tracks in a complex environment, especially in turnout scenarios. In this study, we propose a topology guided method to detect rail-tracks which includes the following four parts: Firstly, a neural network is used to obtain the pixels of the rail-lanes, and the geometric relationship between rail-lanes is mined by inverse perspective transformation. Secondly, the rail-lanes’ pixels are converted to rail-lanes’ key points and the topological relationship between the key points. Thirdly, the rail-lanes are reconnected through topological relationships between key points. Finally, the rail-track geometry features are used to match the rail-lanes. Experimental results show that the rail-track level F1 score of the proposed method reached 91.62%, which is state-of-the-art (SOTA) in this field. Furthermore, the proposed method has been tested and applied on the Hong Kong Metro Tsuen Wan Line.},

To address the problem, this paper proposes an intelligent prognosis method for intermittently faulty components in electric scooter based on dual degradation processes. Firstly, fault detection and isolation is used to identify discrete faults and isolate possible intermittent faults in continuous components, where the fault isolation performance under multiple faults condition is improved by developing an extended fault signature matrix. Secondly, the adaptive competitive swarm optimization is proposed to identify the magnitude, appearing and disappearing instants of each intermittent fault for faulty components. After that, the dual degradation processes are established with the aid of tumbling window (TW), where the duration degradation process describes the evolutionary trend of the ratio of fault duration to the length of duration-TW, while the magnitude degradation process captures the evolutionary trend of maximum feature in magnitude-TW. With dual degradation processes and predefined failure thresholds, the remaining useful life of the faulty component is jointly predicted, where the degradation speed difference between duration and magnitude is considered. Finally, the proposed methods are validated by experiment results.},

  abstract     = {Longitudinal motion controllers based on over- simplified models result in steady-state errors, oscillations, and overshoots of the velocity, all of which impair the unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) multiple objectives (trajectory tracking capability, energy economy, and ride comfort). While it is challenging for complicated methods to accomplish real-time control in the vehicle-mounted electronic control unit (ECU), which meets harsh working conditions but has limited computing power. This paper proposes a multi-objective model predictive longitudinal motion control approach for an ECU based on a trajectory tracking model. For the trajectory tracking model, we establish an internal powertrain/brake dynamics model and divide the external resistance into three components. They are identified using a variety of practical and straightforward methods. The control strategy is composed of a high-level multi-objective model predictive controller (MPC) that obtains the optimal internal acceleration and a low-level controller that calculates control inputs based on the powertrain/brake model. To implement real-time control on the ECU, the MPC optimization problem and its solver that combines offline and online calculation are elaborately designed. Finally, the method is validated through simulations in three typical driving scenarios and vehicle tests on a hybrid-electric sport utility vehicle (SUV) and a 6-speed dual- clutch transmission (DCT) fuel sedan. Simulations and experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach is superior to the other four commonly used methodologies in terms of achieving multiple objectives.},

Upon a light vehicle collision, vehicle experiences lateral and yaw motions due to collision impact-induced yaw moment. A multiple-objective hierarchical control strategy to attenuate vehicle yaw moment and regain stability control is proposed. Two potential sets of control reference states for the control strategy motion control are considered: desired DYC states and the drift equilibrium. A direct yaw moment controller based on sliding mode control (SMC) theory is designed to track the desired yaw rate. For the AFS, the tracking of desired DYC sideslip angle is performed using a SMC based controller, whereas the tracking of drift equilibrium state values employs a state feedback controller. An SMC longitudinal controller is designed for deceleration control of the vehicle after collision. Upon compensation of the yaw moment, a multiple sliding surface control theory-based lane controller is employed for lateral path deviation and heading angle control. The effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is validated on Carsim and Matlab/Simulink joint simulation platform. Simulation results showed that the proposed control strategy is effective in improving the post-impact stability control of the 4MIDEV on a high-velocity condition, and the control strategy that tracks the drift equilibrium showed better control performance on low adhesion coefficient surface.},

  abstract     = {Dq impedance measurement is of great importance as a part of the impedance-based analysis. At present, impedance of objects in single-phase vehicle-grid system are mainly obtained by injecting the voltage or current disturbance of one single frequency into the system circularly. However, as the number of measurement frequency points increases, there will produce much time-consuming of measurement. In this paper, a quick dq impedance measurement algorithm for single-phase vehicle-grid system based on multi-frequency sweep is proposed. First, pseudo-random binary sequences (PRBS) and ternary sequences are modified as the driving signals rather than directly injecting into the control link. Then three types of disturbance with specific frequency characteristics are introduced into the system and their parameters setting principle are given for the first time. According to the different characteristics of measurement objects, the proposed algorithms are also different to ensure the maximum specificity and sensitivity. Finally, for different objects in vehicle-grid system like traction network, single-phase converter and dual-interleaved converter, simulation and experimental results based on the hardware in the loop real-time simulation platform both show the correctness of the proposed algorithm, and the possible causes of errors are also analyzed in detail. Moreover, the proposed algorithm makes it possible to quickly measure the dq impedance of the single-phase vehicle-grid system, and the correctness of the theoretical and measured value can be judged and used for the stability analysis of electrical systems.},

It is assumed that each following vehicle can only measure the relative position with respect to its predecessor and subsequent vehicles. To estimate the uncertain dynamics of each following vehicle and unknown leader acceleration, a new decentralized robust adaptive consensus protocol is introduced which by using only relative position measurement, guarantees internal and string stability. It will be shown that the control gains are tuned without requiring any knowledge about the platoon size (number of following vehicles) and consequently, the controller is robust against size changing due to common maneuvers. By using Lyapunov theorem, we will prove that under this approach, the position and velocity tracking errors of each vehicle converge to zero asymptotically. Furthermore, it is shown that the adaptation laws have the main role in assuring string stability of DLBVPs with constant spacing strategy. Several simulation and practical results will depict the merits of this algorithm.},

Most of the existing methods require heavy traffic data exchange among neighboring intersections to achieve collaborative ATSC, which may not be supported by bandwidth-limited communication links in practice. In this article, we develop a communication-efficient decentralized ATSC framework for traffic networks with multiple intersections, where each intersection only exchanges traffic statistics with its neighboring intersections. In particular, the proposed framework consists of a generative adversarial network (GAN) based algorithm for traffic data recovery, and a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based decentralized ATSC algorithm for traffic efficiency enhancement. By adopting the value decomposition technique that establishes a nonlinear mapping from the local state-action values to the global reward, each intersection can independently determine its traffic light signal based on its local traffic data while achieving collaboration among neighboring intersections. Our proposed decentralized ATSC framework is scalable to large-scale traffic networks, and is also robust to traffic flow variations via interacting with the environment. Simulations show that our proposed algorithm can significantly reduce the vehicle travel time while maintaining high and stable traffic throughput.},

The optimization of single-train driving control and multi-train operation synergy are two critical and closely related aspects for energy saving, but they are rarely solved in an integrative manner. The comprehensive study on these two aspects is a complex, large-scale, multi-variable and constrained task, which involves nested, coupled and mutual-input optimization processes. This paper proposes an energy-efficient integrated model, which includes optimizing single-train operation control in an inner model and multi-train operation synergy, committing to the utilization of regenerative braking energy (RBE) in an outer model. A parallelized particle swarm optimization based on Map-Reduce (PPSO-MR) algorithm is proposed to solve the integrated model to reduce the execution time. Two concepts of temporal-spatial record and time shift are introduced to derive the movement of a train at inter-stations for the operation adjustment of multiple trains on a subway line. Experimental results show that the proposed control model solved by the holistic optimization approach can achieve lower energy consumption with fast execution time. This study provides the novel model and algorithm to obtain energy-saving schedules serving the multi-train operation coordination.},

  abstract     = {To find the optimal powertrain design for hybrid and electric vehicles in terms of energy efficiency and performance, automatised optimisation tools are often applied. These require a mathematical model of the powertrain configuration, which is usually done on the level of components, such as planetary gear sets (PGSs), clutches and brakes. This, however, leads to a huge design space with lots of functional redundancy. In fact, each functional powertrain mode can be realised by various component combinations. In this paper, a novel mode-based modelling technique for arbitrary hybrid and electric powertrain configurations with up to one internal combustion engine (ICE) and two electrical machines (EMs) is proposed. This allows to easily analyse multi-mode hybrid and electric powertrains on a purely functional basis. Additionally, it reduces mode describing parameters to the minimum amount required. First, an existing graphical representation of hybrid powertrains with one ICE and one EM is analysed and formalised. Based on that, virtual powertrain nodes are defined. These are used to compose all hybrid and electric powertrain modes. Five of them are presented in detail and plotted within a three-dimensional ratio plot. Using a first case study, it is shown how the ratio plot can be used to analyse arbitrary multi-mode powertrains. Within a second case study, it is demonstrated how optimal parameter sets for single-mode powertrain configurations can be identified using the derived model.},

This paper presents a more practical technique for automated vehicles’ predictive driving by extending the existing adaptive cruise control (ACC) scheme with a look-ahead functionality. Such a look-ahead driving scheme (LDS) predicts the states of the preceding vehicle at an adaptive look-ahead time step and, with negligible computation costs, computes the vehicle control input more circumspectly for efficient driving in urban traffic. The proposed LDS is evaluated in typical urban traffic at the signalized intersections by observing the intersection utilization, flowing characteristics, and individual vehicles’ fuel efficiency. Furthermore, we also evaluate the influences of the LDS-vehicles’ penetration rates on overall traffic performances at various traffic volumes.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a design of driveline torque observer with dual clutch transmission (DCT). A goal of this study is to improve estimation performance of the observer. To increase the observer’s performance, it is important to make an accurate driveline model and a robust observer. First, to increase the accuracy of the model, we propose lumped driveline efficiency which is a parameter that expresses driveline transmission loss. In addition, a recursive least square estimation (RLSE) algorithm is proposed to estimate the parameter using driving data. Then, the model is updated using the estimated parameter value. Second, a reduced order observer is proposed to estimate transmitted torques of driveline in both driving and gear shifting process. Moreover, the observer, which is robust against measurement noise and disturbance, is designed through frequency domain analysis. For frequency domain analysis, an eigenstructure assignment method is applied to tune observer gains. Performance of the proposed RLSE algorithm and the observer are verified through simulation and testbench experiments.},

  abstract     = {Shortening inter-vehicle distance can increase traffic throughput on roads for increasing volume of vehicles. In the process, traffic accidents occur more frequently, especially for multi-car accidents. Furthermore, it is difficult for drivers to drive safely under such complex driving conditions. This article investigates multi-vehicle longitudinal collision avoidance issue under such traffic conditions based on the Advanced Emergency Braking System (AEBS). AEBS is used to avoid collisions or mitigate the impact during critical situations by applying brake automatically. Hierarchical multi-vehicle longitudinal collision avoidance controller is proposed to guarantee safety of multi-cars using Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communication capability in addition to radar for longitudinal vehicle control. High-level controller is designed to ensure safety of multi-cars and optimize total energy by calculating the target braking force. Vehicle network is used to get the key vehicle-road interaction data and constrained hybrid genetic algorithm (CHGA) is adopted to decouple the vehicle-road interactive system,which can obtain the maximum ground friction through vehicle-road data, and provide key predictive parameters for multi-vehicle safety controller. Lower level non-singular Fractional Terminal Sliding Mode(NFTSM) Controller is built to achieve control goals of high-level controller. Simulations are carried out under typical driving conditions. Results verify that the proposed system in this article can avoid or mitigate the collision risk compared to the vehicle without this system.},

  abstract     = {Coordination of the Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) is a demanding task in aspects of effective incorporation of road information with the control of vehicle motion states. Formulating a platoon composed of multiple CAVs initially located in multiple lanes requires integrated consideration of both steering incurred by the curved road and merging actions. Meanwhile, additional requirement of intervehicle safety distance keeping as well as bounded actuations is also critical for practical implementation. Considering the above problems, a comprehensive framework containing a distributed controller is proposed in this paper to systematically address the combined problems. A bi-level curvilinear vehicle coordination scheme is proposed and proven to be capable of guiding CAVs to desired platoon formation with theoretical analysis. Besides, both longitudinal and lateral acceleration limitations have been taken into consideration. The limited longitudinal acceleration is included in the design of nonlinear saturated controller of which the convergence has been proven. Adaptive merging is realized with a bounded lateral controller. The condition of limiting the initial states to guarantee safe intervehicle distance maintenance is formulated. Hardware-in-the-Loop (HiL) test demonstrations in multiple road scenarios with different curvatures validate the performance of the proposed controller over existing baseline methods.},

A coordinate transformation and the prescribed performance control (PPC) technique are employed to develop a second-order Euler-Lagrange formulation of the tracking errors. Then, a neural adaptive saturated velocity observer-based controller is proposed to force that the trailer center is exactly placed under the end point of the harvester unloading tube to collect cereal grains. By an effective application of the PPC technique and computing a safe motion boundary, controller non-singularity, collision avoidance and connectivity between two vehicles are preserved continuously. The model uncertainties including unknown vehicle parameters, variable trailer mass and moment of inertia during the crop collection, surface friction, climate and crop conditions and external disturbances are compensated by an effective combination of a neural network and an adaptive robust control law. Lyapunov’s direct method is employed to prove that the tracking errors are semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded and converge to a neighborhood of the origin with a pre-specified maximum overshoot, convergence rate and steady-state accuracy. Finally, comparative simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller for the crop harvesting operations in a practical perspective.},

  abstract     = {Vehicles on the road, where an Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) is built, can share a lot of traffic information and drive more safely and efficiently through data sharing. Since incorrect information misleads vehicles and causes confusion in traffic, a vehicular trust model is needed to check the message’s trustworthiness while considering the vehicle’s properties and protecting its privacy. In this paper, we proposed a two layered blockchain-based reputation system, which consists of a local one-day message blockchain and a global vehicle reputation blockchain. It can administrate the reputation score securely and preserve the vehicle’s partial privacy. The proposed model efficiently manages local traffic information through the local one-day blockchain, reducing the memory overhead of vehicles. As the vehicle’s actual identity and activities in other areas are hidden by using one-time public keys, partial privacy of the vehicle is preserved. According to the activity of the vehicle, the vehicle’s reputation score is updated and stored permanently in the global reputation blockchain. We also suggested the location-based practical byzantine fault tolerance (LPBFT), a new consensus algorithm for fast block generating. The LPBFT lowers message propagation time through location-based primary node selection and is about 1.4 times faster than existing PBFT. The simulation results show the efficiency and the feasibility of LPBFT and our proposed protocol.},

  abstract     = {Improving the efficiency of traffic signal control is an effective way to alleviate traffic congestion at signalized intersections. To achieve effective management of the system-wide traffic flows, current research tends to focus on applying reinforcement learning (RL) techniques for collaborative traffic signal control in a traffic road network. However, the existing collaboration-based methods often ignore the impact of transmission delay for exchanging traffic flow information on the system. Most of the studies assume that the signal controllers can collect all instantaneous vehicular features without delay. To fill the gap, we propose an RL-based cooperative traffic signal control scheme considering the data transmission delay issue in a traffic road network. In this paper, we (1) design our new RL agents to cooperatively control the traffic signals by improving the reward and state representation based on the state-of-the-art max-pressure control theory; (2) propose a traffic state prediction method to address the data transmission delay issue by decreasing the discrepancy between the real-time and delayed traffic conditions; (3) evaluated the performance of our proposed work on both synthetic and real-world scenarios with a different range of data transmission delays. The results demonstrate that our method surpassed the performance of the previous max-pressure-based traffic signal control methods and addressed the data transmission delay issue.},

In this work, we propose two efficient methods, to accomplish fast subspace computation and accurate angle of arrival (AoA) acquisition. By leveraging randomized low-rank approximation, our fast multiple signal classification (MUSIC) methods, relying on random sampling and projection techniques, substantially accelerate the subspace estimation by orders of magnitude. Moreover, we establish the theoretical bounds of our proposed methods, which ensure the accuracy of the approximated pseudo-spectrum. As demonstrated, the pseudo-spectrum acquired by our fast-MUSIC would be highly precise; and the estimated AoA is almost as accurate as standard MUSIC. In contrast, our new methods are tremendously faster than standard MUSIC. Thus, our fast-MUSIC enables the high-resolution real-time environmental sensing with massive MIMO radars, which has great potential in the emerging unmanned systems.},

In addition, the VTFAR model stability is investigated and an approximation for the correlated scattering channel is proposed. The experimental validation shows a good agreement with RMSE of only 0.01 for the delay spread and 0.4 for the stationarity time.

  abstract     = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) composed of unit cells with tunable reflection coefficients, amplitude, phase, and frequency has received great interest from wireless communication communities. In this paper, a non-stationary three-dimensional (3-D) wideband IRS-assisted channel model, including spatial and temporal non-stationarity, is proposed for high altitude platform (HAP) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems. The proposed channel model considers the propagation environment around the receiver (Rx) and that around both the IRS and Rx, which are modeled using multiple 3-D cylinders and confocal elliptic-cylinders, respectively. In the proposed model, the optimal reflection phases of the IRS reflection units are proposed, and the number and the size of the IRS reflection units are also considered, which are used to investigate received signal strength, multipath fading effect, and spatial non-stationarity of IRS-aided communication systems. The numerical results show that the IRS reflection units can improve the received signal strength by adjusting the reflection phases and multipath fading effect can be effectively reduced by increasing the number and the size of IRS reflection units. Also, it is found that the spatial correlation significantly decreases with the increase of the number and size of the IRS reflection units, and the proposed IRS-aided channel model presents spatial non-stationarity. These observations can provide guidelines and references for systems design and performance analysis of IRS-aided HAP-MIMO communication systems.},

  abstract     = {Device-to-device (D2D) communication is an emerging paradigm that can improve system capacity and spectral efficiency by using cooperative communication coexisting with cellular networks. In spite of these advantages, D2D communication suffers from unfair resource usage, security risks posed by eavesdroppers, and limited energy storage. To deal with these issues, in this paper, we propose a resource allocation algorithm to maximize the security-aware energy efficiency (EE) for D2D users (DUs) in a simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT)-enabled D2D communication system with &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\alpha$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; fairness, where multiple random eavesdroppers are present. In particular, we formulate a multi-objective resource allocation problem by jointly optimizing the transmit power, power-splitting (PS) factors of DUs, and the sub-channel allocation factor under multiple constraints, including the maximum interference power for each cellular user, the maximum transmit power of each DU, the PS factor, and the integer sub-channel assignment. To solve the non-convex problem, an iterative algorithm is developed to obtain the sub-optimal solution. Simulation results verify that the proposed algorithm outperforms benchmark algorithms in terms of balancing secrecy EE and fairness.},

By jointly exploiting the dynamic characteristics of wireless channels and computational capability at the clients, we optimize the federated learning network by maximizing the number of active clients under the constraints of both latency and bandwidth. Specifically, we propose two bandwidth allocation (BA) schemes, where scheme I is based on the instantaneous channel state information (CSI), while scheme II employs the particle swarm optimization (PSO) method, based on the statistical CSI. Simulation results on the test accuracy and convergence rate are finally provided to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed optimization schemes for the considered FL network.},

Analytical and simulation results show that the diversity gain is not affected by the number of reflecting elements, but the coding gain exponentially and linearly grows with the number of reflecting elements if the Rician channel factors are larger than and equal to zero, respectively.},

However, if multiple resource demanders (RDs) offload tasks to the MAHC without a proper scheduling policy, it may cause unbalanced load distribution among resource providers (RPs), which will affect the overall quality of service (QoS). To this end, in this paper, we propose a multi-agent independent learning approach aiming to optimize the QoS of MAHC. Firstly, for the distributed MAHC, we formulate the QoS optimization model as a non-cooperative game, where each RD competes for maximizing its own utility. Secondly, based on the potential game theory, we prove the existence of Nash equilibrium. A multi-agent independent learning algorithm is then proposed to obtain the equilibrium points, and the convergence of this algorithm is analyzed. Simulation results confirm that the proposed approach helps balance the load distribution and enhances the QoS of MAHC.},

However, the energy consumption of UAVs is a key issue in this UAVs-enabled application. Usually, the communication overhead plays an important role in the energy consumption. To address this problem, we design two distributed methods for this multi-UAV system with considerable performance under low communication overhead. Firstly, a distributed majorize-minimization (DMM) method is proposed. To accelerate its convergence, a tight upper bound of the objective function from the primary one is derived. Furthermore, a distributed estimation scheme using the Fisher information matrix (DEF) is presented, only requiring one round of communication between edge UAVs and central UAV. Simulation results show that the proposed DMM outperforms the existing distributed iterative methods in terms of root of mean square error (RMSE) under low communication overhead. Moreover, the most communication-effective DEF with local search estimation performs much better than the proposed DMM in terms of RMSE, but has a higher computational complexity.},

Considering that video transmission is usually delay-sensitive, the video quality can be adaptively adjusted based on the network conditions. First, a new performance metric, called the average video quality degradation probability, is proposed to describe the adaptive video quality. Then, based on the principles of NOMA and user queue model, the average video quality degradation probability of both users is derived. Next, a bisection search based power allocation (PA) algorithm is proposed to balance the video quality between the NOMA pair. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed NOMA scheme is more effective to achieve the user fairness compared with the fixed NOMA scheme, the fractional transmit power allocation (FTPA) based NOMA scheme, the achievable rate fairness (ARF) NOMA scheme, and the optimized time division multiple access (TDMA) scheme.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we introduce channel prediction to wireless communications aided by intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) in order to reduce the overhead brought by full channel estimation. Hopefully, fine-grained control of reflection coefficients on IRS can still be maintained with sufficiently accurate channel prediction. Innovatively, we consider channel prediction as an analogy to image super-resolution in computer vision since elements on an IRS are normally two-dimensionally arranged, which makes the popular deep learning techniques efficient solution. To this end, we first solve the element control problem via semi-definite relaxation (SDR) and then design an end-to-end deep-learning model for channel prediction. With estimation for only part of the entire channel state information (CSI), the total channel estimation overhead can be significantly reduced. We visually show that the purposed deep-learning model maintains considerably high accuracy for channel prediction, which makes the proposed channel-prediction method outperforms the existing group-based method in terms of achievable rate. Moreover, the tradeoff between channel estimation overhead and channel prediction accuracy is also investigated with numerical results.},

Optimal precoding design is a main concern in multi-RU joint transmission. In this paper, a new multi-RU joint precoding scheme is newly designed for sum-r ate-maximization with a minimum rate guarantee constraint under imperfect channel estimation. Owing to non-convexity of minimum rate guarantee constraints which causes huge computational complexity, we decouple the non-convex rate guarantee constraint into two convex constraints; desired signal constraint and interference constraint. And then, we propose a computationally efficient algorithm to find the suboptimal solution by iteratively solving two convex suboptimization problems. Through intensive simulations, the performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated and found to be superior compared with two previous schemes as well as the small-cell base station (SBS) transmission scheme.},

To this end, in this correspondence, we investigate a multiuser MEC system, where each user offloads packet to a single AP equipped with an MEC server by preempting the channel according to carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) protocol. We derive the effective offloading rate and delay by considering transmission outage caused by the poor channel condition, the MAC-layer channel competition, and the packet overflow due to the limited service capability of the server, where the service process is modelled as an &lt;inline-formula&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$M/M/1/B$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; queue.

In this paper, we study the employment of RIS in mitigating MUI in ISAC systems. For practical consideration, we investigate joint constant-modulus waveform and discrete RIS phase shift design, with the aim of minimizing MUI under the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) constraint for direction of arrival (DOA) estimation. An alternating optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the formulated problem, and two schemes are proposed to deal with the discrete RIS phase shifts.

In this paper, a denoising method based on ML is presented. Two ML algorithms are used to classify and remove noise in channel impulse responses. Then, the results of the traditional noise threshold denoising are compared with ML denoising, and it is found that the denoising classifier using the bidirectional recurrent neural network has the better denoising performance.

The proposed algorithm maximizes the D2D throughput and energy efficiency in a distributed manner, without online coordination and message exchange between users.

  abstract     = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted heterogeneous network has drawn great research interests as it can significantly improve the capacity and coverage of cellular networks. An UAV can act as a flying base station (BS) or a relay when the regular terrestrial infrastructure is malfunctioned or overloaded. However, the deployment of UAV-mounted communication infrastructure is confined by the limited on-board energy and short battery life. To prolong the lifetime of each UAV, connecting it with a ground charging station (GCS) through a tether could be a promising and feasible solution. In this paper, we aim to maximize the sum rate of all users by jointly optimizing the user association, resource allocation and placement of the GCSs and the aerial UAVs. In addition, the constraint of each user&amp;#x0027;s quality of service (QoS) requirement and total available resource are considered. To tackle this problem, we propose a cyclic iterative algorithm to efficiently obtain suboptimal solutions. Specifically, the primal problem is decomposed into three subproblems, i.e., the TUAV placement problem, the resource allocation problem and the user association problem. Then, the three sub-problems are alternately and iteratively optimized by using the outputs of the first two as the input for the third. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our proposed algorithm outperforms baseline algorithms under different setups.},

  abstract     = {Indoor drone or Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) operations, automated or with pilot control, are an upcoming and exciting subset of drone use cases. Automated indoor flights tighten the requirements of stability and localization accuracy in comparison with the classic outdoor use cases which rely primarily on (RTK) GNSS for localization. In this paper the effect of multiple sensors on 3D indoor position accuracy is investigated using the flexible sensor fusion platform OASE. This evaluation is based on real-life drone flights in an industrial lab with mm-accurate ground truth measurements provided by motion capture cameras, allowing the evaluation of the sensors based on their deviation from the ground truth in 2D and 3D. The sensors under consideration for this research are: IMU, sonar, SLAM camera, ArUco markers and Ultra-Wideband (UWB) positioning with up to 6 anchors. The paper demonstrates that using this setup, the achievable 2D (3D) indoor localization error varies between 4.4&amp;#x00A0;cm and 21&amp;#x00A0;cm (4.9&amp;#x00A0;cm and 67.2&amp;#x00A0;cm) depending on the selected set of sensors. Furthermore, cost/accuracy trade-offs are included to indicate the relative importance of different sensor combinations depending on the (engineering) budget and use case. These lab results were validated in a Proof of Concept deployment of an inventory scanning drone with more than 10 flight hours in a 65&amp;#x00A0;000 m2 warehouse. By combining lab results and real-life deployment experiences, different subsets of sensors are presented as a minimal viable solution for three different indoor use cases considering accuracy and cost: a large drone with little weight- and cost restrictions, one or more medium sized drones, and a swarm of weight and cost restricted nano drones.},

  abstract     = {Electric Vehicles (EVs) have emerged as one of the most promising solutions for reducing carbon emissions in smart cities. However, due to the limited battery life of EVs and the scarcity of charging stations, EV drivers are not willing to travel long distances. Thus, blockchain-enabled energy trading (BET) has lately been used to securely share energy among EVs via wireless power transfer (WPT) technology. Blockchain is used to ensure the security and privacy of transactions between untrustworthy EVs in the WPT process. Nevertheless, previous works on BET have relied on existing consensus mechanisms built on the requirements of the cryptocurrency systems. These consensus mechanisms have faced significant challenges in maintaining high reliability, throughput, low latency, and network scalability in V2V energy trading that requires real-time services. To address these issues, we propose a new consensus mechanism that leverages the benefits of Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) and Proof of Reputation (PoR) called PBFT-based PoR (PPoR). The energy trading process runs in a clustered vehicular network, where validator selection, block generation, and consensus processes are performed in each cluster. We adopt an incentive mechanism based on a Stackelberg game model to optimize the utility of sellers, buyers, and validator nodes, which motivates honest and cooperative nodes. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme reduces buyers&amp;#x2019; costs by 21.1&amp;#x0025; while increasing the utility of sellers by 18&amp;#x0025;. Moreover, compared to benchmarks, the proposed scheme reduces the transaction processing delay and increases the throughput by more than 47.1&amp;#x0025; and 15.7&amp;#x0025;, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Past few years have witnessed the widespread adoption of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in target tracking for regional monitor and strike. Most existing target tracking approaches rely on the target motion frames obtained by the camera equipped, or on ideally assuming a pre-set target trajectory. However, in practice, the real trajectory of the target cannot be perfectly known to the UAVs in advance, and also the target may intelligently adjust its flying strategy according to the environment. Besides, the limited flight performance, as well as information capture and processing capability, of a single UAV can hardly fulfill high tracking success rate requirements. To address aforementioned issues, this paper proposes an end-to-end cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) scheme, where UAVs are enabled to make intelligent flight decisions for cooperative target tracking, on the basis of the past and current states of the target. In order to reduce power consumption and prolong the lifetime of the UAV tracking system, the propulsion power consumption model and energy saving strategy are introduced. Moreover, to further increase the detection coverage, spatial information entropy is introduced in the tracking algorithm. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm outperfoms the deep reinforcement learning baselines in terms of the mean episode rewards, while also yields high performances with respect to tracking success rates, power saving efficiency and detection coverage.},

  abstract     = {Mobile edge computing (MEC) has been considered as a promising paradigm to support the growing popularity of mobile devices (MDs) with similar capabilities as cloud computing. Most existing research focuses on MEC enabled by terrestrial base stations (BSs), which is unable to work in certain scenarios, e.g., disaster rescue and field operation. Some researchers have been making efforts on studying MEC assisted by unmanned-aerial-vehicles (UAVs) and developed lots of efficient scheduling algorithms. However, MEC assisted only by UAVs has limited capability and is unsuitable for heavy-computation applications. To address the issue, this paper proposes a novel UAV-and-BS hybrid enabled MEC system, where multiple UAVs and one BS are deployed to facilitate the provisioning of MEC services either directly from UAVs or indirectly from the BS. Considering maximizing the lifetime of all MDs, the energy-efficient scheduling problem is formulated as minimizing the energy consumption of all MDs by jointly optimizing UAV trajectories, task associations, computing-and-transmitting resource allocations. The optimization problem is further decomposed into three sub-problems and solved by the proposed hybrid heuristic and learning based scheduling algorithms to reduce the complexity. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve promising performance improvements over baseline algorithms, including local-computing, random-offloading and greedy-offloading.},

By considering the fact that smartphone users may not always be willing to provide such computation service because of the consumption of their own energy and resources, a truthful mechanism is designed to provide incentive to smartphone users. The design aims to maximize the net revenue of the service provider and addresses more practical, but more complicated, scenarios of unknown a prior distribution information on smartphone users’ private information. To tackle this high computational complexity, which makes the traditional mechanism design methods infeasible, a new approach, called truthful deep mechanism, is proposed by leveraging a multi-task machine learning model, where inherently inter-connected collaborator selection and pricing policy determination are decided by designing two deep neural networks. The numerical results show that the proposed deep truthful mechanism can ensure a convergence to a stable state and can satisfy all required economical properties, including individual rationality, incentive compatibility, and budget balance.},

  abstract     = {As an attractive alternative to traditional and large satellite, small satellite cluster (SSC) with low cost and short development time will play an important role in Earth observation. Generally, SSC networks for Earth observation are energy-limited, the design of the joint data downloading and resource management scheme remains challenging. On the one hand, with the ever-increasing amount of sensing data, multiple gateway stations and relay satellites have been deployed to receive the sensing data from SSC. The problem that where to download the sensing data should be addressed. On the other hand, due to the limited communication, storage, computing and power supply capacities of small satellite, an efficient multi-dimensional resource management scheme should be adopted. In this paper, the joint data downloading scheduling and multi-dimensional resource management problem for satellite cluster networks with relay satellites is investigated, which is formulated as a long-term optimization problem to minimize the energy consumption and guarantee the data drop rate performance. Then, this problem is decomposed into a series of mixed-integer programming problems by Lyapunov optimization theory. Leveraging many-to-many matching theory with empty node and the simplex method, an online joint data downloading and resource management (OJDDRM) scheme is proposed. Simulation results validate the proposed OJDDRM scheme&amp;#x0027;s performance and demonstrate that there exists a balance point for the proposed OJDDRM scheme. Under the balance point, the data drop rate is zero and the energy consumption can be reduced compared with the existed schemes.},

However, existing works only focus on the enhancement between computation offloading and data caching but ignore the competition for cache resources between them. To this end, in this paper, we propose a caching enhanced computation offloading algorithm in mobile edge service networks (MESN), by considering the cache resources competition. We formulate a joint optimization problem of content caching and cache-enhanced computation offloading. Furthermore, we give the optimal caching strategy to achieve the equilibrium between the resources competition. By our offloading algorithm caching strategy, the average response time of computation and content request tasks can get further reduction. In addition, we design two low time complexity algorithms, i.e., mixed caching algorithm and enhanced offloading algorithm, to solve the sub-problems, i.e., smart base station (SBS) caching sub-problem and computation offloading sub-problem, transformed by the original optimization problem. The simulation results show that our algorithms can quickly converge and our scheme can reduce 20.52&amp;#x0025; average response time of all tasks at most compared with other schemes.},

  abstract     = {One of the pillars of the 5G architecture is network slicing, in which hardware, radio, and power resources are virtualized as a logical network taking into account the requirements of diverse applications. While ensuring performance isolation among different slices, resource allocation in 5G Radio Access Networks (RANs) is associated with different challenges due to network dynamics and the different applications’ requirements. In this paper, we have considered the allocation of power and radio resources to rate-based as well as resource-based users. We propose an energy-efficient deep reinforcement learning-assisted resource allocation (EE-DRL-RA) method for RAN slicing in 5G networks. The main idea of the proposed method is to exploit a collaborative learning framework that includes deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and deep learning (DL) to decide on resource allocation in the RAN. Specifically, we use DL for decision-making on resource allocation on a large time-scale and DRL for decision-making on resource allocation on a small time-scale. The asynchronous advantage actor-critic (A3C) and the stacked and bidirectional long-short-term-memory (SBiLSTM) network are used as DRL and supervised DL methods, respectively. Furthermore, we determine the optimal power and resource blocks (RBs) for rate-based users by formulating the energy-efficient power allocation (EE-PA) problem as a non-convex optimization problem and solve it by an efficient iterative algorithm. Our proposed approach is unique in that it simultaneously allocates power and RBs while ensuring slice isolation with low computational and time complexity. Simulation results show that EE-DRL-RA yields better performance compared to a state-of-the-art published method in terms of convergence speed, computational complexity, energy efficiency, and the number of accepted users as well as the degree of inter-slice isolation.},

However, the delay caused by data transmission conflicts is still a problem in the current Ethernet research, which cannot meet the demands of real-time transmission between network devices. To solve the time-delay problem, an improved adaptive genetic algorithm (IAGA) for topology optimization is proposed, in which a new optimization model is established based on the train Ethernet topology. Compared with two traditional algorithms in solving the optimization model, the IAGA achieved better performance in terms of convergence speed and solution accuracy. To verify the effect of the optimized model, the theoretical calculation, simulation, and experiment based on a communication platform are carried out for the real-time index. Experimental results indicated that the end-to-end delay of the optimized network is significantly reduced.

Furthermore, we have proved that the CFG with Group-Best order is an exact potential game (EPG), which can get stable group partition and achieve global optimization, i.e., minimizing total cost. Finally, a best response algorithm for NOMA based CFG (NCFG) is proposed to find stable group partition. Simulation results verify that our proposed approach is better than other approaches.},

In this paper, the UE association problem is investigated from a long-term perspective, where the UE&#39;s mobility pattern, i.e., the moving velocity and direction, is taken into consideration. To predict the UE&#39;s positions based on their previous activity data, a practical scheme, i.e., the classification and batch online learning method (CBOM), is proposed for achieving the UE&#39;s velocity and direction transition matrices. Then the UE association problem with the objective of maximizing the UEs’ expected achievable rate while minimizing the number of handovers is formulated.

However, none of them consider the ability of seamlessly integrating edge resources running across multiple drones in a single pool, to holistically manage and control these resources as well as to eliminate vendor lock-in situations. This paper presents an intelligent resource scheduling solution for a federated aerial EC system, called AirEdge, which jointly considers task dependencies, heterogeneous resource demand and drones’ flight time. We propose a multi-task execution time estimation and a dispatching policy, to select the closest drone deployment having congruent flight time and resource availability to execute ready tasks at any given time. For the utilization of the drones’ attached edge resources, we propose a variant bin-packing optimization approach through gang-scheduling of multi-dependent tasks that co-locates tasks tightly on nodes to fully utilize available resources. Experiments on real-world data-trace from Alibaba cluster trace with information on task dependencies (about 12,207,703 dependencies) and resource demands show the effectiveness, fast executions, and resource efficiency of our approach.},

  abstract     = {Integrated satellite-terrestrial (IST) networks will play a promising role in future peer-to-peer (P2P) distribution by bridging multiple isolated P2P sub-networks to provide real-time cross-regional file access in certain scenarios. However, due to the periodic orbital movements of satellites, highly time-varying visibility among peer nodes in IST networks imposes significant challenge on file lookup and retrieval, which is difficult to be solved with current methods in terrestrial P2P networks. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a contact-aware dual-layer Chord (DL-Chord) lookup mechanism for P2P-based IST networks by carefully considering link contacts among satellites and terrestrial P2P nodes. In the proposed DL-Chord mechanism, we develop a group of novel algorithms, comprising an orbital parameter-based dual-layer identification mapping scheme, a contact-based dual-layer finger table, an efficient file lookup algorithm, and a node updating scheme. Furthermore, a theoretical analysis is conducted based on the visibility of satellite constellations to evaluate the lookup performance of the proposed DL-Chord mechanism, i.e., average lookup delay (ALD) and average lookup rounds (ALR). Simulation results verify that the proposed mechanism achieves better efficiency in terms of ALD and ALR with a lower update cost than other similar schemes, i.e., the stochastic mapping-based original chord ring scheme (ORCO) and physical location-aware mapping-based wireless location-aware scheme (WILCO).},

A laser charging DBS framework is proposed in which a DBS is provisioning services for user equipments (UEs) on the ground and harvesting energy transmitted from the laser charging station mounted on the macro base station (MBS). Both MBS and DBS are equipped with servers. UEs can offload their tasks to either the MBS or the DBS. The DBS is to be placed at the optimal location to provide uplink communications and computing services for the ground UEs in each time slot. We thus formulate the joint user AssoCiation bandwidth and Computation ResoUrce Assignment Laser charing (ACCRUAL) problem to jointly maximize the DBS service time and minimize the task completion time for all UEs. Since ACCRUAL is a mixed integer nonlinear problem, we decompose it into two sub-problems: the joint UE association computing REsource And bandwidth allocation Problem (REAP) and the DBS placement problem. An iterative algorithm is employed to solve the REAP problem and a placement algorithm based on counting sort is used to tackle the DBS placement problem. The performance of our algorithm is superior to the greedy algorithm and equally shared resource allocation algorithm upon which the total UE task offloading completion time is improved by more than 9&amp;#x0025; as compared to the greedy algorithm and the total DBS service time is improved by 20&amp;#x0025; when the laser power is 200&amp;#x00A0;w and 40&amp;#x0025; of the DBS service time is improved when the laser power is 400&amp;#x00A0;w.},

In such dynamic scenarios, it is needed to search and track mobile objects transported by the water flows, such as humans, animals, vehicles, and debris. The use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is essential in disaster scenarios to help first responders determine correct procedures in terms of searching, tracking, and rescuing the victims, as well as in defining the actions to minimize the risks in a sustainable and timely manner. However, the tracking of mobile objects and the delivery of real-time video sequences from UAVs with energy constraints toward first responders is still a hard task. Therefore, it is necessary to orchestrate a swarm of UAVs for searching and tracking objects while reacting fast to frequent changes in the topology and trajectory, as well as distributing real-time video flows with quality level support to the ground team. This article proposes an energy-aware swarm-based and mobility prediction scheme for UAVs, called SUAV. SUAV provides a unique UAV-based system for rescue scenarios with mobile objects and with support for route and path planning, searching and tracking procedures, mobility prediction and multi-hop communication management, video delivery with Quality of Service (QoS)/Quality of Experience (QoE) support, and energy-efficiency. Simulation results show the efficiency of SUAV in transmitting real-time video flows with QoS/QoE support while minimizing the energy consumption in flooding scenarios with mobile targets.},

  abstract     = {Ultra-reliable and low-latency (URLLC) traffic in the upcoming sixth-generation (6G) systems utilize short packets, signalling a distancing from traditional communication systems devised only to support long data packets based on Shannon&amp;#x0027;s capacity formula. This poses a formidable challenge for system designers and network operators. Many URLLC scenarios involve infrastructure-less unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted communications. One of the biggest challenges with UAVs is their limited battery capacity, which can cause abrupt disruption of UAV-assisted communications. To overcome these limitations, we consider URLLC-enabled over-the-air charging of UAV relay system using a laser transmitter. Furthermore, we formulate a non-convex optimization problem to minimize the total decoding error rate subject to optimal resource allocation, including blocklength allocation, power control, trajectory planning, and energy harvesting to facilitate URLLC in such systems. In this regard, given its lower complexity, a novel perturbation-based iterative method is proposed to solve the optimization problem. The proposed method yields optimal blocklength allocation and power control for the two transmission phases, i.e., from the source node to the UAV and from the UAV to the robot acting as a ground station. It also maps the UAV trajectory from the initial position to the final position, and the UAV completes the flight using the laser&amp;#x0027;s harvested energy. It is shown that the proposed algorithm and fixed baseline scheme, named fixed blocklength (FB), yield a similar performance as the exhaustive search in terms of UAV energy consumption. In contrast, fixed trajectory (FT) delivers the worst performance. Simultaneously, the proposed method yields the best performance in terms of the lowest average overall decoding error compared to fixed baseline schemes, including FB and FT, showing the efficacy of the proposed technique.},

  abstract     = {Deployment of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as flying base stations to provide specific geographical area with air-to-ground wireless communications is expected to increase dramatically in the coming decades, owing to its flexibility, mobility and autonomy. Moreover, mobile edge computing (MEC) promises significant reduction in latency by caching popular contents at the mobile edge. In this paper, we propose a method to apply mobile edge caching on UAVs in wireless communication systems. By investigating the user request preference with the aid of latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), the caching strategy can be optimized. In the proposed system, we consider the design of intelligent caching strategies when a number of UAVs are deployed to serve ground users, where each UAV has a limited storage capacity for caching useful user contents. We use LDA to extract the user request preferences in order to intelligently cache data in the UAVs, while we utilize &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$k$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -means clustering to classify users and to help deploy UAVs. Besides, we consider three user-UAV association criteria, namely the user received signal to noise ratio (SNR), user preferences and the delay.

To compensate for high propagation losses, these systems will utilize antenna arrays with extremely directional beams. The performance of such systems will thus be heavily affected by micromobility such as shakes and rotations of user equipment (UE) even when user is in stationary position. The ultimate impact of micromobility is spontaneous degradation of signal-to-noise (SNR) level leading to outages. In this paper, we measure and statistically investigate the micromobility process of various applications including video viewing, phone calling, virtual reality viewing and racing game. Particularly, we characterize occupancy distributions and first-passage time (FPT) to outage for various antenna configurations. We also assess the radial symmetry in micromobility patterns and characterize distance-dependent velocity and drift to the origin parameters. The obtained results are essential for developing mathematical models of micromobility patterns that needs to be further used in system-level analysis of THz cellular systems. To this end, we also illustrate that Markov models are only suitable for applications with low and purely random micromobility dynamics such as video viewing and phone calling. When a user is controlled by the application, as in the case of gaming, Markov models overestimate FPT to outage.},

  abstract     = {The critical nature of vehicular communications requires their extensive testing and evaluation. Analytical models can represent an attractive and cost-effective approach for such evaluation if they can adequately model all underlying effects that impact the performance of vehicular communications. Several analytical models have been proposed to date to model vehicular communications based on the IEEE 802.11p (or DSRC) standard. However, existing models normally model in detail the MAC (Medium Access Control), and generally simplify the propagation and interference effects. This reduces their value as an alternative to evaluate the performance of vehicular communications. This paper addresses this gap, and presents new analytical models that accurately model the performance of vehicle-to-vehicle communications based on the IEEE 802.11p standard. The models jointly account for a detailed modeling of the propagation and interference effects, as well as the impact of the hidden terminal problem. The model quantifies the PDR (Packet Delivery Ratio) as a function of the distance between transmitter and receiver. The paper also presents new analytical models to quantify the probability of the four different types of packet errors in IEEE 802.11p. In addition, the paper presents the first analytical model capable to accurately estimate the Channel Busy Ratio (CBR) metric even under high channel load levels. All the analytical models are validated by means of simulation for a wide range of parameters, including traffic densities, packet transmission frequencies, transmission power levels, data rates and packet sizes. An implementation of the models is provided openly to facilitate their use by the community.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we analyze the tradeoff between the profits gained by mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) in an orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA)-based virtualized wireless network (VWN). In this respect, MVNOs rent the network resources from a mobile network operator (MNO) to create virtual resources based on allocated rates and the cost due to allocated transmit powers in two different strategies: resource-based isolation strategy and rate-based isolation strategy. In resource-based isolation strategy, it is assumed that the whole bandwidth in each base station is divided equally between MVNOs whereas in rate-based isolation strategy, the whole bandwidth in each base station is allocated dynamically between MVNOs. We then formulate a multi-objective optimization problem (MOOP) to show the tradeoff between the maximum profit of each MVNO. To solve the formulated MOOP, we adopt the weighted Tchebycheff approach, which can provide the complete Pareto optimal region for nonconvex problems. Thus, by developing such formulation, we will be able to find the best profit gained by MVNOs. We also employ monotonic optimization to obtain the global optimal solutions of the non-convex problems by applying polyblock outer approximation algorithm. Our numerical results show the importance of the aforementioned tradeoffs and confirm that the proposed geometric programming (GP) based algorithm achieves excellent performance as compared to the monotonic method.},

The characteristics that video service can flexibly adjust the encoding rates and provide acceptable encoding qualities, make the security requirements more possible to be satisfied but tightly coupled with video encoding by introducing more restrictions on edge caching. In this paper, by considering the interaction between video encoding and edge caching, we investigate the quality of experience (QoE)-driven cross-layer optimization of secure video transmission over the wireless backhaul link in cloud-edge collaborative networks. First, we develop a secure transmission model based on video encoding and edge caching. By employing this model as the security constraint, then we formulate a QoE-driven joint optimization problem subject to limited available caching capacity. To solve the optimization problem, we propose two algorithms: a near-optimal iterative algorithm (EC-VE) and a greedy algorithm with low computational complexity (Greedy EC-VE). Simulation results show that our proposed EC-VE can greatly improve user QoE within security constraints, and the proposed Greedy EC-VE can obtain the tradeoff between QoE and computational complexity.},

  abstract     = {Mobile vehicles have been considered as potential edge servers to provide computation resources for the emerging Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) applications. However, how to fully utilize the mobile computation resources to satisfy the real-time arrived computation requests has not been explored yet. This work will address the critical challenges of limited computation resources, stringent computation delay and unknown requirement statistics of real-time tasks in realistic vehicular edge computing scenarios. Specifically, we design a distributed clustering strategy to classify vehicles into multiple cooperative edge servers according to the available computation resources, effective connection time and the distribution of tasks&amp;#x2019; expected deadlines. Then, a &amp;#x2018;Less than or Equal to&amp;#x2019; Generalized Assignment Problem (i.e., LEGAP) is formulated to maximize the system service revenue, and on this basis, we propose an offline Bound-and-Bound based Optimal (BBO) algorithm to make periodical scheduling with a global view of tasks&amp;#x2019; requirement statistics. The quick branching is conducted by following a greedy solution and the upper bound at each branch is derived by solving a multiple-choice knapsack problem. In addition, we present an online heuristic algorithm which makes real-time offloading decision with the guarantees that the resource capacities of all the computing servers are never exceeded with new tasks arriving. Through comparing with the other four online algorithms, the BBO algorithm achieves the highest service revenues by offloading tasks with shorter delays, and the online heuristic algorithm has the best performance in improving the service ratios.},

  abstract     = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided two-way relay networks with multiple terrestrial user pairs is investigated, where a fix-wing UAV is served as a two-way relay to assist information transmission. We aim to maximize the total rate of the two-way relay networks while the quality of service (QoS) being guaranteed. A novel relay strategy, namely time-slots pairing, is proposed by exploiting physical-layer network coding (PNC) protocol. Specifically, the UAV receives and buffers the signals from the scheduled user pair when the UAV approaches one of them, then forwards the modulated signal when the UAV is close to the other. As a result, a non-convex total rate maximization problem is formulated by joint trajectory design and resource optimization. To solve this problem, we first decompose it into three sub-problems, and then a three-step iterative algorithm that can effectively handle the non-convex problem with no worse than a polynomial complexity is developed leveraging the block coordinate descent (BCD) technique and successive convex approximation (SCA) method. Simulation results finally illustrate that: 1) Compared with amplify-and-forward (AF) or decode-and-forward (DF) protocols, the proposed design based on PNC protocol can significantly improve the total rate of the two-way relay networks; 2) the time-slots pairing relay strategy always achieves a significant enhancement on performance than the traditional non-time-slots pairing relay strategy; 3) the time-slots pairing relay strategy is more favorable for the mobile PNC relay networks since it can well resist the degradation of the entire networks caused by users&amp;#x2019; increased service quality requirements.},

  abstract     = {The impulsive noise and the time-varying channel are two major detrimental factors which greatly constrain the performance of underwater acoustic communications (UACs). Utilizing the joint sparsity of the impulsive noise and the channel impulse response, the paper proposes the generalized approximate message passing (GAMP)-based sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) frameworks for joint impulsive noise mitigation and channel estimation and tracking for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) UACs. Firstly, the SBL framework for the joint estimation is employed. To reduce the computational complexity, the GAMP is introduced into the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, and a low-complexity GAMP based SBL framework is formulated without performance degradation. To further estimate and track the impulsive noise and channel state information in the slow time-varying scenarios, we propose a novel GAMP-based temporal SBL framework. The factor graph and GAMP are used to achieve the approximated estimation for the posterior statistics of both the channel state information and the impulsive noise. The algorithm formulates the message passing scheduling for the EM algorithm to solve the joint multiple sparse signal recovery problem. Simulations and sea-trial results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms significantly improve the performance in terms of the mean square error of channel estimation, impulsive noise estimation, bit error rate and computational complexity compared with their corresponding SBL-based counterparts.},

  abstract     = {In ultra-dense cellular networks (UDNs) with user/control plane(U/C) splitting, frequent handovers in user planes are unavoidable, which seriously degrades the transmission control protocol (TCP) throughput of mobile station (MS). To enhance the TCP throughput in UDNs, this paper proposes an intelligent recommendation-based user plane handover scheme. Firstly, based on intelligent recommendation algorithms, a mobility prediction algorithm called content-based collaborative hybrid filters (CCHF) is proposed to predict the target small base station (SBS). When the MS moves into the cell-edge of the source SBS, it can pre-access the predicted target SBS and set up connections to the predicted target SBS and the source SBS simultaneously. This is the proposed CCHF-dual-handover scheme. With an accurate prediction and a simultaneous connection, CCHF-dual-handover can present enhanced signal to interference and noise ratio (SINR) at cell-edge, reduced handover interruption ratio (HIR), and improved MS’s TCP throughput. Moreover, TCP throughput of CCHF-dual-handover is analyzed to show the impact of various key parameters (such as MS’s velocity and pre-access threshold). Finally, simulations are carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed CCHF-dual-handover. Given random trajectory, the prediction accuracy using CCHF is increased by more than 100% compared with existing prediction algorithms. Given accurate prediction, the CCHF-dual-handover can improve the TCP throughput by up to 150% compared with that of existing handover schemes.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of wireless communication techniques, Internet of Things (IoT) has enabled a host of innovative services by deploying numerous distributed nodes to observe diverse phenomena. There are massive observations of phenomena at distributed nodes that need to be sent. Due to the low spectrum efficiency, it is a great challenge for orthogonal multi-access (OMA) schemes to transmit such enormous observations in time. To cope with this challenge, in this paper, we propose a joint compressed sensing (CS) measurement scheme for wireless networks to achieve the efficient observation of multiple phenomena. Specifically, all nodes are divided into multiple groups to observe different phenomena, and their observations are sequentially transmitted to the fusion center (FC) through the coherent multiple access channel (MAC). To evaluate the performance, we derive the total achievable rate, which is heavily influenced by the design of coherent transmission and joint CS measurement. Moreover, we compare the joint CS measurement scheme with the traditional scheme based on OMA by deriving the performance gain. It demonstrates the superiority of the proposed scheme.v To maximize the total achievable rate, we study a non-convex optimization problem of the common-component allocation and the time allocation. To solve this intractable problem, we equivalently convert it into a convex optimization problem by studying the non-convex constraint and propose a low-complexity algorithm to provide the optimal solution. Finally, simulation results are provided to verify the correctness of the theoretical analysis and demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed scheme.},

As such, to distinguish the superposed signals at each user, the passive beamforming weight at the IRSs and detection weight vectors at the users are jointly designed. As a benefit, by adopting a zero-forcing-based design, the intra-cell interference imposed by the IRS can be suppressed. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed network, we first derive the approximated channel statistics in the high signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) regime. Then, we derive the closed-form expressions both for the outage probability and for the ergodic rate of users. Both the high-SNR slopes of ergodic rate and the diversity orders of outage probability are derived for gleaning further insights. The network&#39;s SE and EE are also derived. Our numerical results are provided to confirm that: i) the high-SNR slope of the proposed network is one; ii) the SE and EE can be significantly enhanced by increasing the number of IRS elements.},

We refer to it as the Power to Velocity Ratio (PVR). The prime objective of this paper is to minimize either the maximum individual vehicle PVR or the entire system&#39;s PVR by optimizing the power allocation at the BS, while guaranteeing the information requirements of the vehicles both under the total transmit power constraint and driving velocity constraint. As for the individual vehicle PVR, a closed-form power allocation expression is derived by assuming that the transmit power constraint is non-restrictive. Based on this an optimal power allocation algorithm is proposed for arbitrary finite transmit power constraints. As for the system PVR, the non-convex problem formulated is first transformed into a convex problem and then the optimal solution is found by conceiving an efficient iterative algorithm. Our simulation results show that the proposed algorithms indeed succeed in achieving the optimal individual vehicle or system PVR.},

First, the closed-form expressions of covert communication constraint are derived under both the non-colluding and colluding detection strategies over the channels suffering both path-loss and small scaling fading. Then, considering the constraint of maximum available blocklength, the transmit power and the blocklength are jointly optimized to maximize the average effective covert throughput (AECT). Differing from the existing literature with only one warden, it is demonstrated that the increasing of maximum available blocklength causes the improvement of maximum AECT only when the density of warden is small. In addition, our examinations show that the expansion of the protection area indeed improves the maximum AECT, and the improvement under the non-colluding detection strategy is more significant than that under the colluding detection strategy.},

In this paper, we propose a vision-based relative localization scheme in the presence of communication constraints. First, the relative squared position error bound (SPEB) is derived via subspace projection of the Fisher information matrix. Next, we determine the local convexity of the relative SPEB with respect to bit allocation vectors and propose two bit allocation algorithms. Furthermore, we exploit the vision-based relative geometry and develop two localization algorithms based on Euclidean distance matrix completion.

  abstract     = {Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology with high order signal modulation method has been proposed recently as a scheme to achieve high throughput requirements of next-generation communication applications. However, the use of high-order modulation signals degrades the error rate performance. Generalized frequency division multiplexing (GFDM) has attracted enormous consideration for deploying in new communication scenarios due to its advantages in terms of out-of-band (OOB) emission, spectral efficiency (SE), and latency. Index modulation (IM) methods convey digital information by utilizing transmission entities with adjustable index parameters to provide flexible system design and offer attractive advantages such as energy and SE without increasing the computational complexity. The Multiple-Mode (MM) method permits multiple subcarriers to transmit multiple modes and employs the whole permutation of these modes to convey additional information bits. The proposed MIMO MM-GFDM-IM scheme improves the bit error rate and the spectral efficiency compared to the existing schemes. The proposed method can select the modulation order and the number of modes to achieve the design goals. Furthermore, a system with high modulation order can improve the spectral efficiency when the constellation point is fixed. This paper also proposes a practical and effective MM selection strategy and two low-complexity detectors.},

  abstract     = {Vehicle-to-everything communication system is a strong candidate for improving the driving experience and automotive safety by linking vehicles to wireless networks. To take advantage of the full benefits of vehicle connectivity, it is essential to ensure a stable network connection between roadside unit (RSU) and fast-moving vehicles. Based on the extended Kalman filter (EKF), we develop a vehicle tracking algorithm to enable reliable radio connections. For the vehicle tracking algorithm, we focus on estimating the rapid changes in the beam direction of a high-mobility vehicle while reducing the feedback overhead. Furthermore, we design a beamforming codebook that considers the road layout and RSU. By leveraging the proposed beamforming codebook, vehicles on the road can expect a service quality similar to that of conventional cellular services. Finally, a beamformer selection algorithm is developed to secure sufficient gain for the system&#39;s link budget. Numerical results verify that the EKF-based vehicle tracking algorithm and the proposed beamforming structure are more suitable for vehicle-to-infrastructure networks compared to existing schemes.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the physical-layer security (PLS) for an underlay cognitive radio network (CRN) with multiple non-colluding eavesdroppers is studied. We assume that a secondary user (SU) transmitter communicates with an SU receiver over a cascaded &lt;inline-formula&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\kappa$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt;-&lt;inline-formula&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\mu$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; fading channel and under the threat of eavesdropping. A cooperative jammer exists to improve the SUs&amp;#x2019; security by harvesting energy from the SU transmitter using power splitting technique. This harvested energy is utilized to generate jamming signals to deteriorate the eavesdroppers&amp;#x2019; reception quality. Moreover, the eavesdroppers are assumed to be randomly distributed according to a homogeneous Poisson point process (HPPP), in which the &lt;inline-formula&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$k^{th}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; closest eavesdropper to the SU transmitter will be selected in our analysis. Additionally, the legitimate receiver is assumed to harvest energy from the SU transmitter using the power splitting technique. In this context, we propose an optimum power splitting factor at the legitimate receiver that achieves the best privacy while constraining the amount of the harvested energy. Furthermore, on enhancing system security, we investigate the effectiveness of the jamming technique. The impact of distances over security is also examined. The results reveal an improvement in privacy as the legitimate receiver utilizes the adaptable power splitting factor. PLS is evaluated in terms of the probability of non-zero secrecy capacity and the intercept probability.},

While the prior works mostly focused on the design of error-control protocols for terrestrial-based FSO communications, using either hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) based stop-and-wait mechanism or pure sliding window ARQ, we instead propose a design of HARQ-based sliding window mechanism for the high data-rate and long-distance of FSO-based satellite systems. In particular, we model and analyze the performance of low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite-to-ground FSO systems over atmospheric turbulence channels when truncated incremental redundancy (IR) HARQ protocols, which combine the rate-compatible punctured convolutional (RCPC) codes and sliding window ARQ, are employed. For this purpose, the time-varying behavior of atmospheric turbulence channels is first captured by a finite-state Markov chain. Then, the channel model is used to develop the burst loss model to analytically derive the system performance metrics, including throughput, energy efficiency, and average frame delay. The results quantitatively demonstrate the impact of atmospheric turbulence and pointing error on the system performance and support the optimal selection of parameters. Additionally, the effectiveness of the proposed system is numerically confirmed. Monte Carlo simulations are also performed to validate the accuracy of theoretical derivations.},

  abstract     = {A plethora of new applications will be enabled by next generation wireless networks. These demand sophisticated medium access control and physical layer protocols in order to fulfill the requirements in terms of spectral efficiency, bit error rate (BER), energy efficiency, reliability, and security, among others. This paper develops an advanced space-time multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) solution that builds on the concept of space-time shift keying (STSK) for single-carrier frequency domain equalization (SC-FDE). STSK-aided SC-FDE, or SSF, ensures space-time and frequency diversity in dispersive channels, but can only support suboptimal linear receiver schemes. We therefore introduce a turbo equalizer for SSF in frequency-selective multipath channels. It enables inter-symbol-interference cancellation by means of iterative space-time processing. We coin it the iterative space-time block equalizer (SSF-ISTBE). We provide the mathematical formulation for the proposed SSF-ISTBE framework in non-linear channel conditions. We demonstrate that the SSF-ISTBE achieves a substantial 4 dB gain in terms of BER over the linear minimum mean square error equalizer while significantly reducing the computational complexity of the optimal maximum likelihood SSF. When considering practical transceivers, in particular non-linear power amplifiers, the gain of the SSF-ISTBE becomes more prominent over state-of-the-art approaches, demonstrating its robustness against non-linear distortion.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a deep neural network (DNN) aided codebook based beamforming scheme for frequency-division-duplex (FDD) millimeter-Wave (mmWave) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems under multipath. Different from the time-division-duplex (TDD) systems, for FDD systems the reciprocity between the down-link (DL) and up-link (UL) channel state information (CSI) does not hold in general, requiring an extra CSI feedback stage. Based on the previous theoretical analysis and measurements, however, partial reciprocities, including the spatial directional angles and number of propagation paths, do exist for FDD mmWave systems. Given such partial reciprocities, we propose a beamforming scheme based on a predefined codebook. Furthermore, we consider the channels with multipath where multiple codewords can be selected for some mobile stations (MSs) to utilize more than one propagation paths, which improves the link reliability. We then propose the corresponding beamforming strategy that not only identifies the number of paths, but also reconstructs the individual single-path channels which are easier to deal with at the beamforming stage. To select the optimal codewords for these single-path channels with lower complexity, we then present a DNN-aided approach that predicts the optimal codewords. The integration of DNN resolves not only the issue of power leakage, but also angular ambiguity in the codebook. Simulation results demonstrate that the performance of the proposed DNN-aided approach is very close to that of an exhaustive search.},

Although bit loading is generally a non-deterministic polynomial-time (NP)-hard problem, even for orthogonal multiple access (OMA), the mutual interference between the users, and the dependence of power coefficients and modulation orders are additional challenges that add substantial complexity to the optimization problem. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an efficient bit loading algorithm for multicarrier NOMA systems and compare the complexity and throughput with a corresponding OMA system. The obtained results show that for the case of NOMA, bit loading provides an additional degree of freedom that allows non-uniform spectrum sharing among the users. In particular scenarios, the system may experience hybrid modes of operation, where the system switches between NOMA and OMA. The obtained numerical results show that NOMA can outperform OMA by 100&amp;#x0025; in terms of spectral efficiency, for a two-user scenario. The complexity of the loading process for NOMA is noticeably higher than OMA, which is due to the high complexity associated with the bit error rate (BER) computation in the case of NOMA.},

The forthcoming proliferation of faster 5G networks utilizing mmWave has raised concerns on interference with automotive radar sensors, which has led to a body of research on Joint Radar-Communication (JRC). This paper considers the problem of time-sharing for JRC, with the additional simultaneous objective of minimizing the average age of information (AoI) transmitted by a JRC-equipped AV. We first formulate the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). We then propose a more general multi-agent system, with an appropriate medium access control (MAC) protocol, which is formulated as a partially observed Markov game (POMG). To solve the POMG, we propose a multi-agent extension of the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, along with algorithmic features to enhance learning from raw observations. Simulations are run with a range of environmental parameters to mimic variations in real-world operation. The results show that the chosen deep reinforcement learning methods allow the agents to obtain strong performance with minimal a priori knowledge about the environment.},

We obtain a sub-optimal solution by decoupling the original problem in two sub-problems: an iterative algorithm is considered for the user grouping, while, in addition, we utilize the Bat Algorithm (BA) for solving the power allocation problem, where BA was proved to be able to achieve a higher accuracy and efficiency with respect to other meta-heuristic algorithms. Furthermore, to validate the performance of the proposed system, analytical expressions for the energy outage probability and outage probability of users are derived, confirming the effectiveness of the simulation results. It is demonstrated that the proposed cooperative NOMA with WPT offers a considerable improvement in terms of SE and EE of the network compared to other methods. Finally, the effectiveness of BA in solving the EE optimization problem is demonstrated through a high convergence speed by comparing it with other methods.},

In this paper, the performance of downlink Terahertz (THz) communication systems with low-resolution digital-to-analog converters (DACs) at the Access Point (AP) and/or finite-bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) at the user sides are investigated. Array-of-subarrays architecture is assumed at the AP, where each RF chain uniquely activates a disjoint subset of antennas, each of which is connected to an exclusive phase shifter. Hybrid precodings including maximum ratio transmission (MRT) and zero-forcing (ZF) precoding are considered. The best beamsteering direction for the phase shifters in the large subarray antenna regime is first proved to be the direction of the line-of-sight (LOS) path. Subsequently, the closed-form expression of the lower-bound of the achievable rate in the large subarray antenna regime is derived, which is the same for both MRT and ZF and is independent of the transmit power. Moreover, numerical results show that the rate loss caused by the phase uncertainties can be negligible in large subarray antenna regime and moderate resolution DACs and ADCs can achieve performance close to the infinite-resolution one. Numerical results validating the analysis are provided as well. Overall, the impact of finite-bit precoding and finite-bit ADCs on the achievable rate of indoor THz communication systems is characterized.},

  abstract     = {The performance of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) assisted cooperative cognitive radio (CR) network is studied in this paper. The study is carried out for line-of-sight (LOS) links between UAV and a ground user and UAV aerodynamic power consumption of UAV. The UAV consists of an RF energy harvester and it is also a CR enabled device. It harvests energy from RF signal of source nodes. It rotates periodically over a circular region of interest (CROI) for finding the vacant primary user (PU) band. It uses a PU band to set a link between ground nodes, while the direct links between them suffer from severe fading. The decision about the status of a PU band is made cooperatively. In cooperative sensing, all the sources along with the UAV take sensing decisions and send them to fusion centre (FC). A two stage fusion scheme is proposed to take the overall decision. The considered network model uses non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scheme to forward the information of a source to its corresponding destination. Analytical expressions of harvested energy, overall sensing decision and throughput are developed. The analytical expressions capture the effect of fading as well as change in distances (source-UAV and UAV-destination) due to the circular flight of the UAV. Impact of imperfect successive interference cancellation (SIC) on the system performance is also studied. Power allocation in the second hop link is optimized to maximize the network throughput. Energy-efficiency of the considered network is evaluated. For a given UAV flight period, radius of the circular trajectory, and the velocity of the UAV is optimized to maximize the energy-efficiency. Sensing performance of the considered system model is studied in terms of false alarm. Network throughput is investigated for several network parameters such as fading parameter, the number of sources, the number of UAV&amp;#x0027;s sensing slots, the velocity of UAV, the radius of the UAV trajectory etc. Sensing angle and harvesting angle are optimized to maximize the throughput. Results show that the value of fading parameter, radius of UAV trajectory, and UAV velocity has significant impact on throughput. The performance of NOMA is compared with orthogonal multiple access (OMA).},

In this paper, we consider the joint sparsity of the angle domain and time delay domain to propose an improved SBL algorithm by using a new two-dimensional adaptive grid refinement method in the SBL framework. This algorithm solves the grid mismatch problem caused by the fixed grid in the traditional SBL method, and reduces the algorithm complexity of the off-grid SBL (OGSBL) algorithm. We also obtain the Cram&amp;#x00E9;r-Rao bound (CRB) of AOA, time delay and position estimation based on the mmWave multipath signals to analyze the estimation errors.

  abstract     = {At ultra-low altitudes, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) can act as a personal base station where it communicates only with one user. User equipment (UE) can be inside the pocket of a user or near their chest while facing or facing-away from the flying base station. In these scenarios, the wireless channel can go through different fading levels, depending on the UAV&amp;#x0027;s location, user orientation, the location of the UE near the user&amp;#x0027;s body, and the frequency of the transmitted signal. In this work, we provide measurement results and investigate how the human body affects the Air-to-Ground (AtG) channel characteristics under various use cases of holding a device. These channel characteristics include the average signal strength, shadowing, multipath, and the Rician K-factor. We target three different use cases of holding the device: Near-Chest Facing, In-pocket Facing, and Near-Chest Facing-away from the transmitting UAV. We perform this study at carrier frequencies of 900&amp;#x00A0;MHz and 2.5&amp;#x00A0;GHz and in Line-of-Sight conditions. First, we conduct a set of baseline experiments to understand ground-to-ground and AtG channels in free space. Second, we conduct AtG experiments with the user holding the device and show that the human body can induce either gains or losses compared to free space, depending on its relative orientation to the UAV. Third, we find that there are two distinct regions of operation, one in which the channel characteristics are mainly affected by the UAV and another that is dominated by the user&amp;#x0027;s body. Fourth, we address the time-varying nature of the K-factor and analyze the user&amp;#x0027;s body impact on its mean and standard deviation. We find that if a user changes their orientation to face away from the transmitting UAV, their body can cause extreme fluctuations in the K-factor value over time and reduce its mean value by an average and a maximum of 6.8 and 15&amp;#x00A0;dB, respectively. Finally, to demonstrate the impact of our findings on the design of deployment strategies of UAVs, we considered how the human body and the relative UAV hovering position can affect the physical layer security in a UAV-assisted network. We show that the secrecy rate for a UAV-based network can be heavily influenced by the human body orientation relative to the UAV hovering location, consequently resulting in a different optimal deployment strategy compared to existing schemes that employ free-space pathloss models that neglect such human-induced effects.},

  abstract     = {We present a non-convex, partially observable solution for underwater vehicle localization, referred to as the time difference of arrival target motion analysis (TD-TMA). TD-TMA is especially suitable for the practical case in which localization ambiguities arise due to a lack of receivers, the effective sound velocity is unknown, and cooperation between the nodes is not available. The method relies on periodic emissions from a target vehicle, which are detected by an observer to yield a series of time difference of arrival (TDoA) measurements. The measurements are arranged in the framework of target motion analysis to obtain a set of localization solutions for the target. Maneuvering of either the target or the observer removes ambiguities and yields a single solution. We formalize TD-TMA as a least squares optimization problem, and solve it in polynomial time. Numerical results show that TD-TMA provides accurate localization performance in terms of both the target&amp;#x0027;s kinematics and positioning, which are close to the posterior Cram&amp;#x00E9;r-Rao lower bound. Two sea experiments successfully demonstrate the effectiveness of the solution in real sea environments.},

  abstract     = {Path planning is a critical part for improving the driving safety and driver comfort of autonomous vehicles (AVs), especially in complex maneuvering conditions. In addition, different drivers have different preferences for AVs, thus, how to provide personalized trajectories for different drivers is a vital issue for AVs. The collision-free path planning problem in conditions with large road curvatures is investigated in this paper, with the consideration of environmental safety constraints, drivers’ comfort, vehicle actuator constraints, etc. Firstly, a Driver-Vehicle-Road (DVR) system is established based on the combination of the kinematic vehicle model and the two-point visual preview driver model, such that the driver&#39;s individual handling characteristics can be considered in the controller. The kinematic vehicle model is modified to have the similar understeering characteristics with those of the nonlinear full car models, and then the proposed DVR system can satisfy different groups of drivers and cars. Secondly, for environmental constraints, a new artificial potential field (APF) method is proposed, which can form a banana-shaped 3-D dangerous imaginary mountain and a lane boundary cliff suitable for arbitrary curvature roads to generate a collision-free evasive path. Finally, the Linear-Time-Varying (LTV) model predictive control (MPC) method is adopted to design the path planner. The CarSim-Simulink joint simulation illustrates that with the proposed planner, the host vehicle is capable of avoiding obstacles with a safer and more comfortable maneuver on large curvature roads. And the proposed path planner can provide individually safe trajectories for different drivers with good maneuverability.},

  abstract     = {Accurate and globally referenced global navigation satellite system (GNSS) based vehicular positioning can be achieved in outlier-free open areas. However, the performance of GNSS can be significantly degraded by outlier measurements, such as multipath effects and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) receptions arising from signal reflections of buildings. Inspired by the advantage of batch historical data in resisting outlier measurements, in this paper, we propose a graduated non-convexity factor graph optimization (FGO-GNC) to improve the GNSS positioning performance, where the impact of GNSS outliers is mitigated by estimating the optimal weightings of GNSS measurements. Different from the existing local solutions, the proposed FGO-GNC employs the non-convex Geman McClure (GM) function to globally estimate the weightings of GNSS measurements via a coarse-to-fine relaxation. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through several challenging datasets collected in urban canyons of Hong Kong using automobile level and low-cost smartphone level GNSS receivers.},

To tackle this problem, this paper proposes a novel model of learning interpretable representations for fatigue features, so as to improve the performance of the monitoring system on real roads through the learned features. First, the approximate entropy of the Steering Wheel Angle (SWA)sequence is used to crop adaptive lengths of the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) input data. Then, it will learn statistical indexes to discover the random steering characteristics. The Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) unit can memorize drivers&amp;#x2019; long-term operating characteristics and instantaneous change patterns, and mine their fatigue characteristics. Finally, the information gain method is used to discover the strong correlation between potential characteristics and fatigue levels, thereby obtaining the best feature representation for driver fatigue. The proposed method makes use of the advantages of recurrent neural network learning to explicitly capture various potential characteristics of fatigue driving and interactions between non-linear characteristics in driving. Experimental results on real driving data validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.},

To solve this problem, the correlations for an axial flux permanent magnet (PM) eddy current brake are derived using the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and the least square method. The proposed correlations considered the changes in design parameters and temperatures of the eddy current brake, and the accuracy is verified by the CFD. Subsequently, convective heat transfer coefficients calculated through the correlations are assigned to a thermal network model of the eddy current brake, and the thermal network model is verified by experimental tests. The results show that the thermal network model can accurately predict temperatures of the eddy current brake. Since the time required to calculate convective heat transfer coefficients through the correlations is significantly less than that required through CFD, and the variation of the geometrical parameters and temperatures can be considered, these correlations are very suitable for use in the optimization process.},

However, in challenging environments, such as sparsely textured parking lots, the state-of-the-art methods often fail to obtain sufficiently reliable features for robust localization and consistent mapping. This paper proposes a multi-level visual information hierarchical fusion SLAM framework based on a multi-camera system. High-level features like object edges are extracted by different segmentation methods. With the guidance of high-level information, low-level key points are selected. The hierarchical fusion structure consists of two parts. High-level visual information is loosely fused with the wheel encoder to estimate initial data association. Then, low-level feature points of multiple views are tightly fused to facilitate robust localization. With such a structure, a consistent map can be built even under the condition that one view is lost. In addition, the lost view can be reinitialized in the single map with other information instead of waiting for re-localization or creating additional maps. Real-time experiments in autonomous parking scenario validate the robustness and consistency of the proposed method.},

Therefore, in order to adjust the gear shift performance, it is necessary to perform Multi-Input-Multi-Output (MIMO) control. In MIMO control, the system output is the clutch slip speed and output shaft torque, and the system input is the engine torque and clutch torque. In the past, several trajectories of the engine torque and clutch torque have been generated heuristically to adjust the gear shift performance. Therefore, a MIMO control method that is capable of adjusting the gear shift performance conveniently with a few tuning parameters during gear shifting is needed. In this study, a gear shift controller for generating target driveline torque (engine and clutch torque) based on MIMO model predictive control that can adjust the gear shift performance with only one tuning parameter is proposed.

  abstract     = {A realistic steering feel is one of the key elements to guarantee fidelity on a driving simulator in general, and in particular to replicate on-centre vehicle handling. This requires precise modelling of the steering dynamics, a high bandwidth control loading system, and coupling of virtual and physical components in agreement with computational requirements and hardware limitations. For such a coupling, the common approach position-based control uses the measured signals of steering wheel angle and steering rate as inputs to the steering system model. This paper proposes an alternative torque-based control scheme using steering torque as an input to the steering system with additional compensation. Torque-based control was designed and evaluated in conjunction with detailed electric power steering models including state-of-the-art friction models, a neuromuscular driver model, and two driver-in-the-loop experiments in a high-end driving simulator. The objective analysis performed by means of the neuromuscular driver model reveals that the driver applies less impedance i.e. the driver is less stiff on a driving simulator when steering feedback is provided with the torque-based control compared to the position-based control. The investigations demonstrate that torque-based control reduces haptic response delay and vibrations caused by friction modelling compared to position-based control. The driver-in-the-loop experiments show significant objective effects on steering performance and subjective evaluation of fidelity and effort. We conclude that the proposed approach closes the vehicle-driver loop with more realism in a driving simulator.},

This paper proposes a method for estimating the SOE of the battery pack based on prediction, taking into account the future voltage and temperature changes of the battery pack. Firstly, a novel definition of the battery pack SOE is proposed, which considers the inconsistency of the battery pack. Secondly, the thermo-electric lumped parameter equivalent circuit model of a single cell in the battery pack is applied. The electrical parameters are identified using the forgetting factor recursive least-squares algorithm, and the extended Kalman filter is used to estimate the SOC of each cell. Finally, the future current, voltage and temperature response of the cell in the battery pack are accurately predicted and iterative calculations are performed to get SOE under the condition that the future output power of the battery pack is predicted by the Markov chain model method. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified under dynamic conditions at different temperatures. The results show that the above method has high precision and good robustness, and can meet the needs of actual vehicle applications.},

  abstract     = {Virtual Coupling (VC) is regarded as a breakthrough to the traditional train operation and control for improving the capability and flexibility in railways. It brings benefits as trains under VC are allowed to operate much closer to one another, forming a virtually coupled train set (VCTS). However, the safe and stable spacing between trains in the VCTS is a problem since there are no rigid couplers to connect them into a fixed formation, especially in high-speed scenarios. Due to the close spacing, the interference between trains becomes non-negligible as various maneuvers of the preceding train can significantly affect driving behaviors of the following train; this results in fluctuating spacing and therefore an unstable VCTS. Aiming at minimizing the interference and maintaining constantly safe spacing between trains in the VCTS, this paper presents a distributed model predictive control (DMPC) approach for solving the high-speed VCTS control problem. Particularly, the proposed control method focuses on the feasibility and stability of this problem, with considerations of the coupled constraint of safety braking distance and the individual constraints of speed limit variations and restricted traction/braking performance. To guarantee feasibility and stability, the terminal controller and invariant set of the DMPC are designed. For rigor, sufficient conditions of feasibility and stability are mathematically proved and derived. Based on the data of the Beijing-Shanghai high-speed railway line, numerical experiments are conducted to verify the correctness of derived sufficient conditions and the effectiveness of the proposed control method under interference and disturbances.},

More precisely, an event-triggering mechanism is devised to determine the time instants of updating control signals, which reduces the signal transmission burden, while saving on system resources. The Zeno phenomenon is excluded in the sense of guaranteeing that the time between two consecutive switchings is lower bounded by a positive constant. The actuator faults as well as the network induced errors are handled via the bound estimation approach and some well-defined smooth functions. By strict Lyapunov arguments, all closed-loop signals are proved to be semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB) and the synchronization tracking errors of speed and attitude converge to a residual set around origin whose size can be made arbitrarily small through selecting appropriate design parameters.},

  abstract     = {The traditional signalized intersection is no longer able to meet the increasing demands of transportation. A method combining autonomous intersection management (AIM) and connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) is suggested for solving existing traffic problems. This study proposes a control method for unsignalized intersections based on cooperative grouping, which discretizes the continuous traffic flow into a series of small-scale vehicle groups. In addition, a Petri Net model with a progressive structure is proposed, for which the time domain sequence of each group is strictly defined. To realize the global control of CAVs, the whole process of vehicle movement is decomposed into two processes: i ) adjustment on branches and ii ) coordination in the junction. All grouping conditions in the junction are clearly defined, and time windows are used for the discrete traffic flow modeling. Furthermore, a cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) model with bifurcations is proposed for grouping and following the control of vehicles on each branch. Simulation results show that vehicles are automatically grouped according to their initial positions, and no collision occurs during the whole process. Applied with the proposed method, the traffic capacity of a four-branch intersection exceeds 10000 veh/h under ideal conditions. The vehicles run more smoothly and show a better fuel economy than the other two methods.},

  abstract     = {The rapid growth in Autonomous Vehicle (AV) technology endeavors increased attention towards road safety in recent days. Particularly, a higher number of road accidents occurs when the AV tries to overtake or change the lane. To cut down the number of accidents and improve traffic reliability, the AV should be capable of making intelligent decisions and communicating those to other AVs. Therefore, in this paper, a Cooperative Collision avoidance scheme for AVs at Overtaking and Lane Changing maneuver (CCAV-OLC) is proposed. The Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) in the CCAV-OLC scheme, processes on the given number of expert demonstrations for automatically acquiring the reward function, and thereby imitating actual human driving strategy and decisions. However, the adaptability of IRL to a high-dimensional AV environment restricts the performance of the CCAV-OLC scheme. To overcome this, the IRL in CCAV-OLC leverages the Gaussian Process (GP) regression model (IRL-GP), which enables data-efficient Bayesian prediction even when the number of demonstrations is very low. After taking intelligent decisions in overtaking and lane changing maneuvers, the AVs cooperatively communicate and exchange the decisions with each other by 6th Generation Vehicle-to-Everything (6G-V2X) communications, which further improves the accuracy and lessens the time taken for making optimal decisions. The experimental results show that the AVs clone the expert&#39;s optimal driving strategy and avoid the collisions to a greater extent.},

  abstract     = {Active pedestrian collision avoidance (APCA) systems can significantly reduce road injuries and thus have attracted considerable attention from both the automobile and the transportation industries. Numerous studies have focused on APCA; however, it remains challenging to model variable and complex scenarios in a safe, efficient and low-cost way. For this purpose, this paper proposes a novel multipedestrian collision risk assessment framework comprising a motion prediction module, a collision checking module and a collision risk assessment module. First, the motion of the ego vehicle (EV) is predicted through a constant-acceleration (V-CA) model and a constant-turn-rate and constant-velocity (V-CTRV) model in different scenarios. Next, the pedestrian motion is estimated using Kalman filter (KF) approaches based on a constant-velocity (PCV) model and a constant-acceleration (P-CA) model. Then, the potential collision area (PCA) is defined according to the predicted motions of the EV and pedestrian, and the time-to collision (TTC) is selected to conduct collision checking. Finally, the most dangerous pedestrian is identified as the target with the minimum TTC in a multipedestrian scenario, and field tests are conducted on an autonomous vehicle platform. Comparative simulations indicate that the P-CA-based KF is more accurate and robust in variable-velocity scenarios than the P-CV-based KF. Furthermore, multipedestrian scenario simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.},

First, each vehicle is automatically detected using hierarchical clustering and then its trajectory is tracked using a virtual point method that compensates for the low angular resolution of the sensor. Then, characteristic low-dimensional features of each trajectory are extracted for the classification task, so that use of the entire time-varying trajectory can be avoided. The novel features extracted include selected locations&amp;#x002F;velocities, and zero-mean singular vectors that describe the shape of the trajectory around the mean vehicle location. These features are found to provide excellent separation between various inlet-outlet maneuvers. Both simulation and extensive experimental results are presented. A single sensor that covers 2 out of 4 roads at a traffic intersection is found to work with high accuracy but has occlusion errors due to the limited coverage of the sensor. A two-sensor system that covers all 4 roads at an intersection needs an additional algorithm to merge trajectories from the two sensors to avoid double counting. High counting and classification accuracies are achieved with the developed systems.},

The system includes an improved pure pursuit controller with adaptive look-ahead distance for forward path following; a cascade controller of reverse pure pursuit and a gain-scheduled LQ control for reverse path-following. In the evaluation of the path-following performance of forward and reverse controllers, the closed-loop system of path-following controllers with the truck-trailer kinematic model is simulated in MATLAB/Simulink for various test cases, and the results are compared with those of other studies. Furthermore, different docking scenarios are generated via the cascade path planning algorithm for autonomous semitrailer docking. These are tested with a high degree semi-trailer model within the IPG TruckMaker simulation environment, and with a full truck-trailer vehicle in the test field. The results of both simulations and physical testing clearly demonstrate improvements in terms of the control problem formulation, i.e., the stabilized path-following is obtained with acceptable path-following errors.},

Furthermore, datasets available for testing the proposed approaches have some limitations since they generally (a) include only a few types of events, (b) contain data collected with only one device, and (c) are generated in drives that did not fully consider the variety of road characteristics and/or driving conditions. The main objective of this work is to compare the performance of several state-of-the-art algorithms for aggressive driving event detection (belonging to anomaly detection-, threshold- and machine learning-based categories) on multiple datasets containing sensors data collected with different devices (black-boxes and smartphones), on different vehicles and in different locations.

  abstract     = {This paper presents a gain enhanced wide azimuth beam automotive antenna using half-mode substrate integrated waveguide (HMSIW) cavity for automotive applications. The antenna is separated into two HMSIW cavities by electrical via walls.

The antenna size is small enough to mount in the rear-view mirror, which has a long rectangular shape. For comparison, the proposed antenna and a conventional 1 × 2 microstrip square patch antenna array were fabricated to the same dimensions. Then, these antennas were tested to provide validation. The tested results were consistent with the simulation results.

  abstract     = {In this article, the completely distributed adaptive time-varying formation target tracking control problem for quadrotor team via image-based visual servoing is addressed. An adaptive cascade formation controller is proposed, which consists of a trajectory tracking controller, an attitude controller, and an image-based visual servoing controller. All the controllers consist of a nominal part to achieve the desired performance and a robust part to retrain the influence of parameter uncertainties and external disturbance. The robust properties of the closed-loop control system are proven via the theoretical analysis. Moreover, the simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed formation tracking control protocol in this paper.},

  abstract     = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are emerging as important users of next-generation cellular networks. By operating in the sky, UAV users experience very different radio conditions than terrestrial users, due to factors such as strong Line-of-Sight (LoS) channels (and interference) and Base Station (BS) antenna misalignment. As a consequence, the UAVs may experience significant degradation to their received quality of service, particularly when they are moving and are subject to frequent handovers. The solution is to allow the UAV to be aware of its surrounding environment, and intelligently connect into the cellular network taking advantage of this awareness. In this paper we present REgression and deep Q-learning for Intelligent UAV cellular user to Base station Association (REQIBA), a solution that allows a UAV flying over an urban area to intelligently connect to underlying BSs, using information about the received signal powers, the BS locations, and the surrounding building topology. We demonstrate how REQIBA can as much as double the total UAV throughput, when compared to heuristic association schemes similar to those commonly used by terrestrial users. We also evaluate how environmental factors such as UAV height, building density, and throughput loss due to handovers impact the performance of our solution.},
