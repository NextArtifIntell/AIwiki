  abstract     = {Differential privacy, which has been widely applied in industries, is a privacy mechanism effective in preventing malicious entities from breaching the privacy of an individual participant. It is usually achieved by adding random variables in the data. This article investigates a class of multivariable discrete-time multiagent systems with $\epsilon $ -differential privacy preserved. A novel information-masking mechanism is proposed, in which the information of each state transmitted to different neighbors is obscured by adding independent random noises. Then, the mean-square consensus conditions, and the upper bound and lower bound of the convergence rate are obtained. Moreover, the conditions for the convergence rate reaching its upper bound are established. The results can be applied to the average mean-square consensus. In addition, a necessary and sufficient condition is presented under which agents can preserve the dynamics of agents $\epsilon $ -differentially private at any time instant.},

  abstract     = {Accurate power time-series prediction is an important application for building new industrialized smart cities. The gated recurrent units (GRUs) models have been successfully employed to learn temporal information for power time-series prediction, demonstrating its effectiveness. However, from a statistical perspective, these existing models are geometrically ergodic with short-term memory that causes the learned temporal information to be quickly forgotten. Meanwhile, these existing approaches completely ignore the temporal dependencies between the gradient flow in the optimization algorithm, which greatly limits the prediction accuracy. To resolve these issues, we propose a novel GRU model coupling two new mechanisms of selective state updating and adaptive mixed gradient optimization (GRU-SSU-AMG) to improve the accuracy of prediction. Specifically, a tensor discriminator is used for adaptively determining whether hidden state information needs to be updated at each time step for learning the extremely fluctuating information in the proposed selective GRU (SGRU). In addition, an adaptive mixed gradient (AdaMG) optimization method that mixes the moment estimations is proposed to further improve the capability of learning the temporal dependencies information. The effectiveness of the GRU-SSU-AMG has been extensively evaluated on five different real-world datasets. The experimental results show that the GRU-SSU-AMG achieves significant accuracy improvement compared with the state-of-the-art approaches.},

  abstract     = {Recently, tensor sparsity modeling has achieved great success in the tensor completion (TC) problem. In real applications, the sparsity of a tensor can be rationally measured by low-rank tensor decomposition. However, existing methods either suffer from limited modeling power in estimating accurate rank or have difficulty in depicting hierarchical structure underlying such data ensembles. To address these issues, we propose a parametric tensor sparsity measure model, which encodes the sparsity for a general tensor by Laplacian scale mixture (LSM) modeling based on three-layer transform (TLT) for factor subspace prior with Tucker decomposition. Specifically, the sparsity of a tensor is first transformed into factor subspace, and then factor sparsity in the gradient domain is used to express the local similarity in within-mode. To further refine the sparsity, we adopt LSM by the transform learning scheme to self-adaptively depict deeper layer structured sparsity, in which the transformed sparse matrices in the sense of a statistical model can be modeled as the product of a Laplacian vector and a hidden positive scalar multiplier. We call the method as parametric tensor sparsity delivered by LSM-TLT. By a progressive transformation operator, we formulate the LSM-TLT model and use it to address the TC problem, and then the alternating direction method of multipliers-based optimization algorithm is designed to solve the problem. The experimental results on RGB images, hyperspectral images (HSIs), and videos demonstrate the proposed method outperforms state of the arts.},

To handle such a problem, a new continuous connectivity-preserving mechanism is presented to preserve the connectivity of the considered network.

  abstract     = {Recent advances in 3-D sensors and 3-D modeling have led to the availability of massive amounts of 3-D data. It is too onerous and time consuming to manually label a plentiful of 3-D objects in real applications. In this article, we address this issue by transferring the knowledge from the existing labeled data (e.g., the annotated 2-D images or 3-D objects) to the unlabeled 3-D objects. Specifically, we propose a domain-adversarial guided siamese network (DAGSN) for unsupervised cross-domain 3-D object retrieval (CD3DOR). It is mainly composed of three key modules: 1) siamese network-based visual feature learning; 2) mutual information (MI)-based feature enhancement; and 3) conditional domain classifier-based feature adaptation. First, we design a siamese network to encode both 3-D objects and 2-D images from two domains because of its balanced accuracy and efficiency. Besides, it can guarantee the same transformation applied to both domains, which is crucial for the positive domain shift. The core issue for the retrieval task is to improve the capability of feature abstraction, but the previous CD3DOR approaches merely focus on how to eliminate the domain shift. We solve this problem by maximizing the MI between the input 3-D object or 2-D image data and the high-level feature in the second module. To eliminate the domain shift, we design a conditional domain classifier, which can exploit multiplicative interactions between the features and predictive labels, to enforce the joint alignment in both feature level and category level. Consequently, the network can generate domain-invariant yet discriminative features for both domains, which is essential for CD3DOR. Extensive experiments on two protocols, including the cross-dataset 3-D object retrieval protocol (3-D to 3-D) on PSB/NTU, and the cross-modal 3-D object retrieval protocol (2-D to 3-D) on MI3DOR-2, demonstrate that the proposed DAGSN can significantly outperform state-of-the-art CD3DOR methods.},

Due to the complexity of human behaviors and changing social environments, the distributions of financial data are usually complex and it is challenging to find clusters and give reasonable interpretations. The goal of this study is to develop an integrated approach to detect clusters in financial data, and optimize the scope of the clusters such that the clusters can be easily interpreted. Specifically, we first proposed a new cluster quality evaluation criterion, which is free from large-scale computation and can guide base clustering algorithms such as ${k}$ -Means to detect hyperellipsoidal clusters adaptively. Then, we designed a new solver for a revised support vector data description model, which efficiently refines the centroids and scopes of the detected clusters to make the clusters tighter such that the data in the clusters share greater similarities, and thus, the clusters can be easily interpreted with eigenvectors. Using ten financial datasets, the experiments showed that the proposed algorithm can efficiently find reasonable number of clusters. The proposed approach is suitable for large-scale financial datasets whose features are meaningful, and also applicable to financial mining tasks, such as data distribution interpretation and anomaly detection.},

Learning normal patterns on normal data, deep AE is expected to yield larger reconstruction errors for anomalous samples, which is utilized as the criterion for detecting anomalies. However, this hypothesis cannot be always tenable since the deep AE usually captures the low-level shared features between normal and abnormal data, which leads to similar reconstruction errors for them. To tackle this problem, we propose a self-supervised representation-augmented deep AE for unsupervised VAD, which can enlarge the gap of anomaly scores between normal and abnormal samples by introducing autoencoding transformation (AT). Essentially, AT is introduced to facilitate AE to learn the high-level visual semantic features of normal images by introducing a self-supervision task (transformation reconstruction). In particular, our model inputs the original and transformed images into the encoder for obtaining latent representations; afterward, they are fed to the decoder for reconstructing both the original image and applied transformation. In this way, our model can utilize both image and transformation reconstruction errors to detect anomaly. Extensive experiments indicate that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, which demonstrates the validity and advancement of our model.},

  abstract     = {Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved remarkable performance in driver drowsiness detection based on the extraction of deep features of drivers’ faces. However, the performance of driver drowsiness detection methods decreases sharply when complications, such as illumination changes in the cab, occlusions and shadows on the driver’s face, and variations in the driver’s head pose, occur. In addition, current driver drowsiness detection methods are not capable of distinguishing between driver states, such as talking versus yawning or blinking versus closing eyes. Therefore, technical challenges remain in driver drowsiness detection. In this article, we propose a novel and robust two-stream spatial–temporal graph convolutional network (2s-STGCN) for driver drowsiness detection to solve the above-mentioned challenges. To take advantage of the spatial and temporal features of the input data, we use a facial landmark detection method to extract the driver’s facial landmarks from real-time videos and then obtain the driver drowsiness detection result by 2s-STGCN. Unlike existing methods, our proposed method uses videos rather than consecutive video frames as processing units. This is the first effort to exploit these processing units in the field of driver drowsiness detection. Moreover, the two-stream framework not only models both the spatial and temporal features but also models both the first-order and second-order information simultaneously, thereby notably improving driver drowsiness detection. Extensive experiments have been performed on the yawn detection dataset (YawDD) and the National TsingHua University drowsy driver detection (NTHU-DDD) dataset. The experimental results validate the feasibility of the proposed method. This method achieves an average accuracy of 93.4\% on the YawDD dataset and an average accuracy of 92.7\% on the evaluation set of the NTHU-DDD dataset.},

However, most existing short text stream clustering approaches usually work on static data and tend to cause a “term ambiguity” problem due to the sparse word representation. Beyond, they often exploit short text streams in a batch way and are difficult to find evolving topics in term-changing subspaces. In this article, we propose an online semantic-enhanced graphical model for evolving short text stream clustering (OSGM), by exploiting the word-occurrence semantic information and dynamically maintaining evolving active topics in term-changing subspaces in an online way. Compared to the existing approaches, our online model is not only free of determining the optimal batch size but also lends itself to handling large-scale data streams efficiently. It is also able to handle the “term ambiguity” problem without incorporating features from external resources. More importantly, to the best of our knowledge, it is the first work to extract evolving topics in term-changing subspaces automatically in an online way. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed model yields better performance compared to many state-of-the-art algorithms on both synthetic and real-world datasets.},

The existing ZSL methods are trained on a set of predefined classes and do not have the ability to learn from a stream of training data. However, in many real-world applications, training data are collected incrementally; this is one of the main reasons why ZSL methods cannot be applied to certain real-world situations. Accordingly, in order to handle practical learning tasks of this kind, we introduce a novel ZSL setting, referred to as incremental ZSL (IZSL), the goal of which is to accumulate historical knowledge and alleviate Catastrophic Forgetting to facilitate better recognition when incrementally trained on new classes. We further propose a novel method to realize IZSL, which employs a generative replay strategy to produce virtual samples of previously seen classes. The historical knowledge is then transferred from the former learning step to the current step through joint training on both real new and virtual old data. Subsequently, a knowledge distillation strategy is leveraged to distill the knowledge from the former model to the current model, which regularizes the training process of the current model. In addition, our method can be flexibly equipped with the most generative-ZSL methods to tackle IZSL. Extensive experiments on three challenging benchmarks indicate that the proposed method can effectively tackle the IZSL problem effectively, while the existing ZSL methods fail.},

  abstract     = {The simulation of biological dendrite computations is vital for the development of artificial intelligence (AI). This article presents a basic machine-learning (ML) algorithm, called Dendrite Net or DD, just like the support vector machine (SVM) or multilayer perceptron (MLP). DD’s main concept is that the algorithm can recognize this class after learning, if the output’s logical expression contains the corresponding class’s logical relationship among inputs (and $\backslash $ or $\backslash $ not). Experiments and main results: DD, a white-box ML algorithm, showed excellent system identification performance for the black-box system. Second, it was verified by nine real-world applications that DD brought better generalization capability relative to the MLP architecture that imitated neurons’ cell body (Cell body Net) for regression. Third, by MNIST and FASHION-MNIST datasets, it was verified that DD showed higher testing accuracy under greater training loss than the cell body net for classification. The number of modules can effectively adjust DD’s logical expression capacity, which avoids overfitting and makes it easy to get a model with outstanding generalization capability. Finally, repeated experiments in MATLAB and PyTorch (Python) demonstrated that DD was faster than Cell body Net both in epoch and forwardpropagation. The main contribution of this article is the basic ML algorithm (DD) with a white-box attribute, controllable precision for better generalization capability, and lower computational complexity. Not only can DD be used for generalized engineering, but DD has vast development potential as a module for deep learning. DD code is available at https://github.com/liugang1234567/Gang-neuron .},

  abstract     = {In this article, we consider an iterative adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) algorithm within the Hamiltonian-driven framework to solve the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equation for the infinite-horizon optimal control problem in continuous time for nonlinear systems. First, a novel function, “min-Hamiltonian,” is defined to capture the fundamental properties of the classical Hamiltonian. It is shown that both the HJB equation and the policy iteration (PI) algorithm can be formulated in terms of the min-Hamiltonian within the Hamiltonian-driven framework. Moreover, we develop an iterative ADP algorithm that takes into consideration the approximation errors during the policy evaluation step. We then derive a sufficient condition on the iterative value gradient to guarantee closed-loop stability of the equilibrium point as well as convergence to the optimal value. A model-free extension based on an off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) technique is also provided. Finally, numerical results illustrate the efficacy of the proposed framework.},

  abstract     = {Hand detection is a crucial technology for space human–robot interaction (SHRI), and the awareness of hand identities is particularly critical. However, most advanced works have three limitations: 1) the low detection accuracy of small-size objects; 2) insufficient temporal feature modeling between frames in videos; and 3) the inability of real-time detection. In the article, a temporal detector (called TA-RSSD) is proposed based on the SSD and spatiotemporal long short-term memory (ST-LSTM) for real-time detection in SHRI applications. Next, based on the online tubelet analysis, a real-time identity-awareness module is designed for multiple hand object identification. Several notable properties are described as follows: 1) the hybrid structure of the Resnet-101 and the SSD improves the detection accuracy of small objects; 2) three-level feature pyramidal structure retains rich semantic information without losing detailed information; 3) a group of the redesigned temporal attentional LSTM (TA-LSTM) is utilized for three-level feature map modeling, which effectively achieves background suppression and scale suppression; 4) low-level attention maps are used to eliminate in-class similarity between hand objects, which improves the accuracy of identity awareness; and 5) a novel association training scheme enhances the temporal coherence between frames. The proposed model is evaluated on the SHRI-VID dataset (collected according to the task requirements), the AU-AIR dataset, and the ImageNet-VID benchmark. Extensive ablation studies and comparisons on detection and identity-awareness capacities show the superiority of the proposed model. Finally, a set of actual testing is conducted on a space robot, and the results show that the proposed model achieves a real-time speed and high accuracy.},

By utilizing the Chang transformation, a distributed synchronization protocol is proposed with event-triggered communication. Static and dynamic event-triggered mechanisms are proposed successively, which both contain two separated event-triggering conditions corresponding to the slow and the fast subsystems. The existence of a strictly positive time period between any two successive transmissions is ensured regardless of the initial states. The main difficulty of this study lies in that the state jump and parametric uncertainty appear because of the system transformation. To overcome the difficulty, the system is first modeled as an uncertain hybrid system. Then, the control gain is properly designed by solving Riccati-like equations dependent on the rough bounds of the eigenvalues of communication graph Laplacians, and a piecewise quadratic Lyapunov function is proposed with which the jump caused by the switching topology is subtly evaluated. Sufficient conditions are thus established to achieve the event-triggered synchronization. Furthermore, the results are also extended to solve the synchronization problem of the interconnected impulsive linear TTSSs. Finally, three numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {Although state estimation using a bad data detector (BDD) is a key procedure employed in power systems, the detector is vulnerable to false data injection attacks (FDIAs). Substantial deep learning methods have been proposed to detect such attacks. However, deep neural networks are susceptible to adversarial attacks or adversarial examples, where slight changes in inputs may lead to sharp changes in the corresponding outputs in even well-trained networks. This article introduces the joint adversarial example and FDIAs (AFDIAs) to explore various attack scenarios for state estimation in power systems. Considering that perturbations added directly to measurements are likely to be detected by BDDs, our proposed method of adding perturbations to state variables can guarantee that the attack is stealthy to BDDs. Then, malicious data that are stealthy to both BDDs and deep learning-based detectors can be generated. Theoretical and experimental results show that our proposed state-perturbation-based AFDIA method (S-AFDIA) can carry out attacks stealthy to both conventional BDDs and deep learning-based detectors, while our proposed measurement-perturbation-based adversarial FDIA method (M-AFDIA) succeeds if only deep learning-based detectors are used. The comparative experiments show that our proposed methods provide better performance than state-of-the-art methods. Besides, the ultimate effect of attacks can also be optimized using the proposed joint attack methods.},

In view of the shortcomings, this article presents an SBL algorithm based on collaborative neurodynamic optimization (CNO) for searching global optimal solutions to the global optimization problem. The CNO system consists of a population of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) where each RNN is convergent to a local optimum to the global optimization problem. Reinitialized repetitively via particle swarm optimization with exchanged local optima information, the RNNs iteratively improve their searching performance until reaching global convergence. The proposed CNO-based SBL algorithm is almost surely convergent to a global optimal solution to the formulated global optimization problem. Two applications with experimental results on sparse signal reconstruction and partial differential equation identification are elaborated to substantiate the superiority and efficacy of the proposed method in terms of solution optimality and consistency.},

  abstract     = {It is known that many-objective optimization problems (MaOPs) often face the difficulty of maintaining good diversity and convergence in the search process due to the high-dimensional objective space. To address this issue, this article proposes a novel multiobjective framework for many-objective optimization (Mo4Ma), which transforms the many-objective space into multiobjective space. First, the many objectives are transformed into two indicative objectives of convergence and diversity. Second, a clustering-based sequential selection strategy is put forward in the transformed multiobjective space to guide the evolutionary search process. Specifically, the selection is circularly performed on the clustered subpopulations to maintain population diversity. In each round of selection, solutions with good performance in the transformed multiobjective space will be chosen to improve the overall convergence. The Mo4Ma is a generic framework that any type of evolutionary computation algorithm can incorporate compatibly. In this article, the differential evolution (DE) is adopted as the optimizer in the Mo4Ma framework, thus resulting in an Mo4Ma-DE algorithm. Experimental results show that the Mo4Ma-DE algorithm can obtain well-converged and widely distributed Pareto solutions along with the many-objective Pareto sets of the original MaOPs. Compared with seven state-of-the-art MaOP algorithms, the proposed Mo4Ma-DE algorithm shows strong competitiveness and general better performance.},

To this end, we complete the incomplete graph with missing data referring to tensor complete and present a novel and effective model to handel the incomplete multiview clustering task. To be specific, we consider the similarity of the interview graphs via the tensor Schatten $p$ -norm-based completion technique to make use of both the complementary information and spatial structure. Meanwhile, we employ the connectivity constraint for similarity matrices of different views such that the connected components approximately represent clusters. Thus, the learned entire graph not only has the low-rank structure but also well characterizes the relationship between unmissing data.

In general, the FD observer cannot work synchronously with the system, that is, the mode of the observer varies with the mode of the system in line with some conditional transitional probabilities. For dealing with this difficult point, a hidden Markov model (HMM) is employed. Then, combining the $H_{\infty }$ attenuation index and $H_{\_{}}$ increscent index, a multiobjective solution to the FD problem is formed. In terms of linear matrix inequality technology, sufficient conditions are gained to guarantee the existence of the asynchronous FD. Simultaneously, an asynchronous FD algorithm is generated to acquire the optimal performance indices.

  abstract     = {In this article, the asynchronous fault detection (FD) strategy is investigated in frequency domain for nonlinear Markov jump systems under fading channels. In order to estimate the system dynamics and meet the fact that not all the running modes can be observed exactly, a set of asynchronous FD filters is proposed. By using statistical methods and the Lynapunov stability theory, the augmented system is shown to be stochastic stable with a prescribed $l_{2}$ gain even under fading transmissions. Then, a novel lemma is developed to capture the finite frequency performance. Some solvable conditions with less conservatism are subsequently deduced by exploiting novel decoupling techniques and additional slack variables. Besides, the FD filter gains could be calculated with the aid of the derived conditions. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is shown by an illustrative example.},

Based on the multilayer graph, a formation control law by using the potential function approach is developed for autonomous formation, formation maintenance, collision, and obstacle avoidance. When the desired formation is achieved, the barycentric of the formation shape is viewed as a virtual leader, and a model predictive control (MPC) scheme is applied to the virtual leader for tracking a reference trajectory; meanwhile, the agents will maintain the desired angles and distances via the formation control law. By applying the proposed schemes, the tasks of formation maintenance and trajectory tracking in a constrained space are fulfilled. Comprehensive simulation studies under different environmental constraints and trajectories confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approaches in addressing the formation and trajectory tracking problems.},

  abstract     = {Existing deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based methods for solving the capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP) intrinsically cope with a homogeneous vehicle fleet, in which the fleet is assumed as repetitions of a single vehicle. Hence, their key to construct a solution solely lies in the selection of the next node (customer) to visit excluding the selection of vehicle. However, vehicles in real-world scenarios are likely to be heterogeneous with different characteristics that affect their capacity (or travel speed), rendering existing DRL methods less effective. In this article, we tackle heterogeneous CVRP (HCVRP), where vehicles are mainly characterized by different capacities. We consider both min–max and min–sum objectives for HCVRP, which aim to minimize the longest or total travel time of the vehicle(s) in the fleet. To solve those problems, we propose a DRL method based on the attention mechanism with a vehicle selection decoder accounting for the heterogeneous fleet constraint and a node selection decoder accounting for the route construction, which learns to construct a solution by automatically selecting both a vehicle and a node for this vehicle at each step. Experimental results based on randomly generated instances show that, with desirable generalization to various problem sizes, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art DRL method and most of the conventional heuristics, and also delivers competitive performance against the state-of-the-art heuristic method, that is, slack induction by string removal. In addition, the results of extended experiments demonstrate that our method is also able to solve CVRPLib instances with satisfactory performance.},

  abstract     = {This article studies the distributed dimensionality reduction fusion estimation problem with communication delays for a class of cyber-physical systems (CPSs). The raw measurements are preprocessed in each sink node to obtain the local optimal estimate (LOE) of a CPS, and the compressed LOE under dimensionality reduction encounters with communication delays during the transmission. Under this case, a mathematical model with compensation strategy is proposed to characterize the dimensionality reduction and communication delays. This model also has the property of reducing the information loss caused by the dimensionality reduction and delays. Based on this model, a recursive distributed Kalman fusion estimator (DKFE) is derived by optimal weighted fusion criterion in the linear minimum variance sense. A stability condition for the DKFE, which can be easily verified by the exiting software, is derived. In addition, this condition can guarantee that the estimation error covariance matrix of the DKFE converges to the unique steady-state matrix for any initial values and, thus, the steady-state DKFE (SDKFE) is given. Note that the computational complexity of the SDKFE is much lower than that of the DKFE. Moreover, a probability selection criterion for determining the dimensionality reduction strategy is also presented to guarantee the stability of the DKFE. Two illustrative examples are given to show the advantage and effectiveness of the proposed methods.},

However, it is difficult to directly adopt the traditional 3-D convolution kernel to extract features from raw 3-D point clouds because of the unstructured property of point clouds. In this article, a spherical interpolated convolution operator is proposed to replace the traditional grid-shaped 3-D convolution operator. In addition, this article analyzes the defect of point cloud interpolation methods based on the distance as the interpolation weight and proposes the self-learned distance–feature density by combining the distance and the feature correlation. The proposed method makes the feature extraction of the spherical interpolated convolution network more rational and effective. The effectiveness of the proposed network is demonstrated on the 3-D semantic segmentation task of point clouds. Experiments show that the proposed method achieves good performance on the ScanNet dataset and Paris-Lille-3D dataset. The comparison experiments with the traditional grid-shaped 3-D convolution operator demonstrated that the newly proposed feature extraction operator improves the accuracy of the network and reduces the parameters of the network.

  abstract     = {The multipoint dynamic aggregation (MPDA) problem of the multirobot system is of great significance for its real-world applications such as bush fire elimination. The problem is to design the optimal plan for a set of heterogeneous robots to complete some geographically distributed tasks collaboratively. In this article, we consider the dynamic version of the problem, where new tasks keep appearing after the robots are dispatched from the depot. The dynamic MPDA problem is a complicated optimization problem due to several characteristics, such as the collaboration of robots, the accumulative task demand, the relationships among robots and tasks, and the unpredictable task arrivals. In this article, a new model of the problem considering these characteristics is proposed. To solve the problem, we develop a new genetic programming hyperheuristic (GPHH) method to evolve reactive coordination strategies (RCSs), which can guide the robots to make decisions in real time. The proposed GPHH method contains a newly designed effective RCS heuristic template to generate the execution plan for the robots according to a GP tree. A new terminal set of features related to both robots and tasks and a cluster filter that assigns the robots to urgent tasks are designed. The experimental results show that the proposed GPHH significantly outperformed the state-of-the-art methods. Through further analysis, useful insights such as how to distribute and coordinate robots to execute different types of tasks are discovered.},

We initially present a greedy capturing strategy for an obstacle-free environment based on the Buffered Voronoi Cell (BVC). For an environment with obstacles, the obstacle-aware BVC (OABVC) is defined as the safe region, which considers the physical radius of each robot, and dynamically weights the Voronoi boundary between robot and obstacle to make it tangent to the obstacle. Each robot continually computes its safe cells and plans its control actions in a recursion fashion.

In a recent work, the concept of mixture correntropy (MC) was proposed to improve the learning performance, where the kernel function is a mixture Gaussian kernel, namely, a linear combination of several zero-mean Gaussian kernels with different widths. In both correntropy and MC, the center of the kernel function is, however, always located at zero. In the present work, to further improve the learning performance, we propose the concept of multikernel correntropy (MKC), in which each component of the mixture Gaussian kernel can be centered at a different location. The properties of the MKC are investigated and an efficient approach is proposed to determine the free parameters in MKC. Experimental results show that the learning algorithms under the maximum MKC criterion (MMKCC) can outperform those under the original maximum correntropy criterion (MCC) and the maximum MC criterion (MMCC).},

Each node is associated with a subproblem with the help of its weight vector. Consequently, a subproblem tree can be established. It is easy to find that the descendant subproblems are refinements of their ancestor subproblems. The proposed algorithm approaches the Pareto front (PF) by solving a few subproblems in the first few levels to obtain a rough PF and gradually refining the PF by involving the subproblems level-by-level. This strategy is highly favorable for solving problems in which the solutions are initially far from the Pareto set. Moreover, the proposed algorithm has lower time complexity. Theoretical analysis shows the complexity of dealing with a new candidate solution is $\mathcal {O}(M \log N)$ , where $M$ is the number of objectives.

  abstract     = {Traffic prediction based on massive speed data collected from traffic sensors plays an important role in traffic management. However, it is still challenging to obtain satisfactory performance due to the complex and dynamic spatial-temporal correlations among the data. Recently, many research works have demonstrated the effectiveness of graph neural networks (GNNs) for spatial–temporal modeling. However, such models are restricted by conditional distribution during training, and may not perform well when the target is outside the primary region of interest in the distribution. In this article, we address this problem with a stagewise learning mechanism, in which we redefine speed prediction as a conditional distribution learning followed by speed regression. We first perform a conditional distribution learning for each observed speed class, and then obtain speed prediction by optimizing regression learning, based on the learned conditional distribution. To effectively learn the conditional distribution, we introduce a mean–residue loss, consisting of two parts: 1) a mean loss, which penalizes the differences between the mean of the estimated conditional distribution and the ground truth and 2) a residue loss, which penalizes residue errors of the long tails in the distribution. To optimize the subsequent regression based on distribution information, we combine the mean absolute error (MAE) as another part of the loss function. We also incorporate a GNN-based architecture with our proposed learning mechanism. Mean–residue loss is employed to supervise the hidden speed representation in the network at each time interval, followed by a shared layer to recalibrate the hidden temporal dependencies in the conditional distribution. The experimental results based on three public traffic datasets have demonstrated that the effectiveness of the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Multivariate time-series (MTS) clustering is a fundamental technique in data mining with a wide range of real-world applications. To date, though some approaches have been developed, they suffer from various drawbacks, such as high computational cost or loss of information. Most existing approaches are single-view methods without considering the benefits of mutual-support multiple views. Moreover, due to its data structure, MTS data cannot be handled well by most multiview clustering methods. Toward this end, we propose a consistent and specific non-negative matrix factorization-based multiview clustering (CSMVC) method for MTS clustering. The proposed method constructs a multilayer graph to represent the original MTS data and generates multiple views with a subspace technique. The obtained multiview data are processed through a novel non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) method, which can explore the view-consistent and view-specific information simultaneously. Furthermore, an alternating optimization scheme is proposed to solve the corresponding optimization problem. We conduct extensive experiments on 13 benchmark datasets and the results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method against other state-of-the-art algorithms under a wide range of evaluation metrics.},

  abstract     = {Understanding the fine-grained temporal structure of human actions and its semantic interpretation is beneficial to many real-world tasks, such as sports movements, rehabilitation exercises, and daily-life activities analysis. Current action segmentation methods mainly rely on deep neural networks to derive feature embedding of actions from motion data, while works on analyzing human actions in fine-granularity are still lacking due to the lack of clear and generic definitions of subactions and related datasets. On the other hand, the motion representations obtained in current action segmentation methods lack semantic or mathematical interpretability that can be used to evaluate action/subaction similarity in quantitative motion analysis. Toward the goal of fine-grained, interpretable, scalable, and efficient action segmentation, we propose a novel unsupervised action segmentation and distributed representation framework based on intuitive motion primitives defined on pose data. Metrics for comprehensive evaluation of the unsupervised fine-grained action segmentation task performance are proposed, and both public and self-constructed datasets are adopted in the experiments. The results show that the proposed method has good performance and generality across different subjects, datasets, and application scenarios.},

However, especially when considerable pixels of an image are missing, the low-rankness is not reliable on the pixel level, resulting in some details losing in their results, which hinders the performance of subsequent image applications (e.g., image recognition and segmentation). In this article, we suggest a novel multiscale feature (MSF) tensorization by exploiting the MSFs of multidimensional images, which not only helps to recover the missing values on a higher level, that is, the feature level but also benefits subsequent image applications. By exploiting the low-rankness of the resulting MSF tensor constructed by the new tensorization, we propose the convex and nonconvex MSF tensor train rank minimization (MSF-TT) to conjointly recover the MSF tensor and the corresponding original tensor in a unified framework. We develop the alternating directional method of multipliers (ADMMs) to solve the convex MSF-TT and the proximal alternating minimization (PAM) to solve the nonconvex MSF-TT. Moreover, we establish the theoretical guarantee of convergence for the PAM algorithm. Numerical examples of real-world multidimensional images show that the proposed MSF-TT outperforms other compared approaches in image recovery and the recovered MSF tensor can benefit the subsequent image recognition.},

  abstract     = {The distributed observer problem is motivated by the case where the output information of the system is decentralized in different subsystems. In this scene, all the subsystems form an observer network, and each of them has access to only a part of output information and the information exchanged via the given communication networks. Due to the limitation of communication conditions among subsystems, the communication network is often time varying and disconnected. However, the existing research about the aforementioned scene is still not enough to solve this problem. To this end, this article is concerned with the challenge of the distributed observer design for linear systems under time-variant disconnected communication networks. The design method is successfully established by fixing both completely decentralized output information and incompletely decentralized output information into account. Our work overcomes the limitation of the existing results that the distributed observer can only reconstruct the full states of the underlying systems by means of fast switching. In the case of completely decentralized output information, a group of sufficient conditions is put forward for the system matrix, and it is proved that the asymptotical omniscience of the distributed observer could be achieved as long as anyone of the developed conditions is satisfied. Furthermore, unlike similar problems in multiagent systems, the systems that can meet the proposed conditions are not only stable and marginally stable systems but also some unstable systems. As for the case where the output information is not completely decentralized, the results show with the observable decomposition and states reorganization technology that the distributed observer could achieve omniscience asymptotically without any constraints on the system matrix. The validity of the proposed design method is emphasized in two numerical simulations.},

The target formation is defined by both leaders’ motions and bearing constraints among neighboring agents, which enables the formation not only to form and preserve a geometric pattern but also to have the ability to achieve both translational and scaling formation maneuver. To satisfy the bearing constraints, a matrix-weighted estimator/controller is developed. The finite-time stabilization of the target formation is achieved, though the matrix-weighted design makes the stability analysis complicated.

System observability is the key factor to characterize the internal relationship of them. In most existing works, the observability is regarded as the assumption for subsequent sensing and control. But, in fact, with the gradually expanded network scale, this assumption is more difficult to directly satisfy sensing design. For this problem, we propose the observability guaranteed method (OGM) for edge sensing and control co-design. Specifically, the nonconvex observability condition is transformed into the convex range of key parameters of the sensing strategy based on the graph signal processing (GSP) technology. Then, we establish the relationship between these parameters and control performance. In OGM, except the previous design from sensing to control, we reversely adjust the sensing design for control demands to satisfy observability. Finally, our algorithm is applied into the hot rolling laminar cooling process based on the semiphysical evaluation. The effectiveness is verified by the results.},

In order to address this issue, transfer learning has been proposed and widely used in traditional ANNs, but it has limited use in SNNs. In this article, we propose an effective transfer learning framework for deep SNNs based on the domain in-variance representation. Specifically, we analyze the rationality of centered kernel alignment (CKA) as a domain distance measurement relative to maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) in deep SNNs. In addition, we study the feature transferability across different layers by testing on the Office-31, Office-Caltech-10, and PACS datasets.

In the proposed method, the swarm is first divided into multiple independent subpopulations organized in a hierarchical promotion structure, which protects subpopulation at each hierarchy to search for the optima in parallel. A unidirectional communication strategy and a promotion operator are further implemented to allow excellent particles to be promoted from low-hierarchy subpopulations to high-hierarchy subpopulations. Furthermore, for the internal competition within each subpopulation of the hierarchical promotion structure, a hierarchical multiscale optimum controlled by a tiered architecture of particles is constructed for particles, in which each particle can synthesize a set of optima of its different scales. The hierarchical promotion structure can protect particles that just fly to promising regions and have low fitness from competing with the entire swarm. Also, the double hierarchical structures increase the diversity of searching. Numerical experiments and statistical analysis of results reported on 30 benchmark problems show that the proposed method improves the accuracy and convergence speed especially in solving complex problems when compared with several variations of particle swarm optimization.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning has shown significant successes in person reidentification (re-id) tasks. However, most existing works focus on discriminative feature learning and impose complex neural networks, suffering from low inference efficiency. In fact, feature extraction time is also crucial for real-world applications and lightweight models are needed. Prevailing pruning methods usually pay attention to compact classification models. However, these methods are suboptimal for compacting re-id models, which usually produce continuous features and are sensitive to network pruning. The key point of pruning re-id models is how to retain the original filter distribution in continuous features as much as possible. In this work, we propose a blockwise adjacent filter decaying method to fill this gap. Specifically, given a trained model, we first evaluate the redundancy of filters based on the adjacency relationships to preserve the original filter distribution. Second, previous layerwise pruning methods ignore that discriminative information is enhanced block-by-block. Therefore, we propose a blockwise filter pruning strategy to better utilize the block relations in the pretrained model. Third, we propose a novel filter decaying policy to progressively reduce the scale of redundant filters. Different from conventional soft filter pruning that directly sets the filter values as zeros, the proposed filter decaying can keep the pretrained knowledge as much as possible. We evaluate our method on three popular person reidentification datasets, that is: 1) Market-1501; 2) DukeMTMC-reID; and 3) MSMT17_V1. The proposed method shows superior performance to the existing state-of-the-art pruning methods. After pruning over 91.9\% parameters on DukeMTMC-reID, the Rank-1 accuracy only drops 3.7\%, demonstrating its effectiveness for compacting person reidentification.},

  abstract     = {Brain–computer interfaces (BCIs) have been widely employed to identify and estimate a user’s intention to trigger a robotic device by decoding motor imagery (MI) from an electroencephalogram (EEG). However, developing a BCI system driven by MI related to natural hand-grasp tasks is challenging due to its high complexity. Although numerous BCI studies have successfully decoded large body parts, such as the movement intention of both hands, arms, or legs, research on MI decoding of high-level behaviors such as hand grasping is essential to further expand the versatility of MI-based BCIs. In this study, we propose NeuroGrasp, a dual-stage deep learning framework that decodes multiple hand grasping from EEG signals under the MI paradigm. The proposed method effectively uses an EEG and electromyography (EMG)-based learning, such that EEG-based inference at test phase becomes possible. The EMG guidance during model training allows BCIs to predict hand grasp types from EEG signals accurately. Consequently, NeuroGrasp improved classification performance offline, and demonstrated a stable classification performance online. Across 12 subjects, we obtained an average offline classification accuracy of 0.68 (±0.09) in four-grasp-type classifications and 0.86 (±0.04) in two-grasp category classifications. In addition, we obtained an average online classification accuracy of 0.65 (±0.09) and 0.79 (±0.09) across six high-performance subjects. Because the proposed method has demonstrated a stable classification performance when evaluated either online or offline, in the future, we expect that the proposed method could contribute to different BCI applications, including robotic hands or neuroprosthetics for handling everyday objects.},

  abstract     = {This article is concerned with the stability of the closed-loop system using various control policies generated by value iteration. Some stability properties involving admissibility criteria, the attraction domain, and so forth, are investigated. An offline integrated value iteration (VI) scheme with a stability guarantee is developed by combining the advantages of VI and policy iteration, which is convenient to obtain admissible control policies. Also, based on the concept of attraction domain, an online adaptive dynamic programming algorithm using immature control policies is developed. Remarkably, it is ensured that the state trajectory under the online algorithm converges to the origin. Particularly, for linear systems, the online ADP algorithm with a general scheme possesses more enhanced stability property. The theoretical results reveal that the stability of the linear system can be guaranteed even if the control policy sequence includes finite unstable elements. The numerical results verify the effectiveness of the present algorithms.},

This range of applications raises a great number of theoretical and practical challenges arising mainly from the unknown human–robot interaction model as well as from the difficulty of accurately model the robot dynamics. In this article, an adaptive impedance controller for human–robot co-transportation is put forward in task space. Vision and force sensing are employed to obtain the human hand position, and to measure the interaction force between the human and the robot. Using the latest developments in nonlinear control theory, we propose a robot end-effector controller to track the motion of the human partner under actuators’ input constraints, unknown initial conditions, and unknown robot dynamics. The proposed adaptive impedance control algorithm offers a safe interaction between the human and the robot and achieves a smooth control behavior along the different phases of the co-transportation task. Simulations and experiments are conducted to illustrate the performance of the proposed techniques in a co-transportation task.},

However, there is no universally accepted computational model in the literature for reproducing the motion of the human upper limb. In response to the problem, this article presents a computational framework for generating reaching movement endowed with human motion characteristics that imitated the mechanism in the control and realization of human upper limb motions. This article first establishes the experimental paradigm of human upper limb functional movements and proposes the characterization of human upper limb movement characteristics and feature movement clustering methods in the joint space. Then, according to the specific task requirements of the upper limb, combined with the human sensorimotor model, the estimation method of the human upper limb natural postures was established. Next, a continuous task parametric model matching the characteristic motion class is established by using the Gaussian mixture regression method. The anthropomorphic motion generation method with the characteristics of the smooth trajectory and the ability of natural obstacle avoidance is proposed. Finally, the anthropomorphic motion generation method proposed in this article is verified by a human-like robot. The measurement index of the human-likeness degree of the trajectory is given. The experimental results show that for all four tested tasks, the human-likeness degrees were greater than 90.8\%, and the trajectories’ jerk generated by this method is very similar to the trajectories’ jerk of humans, which validates the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Abstract-domain adaptation action recognition is a hot research topic in machine learning and some effective approaches have been proposed. However, samples in the target domain with label information are often required by these approaches. Moreover, domain-invariant discriminative feature learning, feature fusion, and classifier module learning have not been explored in an end-to-end framework. Thus, in this study, we propose a novel end-to-end multiple-view adversarial learning network (MAN) for unsupervised domain adaptation action recognition in which the fusion of RGB and optical-flow features, domain-invariant discrimination feature learning, and action recognition is conducted in a unified framework. Specifically, a robust spatiotemporal feature extraction network, including a spatial transform network and an adaptive intrachannel weight network, is proposed to improve the scale invariance and robustness of the method. Then, a self-attention mechanism fusion module is designed to adaptively fuse the RGB and optical-flow features. Moreover, a multiview adversarial learning loss is developed to obtain domain-invariant discriminative features. In addition, three benchmark datasets are constructed for unsupervised domain adaptation action recognition, for which all actions and samples are carefully collected from public action datasets, and their action categories are hierarchically augmented, which can guide how to extend existing action datasets. We conduct extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that our proposed MAN can outperform several state-of-the-art unsupervised domain adaptation action recognition approaches. When the SDAI Action II-6 and SDAI Action II-11 datasets are used, MAN can achieve 3.7\% ( $H \to U$ ) and 6.1\% ( $H \to U$ ) improvements over the temporal attentive adversarial adaptation network (published in ICCV 2019) module, respectively. As an added contribution, the SDAI Action II-6, SDAI Action II-11, and SDAI Action II-16 datasets will be released to facilitate future research on domain adaptation action recognition.},

  abstract     = {Public concerns on image encryption grow significantly as the development and application of edge computing and the Internet of Things intensified recently. However, most existing image cryptosystems are not sophisticated enough to resist the two major attack strategies available currently, that is: 1) differential attacks and 2) chosen-plaintext attacks, which are famous for their destructive power, especially their capability of exploiting cryptosystems’ features to recover the secret key. In this article, we propose an artificial image, computational experiment, and parallel execution (ACP)-based color image encryption approach using redundant blocks. First, a redundant blocks strategy with redundant spaces is proposed to prevent differential attacks and accelerate operating speed while guaranteeing the security of image cryptosystems. Second, real-world chaotic data (e.g., stock data) are obtained to generate artificial images and conduct computational experiments. Furthermore, artificial images are encrypted via real-world chaos, while the original images are encrypted via simulated chaos (such as Chen’s hyperchaos). Finally, we design the process of parallel execution for image encryption and use DNA XOR to merge two groups of encrypted subimages to fuse the effect of the chaotic characteristics in both the real world and the simulation. The final encrypted image is realized through the recovery of redundant blocks. The ACP mechanism of color image encryption achieves the goal of improving the sophistication of chaos-based cryptosystems and resists both the differential and chosen-plaintext attacks. Experimental results and security analysis show that our approach provides not only excellent encryption but also security sufficient to prevent known attacks.},

In this article, a conditional joint distribution (CJD)-based test selection method is proposed to construct an accurate TSP model. In addition, we propose a deep copula function which can describe the dependency among the tests. Afterward, an improved discrete binary particle swarm optimization (IBPSO) algorithm is proposed to deal with TSP.

Specifically, in the model, we apply the multihead attention (MHA) to capture the structural patterns, and design a dynamic embedding to handle the dynamic patterns of the problem. Once the model is trained, it can generalize to various types of CSP tasks (different sizes and topologies) without the need of retraining. Through controlled experiments, the proposed approach shows desirable time complexity: it runs more than 20 times faster than the traditional heuristic solvers with a tiny gap of optimality. Moreover, it significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art deep learning approaches for combinatorial optimization in the aspect of both training and inference. In comparison with traditional solvers, this approach is highly desirable for most of the challenging tasks in practice that are usually large scale and require quick decisions.},

  abstract     = {A mixed-integer programming (MIP) problem contains both constraints and integer restrictions. Integer restrictions divide the feasible region defined by constraints into multiple discontinuous feasible parts. In particular, the number of discontinuous feasible parts will drastically increase with the increase of the number of integer decision variables and/or the size of the candidate set of each integer decision variable. Due to the fact that the optimal solution is located in one of the discontinuous feasible parts, it is a challenging task to solve a MIP problem. This article presents a cutting and repulsion-based evolutionary framework (called CaR) to solve MIP problems. CaR includes two main strategies: 1) the cutting strategy and 2) the repulsion strategy. In the cutting strategy, an additional constraint is constructed based on the objective function value of the best individual found so far, the aim of which is to continuously cut unpromising discontinuous feasible parts. As a result, the probability of the population entering a wrong discontinuous feasible part can be decreased. In addition, in the repulsion strategy, once it has been detected that the population has converged to a discontinuous feasible part, the population will be reinitialized. Moreover, a repulsion function is designed to repulse the previously explored discontinuous feasible parts. Overall, the cutting strategy can significantly reduce the number of discontinuous feasible parts and the repulsion strategy can probe the remaining discontinuous feasible parts. Sixteen test problems developed in this article and two real-world cases are used to verify the effectiveness of CaR. The results demonstrate that CaR performs well in solving MIP problems.},

Inspired by these findings, an optimal trust-induced consensus process is designed with the usage of intuitionistic fuzzy preference relation. The comprehensive weight of each expert is decomposed into two portions, namely: 1) the individual weights and 2) interactive weights. Three optimization models are constructed to achieve weight parameters under different decision situations, where the weight parameters are represented through a 2-order additive fuzzy measure and the Shapley value. To reflect the interaction, the Choquet integral is employed for aggregating opinions, and a novel distance measure is adopted for accomplishing a consensus index. An illustrative example and comparison are put in practice to show the effectiveness and improvements of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Many important engineering applications involve control design for Euler–Lagrange (EL) systems. In this article, the practical prescribed time tracking control problem of EL systems is investigated under partial or full state constraints. A settling time regulator is introduced to construct a novel performance function, with which a new neural adaptive control scheme is developed to achieve pregiven tracking precision within the prescribed time. With the specific system transformation techniques, the problem of state constraints is transformed into the boundedness of new variables. The salient feature of the proposed control methods lies in the fact that not only the settling time and tracking precision are at the user’s disposal but also both partial state and full state constraints can be accommodated concurrently without the need for changing the control structure. The effectiveness of this approach is further verified by the simulation results.},

  abstract     = {This article proposes robust inverse $Q$ -learning algorithms for a learner to mimic an expert’s states and control inputs in the imitation learning problem. These two agents have different adversarial disturbances. To do the imitation, the learner must reconstruct the unknown expert cost function. The learner only observes the expert’s control inputs and uses inverse $Q$ -learning algorithms to reconstruct the unknown expert cost function. The inverse $Q$ -learning algorithms are robust in that they are independent of the system model and allow for the different cost function parameters and disturbances between two agents. We first propose an offline inverse $Q$ -learning algorithm which consists of two iterative learning loops: 1) an inner $Q$ -learning iteration loop and 2) an outer iteration loop based on inverse optimal control. Then, based on this offline algorithm, we further develop an online inverse $Q$ -learning algorithm such that the learner mimics the expert behaviors online with the real-time observation of the expert control inputs. This online computational method has four functional approximators: a critic approximator, two actor approximators, and a state-reward neural network (NN). It simultaneously approximates the parameters of $Q$ -function and the learner state reward online. Convergence and stability proofs are rigorously studied to guarantee the algorithm performance.},

Thus, the distributed controller of hybrid-order MASs can be designed by using the consensus control method of the same-order MASs. Second, through a case study of a stochastic mixed first- and second-order nonlinear MASs, this article further expounds the design idea of the framework structure and gives the concrete design form of the distributed controller and the stability analysis of the closed-loop system.

  abstract     = {Large-scale multiobjective optimization problems (LMOPs) bring significant challenges for traditional evolutionary operators, as their search capability cannot efficiently handle the huge decision space. Some newly designed search methods for LMOPs usually classify all variables into different groups and then optimize the variables in the same group with the same manner, which can speed up the population’s convergence. Following this research direction, this article suggests a differential evolution (DE) algorithm that favors searching the variables with higher importance to the solving of LMOPs. The importance of each variable to the target LMOP is quantized and then all variables are categorized into different groups based on their importance. The variable groups with higher importance are allocated with more computational resources using DE. In this way, the proposed method can efficiently generate offspring in a low-dimensional search subspace formed by more important variables, which can significantly speed up the convergence. During the evolutionary process, this search subspace for DE will be expanded gradually, which can strike a good balance between exploration and exploitation in tackling LMOPs. Finally, the experiments validate that our proposed algorithm can perform better than several state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms for solving various benchmark LMOPs.},

In order to highlight the influence of matrix coupling in the antagonistic interaction network, we investigate the second-order matrix-weighted bipartite consensus problem on undirected structurally balanced signed networks. Under the proposed bipartite consensus protocol, an algebraic condition is obtained for achieving second-order bipartite consensus via utilizing matrix-valued Gauge transformation and stability theory. Then, using the obtained criteria, a more direct algebraic graph condition is given for reaching bipartite consensus. Besides, because of the existence of negative (positive) semidefinite connections, the matrix-weighted network may have clustering phenomena, which means that matrix weights play a critical role in achieving consensus. An algebraic graph condition for admitting cluster bipartite consensus is provided. By designing matrix weights in practical scenarios, the required number of clusters can be obtained.

To simplify the control design and decrease the conservatism, tunnel prescribed performance (TPP) is proposed not only with concise form but also smaller overshoot performance. By introducing non-negative modified signals into TPP as saturation-tolerant prescribed performance (SPP), we propose SPC to guarantee tracking errors not to violate SPP constraints despite the existence of saturation and actuator faults. Namely, SPP possesses the ability of enlarging or recovering the performance boundaries flexibly when saturations occur or disappear with the help of these non-negative signals. A novel auxiliary system is then constructed for these signals, which bridges the associations between input saturation errors and performance constraints. Considering nonlinearities and uncertainties in systems, a fuzzy state observer is utilized to approximate the unmeasurable system states under saturations and unknown actuator faults. Dynamic surface control is employed to avoid tedious computations incurred by the backstepping procedures. Furthermore, the closed-loop state errors are guaranteed to a small neighborhood around the equilibrium in finite time and evolved within SPP constraints although input saturations and actuator faults occur. Finally, comparative simulations are presented to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.},

This framework is based on the structural information of the behavior continuity and the high similarity between neighboring frames. Due to the high similarity and high dimensionality of human behavior data, the high-precision segmentation of human behavior is hard to achieve from the perspective of application and academia. By making the behavior continuity hypothesis, first, the effective constraint regular terms are constructed. Subsequently, the clustering framework based on constrained non-negative matrix factorization is established. Finally, the segmentation result can be obtained by using the spectral clustering and graph segmentation algorithm. For illustration, the proposed framework is applied to the Weiz dataset, Keck dataset, mo_86 dataset, and mo_86_9 dataset. Empirical experiments on several public human behavior datasets demonstrate that the structure constraint matrix factorization framework can automatically segment human behavior sequences. Compared to the classical algorithm, the proposed framework can ensure consistent segmentation of sequential points within behavior actions and provide better performance in accuracy.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we study two challenging problems in semisupervised cross-view learning. On the one hand, most existing methods assume that the samples in all views have a pairwise relationship, that is, it is necessary to capture or establish the correspondence of different views at the sample level. Such an assumption is easily isolated even in the semisupervised setting wherein only a few samples have labels that could be used to establish the correspondence. On the other hand, almost all existing multiview methods, including semisupervised ones, usually train a model using a fixed dataset, which cannot handle the data of increasing views. In practice, the view number will increase when new sensors are deployed. To address the above two challenges, we propose a novel method that employs multiple independent semisupervised view-specific networks (ISVNs) to learn representation for multiple views in a view-decoupling fashion. The advantages of our method are two-fold. Thanks to our specifically designed autoencoder and pseudolabel learning paradigm, our method shows an effective way to utilize both the labeled and unlabeled data while relaxing the data assumption of the pairwise relationship, that is, correspondence. Furthermore, with our view decoupling strategy, the proposed ISVNs could be separately trained, thus efficiently handling the data of increasing views without retraining the entire model. To the best of our knowledge, our ISVN could be one of the first attempts to make handling increasing views in the semisupervised setting possible, as well as an effective solution to the noncorresponding problem. To verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our method, we conduct comprehensive experiments by comparing 13 state-of-the-art approaches on four multiview datasets in terms of retrieval and classification.},

A distinctive feature of the FXFNN is its fast and fixed-time convergence, in contrast to conventional forward-backward-forward neurodynamic network and projected neurodynamic network. It is shown that the solution of the proposed FXFNN exists uniquely and converges to the unique solution of the corresponding MVIs in fixed time under some mild conditions. It is also shown that the fixed-time convergence result obtained for the FXFNN is independent of initial conditions, unlike most of the existing asymptotical and exponential convergence results. Furthermore, the proposed FXFNN is applied in solving sparse recovery problems, variational inequalities, nonlinear complementarity problems, and min–max problems. Finally, numerical and experimental examples are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed neurodynamic network.},

  abstract     = {This article aims to stabilize probabilistic Boolean networks (PBNs) via a novel pinning control strategy. In a PBN, the state evolution of each gene switches among a collection of candidate Boolean functions with preassigned probability distributions, which govern the activation frequency of each Boolean function. Due to the existence of stochasticity, the mode-independent pinning controller might be disabled. Thus, both mode-independent and mode-dependent pinning controller are required here. Moreover, a criterion is derived to determine whether mode-independent controllers are applicable while the pinned nodes are given. It is worth pointing out that this pinning control is based on the $n\times n$ network structure rather than $2^{n} \times 2^{n}$ state transition matrix. Therefore, compared with the existing results, this pinning control strategy is more practicable and has the ability to handle large-scale networks, especially sparsely connected networks. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the designed control scheme, a PBN that describes the mammalian cell-cycle encountering a mutated phenotype is discussed as a simulation.},

  abstract     = {This article presents a robust adaptive neural control algorithm for the wing-sail-assisted vehicle to track the desired waypoint-based route, where the event-triggered mechanism is with the multiport form. The main features of the proposed algorithm are three-fold: 1) the communication burden, in the channel from the sensor to the controller as well as the actuator, has been reduced for the merits of the multiport event-triggered approach. The feedback error signals and the control input will be updated only on the event-triggered time point; 2) for the wing-sail-assisted vehicle, the thrust force is provided by devices with the propeller and the sail. From this consideration, the proper sail force compensation is derived on the basis of information about the current heading angle and the wind direction. The corresponding control law can guarantee the energy-saving for the propeller; and 3) in the algorithm, the system uncertainties are remodeled by the neural-network approximator. Furthermore, by fusion of the robust neural damping and dynamic surface control (DSC) techniques, the corresponding gain-related adaptive law is developed to address constraints of the gain uncertainty and the environmental disturbances. Through the Lyapunov theorem, all signals of the closed-loop control system have been proved to be with the semiglobal uniform ultimate bounded (SGUUB) stability, including the triggered time point and the intermediate triggered interval. Finally, the numerical simulation and the practical experiment are illustrated to verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.},

To cut down the communication load of the channel, the event-triggered control law is developed based on the switching threshold strategy. The Lyapunov stability theory and backstepping technique are applied coordinately to design the control strategy.

To address this problem, we propose an embodied neural controller for self-localization, foraging, backward homing (BH), and home searching of an advanced mobility sensor (AMOS)-driven insect-like robot. The controller, comprising a navigation module for the Bayesian self-localization and goal-directed control of AMOS and a locomotion module for coordinating the 18 joints of AMOS, leads to its robust insect-like navigation behaviors. As a result, the proposed controller enables AMOS to perform robust foraging, BH, and home searching against various levels of sensory noise, compared to conventional controllers. Its implementation relies only on self-localization and heading perception, rather than global positioning and landmark guidance. Interestingly, the proposed controller makes AMOS achieve spiral searching patterns comparable to those performed by real insects. We also demonstrated the performance of the controller for real-time indoor and outdoor navigation in a real insect-like robot without any landmark and cognitive map.},

  abstract     = {Deep-learning-based soft sensors have been extensively developed for predicting key quality or performance variables in industrial processes. However, most approaches assume that data are uniformly sampled while the multiple variables are often acquired at different rates in practical processes. This article designed a progressive transfer strategy, based on which a variational progressive-transfer network (VPTN) method is proposed for the soft sensor development of industrial multirate processes. In VPTN, the multirate data are first separated into multiple data chunks where the variables within each chunk are acquired at a uniform rate. Then, a variational multichunk data modeling framework is developed to model the multiple chunks in a unified fashion through deep variational structures. The base models, including the unsupervised ones with only partial process variables and the supervised soft sensor model share a similar network structure, such that the subsequent transfer strategy can be readily implemented. Finally, a progressive transfer learning strategy is designed to transfer the model parameters from the fastest sampled data chunk to the slowest one in a progressive manner. Thus, the knowledge from various data chunks can be sequentially explored and transferred to enhance the performance of the terminal soft sensor model. Case studies on both a debutanizer column dataset and a real coal mill dataset in a thermal power plant validate the performance of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {As a kind of biological network, the brain network conduces to understanding the mystery of high-efficiency information processing in the brain, which will provide instructions to develop efficient brain-like neural networks. Large-scale dynamical functional network connectivity (dFNC) provides a more context-sensitive, dynamical, and straightforward sight at a higher network level. Nevertheless, dFNC analysis needs good enough resolution in both temporal and spatial domains, and the construction of dFNC needs to capture the time-varying correlations between two multivariate time series with unmatched spatial dimensions. Effective methods still lack. With well-developed source imaging techniques, electroencephalogram (EEG) has the potential to possess both high temporal and spatial resolutions. Therefore, we proposed to construct the EEG large-scale cortical dFNC based on brain atlas to probe the subtle dynamic activities in the brain and developed a novel method, that is, wavelet coherence–S estimator (WTCS), to assess the dynamic couplings among functional subnetworks with different spatial dimensions. The simulation study demonstrated its robustness and availability of applying to dFNC. The application in real EEG data revealed the appealing “Primary peak” and “P3-like peak” in dFNC network properties and meaningful evolutions in dFNC network topology for P300. Our study brings new insights for probing brain activities at a more dynamical and higher hierarchical level and pushing forward the development of brain-inspired artificial neural networks. The proposed WTCS not only benefits the dFNC studies but also gives a new solution to capture the time-varying couplings between the multivariate time series that is often encountered in signal processing disciplines.},

  abstract     = {Due to the multilayer nature of real-world systems, the problem of inferring multilayer network structures from nonlinear and complex dynamical systems is prominent in many fields, including engineering, biological, physical, and computer sciences. Many network reconstruction methods have been proposed to address this problem, but none of them consider the similarities among network reconstruction tasks at different component layers, which are inspired by topology correlations and dynamic couplings among different component layers. This article develops an evolutionary multitasking multilayer network reconstruction framework to make use of the correlations among different component layers to improve the reconstruction performance; we refer to this framework as EM2MNR. In EM2MNR, the multilayer network reconstruction problem is first established as a multitasking multilayer network reconstruction problem, where the goal of each task is to reconstruct the network structure of a component layer. In addition, multitasking multilayer network reconstruction problems are high dimensional, but existing evolutionary multitasking algorithms may have poor performance when dealing with optimization problems with a high-dimensional search space. Inspired by the sparsity of multilayer networks, EM2MNR employs the restricted Boltzmann machine to extract low effective features from the original decision space and then decides whether to conduct knowledge transfer on these features. To verify the performance of EM2MNR, this article also designs a test suite for multilayer network reconstruction problems. The experimental results demonstrate the significant improvement obtained by the proposed EM2MNR framework on 96 multilayer network reconstruction problems.},

Our research represents the first step toward developing security attacks of formation control on MASs. Our study aims to investigate potential security problems of formation control on a multirobot system for the first time. We propose two kinds of control-level attacks and each kind of attack includes several specific attack forms. Then, we discuss specific features of formation control on a classical multirobot system and utilize theoretical analyses to illustrate how cyberattacks can influence the physical movements of robots.

By introducing the dynamic surface control (DSC) design technique into the adaptive backstepping control algorithm and constructing the fractional-order Lyapunov functions, an adaptive fuzzy output-feedback decentralized control scheme is developed. It is proved that the decentralized controlled system is stable and that the tracking and observer errors are able to converge to a neighborhood of zero. A simulation example is given to confirm the validity of the proposed control scheme.},

  abstract     = {Clustering techniques attempt to group objects with similar properties into a cluster. Clustering the nodes of an attributed graph, in which each node is associated with a set of feature attributes, has attracted significant attention. Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) represent an effective approach for integrating the two complementary factors of node attributes and structural information for attributed graph clustering. Smoothness is an indicator for assessing the degree of similarity of feature representations among nearby nodes in a graph. Oversmoothing in GCNs, caused by unnecessarily high orders of graph convolution, produces indistinguishable representations of nodes, such that the nodes in a graph tend to be grouped into fewer clusters, and pose a challenge due to the resulting performance drop. In this study, we propose a smoothness sensor for attributed graph clustering based on adaptive smoothness-transition graph convolutions, which senses the smoothness of a graph and adaptively terminates the current convolution once the smoothness is saturated to prevent oversmoothing. Furthermore, as an alternative to graph-level smoothness, a novel fine-grained nodewise-level assessment of smoothness is proposed, in which smoothness is computed in accordance with the neighborhood conditions of a given node at a certain order of graph convolution. In addition, a self-supervision criterion is designed considering both the tightness within clusters and the separation between clusters to guide the entire neural network training process. The experiments show that the proposed methods significantly outperform 13 other state-of-the-art baselines in terms of different metrics across five benchmark datasets. In addition, an extensive study reveals the reasons for their effectiveness and efficiency.},

The phenomenon of packet losses is assumed to randomly occur in the feedback channel, which is modeled by a Bernoulli process. Employing the single exponential smoothing method as a compensation scheme, the missing measurements are predicted to help offset the impact of packet losses on system performance. Then, an asynchronous output feedback controller is designed by the hidden Markov model. Based on the mode-dependent Lyapunov function, some novel sufficient conditions on the controller existence are derived such that the closed-loop system is stochastically stable with strict dissipativity.

The multiview generalized eigenvalue proximal support vector machine (MvGSVM) is a recently proposed effective binary classification method, which introduces the concept of MVL into the classical generalized eigenvalue proximal support vector machine (GEPSVM). However, this approach cannot guarantee good classification performance and robustness yet. In this article, we develop multiview robust double-sided twin SVM (MvRDTSVM) with SVM-type problems, which introduces a set of double-sided constraints into the proposed model to promote classification performance. To improve the robustness of MvRDTSVM against outliers, we take L1-norm as the distance metric. Also, a fast version of MvRDTSVM (called MvFRDTSVM) is further presented. The reformulated problems are complex, and solving them are very challenging. As one of the main contributions of this article, we design two effective iterative algorithms to optimize the proposed nonconvex problems and then conduct theoretical analysis on the algorithms.

  abstract     = {Multiview subspace clustering (MVSC) leverages the complementary information among different views of multiview data and seeks a consensus subspace clustering result better than that using any individual view. Though proved effective in some cases, existing MVSC methods often obtain unsatisfactory results since they perform subspace analysis with raw features that are often of high dimensions and contain noises. To remedy this, we propose a self-guided deep multiview subspace clustering (SDMSC) model that performs joint deep feature embedding and subspace analysis. SDMSC comprehensively explores multiview data and strives to obtain a consensus data affinity relationship agreed by features from not only all views but also all intermediate embedding spaces. With more constraints being cast, the desirable data affinity relationship is supposed to be more reliably recovered. Besides, to secure effective deep feature embedding without label supervision, we propose to use the data affinity relationship obtained with raw features as the supervision signals to self-guide the embedding process. With this strategy, the risk that our deep clustering model being trapped in bad local minima is reduced, bringing us satisfactory clustering results in a higher possibility. The experiments on seven widely used datasets show the proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art clustering methods.

Although consensus-based algorithms are effective for distributed fusion and MTT, it may be problematic when distributed sensor nodes have different FoVs. To deal with this issue, the proposed method constructs an extended label space mapping to overcome the “label space mismatching” phenomenon; after that, the model of the undetected multitargets is established so that the tracks can be initialized outside the FoV of local sensors; finally and most important, weight selection and evolution mechanism are proposed such that the fusion weights are automatically tuned for each track at each time step and consensus step.

Notably, for these disturbances, one of them can be described as a norm-bounded, and the other is generated by an exogenous model. In order to reject the above one kind of disturbance, a disturbance observer is developed. Furthermore, combining the disturbance observer approach and conventional state-feedback control scheme, a composite disturbance rejection controller is specifically designed to compensate for the influences of the disturbances. Then, some criteria are established based on the general Lyapunov stability theory, which can ensure that the synchronization error system is stochastically stable and satisfies a fixed $\mathcal {H}_{\infty } $ performance level.

For this issue, this article proposes an adaptive reference vector reinforcement learning (RVRL) approach to decomposition-based algorithms for industrial copper burdening optimization. The proposed approach involves two main operations, that is: 1) a reinforcement learning (RL) operation and 2) a reference point sampling operation. Given the fact that the states of reference vectors interact with the landscape environment (quite often), the RL operation treats the reference vector adaption process as an RL task, where each reference vector learns from the environmental feedback and selects optimal actions for gradually fitting the problem characteristics. Accordingly, the reference point sampling operation uses estimation-of-distribution learning models to sample new reference points. Finally, the resultant algorithm is applied to handle the proposed industrial copper burdening problem. For this problem, an adaptive penalty function and a soft constraint-based relaxing approach are used to handle complex constraints. Experimental results on both benchmark problems and real-world instances verify the competitiveness and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Obstacle detection using semantic segmentation has become an established approach in autonomous vehicles. However, existing segmentation methods, primarily developed for ground vehicles, are inadequate in an aquatic environment as they produce many false positive (FP) detections in the presence of water reflections and wakes. We propose a novel deep encoder–decoder architecture, a water segmentation and refinement (WaSR) network, specifically designed for the marine environment to address these issues. A deep encoder based on ResNet101 with atrous convolutions enables the extraction of rich visual features, while a novel decoder gradually fuses them with inertial information from the inertial measurement unit (IMU). The inertial information greatly improves the segmentation accuracy of the water component in the presence of visual ambiguities, such as fog on the horizon. Furthermore, a novel loss function for semantic separation is proposed to enforce the separation of different semantic components to increase the robustness of the segmentation. We investigate different loss variants and observe a significant reduction in FPs and an increase in true positives (TPs). Experimental results show that WaSR outperforms the current state of the art by approximately 4\% in F1 score on a challenging unmanned surface vehicle dataset. WaSR shows remarkable generalization capabilities and outperforms the state of the art by over 24\% in F1 score on a strict domain generalization experiment.},

Specifically, to generate new learning materials, PASM leverages a point adversarial attack method and a trained teacher network to locate the most informative position related to the target task, generating harder learning samples to refine the network. The searched position is highly adaptive since it considers both the statistical information of each sample and the teacher network capability. Other than being provided new learning materials, the student network also receives guidance from the teacher network. After the student network finishes training, the student network changes its role and acts as a teacher, generating new learning materials and providing stronger guidance to train a better student network. The adaptive learning materials generation and teacher/student update can be conducted more than one time, improving the network capability iteratively.

  abstract     = {Skin lesion diagnosis is a key step for skin cancer screening, which requires high accuracy and interpretability. Though many computer-aided methods, especially deep learning methods, have made remarkable achievements in skin lesion diagnosis, their generalization and interpretability are still a challenge. To solve this issue, we propose an interpretability-based multimodal convolutional neural network (IM-CNN), which is a multiclass classification model with skin lesion images and metadata of patients as input for skin lesion diagnosis. The structure of IM-CNN consists of three main paths to deal with metadata, features extracted from segmented skin lesion with domain knowledge, and skin lesion images, respectively. We add interpretable visual modules to provide explanations for both images and metadata. In addition to area under the ROC curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity, we introduce a new indicator, an AUC curve with a sensitivity larger than 80\% (AUC_SEN_80) for performance evaluation. Extensive experimental studies are conducted on the popular HAM10000 dataset, and the results indicate that the proposed model has overwhelming advantages compared with popular deep learning models, such as DenseNet, ResNet, and other state-of-the-art models for melanoma diagnosis. The proposed multimodal model also achieves on average 72\% and 21\% improvement in terms of sensitivity and AUC_SEN_80, respectively, compared with the single-modal model. The visual explanations can also help gain trust from dermatologists and realize man–machine collaborations, effectively reducing the limitation of black-box models in supporting medical decision making.},

Existing distributed power dispatch algorithms (DPDAs) usually assume that suppliers/consumers bid truthfully. However, this article shows the need for DPDAs to consider strategic players and to take account of their behavior deviation from what the DPDAs expect. To address this, we propose a distributed strategy update algorithm (DSUA) on top of a DPDA. The DSUA considers strategic suppliers who optimize their bids in a DPDA, using only the information accessible from a DPDA, that is, price. The DSUA also considers the cases when suppliers update bids alternately or simultaneously. Under both cases, we show the closeness of supplier bids to the Nash equilibrium via game-theoretic analysis as well as simulation.},

However, the crucial issue of testing the discriminating power of different centrality measures is still open. In this article, we propose to assess the discriminating power of node centrality measures by using the notion of automorphism and orbit: nodes in the same orbit have identical metric scores, while nodes in different orbits should have different centrality values. Under this assumption, we present a benchmark for the discriminating power of node centrality measures. Moreover, we propose an efficient approach to evaluate centrality measures in terms of the discriminating power, which is devoid of finding orbits. Extensive experiments on real and model networks are executed to compare seven commonly used node centrality metrics.},

Under the output of the RBFNN, the disturbance observer technology is employed to estimate the unknown compound disturbances of the system.

By constructing a novel bump function, a distance-dependent dynamic communication network model is first presented, which characterizes the interaction strength as a nonlinear smooth function varying with the relative distance of spacecraft continuously. Subsequently, based on an edge-tension potential function, a distributed event-driven coordinated control scheme is proposed to achieve formation consensus, while ensuring that adjacent spacecraft is always within the allowable connectivity range. Meanwhile, to avoid redundant data transmissions, a hybrid dynamic event-triggered mechanism with maximum triggering interval is developed to schedule the communication frequency among spacecraft. It is proven that the onboard communication resources occupation can be reduced significantly and the Zeno phenomenon is strictly excluded. Finally, the efficiency of the proposed method for, as an example, four-spacecraft formation system is substantiated.},

Thus, cloud images obtained by meteorological satellites can be used to identify different weather phenomena to provide meteorological status and future projections. How to classify and recognize cloud images automatically, especially with deep learning, is an interesting topic. Generally speaking, large-scale training data are essential for deep learning. However, there is no such cloud images database to date. Thus, we propose a large-scale cloud image database for meteorological research (LSCIDMR). To the best of our knowledge, it is the first publicly available satellite cloud image benchmark database for meteorological research, in which weather systems are linked directly with the cloud images. LSCIDMR contains 104 390 high-resolution images, covering 11 classes with two different annotation methods: 1) single-label annotation and 2) multiple-label annotation, called LSCIDMR-S and LSCIDMR-M, respectively. The labels are annotated manually, and we obtain a total of 414 221 multiple labels and 40 625 single labels. Several representative deep learning methods are evaluated on the proposed LSCIDMR, and the results can serve as useful baselines for future research. Furthermore, experimental results demonstrate that it is possible to learn effective deep learning models from a sufficiently large image database for the cloud image classification.},

Due to the presence of the global dual variable in the Lagrangian function, we propose a primal-dual algorithm based on the Laplacian consensus to solve such a problem in a distributed manner by introducing the local estimates of the dual variable. We theoretically show the geometric convergence of the primal-dual gradient optimization algorithm by the contraction theory in the context of discrete-time updating dynamics. The exact convergence rate is obtained, leading the stopping number of iterations to be bounded. The recursive feasibility of the proposed DMPC strategy and the stability of the closed-loop system can be established pursuant to the inexact solution.

These neurons obey Gamma distribution whose shape parameter infers the neurons of the next layer of the network and their related weights. Upsampling the connection weights follows a Dirichlet distribution. Downsampling hidden units obey Gamma distribution. This work performs up-down sampling on each layer to learn the parameters of SGNMN. Experimental results indicate that the width and depth of SGNMN are closely related, and a reasonable network structure for accurately detecting brain fatigue through functional near-infrared spectroscopy can be obtained by considering network width, depth, and parameters.},

The singular perturbation method is adopted to decouple the dynamic equations of the flexible manipulator; hence, two subsystems that represent the rigid robot motion and flexible-link vibration are obtained, respectively. Then, for the slow subsystem related to the rigid motion, an image-based controller is designed to converge the image errors with the consideration of compensating for the errors of approximating the Jacobian matrix. For the fast subsystem corresponding to the elastic vibration, to eliminate the requirements of measuring the vibration states, an observer is designed to estimate the fast states and then a feedback controller of the fast subsystem is presented to suppress the vibration of the flexible manipulator by using the estimation values. The closed-loop stabilities of the slow and fast subsystem are both proved by employing the Lyapunov theory. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller, which shows that the image errors approach zero with the vibration of the flexible manipulator damped out simultaneously.},

Although SSR itself is powerful for image restoration by combining the local sparsity and nonlocal self-similarity in natural images, in this work, we explicitly incorporate the novel NC-SRC prior into SSR. Our proposed approach provides more effective sparse modeling for natural images by applying a more flexible sparse representation scheme, leading to high-quality restored images. Moreover, an alternating minimizing framework is developed to solve the proposed NSSRC-based image restoration problems. Extensive experimental results on image denoising and image deblocking validate that the proposed NSSRC achieves better results than many popular or state-of-the-art methods over several publicly available datasets.},

First, a memory-based mode-compared event-triggered mechanism for switched systems is proposed to effectively shorten asynchronous intervals, which employs historical sampled outputs and compares the mode of the current sampled instant and the adjacent sampled instant. Then, the maximum average dwell time for a novel switching signal is derived with a constraint on the ratio of total destabilizing switchings to total stabilizing switchings, which relaxes the requirement of the regular arrangement of destabilizing and stabilizing switchings. Moreover, with the help of different coordinate transformations in the EAORP, the discretized Lyapunov functions are no longer needed when synthesizing the NSSs with USDs, and the asynchronous switching situation is also discussed. Afterward, by designing a dynamic output feedback controller, sufficient conditions are given to solve the EAORP for NSSs with USDs subject to network-induced delays, packet disorders, and packet losses. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed methods is verified via a switched RLC circuit.},

Then, we develop a multiview graph RBM model on the basis of the graph RBM, which performs local structural learning and multiview representation learning simultaneously. The proposed multiview model has the following merits: 1) it preserves the data manifold structure for multiview classification and 2) it performs view-consistent representation learning and view-specific representation learning simultaneously.

Different from the existing works, this article investigates a brand-new appointed-time consensus control approach for uncertain networked Euler–Lagrange systems on a directed graph via exploring the prescribed performance control structure. First, a two-layer prescribed performance envelope is formulated via using an appointed-time convergent function for position-related and velocity-related consensus errors, respectively. Then, a simple state-feedback virtual controller with online adaptive performance adjustment is developed to preserve the communication connectivity. Moreover, to guarantee the velocity consensus of the networked systems and improve the position consensus accuracy, an appointed-time adaptive controller is designed by applying the norm inequality to the system uncertainties and external disturbances. Compared to the existing consensus control approaches, the prime advantage of the proposed one is that the constraints generated from the communication ranges are approximated by a time-varying contractive performance envelope, wherein, the appointed-time convergence and steady-state tracking accuracy are preassigned a priori. Meanwhile, no repeated logarithmic error transformations are required in the relevant controller design, which implies that the complexity of the devised control laws has decreased dramatically. Finally, two groups of illustrative examples are organized to validate the effectiveness of the proposed consensus control approach.},

  abstract     = {Multiview subspace clustering is one of the most widely used methods for exploiting the internal structures of multiview data. Most previous studies have performed the task of learning multiview representations by individually constructing an affinity matrix for each view without simultaneously exploiting the intrinsic characteristics of multiview data. In this article, we propose a multiview low-rank representation (MLRR) method to comprehensively discover the correlation of multiview data for multiview subspace clustering. MLRR considers symmetric low-rank representations (LRRs) to be an approximately linear spatial transformation under the new base, that is, the multiview data themselves, to fully exploit the angular information of the principal directions of LRRs, which is adopted to construct an affinity matrix for multiview subspace clustering, under a symmetric condition. MLRR takes full advantage of LRR techniques and a diversity regularization term to exploit the diversity and consistency of multiple views, respectively, and this method simultaneously imposes a symmetry constraint on LRRs. Hence, the angular information of the principal directions of rows is consistent with that of columns in symmetric LRRs. The MLRR model can be efficiently calculated by solving a convex optimization problem. Moreover, we present an intuitive fusion strategy for symmetric LRRs from the perspective of spectral clustering to obtain a compact representation, which can be shared by multiple views and comprehensively represents the intrinsic features of multiview data. Finally, the experimental results based on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of MLRR compared with several state-of-the-art multiview subspace clustering algorithms.},

Subsequently, by applying two types of nonlinear mapping, all state variables of MEMS gyroscopes are restrained within the predefined time-varying asymmetric functions without imposing stringent feasibility conditions on virtual control laws. Furthermore, an echo-state network-based minimal learning parameter neural observer is developed to simultaneously recover the unmeasurable velocity-state variables, matched as well as unmatched disturbances in constrained MEMS gyroscopes dynamics, enabling an output-feedback control solution with a decreased online learning complexity.

  abstract     = {The vulnerability of automated fingerprint recognition systems (AFRSs) to presentation attacks (PAs) promotes the vigorous development of PA detection (PAD) technology. However, PAD methods have been limited by information loss and poor generalization ability, resulting in new PA materials and fingerprint sensors. This article thus proposes a global–local model-based PAD (RTK-PAD) method to overcome those limitations to some extent. The proposed method consists of three modules, called: 1) the global module; 2) the local module; and 3) the rethinking module. By adopting the cut-out-based global module, a global spoofness score predicted from nonlocal features of the entire fingerprint images can be achieved. While by using the texture in-painting-based local module, a local spoofness score predicted from fingerprint patches is obtained. The two modules are not independent but connected through our proposed rethinking module by localizing two discriminative patches for the local module based on the global spoofness score. Finally, the fusion spoofness score by averaging the global and local spoofness scores is used for PAD. Our experimental results evaluated on LivDet 2017 show that the proposed RTK-PAD can achieve an average classification error (ACE) of 2.28\% and a true detection rate (TDR) of 91.19\% when the false detection rate (FDR) equals 1.0\%, which significantly outperformed the state-of-the-art methods by ~10\% in terms of TDR (91.19\% versus 80.74\%).},

  abstract     = {This work proposes a nonparametric prior induced deep sum-logarithmic-multinomial mixture (DSLMM) model to detect pilots’ cognitive states through the developed brain power map. DSLMM uses multinormal distribution to infer the latent variable of each neuron in the first layer of the network. These latent variables obeyed a sum-logarithmic distribution that is backpropagated to its observation vector and the number of neurons in the next layer. Multinormal distribution is used to segment the extended observation vector to form a matrix associated with the width of the next layer. This work also proposes an adaptive topic-layer stochastic gradient Riemann (ATL-SGR) Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) inference method to learn its global parameters without heuristic assumptions. The experimental results indicate that DSLMM can extract more probability distribution contained in the brain power map layer by layer, and achieve higher pilot cognition detection accuracy.},

  abstract     = {In this article, an adaptive sensor fault accommodation scheme is proposed for uncertain vehicle active suspensions via output-feedback control where vehicle body displacement is the only measurable output signal corrupted by sensor bias. An adaptive observer with variable gains is constructed to obtain state estimates whose design procedure involves parameter adaption of the uncertain system parameters and sensor bias, and an output-feedback controller is designed to attenuate the vehicle body displacement based on the partial measurement information, estimates of the states, and unknown parameters. Compensation for measurement error is made both in the design process of the adaptive observer and output-feedback controller in order to weaken the influence brought about by sensor bias fault. In order to guarantee system stability, the variable observer gains are determined in real time using a switching strategy where their values can be modified in finite times by monitoring the state estimates generated by the observer itself. It is proved that the vehicle body displacement will converge to a small neighborhood around zero, and all the signals of the closed-loop system are ensured to be bounded through selecting suitable control parameters. Simulation is carried out to show the effectiveness of the proposed method and results indicate that better stabilization of the suspension vertical motion can be achieved through adaptive compensation for sensor bias.},

  abstract     = {Object clustering has received considerable research attention most recently. However, 1) most existing object clustering methods utilize visual information while ignoring important tactile modality, which would inevitably lead to model performance degradation and 2) simply concatenating visual and tactile information via multiview clustering method can make complementary information to not be fully explored, since there are many differences between vision and touch. To address these issues, we put forward a graph-based visual–tactile fused object clustering framework with two modules: 1) a modality-specific representation learning module $M_{R}$ and 2) a unified affinity graph learning module $M_{U}$ . Specifically, $M_{R}$ focuses on learning modality-specific representations for visual–tactile data, where deep non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is adopted to extract the hidden information behind each modality. Meanwhile, we employ an autoencoder-like structure to enhance the robustness of the learned representations, and two graphs to improve its compactness. Furthermore, $M_{U}$ highlights how to mitigate the differences between vision and touch, and further maximize the mutual information, which adopts a minimizing disagreement scheme to guide the modality-specific representations toward a unified affinity graph. To achieve ideal clustering performance, a Laplacian rank constraint is imposed to regularize the learned graph with ideal connected components, where noises that caused wrong connections are removed and clustering labels can be obtained directly. Finally, we propose an efficient alternating iterative minimization updating strategy, followed by a theoretical proof to prove framework convergence. Comprehensive experiments on five public datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework.},

  abstract     = {Visual object tracking is a fundamental and challenging task in many high-level vision and robotics applications. It is typically formulated by estimating the target appearance model between consecutive frames. Discriminative correlation filters (DCFs) and their variants have achieved promising speed and accuracy for visual tracking in many challenging scenarios. However, because of the unwanted boundary effects and lack of geometric constraints, these methods suffer from performance degradation. In the current work, we propose hierarchical spatiotemporal graph-regularized correlation filters for robust object tracking. The target sample is decomposed into a large number of deep channels, which are then used to construct a spatial graph such that each graph node corresponds to a particular target location across all channels. Such a graph effectively captures the spatial structure of the target object. In order to capture the temporal structure of the target object, the information in the deep channels obtained from a temporal window is compressed using the principal component analysis, and then, a temporal graph is constructed such that each graph node corresponds to a particular target location in the temporal dimension. Both spatial and temporal graphs span different subspaces such that the target and the background become linearly separable. The learned correlation filter is constrained to act as an eigenvector of the Laplacian of these spatiotemporal graphs. We propose a novel objective function that incorporates these spatiotemporal constraints into the DCFs framework. We solve the objective function using alternating direction methods of multipliers such that each subproblem has a closed-form solution. We evaluate our proposed algorithm on six challenging benchmark datasets and compare it with 33 existing state-of-the art trackers. Our results demonstrate an excellent performance of the proposed algorithm compared to the existing trackers.},

Aiming at the problems of weakly discriminating marginal representation and difficulty in revealing the data manifold structure in most of the existing linear discriminant methods, we propose a more powerful discriminant feature extraction framework, namely, joint sparse locality-aware regression (JSLAR). In our model, we formulate a new strategy induced by the nonsquared $L_{2}$ norm for enhancing the local intraclass compactness of the data manifold, which can achieve the joint learning of the locality-aware graph structure and the desirable projection matrix. Besides, we formulate a weighted retargeted regression to perform the marginal representation learning adaptively instead of using the general average interclass margin. To alleviate the disturbance of outliers and prevent overfitting, we measure the regression term and locality-aware term together with the regularization term by forcing the row sparsity with the joint $L_{2,1}$ norms. Then, we derive an effective iterative algorithm for solving the proposed model. The experimental results over a range of benchmark databases demonstrate that the proposed JSLAR outperforms some state-of-the-art approaches.},

  abstract     = {The rapid emergence of high-dimensional data in various areas has brought new challenges to current ensemble clustering research. To deal with the curse of dimensionality, recently considerable efforts in ensemble clustering have been made by means of different subspace-based techniques. However, besides the emphasis on subspaces, rather limited attention has been paid to the potential diversity in similarity/dissimilarity metrics. It remains a surprisingly open problem in ensemble clustering how to create and aggregate a large population of diversified metrics, and furthermore, how to jointly investigate the multilevel diversity in the large populations of metrics, subspaces, and clusters in a unified framework. To tackle this problem, this article proposes a novel multidiversified ensemble clustering approach. In particular, we create a large number of diversified metrics by randomizing a scaled exponential similarity kernel, which are then coupled with random subspaces to form a large set of metric-subspace pairs. Based on the similarity matrices derived from these metric-subspace pairs, an ensemble of diversified base clusterings can be thereby constructed. Furthermore, an entropy-based criterion is utilized to explore the cluster wise diversity in ensembles, based on which three specific ensemble clustering algorithms are presented by incorporating three types of consensus functions. Extensive experiments are conducted on 30 high-dimensional datasets, including 18 cancer gene expression datasets and 12 image/speech datasets, which demonstrate the superiority of our algorithms over the state of the art.

  abstract     = {By training different models and averaging their predictions, the performance of the machine-learning algorithm can be improved. The performance optimization of multiple models is supposed to generalize further data well. This requires the knowledge transfer of generalization information between models. In this article, a multiple kernel mutual learning method based on transfer learning of combined mid-level features is proposed for hyperspectral classification. Three-layer homogenous superpixels are computed on the image formed by PCA, which is used for computing mid-level features. The three mid-level features include: 1) the sparse reconstructed feature; 2) combined mean feature; and 3) uniqueness. The sparse reconstruction feature is obtained by a joint sparse representation model under the constraint of three-scale superpixels’ boundaries and regions. The combined mean features are computed with average values of spectra in multilayer superpixels, and the uniqueness is obtained by the superposed manifold ranking values of multilayer superpixels. Next, three kernels of samples in different feature spaces are computed for mutual learning by minimizing the divergence. Then, a combined kernel is constructed to optimize the sample distance measurement and applied by employing SVM training to build classifiers. Experiments are performed on real hyperspectral datasets, and the corresponding results demonstrated that the proposed method can perform significantly better than several state-of-the-art competitive algorithms based on MKL and deep learning.},

However, PIL is mostly applied to a deterministic learning problem, while in the real world, the greatest case that is of concern is the uncertainty learning problem.

  abstract     = {Graph theory analysis using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is currently an advanced technique for seizure prediction. Recent deep learning approaches, which fail to fully explore both the characterizations in EEGs themselves and correlations among different electrodes simultaneously, generally neglect the spatial or temporal dependencies in an epileptic brain and, thus, produce suboptimal seizure prediction performance consequently. To tackle this issue, in this article, a patient-specific EEG seizure predictor is proposed by using a novel spatio-temporal-spectral hierarchical graph convolutional network with an active preictal interval learning scheme (STS-HGCN-AL). Specifically, since the epileptic activities in different brain regions may be of different frequencies, the proposed STS-HGCN-AL framework first infers a hierarchical graph to concurrently characterize an epileptic cortex under different rhythms, whose temporal dependencies and spatial couplings are extracted by a spectral-temporal convolutional neural network and a variant self-gating mechanism, respectively. Critical intrarhythm spatiotemporal properties are then captured and integrated jointly and further mapped to the final recognition results by using a hierarchical graph convolutional network. Particularly, since the preictal transition may be diverse from seconds to hours prior to a seizure onset among different patients, our STS-HGCN-AL scheme estimates an optimal preictal interval patient dependently via a semisupervised active learning strategy, which further enhances the robustness of the proposed patient-specific EEG seizure predictor. Competitive experimental results validate the efficacy of the proposed method in extracting critical preictal biomarkers, indicating its promising abilities in automatic seizure prediction.},

  abstract     = {By utilizing physical models of the atmosphere collected from the current weather conditions, the numerical weather prediction model developed by the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) can provide the indicators of severe weather such as heavy precipitation for an early-warning system. However, the performance of precipitation forecasts from ECMWF often suffers from considerable prediction biases due to the high complexity and uncertainty for the formation of precipitation. The bias correcting on precipitation (BCoP) was thus utilized for correcting these biases via forecasting variables, including the historical observations and variables of precipitation, and these variables, as predictors, from ECMWF are highly relevant to precipitation. The existing BCoP methods, such as model output statistics and ordinal boosting autoencoder, do not take advantage of both spatiotemporal (ST) dependencies of precipitation and scales of related predictors that can change with different precipitation. We propose an end-to-end deep-learning BCoP model, called the ST scale adaptive selection (SSAS) model, to automatically select the ST scales of the predictors via ST Scale-Selection Modules (S3M/TS2M) for acquiring the optimal high-level ST representations. Qualitative and quantitative experiments carried out on two benchmark datasets indicate that SSAS can achieve state-of-the-art performance, compared with 11 published BCoP methods, especially on heavy precipitation.},

  abstract     = {Currently, several convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods have been proposed for computer-aided COVID-19 diagnosis based on lung computed tomography (CT) scans. However, the lesions of pneumonia in CT scans have wide variations in appearances, sizes, and locations in the lung regions, and the manifestations of COVID-19 in CT scans are also similar to other types of viral pneumonia, which hinders the further improvement of CNN-based methods. Delineating infection regions manually is a solution to this issue, while excessive workload of physicians during the epidemic makes it difficult for manual delineation. In this article, we propose a CNN called dense connectivity network with parallel attention module (PAM-DenseNet), which can perform well on coarse labels without manually delineated infection regions. The parallel attention module automatically learns to strengthen informative features from both channelwise and spatialwise simultaneously, which can make the network pay more attention to the infection regions without any manual delineation. The dense connectivity structure performs feature maps reuse by introducing direct connections from previous layers to all subsequent layers, which can extract representative features from fewer CT slices. The proposed network is first trained on 3530 lung CT slices selected from 382 COVID-19 lung CT scans, 372 lung CT scans infected by other pneumonia, and 200 normal lung CT scans to obtain a pretrained model for slicewise prediction. We then apply this pretrained model to a CT scans dataset containing 94 COVID-19 CT scans, 93 other pneumonia CT scans, and 93 normal lung scans, and achieve patientwise prediction through a voting mechanism. The experimental results show that the proposed network achieves promising results with an accuracy of 94.29\%, a precision of 93.75\%, a sensitivity of 95.74\%, and a specificity of 96.77\%, which is comparable to the methods that are based on manually delineated infection regions.},

  abstract     = {Recently, the correlation filter (CF) and Siamese network have become the two most popular frameworks in object tracking. Existing CF trackers, however, are limited by feature learning and context usage, making them sensitive to boundary effects. In contrast, Siamese trackers can easily suffer from the interference of semantic distractors. To address the above problems, we propose an end-to-end target-insight correlation network (TICNet) for object tracking, which aims at breaking the above limitations on top of a unified network. TICNet is an asymmetric dual-branch network involving a target-background awareness model (TBAM), a spatial-channel attention network (SCAN), and a distractor-aware filter (DAF) for end-to-end learning. Specifically, TBAM aims to distinguish a target from the background in the pixel level, yielding a target likelihood map based on color statistics to mine distractors for DAF learning. SCAN consists of a basic convolutional network, a channel-attention network, and a spatial-attention network, aiming to generate attentive weights to enhance the representation learning of the tracker. Especially, we formulate a differentiable DAF and employ it as a learnable layer in the network, thus helping suppress distracting regions in the background. During testing, DAF, together with TBAM, yields a response map for the final target estimation. Extensive experiments on seven benchmarks demonstrate that TICNet outperforms the state-of-the-art methods while running at real-time speed.},

  abstract     = {This article develops a dynamic version of event-triggered model predictive control (MPC) without utilizing any terminal constraint. Such a dynamic event-triggering mechanism takes the advantages of both event- and self-triggering approaches by dealing explicitly with conservatism in the triggering rate and measurement frequency. The prediction horizon shrinks as the system states converge; we prove that the proposed strategy is able to stabilize the system even without any stability-related terminal constraint. Recursive feasibility of the optimization control problem (OCP) is also guaranteed. The simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the scheme.},

  abstract     = {The exoskeleton is mainly used by subjects who suffer muscle injury to enhance motor ability in the daily life environment. Previous research seldom considers extending human collaboration skills to human–robot collaborations. In this article, two models, that is: 1) the following the better model and 2) the interpersonal goal integration model, are designed to facilitate the human–human collaborative manipulation in tracking a moving target. Integrated with dual-arm exoskeletons, these two models can enable the robot to successfully perform target tracking with two human partners. Specifically, the manipulation workspace of the human–exoskeleton system is divided into a human region and a robot region. In the human region, the human acts as the leader during cooperation, while, in the robot region, the robot takes the leading role. A novel region-based Barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) is then designed to handle the change of leader roles between the human and the robot and ensures the operation within the constrained human and robot regions when driving the dual-arm exoskeleton to track the moving target. The designed adaptive controller ensures the convergence of tracking errors in the presence of region switches. Experiments are performed on the dual-arm robotic exoskeleton for the subject with muscle damage or some degree of motor dysfunctions to evaluate the proposed controller in tracking a moving target, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed control.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we study the multiroute job shop scheduling problem with continuous-limited output buffers (MRJSP-CLOBs). In contrast to the standard job shop scheduling problem (JSP), continuous-limited output buffers render the commonly used graph-based approaches inapplicable, and the multiroute issue further increases computational complexity. To this end, we formulate MRJSP-CLOB as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP), which is typically NP-hard. Then, we extend the critical block in the JSP by utilizing the no-time-gap relationship and design a new neighborhood structure. Furthermore, we propose a hybrid artificial immune-simulated annealing algorithm (AIA-SA) by sharing iterations and integrating a random infeasible solution repairing algorithm with a new SA acceptance rule, which enables individuals to share information and increases the robustness of the corresponding SA parameters. Finally, the AIA-SA is compared with CPLEX and state-of-the-art algorithms on MRJSP-CLOB with different sizes. Experiments for large-sized instances demonstrate that our algorithm requires less than 3\% computing time of the CPLEX, while being faster and more accurate than the other algorithms.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates a wireless-powered mobile edge computing (MEC) system, where the service provider (SP) provides the device owner (DO) with both computing resources and energy to execute tasks from Internet-of-Things devices. In this system, SP first sets the prices of computing resources and energy whereas DO then makes the optimal response according to the given prices. In order to jointly optimize the prices of computing resources and energy, we formulate a bilevel optimization problem (BOP), in which the upper level generates the prices of computing resources and energy for SP and then under the given prices, the lower level optimizes the mode selection, broadcast power, and computing resource allocation for DO. This BOP is difficult to address due to the mixed variables at the lower level. To this end, we first derive the relationships between the optimal broadcast power and the mode selection and between the optimal computing resource allocation and the mode selection. After that, it is only necessary to consider the discrete variables (i.e., mode selection) at the lower level. Note, however, that the transformed BOP is still difficult to solve because of the extremely large search space. To solve the transformed BOP, we propose a divide-and-conquer bilevel optimization algorithm (called DACBO). Based on device status, task information, and available resources, DACBO first groups tasks into three independent small-size sets. Afterward, analytical methods are devised for the first two sets. As for the last one, we develop a nested bilevel optimization algorithm that uses differential evolution and variable neighborhood search (VNS) at the upper and lower levels, respectively. In addition, a greedy method is developed to quickly construct a good initial solution for VNS. The effectiveness of DACBO is verified on a set of instances by comparing with other algorithms.},

These days, deep learning (DL) methods have achieved conspicuous performance in the CD of VHR images. Nonetheless, most of the existing CD models based on DL require annotated training samples. In this article, a novel unsupervised model, called kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) convolution, is proposed for extracting representative features from multitemporal VHR images. Based on the KPCA convolution, an unsupervised deep siamese KPCA convolutional mapping network (KPCA-MNet) is designed for binary and multiclass CD. In the KPCA-MNet, the high-level spatial–spectral feature maps are extracted by a deep siamese network consisting of weight-shared KPCA convolutional layers. Then, the change information in the feature difference map is mapped into a 2-D polar domain. Finally, the CD results are generated by threshold segmentation and clustering algorithms. All procedures of KPCA-MNet do not require labeled data. The theoretical analysis and experimental results in two binary CD datasets and one multiclass CD datasets demonstrate the validity, robustness, and potential of the proposed method.},

The NIIOs include the communication delays and fading observations, where the fading observations are modeled by a set of mutually independent random variables. Moreover, the possible bias is taken into account, which is depicted by a dynamical equation. A predictive scheme is proposed to compensate for the influences induced by the communication delays, where the predictive-based estimation mechanism is adopted to replace the delayed estimation transmissions. This article focuses on the problems of estimation method design and performance discussions for addressed DTVCNs with NIIOs and dynamical bias. In particular, a new distributed state estimation approach is presented, where a locally minimized upper bound is obtained for the estimation error covariance matrix and a recursive way is designed to determine the estimator gain matrix. Furthermore, the performance evaluation criteria regarding the monotonicity are proposed from the analytic perspective. Finally, some experimental comparisons are proposed to show the validity and advantages of the new DCBSE approach.},

We formulate the estimation problem as a dynamic generalized group Lasso problem and develop a class of smoothing-and-splitting methods to solve it. The Levenberg–Marquardt iterated extended Kalman smoother-based multiblock alternating direction method of multipliers (LM-IEKS-mADMMs) algorithms are based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMMs) framework. This leads to minimization subproblems with an inherent structure to which three new augmented recursive smoothers are applied. Our methods can deal with large-scale problems without preprocessing for dimensionality reduction. Moreover, the methods allow one to solve nonsmooth nonconvex optimization problems. We then prove that under mild conditions, the proposed methods converge to a stationary point of the optimization problem. By simulated and real-data experiments, including multisensor range measurement problems, marine vessel tracking, autonomous vehicle tracking, and audio signal restoration, we show the practical effectiveness of the proposed methods.},

  abstract     = {Matrix completion, in essence, involves recovering a low-rank matrix from a subset of its entries. Most existing methods for matrix completion neglect two significant issues. First, in several practical applications, such as collaborative filtering, some samples may be corrupted completely. However, most of the robust algorithms consider only the condition that a few components of each column have been arbitrarily contaminated. Second, many real data are not static in nature. Nevertheless, the conventional batch-based matrix completion methods cannot efficiently deal with the out-of-sample, that is, the vector completion problem. In this article, we first provide a novel robust matrix completion model and then develop an efficient optimization method that only requires conducting one time singular value decomposition for a thin matrix per iteration. Furthermore, by exploiting the essence of online matrix completion algorithms, we develop a vector completion model which can help users predict the missing values of out of sample. Numerical comparisons with traditional batch-based and online matrix completion algorithms demonstrate the benefits of the proposed method on streaming data corrupted by column outliers. Moreover, we show that our model can be used to detect outliers from incomplete information. This advantage is validated via numerous experimental results on synthetic and real-world data.},

A significant challenge in DRL-based recommender systems is the large action space required to represent a variety of items. The large action space weakens the sampling efficiency and thereby, affects the recommendation accuracy. In this article, we propose a DRL-based method called deep hierarchical category-based recommender system (DHCRS) to handle the large action space problem. In DHCRS, categories of items are used to reconstruct the original flat action space into a two-level category-item hierarchy. DHCRS uses two deep $Q$ -networks (DQNs): 1) a high-level DQN for selecting a category and 2) a low-level DQN to choose an item in this category for the recommendation. Hence, the action space of each DQN is significantly reduced. Furthermore, the categorization of items helps capture the users’ preferences more effectively. We also propose a bidirectional category selection (BCS) technique, which explicitly considers the category-item relationships. The experiments show that DHCRS can significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods in terms of hit rate and normalized discounted cumulative gain for long-term recommendations.},

  abstract     = {Person reidentification (Re-ID) aims at recognizing the same identity across different camera views. However, the cross resolution of images [high resolution (HR) and low resolution (LR)] is unavoidable in a realistic scenario due to the various distances among cameras and pedestrians of interest, thus leading to cross-resolution person Re-ID problems. Recently, most cross-resolution person Re-ID methods focus on solving the resolution mismatch problem, while the distribution mismatch between HR and LR images is another factor that significantly impacts the person Re-ID performance. In this article, we propose a dually distribution pulling network (DDPN) to tackle the distribution mismatch problem. DDPN is composed of two modules, that is: 1) super-resolution module and 2) person Re-ID module. They attempt to pull the distribution of LR images closer to the distribution of HR images from image and feature aspects, respectively, through optimizing the maximum mean discrepancy losses. Extensive experiments have been conducted on three benchmark datasets and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of DDPN. Remarkably, DDPN shows a great advantage when compared to the state-of-the-art methods, for instance, we achieve rank-1 accuracy of 76.9\% on VR-Market1501, which outperforms the best existing cross-resolution person Re-ID method by 10\%.},

Under such a platoon setting, this article aims to accomplish secure distributed platoon formation tracking with the desired longitudinal spacing and the same velocities and accelerations guided by the leader regardless of the simultaneous presence of nonlinearities, uncertainties, and DoS attacks. First, a new logical data packet processor is developed on each vehicle to identify the intermittent DoS attacks via verifying the time-stamps of the received data packets. Then, a scalable distributed neural-network-based adaptive control design approach is proposed to achieve secure platooning control. It is proved that under the established design procedure, the vehicle state estimation errors and platoon tracking errors can be regulated to reside in small neighborhoods around zero. Finally, comparative simulation studies are provided to substantiate the effectiveness and merits of the proposed control design approach on maintaining the desired platooning performance and attack tolerance.},

The two-phase design procedure can produce a coherent and well-running HACS by sophisticatedly and properly determining the six elements of the HACS and their influences. In the verification phase of GET-MAN, by applying the formalized HACS framework proposed in Part I, a formal model can be constructed to look ahead (predict) and back (explain) at potential faults in the candidate HACS. An example of the HACS design for target searching is employed to illustrate the use of the GET-MAN design procedure. The potential challenges and future research directions are discussed in the light of the GET-MAN design procedure. The systematic analysis framework, Part I, as well as the GET-MAN design procedure, Part II, can serve as common guidance and reference for analyzing and developing various HACSs.},

  abstract     = {To accurately predict the regional spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection, this study proposes a novel hybrid model, which combines a long short-term memory (LSTM) artificial recurrent neural network with dynamic behavioral models. Several factors and control strategies affect the virus spread, and the uncertainty arising from confounding variables underlying the spread of the COVID-19 infection is substantial. The proposed model considers the effect of multiple factors to enhance the accuracy in predicting the number of cases and deaths across the top ten most-affected countries at the time of the study. The results show that the proposed model closely replicates the test data, such that not only it provides accurate predictions but it also replicates the daily behavior of the system under uncertainty. The hybrid model outperforms the LSTM model while accounting for data limitation. The parameters of the hybrid models are optimized using a genetic algorithm for each country to improve the prediction power while considering regional properties. Since the proposed model can accurately predict the short-term to medium-term daily spreading of the COVID-19 infection, it is capable of being used for policy assessment, planning, and decision making.},

  abstract     = {This work proposes a novel event-triggered exponential supertwisting algorithm (ESTA) for path tracking of a mobile robot. The proposed work is divided into three parts. In the first part, a fractional-order sliding surface-based exponential supertwisting event-triggered controller has been proposed. Fractional-order sliding surface improves the transient response, and the exponential supertwisting reaching law reduces the reaching phase time and eliminates the chattering. The event-triggering condition is derived using the Lipschitz method for minimum actuator utilization, and the interexecution time between two events is derived. In the second part, a fault estimator is designed to estimate the actuator fault using the Lyapunov stability theory. Furthermore, it is shown that in the presence of matched and unmatched uncertainty, event-trigger-based controller performance degrades. Hence, in the third part, an integral sliding-mode controller (ISMC) has been clubbed with the event-trigger ESTA for filtering of the uncertainties. It is also shown that when fault estimator-based ESTA is clubbed with ISMC, then the robustness of the controller increases, and the tracking performance improves. This novel technique is robust toward uncertainty and fault, offers finite-time convergence, reduces chattering, and offers minimum resource utilization. Simulations and experimental studies are carried out to validate the advantages of the proposed controller over the existing methods.},

It is shown that for the proposed consensus scheme, even when the gains are nonidentical, consensus results within a finite time, provided all the gains are positive or even if one gain is negative, subject to a lower bound. An algorithm is presented to compute the consensus value and consensus time for a given set of positive gains and initial states of the agents. The set of values, where consensus can occur, by varying the gains, has been derived and a second algorithm aids in determining the positive gains that enable consensus at any point in the aforementioned set, at a given finite time. As an application, the finite-time consensus in line-of-sight rates, over a cycle digraph, for a group of interceptors is shown to be effective in ensuring co-operative collision-free interception of a target, for both constant speed as well as realistic time-varying-speed models of the interceptors.

  abstract     = {Many deep-learning methods have been developed for fault diagnosis. However, due to the difficulty of collecting and labeling machine fault data, the datasets in some practical applications are relatively much smaller than the other big data benchmarks. In addition, the fault data come from different machines. Therefore, on some occasions, fault diagnosis is a multidomain problem with small data, where satisfactory transfer performance is difficult to obtain and has been rarely explored from the few-shot learning viewpoint. Different from the existing deep transfer learning solutions, a novel transfer relation network (TRN), combining a few-shot learning mechanism and transfer learning, is developed in this study. Specifically, the fault diagnosis problem has been treated as a similarity metric-learning problem instead of solely feature weighted classification. A feature net and a relation net have been, respectively, constructed for feature extraction and relation computation. The Siamese structure has been borrowed to extract the features of the source and the target domain samples with shared weights. Multikernel maximum mean discrepancy (MK-MMD) is employed on several higher layers with different tradeoff parameters to enable an efficient domain feature transfer considering different feature properties. To implement efficient diagnosis based on small data, an episode-based few-shot training strategy is adopted to train TRN. Average pooling has been adopted to suppress the noise influence from the vibration sequence which turns out to be important for the success of time sequence-based fault diagnosis. Transfer experiments on four datasets have verified the superior performance of TRN. A significant improvement of classification accuracy has been made compared with the state-of-the-art methods on the adopted datasets.},

The purpose of the optimal output regulation problem is to guarantee the stability of the closed-loop system and disturbance rejection, as well by minimizing some predefined performance indices. It can be realized by using an optimal controller, in which both optimal feedback control gain and optimal feedforward control gain are included. First, an adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) technique is used to solve the optimal feedback control gain. Next, the unknown system matrices of the plant are explicitly computed. In addition, based on the property of the minimal polynomial, the coefficient of the exogenous disturbance in the expression of the regulated output can also be calculated. Finally, according to the regulator equation, an extra cost function is given, which aims to obtain the optimal feedforward control gain. The linear vector space optimization methods are used to solve the optimal problem. As a result, the linear optimal output regulation problem can be solved by the approximately optimal feedback and feedforward control gains.},

The proposed switching signal guarantees the solvability of the $H_{\infty }$ adaptive tracking problem for uncertain switched systems. Significantly, it provides plenty of adjusting time for the adaptive tracking control strategy to damp the transient caused by switching and avoids frequent switching. A novel time-driven adaptive switching controller is established such that the tracking error asymptotically converges to zero and all the signals in the error dynamic system are bounded under an achieved disturbance attenuation level. The solvability criterion ensuring an $H_{\infty }$ adaptive tracking performance is established for the uncertain switched systems, where the solvability of the $H_{\infty }$ adaptive tracking problem for individual subsystems is not required.

In this work, we present a novel sequential recommendation model, called multivariate Hawkes process embedding with attention (MHPE-a), which combines a temporal point process with the attention mechanism to predict the items that the target user may interact with according to her/his historical records. Specifically, the proposed approach MHPE-a can model users’ sequential patterns in their temporal interaction sequences accurately with a multivariate Hawkes process. Then, we perform an accurate sequential recommendation to satisfy target users’ real-time requirements based on their preferences obtained with MHPE-a from their historical records. Especially, an attention mechanism is used to leverage users’ long/short-term preferences adaptively to achieve an accurate sequential recommendation. Extensive experiments are conducted on two real-world datasets (lastfm and gowalla), and the results show that MHPE-a achieves better performance than state-of-the-art baselines.},

When the variation of the discrete-time delay is further considered, the constant matrix involved in the quadratic term is extended to be a delay-dependent one. All these innovations make a contribution to a quadratic function with respect to the delay from the forward differences of L–K functionals. Consequently, tractable stability criteria are derived that are shown to be more relaxed than existing results via numerical examples.},

This article attempts to provide an answer from the viewpoint of consensus robustness against uncertain delay. We consider robust consensus of second-order unstable agents under PID feedback protocols, subject to a constant but unknown time delay over an undirected graph. The issue concerns the so-called delay consensus margin (DCM), which is the largest delay range within which robust consensus can be achieved. The specific problem under study investigates the role of integral control on the robust consensus, seeking to understand whether integral control can be employed to enhance consensus robustness. Our result shows that there is none; that is, in a PID protocol, the integral control action has no improving effect on the DCM, and that PID and proportional-derivative (PD) protocols achieve the same DCM. As a byproduct of this finding, the DCM under PID and PD protocols is found to be computable by solving a quasiconcave, albeit nonsmooth, unimodal optimization problem.},

Most existing collision-avoidance methods mainly focus on a single WMR and environmental obstacles. There are few products that cast light on the collision-avoidance between multiple WMRs (MWMRs). In this article, the problem of simultaneous collision-avoidance and target tracking is investigated for MWMRs working in the shared environment from the perspective of optimization. The collision-avoidance strategy is formulated as an inequality constraint, which has proven to be collision free between the MWMRs. The designed MWMRs control scheme integrates path following, collision-avoidance, and WMR velocity compliance, in which the path following task is chosen as the secondary task, and collision-avoidance is the primary task so that safety can be guaranteed in advance. A Lagrangian-based dynamic controller is constructed for the dominating behavior of the MWMRs. Combining theoretical analyses and experiments, the feasibility of the designed control scheme for the MWMRs is substantiated. Experimental results show that if obstacles do not threaten the safety of the WMR, the top priority in the control task is the target track task. All robots move along the desired trajectory. Once the collision criterion is satisfied, the collision-avoidance mechanism is activated and prominent in the controller. Under the proposed scheme, all robots achieve the target tracking on the premise of being collision free.},

  abstract     = {Detecting small low-contrast targets in the airspace is an essential and challenging task. This article proposes a simple and effective data-driven support vector machine (SVM)-based spatiotemporal feature fusion detection method for small low-contrast targets. We design a novel pixel-level feature, called a spatiotemporal profile, to depict the discontinuity of each pixel in the spatial and temporal domains The spatiotemporal profile is a local patch of the spatiotemporal feature maps concatenated by the spatial feature maps and temporal feature maps in channelwise, which are generated by the morphological black-hat filter and a ghost-free dark-focusing frame difference methods, respectively. Instead of the handcrafted feature fusion mechanisms in previous works, we use the labeled spatiotemporal profiles to train an SVM classifier to learn the spatiotemporal feature fusion mechanism automatically. To speed up detection for high-resolution videos, the serial SVM classification process on central processing units (CPUs) is reformed as parallel convolution operations on graphics processing unit (GPUs), which exhibits over 1000+ times speedup in our real experiments. Finally, blob analysis is applied to generate final detection results. Elaborate experiments are conducted, and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method performs better than 12 baseline methods for the small low-contrast target detection. The field tests manifest that the parallel implementation of the proposed method can realize real-time detection at 15.3 FPS for videos at a resolution of $2048\times 1536$ and the maximum detection distance can reach 1 km for drones in sunny weather.},

It is also constrained via a constraint index. Based on the activation probabilities and transition probabilities of subsystems, the stabilizations in terms of the $p$ th moment exponential stability and almost exponential stability are achieved, respectively, by the ETIC with constraints. Moreover, based on the scheme of ETIC with constraints, sampling-based ETIC and random ETIC are proposed, respectively. The stabilization conditions via sampling-based ETIC and random ETIC are also derived. It is shown that the ETIC with constraints is non-Zeno and robust with respect to time delays and can achieve lower impulse frequency than the classic time-based impulsive control and recent ETIC schemes. Finally, two examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the ETIC with constraints.},

  abstract     = {For sequence classification, an important issue is to find discriminative features, where sequential pattern mining (SPM) is often used to find frequent patterns from sequences as features. To improve classification accuracy and pattern interpretability, contrast pattern mining emerges to discover patterns with high-contrast rates between different categories. To date, existing contrast SPM methods face many challenges, including excessive parameter selection and inefficient occurrences counting. To tackle these issues, this article proposes a top- $k$ self-adaptive contrast SPM, which adaptively adjusts the gap constraints to find top- $k$ self-adaptive contrast patterns (SCPs) from positive and negative sequences. One of the key tasks of the mining problem is to calculate the support (the number of occurrences) of a pattern in each sequence. To support efficient counting, we store all occurrences of a pattern in a special array in a Nettree, an extended tree structure with multiple roots and multiple parents. We employ the array to calculate the occurrences of all its superpatterns with one-way scanning to avoid redundant calculation. Meanwhile, because the contrast SPM problem does not satisfy the Apriori property, we propose Zero and Less strategies to prune candidate patterns and a Contrast-first mining strategy to select patterns with the highest contrast rate as the prefix subpattern and calculate the contrast rate of all its superpatterns. Experiments validate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm and show that contrast patterns significantly outperform frequent patterns for sequence classification.

  abstract     = {In this article, we show how to obtain all of the Pareto optimal decision vectors and solutions for the finite horizon indefinite mean-field stochastic cooperative linear-quadratic (LQ) difference game. First, the equivalence between the solvability of the introduced $\mathcal {N}$ coupled generalized difference Riccati equations (GDREs) and the solvability of the multiobjective optimization problem is established. However, it is difficult to obtain Pareto optimal decision vectors based on the $\mathcal {N}$ coupled GDREs because the optimal joint strategy adopted by all players to optimize the performance criterion of some players in the game is different from the strategies of other players, which rely on the weighted matrices of cost functionals that may be different among players. Second, a necessary and sufficient condition is developed to guarantee the convexity of the costs, which makes the weighting technique not only sufficient but also necessary for searching Pareto optimal decision vectors. It is then shown that the mean-field Pareto optimality algorithm (MF-POA) is presented to identify, in principle, all of the Pareto optimal decision vectors and solutions via the solutions to the weighted coupled GDREs and the weighted coupled generalized difference Lyapunov equations (GDLEs), respectively. Finally, a cooperative network security game is reported to illustrate the results presented. Simulation results validate the solvability, correctness, and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Cross-modal retrieval has attracted considerable attention for searching in large-scale multimedia databases because of its efficiency and effectiveness. As a powerful tool of data analysis, matrix factorization is commonly used to learn hash codes for cross-modal retrieval, but there are still many shortcomings. First, most of these methods only focus on preserving locality of data but they ignore other factors such as preserving reconstruction residual of data during matrix factorization. Second, the energy loss of data is not considered when the data of cross-modal are projected into a common semantic space. Third, the data of cross-modal are directly projected into a unified semantic space which is not reasonable since the data from different modalities have different properties. This article proposes a novel method called average approximate hashing (AAH) to address these problems by: 1) integrating the locality and residual preservation into a graph embedding framework by using the label information; 2) projecting data from different modalities into different semantic spaces and then making the two spaces approximate to each other so that a unified hash code can be obtained; and 3) introducing a principal component analysis (PCA)-like projection matrix into the graph embedding framework to guarantee that the projected data can preserve the main energy of data. AAH obtains the final hash codes by using an average approximate strategy, that is, using the mean of projected data of different modalities as the hash codes. Experiments on standard databases show that the proposed AAH outperforms several state-of-the-art cross-modal hashing methods.},

Disassembly line balancing becomes an important and challenging issue. The disassembly efficiencies of workers are different in the actual disassembly line due to some factors, including disassembly environment, skill level, work enthusiasm, etc. However, efficiency differences are often ignored in previous studies, which ultimately lead to unbalanced workloads among stations. Therefore, this article establishes a disassembly line balancing model that considers workers with different efficiencies and introduces the bucket brigade model into the disassembly line. Its optimization objectives include workload smoothness, cost of workers, disassembly risk, and disassembly demand. To obtain high-quality solutions, a discrete flower pollination algorithm based on problem characteristics is proposed. The performance of the proposed algorithm is verified by comparing it with 11 algorithms. Finally, the proposed model and algorithm are applied to an actual television disassembly case considering workers with different efficiencies, and provide decision makers with multiple disassembly schemes.},

Most existing methods assume that different views are linear transformable or merely sampling from a common latent space. Such rigid assumptions betray reality, thus leading to unsatisfactory performance. To tackle the issue, we propose to learn both common and specific sampling spaces for each view to fully exploit their collaborative representations. The common space corresponds to the universal self-representation basis for all views, while the specific spaces are the view-specific basis accordingly. An iterative self-supervision scheme is conducted to strengthen the learned affinity matrix. The clustering is modeled by a convex optimization. We first solve its linear formulation by the popular scheme. Then, we employ the deep autoencoder structure to exploit its deep nonlinear formulation. The extensive experimental results on six real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed model achieves uniform superiority over the benchmark methods.},

In addition, the constraints existing in most practical engineering are the source of reducing control performance and causing the system instability. The main limitation of current barrier Lyapunov functions is the feasibility conditions for intermediate controllers. The nonlinear mappings are used to achieve the satisfaction of full-state constraints directly and avoid feasibility conditions for intermediate controllers.

  abstract     = {Deep learning techniques have been widely applied to hyperspectral image (HSI) classification and have achieved great success. However, the deep neural network model has a large parameter space and requires a large number of labeled data. Deep learning methods for HSI classification usually follow a patchwise learning framework. Recently, a fast patch-free global learning (FPGA) architecture was proposed for HSI classification according to global spatial context information. However, FPGA has difficulty in extracting the most discriminative features when the sample data are imbalanced. In this article, a spectral-spatial-dependent global learning (SSDGL) framework based on the global convolutional long short-term memory (GCL) and global joint attention mechanism (GJAM) is proposed for insufficient and imbalanced HSI classification. In SSDGL, the hierarchically balanced (H-B) sampling strategy and the weighted softmax loss are proposed to address the imbalanced sample problem. To effectively distinguish similar spectral characteristics of land cover types, the GCL module is introduced to extract the long short-term dependency of spectral features. To learn the most discriminative feature representations, the GJAM module is proposed to extract attention areas. The experimental results obtained with three public HSI datasets show that the SSDGL has powerful performance in insufficient and imbalanced sample problems and is superior to other state-of-the-art methods.},

Specifically, we propose to use the low-dimensional manifold to represent the subdomain, and align the local data distribution discrepancy in each manifold across domains. A manifold maximum mean discrepancy (M3D) is developed to measure the local distribution discrepancy in each manifold. We then propose a general framework, called transfer with manifolds discrepancy alignment (TMDA), to couple the discovery of data manifolds with the minimization of M3D. We instantiate TMDA in the subspace learning case considering both the linear and nonlinear mappings. We also instantiate TMDA in the deep learning framework.

Stage IV computes other SEPs (i.e., LOSs) in corresponding SRs. A theoretical foundation for both stages II and III is developed, and these theoretical results are quite general on their own. The proposed method is numerically evaluated to compute multiple LOSs. For instance, a total of 5085 LOSs have been computed by the proposed Trust-Tech source point method on a 50-D test function.

To derive solutions to these optimal control problems, we first present the related Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equations (HJBEs). Then, we develop a novel critic learning method to solve these HJBEs. To implement the newly developed critic learning approach, we only use critic neural networks (NNs) and tune their weight vectors via the combination of a modified gradient descent method and concurrent learning. By using the present critic learning method, we not only remove the restriction of initial admissible control but also relax the persistence-of-excitation condition. After that, we employ Lyapunov’s direct method to demonstrate that the critic NNs’ weight estimation error and the states of closed-loop auxiliary systems are stable in the sense of uniform ultimate boundedness. Finally, we separately provide a nonlinear-interconnected plant and an unstable interconnected power system to validate the present critic learning approach.},

The computation and time costing property in NAS also means that we should not start from scratch to search, but make every attempt to reuse the existing knowledge. In this article, we discuss what kind of knowledge in a model can and should be used for a new architecture design. Then, we propose a new NAS algorithm, namely, ModuleNet, which can fully inherit knowledge from the existing convolutional neural networks. To make full use of the existing models, we decompose existing models into different modules, which also keep their weights, consisting of a knowledge base. Then, we sample and search for a new architecture according to the knowledge base. Unlike previous search algorithms, and benefiting from inherited knowledge, our method is able to directly search for architectures in the macrospace by the NSGA-II algorithm without tuning parameters in these modules. Experiments show that our strategy can efficiently evaluate the performance of a new architecture even without tuning weights in convolutional layers. With the help of knowledge we inherited, our search results can always achieve better performance on various datasets (CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet) over original architectures.},

First, an intermittent estimator is designed to track the undetectable status of HSTs in response to only partial information available due to sensor failures. Then, two different stability criteria are developed by adopting two different Lyapunov function strategies. Simultaneously, in order to reduce the control cost and accelerate the convergence time, two different algorithms are designed. It is worth emphasizing that different from the existing results of HST subject to actuator fault, this article adopts a more flexible fault representation mode, namely, semi-Markov switching mode, which is more in line with the practical background and has a higher valuable application. Especially, the Lyapunov function designed in this article can drive the system state to decrease monotonically in both the “working interval” and the “rest interval,” so as to avoid the phenomenon of state impulsive jump. Finally, through the test of HST experimental value of Japan’s Shinkansen, the simulation results show the effectiveness and rationality of the proposed control method and also make a comparative analysis with related works, to prove the advantages of the control technology proposed in this article.},

The problem is converted into a time-varying noncooperative game and then a distributed Nash equilibrium-seeking algorithm is designed based on a distributed observer method.

Considering the fact that the controller is fuzzy and the threshold can promptly update its state according to the current and latest sampled signals (SSs), it becomes quite challenging to solve the dissipative stabilization problem (DSP) with the existing schemes. Then, a novel FAETC protocol is put forward to reduce the utilization of communication resources while maintaining the desired control performance. By employing the fuzzy-logic technique and the looped Lyapunov functional (LLF) approach, sufficient conditions related to the relationship between the stabilization and desired dissipative performance for the resulting system are formulated.

When the topology of a network is directed, two different types of adaptive algorithms are developed to achieve synchronization in a fully distributed manner, where the coupling strength of each node is designed to be either the sum or product of two non-negative scalar functions. The fully distributed leaderless synchronization of a directed network is investigated in a leader–follower framework, where the leader subnetwork is analyzed by using the techniques from constrained Rayleigh quotients and the follower subnetwork is addressed by employing the properties of nonsingular $M$ -matrices.

The first two parts are designed to achieve target circling and spacing adjustment, respectively. The last part is designed discontinuously to compensate for the unknown bounded velocity of the target. Due to the discontinuously distributed controller, sufficient conditions are given by a nonsmooth analysis.

First, considering that the system and controller modes could not be perfectly synchronized all the time, we study possible cases of mode mismatching by exploiting the average dwell time (ADT) switching strategy. Since the fact that a minimum dwell time of each subsystem is not required in the ADT switching rule, multiple system switching is allowed within one sampling interval, which overcomes the limitation of at most once switching during any sampling interval in existing works. Second, the asynchronous premise variables between the fuzzy system and fuzzy controller are taken into consideration in the quantized sampled-data control scheme. Then, by virtue of the Lyapunov function approach, we obtain sufficient conditions to guarantee that the asynchronously switched T–S fuzzy system is exponentially stable with quantized sampled-data input. Furthermore, the weighted $L_{2}$ -gain is discussed for the system under external disturbance, and an $H_{\infty }$ state feedback controller is correspondingly designed with prescribed disturbance attenuation.

In our work, a novel attack model is developed, based on which the attacker can launch strictly stealthy or $\epsilon $ -stealthy attacks. To remain strictly stealthy, the attacker only needs to solve an off-line semidefinite program problem. In such a case, the attack performance is optimal but limited. To achieve a higher desired attack effect than that of the strictly stealthy attack, the attacker sometimes needs to sacrifice the stealthy level. Thus, the $\epsilon $ -stealthy attack is analyzed, where an upper bound of the optimal attack performance is obtained by solving a convex optimization problem. Then, an optimal $\epsilon $ -stealthy attack is designed to achieve the upper bound, which differs from the existing suboptimal $\epsilon $ -stealthy attack for the considered LQG systems.

Multiple permutation-based operators are employed in the mutation and local search process under the genetic evolution framework and learning framework, respectively. Besides, a hybrid initialization method and an adaptive replacement strategy are put forward. Moreover, a restart strategy is developed to rebuild the population to maintain the genetic diversity. Twenty-five random test instances are produced to validate the effectiveness of the proposed MA. The results of computational experiments and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test demonstrate that these JASR instances can be well handled by the proposed adaptive MA, and the proposed MA is able to provide remarkably better decision schemes for the majority of the test instances than the prevailing solution methods.},

  abstract     = {This article is concerned with the energy-to-peak state estimation problem for a class of linear discrete-time systems with energy-bounded noises and intermittent measurement outliers (IMOs). In order to capture the intermittent nature, two sequences of step functions are introduced to model the occurrence of the IMOs. Furthermore, two special indices (i.e., minimum and maximum interval lengths) are adopted to describe the “occurrence frequency” of IMOs. Different from the considered energy-bounded noises, the outliers are assumed to have their magnitudes larger than certain thresholds. In order to achieve a satisfactory performance constraint on the energy-to-peak state estimation under the addressed kind of measurement outliers, a novel parameter-dependent (PD) state estimation strategy is developed to guarantee that the measurements contaminated by outliers would be removed in the estimation process. The proposed PD state estimation method is essentially a two-step process, where the first step is to examine the appearing and disappearing moments for each IMO by using a dedicatedly constructed outlier detection scheme, and the second step is to implement the state estimation task according to the outlier detection results. Sufficient conditions are obtained to ensure the existence of the desired estimator, and the gain matrix of the desired estimator is then derived by solving a constrained optimization problem. Finally, a simulation example is presented to illustrate the effectiveness of our developed PD state estimation strategy.},

  abstract     = {In this article, the unsupervised domain adaptation problem, where an approximate inference model is to be learned from a labeled dataset and expected to generalize well on an unlabeled dataset, is considered. Unlike the existing work, we explicitly unveil the importance of the latent variables produced by the feature extractor, that is, encoder, where contains the most representative information about their input samples, for the knowledge transfer. We argue that an estimator of the representation of the two datasets can be used as an agent for knowledge transfer. To be specific, a novel variational inference approach is proposed to approximate a latent distribution from the unlabeled dataset that can be used to accurately predict its input samples. It is demonstrated that the discriminative knowledge of the latent distribution that is learned from the labeled dataset can be progressively transferred to that is learned from the unlabeled dataset by simultaneously optimizing the estimator via the variational inference and our proposed regularization for shifting the mean of the estimator. The experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods for both object classification and digit classification.},

More specifically, the threshold parameter in the triggering condition is dynamically adjusted over time according to the vehicular data variations, the dynamic threshold updating laws, and the bandwidth occupancy indication. Second, a unified platooning control framework is established to account for various spacing policies, randomly switching communication topologies, unknown leader control input, and external disturbances. Then, a new scheduling and platooning control co-design approach is presented such that the controlled vehicular platoon can successfully track the leader vehicle under random communication topologies and different spacing policies, including constant spacing, constant time headway spacing, and variable time headway spacing, meanwhile maintaining efficient bandwidth-aware resource management.

To be specific, all agents finally have the same output moduli at each time instant over the desired finite-time interval, which overcomes the influences caused by the antagonisms among agents and topology nonrepetitiveness along the iteration axis.

This article focuses on the adaptive motion generation of fast goal-oriented motion on the musculoskeletal system by implementing the speed–accuracy tradeoff (SAT) in a hierarchical motion learning framework. First, we introduce Fitts’ Law into the modified basal ganglia circuit-inspired iterative decision-making model for achieving dynamic and adaptive decision making. Then, as a time constraint, the decision is decomposed into a series of supervised terms by the proposed striatal FSI-SPN interneuron circuit-inspired velocity modulator to implement the tradeoff smoothly on the musculoskeletal system. Finally, an improved policy gradient algorithm is suggested to generate the muscle excitations of the modulated motion via the proposed muscle co-contraction policy, which promotes general cooperation between flexor and extensor muscles. In experiments, a redundant musculoskeletal arm model is trained to perform the adaptive quick pointing movements. By combining the muscle co-contraction policy with SAT, our algorithm shows the most efficient training and the best performance in the adaptive motion generation among the other three popular reinforcement learning algorithms on the musculoskeletal model.},

In this article, a triangle tethered formation system is modeled, and an exact stable condition for the system’s maintaining is carefully analyzed, which is given as the desired trajectories; then, a new control scheme is designed for its spinning deployment and stable maintenance. In the proposed scheme, a novel second-order sliding mode controller is given with a designed nonsingular sliding-variable. Based on the theoretical proof, the addressed sliding variable from the arbitrary initial condition can converge to the manifold in finite time, and then sliding to the equilibrium in finite time as well.

Because all of the existing cryptographers aim to protect the entire data (document and file) altogether, they cannot have camouflagibility to mislead data-mining robots. Conversely, by our proposed novel BCC, one can select arbitrary contexts or parts of the data (related to individual identify and/or private confidential information) under protection. To evaluate such a first-ever cryptographer capable of misleading data-mining robots, we define two new metrics, namely: 1) vulnerability and 2) camouflage rates. The theoretical analyses of vulnerability rate and camouflage rate for our proposed new BCC are also presented in this article to demonstrate the corresponding effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {Classic portfolio selection problems mainly focus on high-risk financial markets with tradeoffs between returns and risk. However, more risk-averse investors pursue long-term portfolio planning with the objectives of maximizing final returns and maximizing flexibility. This article addresses a new type of the portfolio problem, called periodic investment portfolio selection problems (PIPSPs), in which investors periodically allocate resources to financial products with different periods. A multiobjective model for PIPSPs is first presented. With a mechanism for utilizing the data generated during the implementation of multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs), a data-assisted MOEA (DA-MOEA) is proposed to solve PIPSPs. The main idea of a DA-MOEA is to combine a MOEA with a data-assisted process that consists of three components: 1) feature construction; 2) data fusion model development; and 3) obtained information utilization. To solve the addressed PIPSPs, two versions of DA-MOEAs with baselines of nondominated sorting and decomposition-based mechanisms are implemented, namely, the data-assisted NSGA-II (DA-NSGA-II) and data-assisted MOEA/D (DA-MOEA/D). In the developed DA-MOEAs for PIPSPs, a feature construction process and a data fusion model are well designed for mining data with different formats. To validate the algorithms, two sets of test instances are generated. The experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the data-assisted process. Furthermore, the effects of the algorithm components, such as the data source sizes, information types, and information utilization strategies, are investigated.},

In this article, we present a robust framework, which collaboratively utilizes patch-level and image-level annotations, for DR severity grading. By an end-to-end optimization, this framework can bidirectionally exchange the fine-grained lesion and image-level grade information. As a result, it exploits more discriminative features for DR grading. The proposed framework shows better performance than the recent state-of-the-art algorithms and three clinical ophthalmologists with over nine years of experience. By testing on datasets of different distributions (such as label and camera), we prove that our algorithm is robust when facing image quality and distribution variations that commonly exist in real-world practice. We inspect the proposed framework through extensive ablation studies to indicate the effectiveness and necessity of each motivation.

Unlike traditional methods that suffer from the repeated trial and error and slow convergence of iteration, this article proposes a new ABM calibration approach by establishing a link between agent microbehavioral parameters and systemic macro-observations. With the assumption that the agent behavior can be formulated as a high-order Markovian process, the new approach starts with a search for an optimal transfer probability through a macrostate transfer equation. Then, each agent’s microparameter values are computed using mean-field approximation, where his complex dependencies with others are approximated by an expected aggregate state. To compress the agent state space, principal component analysis is also introduced to avoid high dimensions of the macrostate transfer equation. The proposed method is validated in two scenarios: 1) population evolution and 2) urban travel demand analysis. Experimental results demonstrate that compared with the machine-learning surrogate and evolutionary optimization, our method can achieve higher accuracies with much lower computational complexities.},

  abstract     = {Hyperspectral anomaly target detection (also known as hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD)] is a technique aiming to identify samples with atypical spectra. Although some density estimation-based methods have been developed, they may suffer from two issues: 1) separated two-stage optimization with inconsistent objective functions makes the representation learning model fail to dig out characterization customized for HAD and 2) incapability of learning a low-dimensional representation that preserves the inherent information from the original high-dimensional spectral space. To address these problems, we propose a novel end-to-end local invariant autoencoding density estimation (E2E-LIADE) model. To satisfy the assumption on the manifold, the E2E-LIADE introduces a local invariant autoencoder (LIA) to capture the intrinsic low-dimensional manifold embedded in the original space. Augmented low-dimensional representation (ALDR) can be generated by concatenating the local invariant constrained by a graph regularizer and the reconstruction error. In particular, an end-to-end (E2E) multidistance measure, including mean-squared error (MSE) and orthogonal projection divergence (OPD), is imposed on the LIA with respect to hyperspectral data. More important, E2E-LIADE simultaneously optimizes the ALDR of the LIA and a density estimation network in an E2E manner to avoid the model being trapped in a local optimum, resulting in an energy map in which each pixel represents a negative log likelihood for the spectrum. Finally, a postprocessing procedure is conducted on the energy map to suppress the background. The experimental results demonstrate that compared to the state of the art, the proposed E2E-LIADE offers more satisfactory performance.},

  abstract     = {In the context of streaming data, learning algorithms often need to confront several unique challenges, such as concept drift, label scarcity, and high dimensionality. Several concept drift-aware data stream learning algorithms have been proposed to tackle these issues over the past decades. However, most existing algorithms utilize a supervised learning framework and require all true class labels to update their models. Unfortunately, in the streaming environment, requiring all labels is unfeasible and not realistic in many real-world applications. Therefore, learning data streams with minimal labels is a more practical scenario. Considering the problem of the curse of dimensionality and label scarcity, in this article, we present a new semisupervised learning technique for streaming data. To cure the curse of dimensionality, we employ a denoising autoencoder to transform the high-dimensional feature space into a reduced, compact, and more informative feature representation. Furthermore, we use a cluster-and-label technique to reduce the dependency on true class labels. We employ a synchronization-based dynamic clustering technique to summarize the streaming data into a set of dynamic microclusters that are further used for classification. In addition, we employ a disagreement-based learning method to cope with concept drift. Extensive experiments performed on many real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method compared to several state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Many methods for monitoring multivariate processes are built on principal component analysis (PCA), which, however, simply tells whether the process is faulty or not. In fact, there is still room for the improvement of the early detection performance by exploiting fully the information given by fault directions. To this end, this article proposes a novel directional PCA (diPCA) approach. First, by narrowing down faults to a specified direction or composite mutually orthogonal directions, diPCA can speed fault detection and facilitate accurate fault diagnosis. It also has good theoretical properties that guarantee concise control limits. Second, with appropriate fault directions, diPCA provides a unified framework for process monitoring and includes existing monitoring indices, such as Hotelling’s $T^{2}$ and the squared prediction error (SPE), as special cases. Third, diPCA also naturally results in a new combined monitoring statistic, which is composed of both $T^{2}$ and SPE, and provides an optimal ratio of their combination. The Monte Carlo simulation results have demonstrated the power of the proposed monitoring and diagnostic methods stemming from diPCA.

  abstract     = {As an effective optimization tool for expensive optimization problems (EOPs), surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) have been widely studied in recent years. However, most current SAEAs are designed for continuous/ combinatorial EOPs, which are not suitable for mixed-variable EOPs. This article focuses on one kind of mixed-variable EOP: EOPs with continuous and categorical variables (EOPCCVs). A multisurrogate-assisted ant colony optimization algorithm (MiSACO) is proposed to solve EOPCCVs. MiSACO contains two main strategies: 1) multisurrogate-assisted selection and 2) surrogate-assisted local search. In the former, the radial basis function (RBF) and least-squares boosting tree (LSBT) are employed as the surrogate models. Afterward, three selection operators (i.e., RBF-based selection, LSBT-based selection, and random selection) are devised to select three solutions from the offspring solutions generated by ACO, with the aim of coping with different types of EOPCCVs robustly and preventing the algorithm from being misled by inaccurate surrogate models. In the latter, sequence quadratic optimization, coupled with RBF, is utilized to refine the continuous variables of the best solution found so far. By combining these two strategies, MiSACO can solve EOPCCVs with limited function evaluations. Three sets of test problems and two real-world cases are used to verify the effectiveness of MiSACO. The results demonstrate that MiSACO performs well in solving EOPCCVs.},

A switched integral-based event-triggered scheme (IETS) is established to reduce the redundant data transmission over the networks. The switched IETS condition uses the integration of system states over a time period in the past. A fixed waiting time is included to avoid the Zeno behavior. In order to estimate a larger domain of attraction, a delay-dependent polytopic representation method is presented to deal with the effects of actuator saturation in the proposed model. A new series of less conservative linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) is proposed on the basis of delay-dependent Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional (LKF) to ensure the stability of nonlinear time-delay system subject to actuator saturation using the proposed IETS. Numerical examples are used to confirm the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed IETS approach.},

Both time-varying additive and multiplicative actuator faults are taken into account in the meantime. And the upper/lower bounds of actuator faults are not required to be known. First, the state observer is designed to settle the occurrence of unmeasurable system states. Two kinds of event-triggered mechanisms are then developed to schedule the interagent communication and controller updates. Next, with the developed event-triggered mechanisms, a novel observer-based bipartite adaptive control strategy is proposed such that the fault-tolerant control problem can be addressed. Compared with some related works on this topic, our control scheme can achieve the intermittent communication and intermittent controller updates, and the more general actuator faults and network topology are considered.

In this article, our primary objective is to minimize the makespan of a project. However, we also have secondary objectives, such as maximizing the free resources (FRs) and minimizing the deviation of activity finishing time. As the existence of FR may lead to a suboptimal solution, we propose a new operator for the evolutionary approach and two new heuristics to enhance the algorithm’s performance. The proposed methodology is tested and analyzed by solving a set of benchmark problems, with its results showing its superiority with respect to state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of the quality of the solutions obtained.},

In this article, a structural synaptic plasticity learning rule is proposed to train the weights and add or remove neurons within the reservoir, which is shown to be able to alleviate the instability of the synaptic plasticity, and to contribute to increase the memory capacity of the network as well. Our experimental results also reveal that a few stronger connections may last for a longer period of time in a constantly changing network structure, and are relatively resistant to decay or disruptions in the learning process. These results are consistent with the evidence observed in biological systems.

  abstract     = {For dynamic multiobjective optimization problems (DMOPs), it is challenging to track the varying Pareto-optimal front. Most traditional approaches estimate the Pareto-optimal sets in the decision space. However, the obtained solutions do not necessarily satisfy the desired properties of decision makers in the objective space. Inverse model-based algorithms have a great potential to solve such problems. Nonetheless, the existing ones have low precision for handling DMOPs with nonlinear correlations between the objective and decision vectors, which greatly limits the application of the inverse models. In this article, an inverse Gaussian process (IGP)-based prediction approach for solving DMOPs is proposed. Unlike most traditional approaches, this approach exploits the IGP to construct a predictor that maps the historical optimal solutions from the objective space to the decision space. A sampling mechanism is developed for generating sample points in the objective space. Then, the IGP-based predictor is employed to generate an effective initial population by using these sample points. The proposed method by introducing IGP can obtain solutions with better diversity and convergence in the objective space, which is more responsive to the demand of decision makers than the traditional methods. It also has better performance than other inverse model-based methods in solving nonlinear DMOPs. To investigate the performance of the proposed approach, experiments have been conducted on 23 benchmark problems and a real-world raw ore allocation problem in mineral processing. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can significantly improve the dynamic optimization performance and has certain practical significance for solving real-world DMOPs.},

Meanwhile, we apply the proposed scheme to the preparation of typical entangled states in multiqubit systems. In view of the convergence obstacle caused by the symmetric structure of the state space, especially in the case with degenerate observable operators, we first partition the state space into a subset containing the target state and its complement to distinguish the target state from its antipodal points, and then design the corresponding control laws in these two subsets, respectively, by using different Lyapunov functions. The interaction Hamiltonians are also constructed to drive the system state to the desired subset first, and further to the target state. In particular, the control law designed in the undesired subset guarantees the strictly monotonic descent of the corresponding Lyapunov function, which makes the system trajectory switch between the two subsets at most twice and has the potential to speed up the convergence process. We also prove the stability of the closed-loop system with the proposed switching control law based on the stochastic Lyapunov stability theory. By applying the proposed switching control scheme to a three-qubit system, we achieve the preparation of a GHZ state and a $W$ state.},

Second, two Bernoulli processes are introduced to represent the randomly happening packet dropouts in the unreliable network and the randomly occurring deception attacks on the actuator side from the adversaries. Third, under the assumption that the system states are unmeasurable, a multistep parameter-dependent model predictive controller is synthesized via optimizing one series of feedback laws for a given period of time, which leads to improved control performance than that of the one-step approach. Moreover, the results on the recursive feasibility and closed-loop stability related to the networked system are achieved, which explicitly consider the external disturbance and input constraint.

The proposed network incorporates density estimation but alleviates the constraint of the atmospheric model. The predicted haze density then guides the Laplacian pyramid decoder to generate a haze-free image in a coarse-to-fine fashion. In addition, we introduce a multiscale discriminator to preserve global and local consistency for dehazing.

  abstract     = {Remote sensing image data clustering is a tough task, which involves classifying the image without any prior information. Remote sensing image clustering, in essence, belongs to a complex optimization problem, due to the high dimensionality and complexity of remote sensing imagery. Therefore, it can be easily affected by the initial values and trapped in locally optimal solutions. Meanwhile, remote sensing images contain complex and diverse spatial-spectral information, which makes them difficult to model with only a single objective function. Although evolutionary multiobjective optimization methods have been presented for the clustering task, the tradeoff between the global and local search abilities is not well adjusted in the evolutionary process. In this article, in order to address these problems, a multiobjective sine cosine algorithm for remote sensing image data spatial-spectral clustering (MOSCA_SSC) is proposed. In the proposed method, the clustering task is converted into a multiobjective optimization problem, and the Xie-Beni (XB) index and Jeffries-Matusita (Jm) distance combined with the spatial information term (SI_Jm measure) are utilized as the objective functions. In addition, for the first time, the sine cosine algorithm (SCA), which can effectively adjust the local and global search capabilities, is introduced into the framework of multiobjective clustering for continuous optimization. Furthermore, the destination solution in the SCA is automatically selected and updated from the current Pareto front through employing the knee-point-based selection approach. The benefits of the proposed method were demonstrated by clustering experiments with ten UCI datasets and four real remote sensing image datasets.},

  abstract     = {For multimodal representation learning, traditional black-box approaches often fall short of extracting interpretable multilayer hidden structures, which contribute to visualize the connections between different modalities at multiple semantic levels. To extract interpretable multimodal latent representations and visualize the hierarchial semantic relationships between different modalities, based on deep topic models, we develop a novel multimodal Poisson gamma belief network (mPGBN) that tightly couples the observations of different modalities via imposing sparse connections between their modality-specific hidden layers. To alleviate the time-consuming Gibbs sampler adopted by traditional topic models in the testing stage, we construct a Weibull-based variational inference network (encoder) to directly map the observations to their latent representations, and further combine it with the mPGBN (decoder), resulting in a novel multimodal Weibull variational autoencoder (MWVAE), which is fast in out-of-sample prediction and can handle large-scale multimodal datasets. Qualitative evaluations on bimodal data consisting of image-text pairs show that the developed MWVAE can successfully extract expressive multimodal latent representations for downstream tasks like missing modality imputation and multimodal retrieval. Further extensive quantitative results demonstrate that both MWVAE and its supervised extension sMWVAE achieve state-of-the-art performance on various multimodal benchmarks.},

Lévy mutation is used in the CNO to avoid premature convergence by ensuring initial state diversity.

However, existing RL models simply aggregate node embeddings to generate the context embedding without taking into account the dynamic network structures, making them incapable of modeling the state transition and action selection dynamics. In this work, we develop a new attention-based RL model that provides enhanced node embeddings via batch normalization reordering and gate aggregation , as well as dynamic-aware context embedding through an attentive aggregation module on multiple relational structures. We conduct experiments on five types of VRPs: 1) travelling salesman problem (TSP); 2) capacitated VRP (CVRP); 3) split delivery VRP (SDVRP); 4) orienteering problem (OP); and 5) prize collecting TSP (PCTSP). The results show that our model not only outperforms the learning-based baselines but also solves the problems much faster than the traditional baselines. In addition, our model shows improved generalizability when being evaluated in large-scale problems, as well as problems with different data distributions.},

To solve these problems, this study presents a novel target detection method based on asymmetric weighted logistic metric learning (AWLML). We first construct a logistic metric-learning approach as an objective function with a positive semidefinite constraint to learn the metric matrix from a set of labeled samples. Then, an asymmetric weighted strategy is provided to emphasize the unbalance between the number of target and background samples.

  abstract     = {Facing with rapidly increasing demands for analyzing high-order data or multiway data, feature-extracting methods become imperative for analysis and processing. The traditional feature-extracting methods, however, either need to overly vectorize the data and smash the original structure hidden in data, such as PCA and PCA-like methods, which is unfavorable to the data recovery, or cannot eliminate the redundant information very well, such as tucker decomposition (TD) and TD-like methods. To overcome these limitations, we propose a more flexible and more powerful tool, called the multiview principal components analysis (Multiview-PCA) in this article. By segmenting a random tensor into equal-sized subarrays called sections and maximizing variations caused by orthogonal projections of these sections , the Multiview-PCA finds principal components in a parsimonious and flexible way. In so doing, two new operations on tensors, the $S$ - direction inner/outer product , are introduced to formulate tensor projection and recovery. With different segmentation ways characterized by section depth and direction , the Multiview-PCA can be implemented many times in different ways, which defines the sequential and global Multiview-PCA, respectively. These multiple Multiview-PCA take the PCA and PCA-like, and TD and TD-like as the special cases, which correspond to the deepest section depth and the shallowest section depth, respectively. We propose an adaptive depth and direction selection algorithm for the implementation of Multiview-PCA. The Multiview-PCA is then tested in terms of subspace recovery ability, compression ability, and feature extraction performance when applied to a set of artificial data, surveillance videos, and hyperspectral imaging data. All numerical results support the flexibility, effectiveness, and usefulness of Multiview-PCA.},

Due to the dimensionality curse and poor interpretability of data, there is always a long-lasting challenge in constructing a stratification model with high diagnostic ability and good generalization. To address these problems, this article proposes two novel evolutionary multiobjective clustering algorithms with ensemble (NSGA-II-ECFE and MOEA/D-ECFE) with four cluster validity indices used as the objective functions. First, an effective ensemble construction method is developed to enrich the ensemble diversity. After that, an ensemble clustering fitness evaluation (ECFE) method is proposed to evaluate the ensembles by measuring the consensus clustering under those four objective functions. To generate the consensus clustering, ECFE exploits the hybrid co-association matrix from the ensembles and then dynamically selects the suitable clustering algorithm on that matrix. Multiple experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in comparison with seven clustering algorithms, twelve ensemble clustering approaches, and two multiobjective clustering algorithms on 55 synthetic datasets and 35 real patient stratification datasets. The experimental results demonstrate the competitive edges of the proposed algorithms over those compared methods. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm is applied to extend its advantages by identifying cancer subtypes from five cancer-related single-cell RNA-seq datasets.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we propose a novel method to simultaneously solve the data problem of dirty quality and poor quantity for person reidentification (ReID). Dirty quality refers to the wrong labels in image annotations. Poor quantity means that some identities have very few images (FewIDs). Training with these mislabeled data or FewIDs with triplet loss will lead to low generalization performance. To solve the label error problem, we propose a weighted label correction based on cross-entropy (wLCCE) strategy. Specifically, according to the influence range of the wrong labels, we first classify the mislabeled images into point label error and set label error. Then, we propose a weighted triplet loss (WTL) to correct the two label errors, respectively. To alleviate the poor quantity issue, we propose a feature simulation based on autoencoder (FSAE) method to generate some virtual samples for FewID. For the authenticity of the simulated features, we transfer the difference pattern of identities with multiple images (MultIDs) to FewIDs by training an autoencoder (AE)-based simulator. In this way, the FewIDs obtain richer expressions to distinguish from other identities. By dealing with a dirty and poor data problem, we can learn more robust ReID models using the triplet loss. We conduct extensive experiments on two public person ReID datasets: 1) Market-1501 and 2) DukeMTMC-reID, to verify the effectiveness of our approach.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we focus on the challenging multicategory instance segmentation problem in remote sensing images (RSIs), which aims at predicting the categories of all instances and localizing them with pixel-level masks. Although many landmark frameworks have demonstrated promising performance in instance segmentation, the complexity in the background and scale variability instances still remain challenging, for instance, segmentation of RSIs. To address the above problems, we propose an end-to-end multicategory instance segmentation model, namely, the semantic attention (SEA) and scale complementary network, which mainly consists of a SEA module and a scale complementary mask branch (SCMB). The SEA module contains a simple fully convolutional semantic segmentation branch with extra supervision to strengthen the activation of interest instances on the feature map and reduce the background noise’s interference. To handle the undersegmentation of geospatial instances with large varying scales, we design the SCMB that extends the original single mask branch to trident mask branches and introduces complementary mask supervision at different scales to sufficiently leverage the multiscale information. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method on the iSAID dataset and the NWPU Instance Segmentation dataset and achieve promising performance.},

  abstract     = {Visible infrared person reidentification (VI-REID) plays a critical role in night-time surveillance applications. Most methods attempt to reduce the cross-modality gap by extracting the modality-shared features. However, they neglect the distinct image-level discrepancies among heterogeneous pedestrian images. In this article, we propose a reciprocal bidirectional framework (RBDF) to achieve modality unification before discriminative feature learning. The bidirectional image translation subnetworks can learn two opposite mappings between visible and infrared modality. Particularly, we investigate the characteristics of the latent space and design a novel associated loss to pull close the distribution between the intermediate representations of two mappings. Mutual interaction between two opposite mappings helps the network generate heterogeneous images that have high similarity with the real images. Hence, the concatenation of original and generated images can eliminate the modality gap. During the feature learning procedure, the attention mechanism-based feature embedding network can learn more discriminative representations with the identity classification and feature metric learning. Experimental results indicate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. For instance, we achieve 54.41\% mAP and 57.66\% rank-1 accuracy on SYSU-MM01 dataset, outperforming the existing works by a large margin.},

Formation strategies enable UAVs to enjoy key collective benefits including reduced energy consumption, but the shape of the formation and each UAV’s freedom are significantly restrained. Swarm strategies are thus proposed to maximize each UAV’s freedom following simple yet powerful rules. This article investigates the integration and switch between these two strategies, considering the deployment environment factors, such as poor network conditions and unknown and often highly mobile obstacles. We design a distributed formation controller to guide multiple UAVs in orderless states to swiftly reach an intended formation. Inspired by starling birds and similar biological creatures, a distributed collision avoidance controller is proposed to avoid unknown and mobile obstacles. We further illustrated the stability of the controllers over both fixed and switching topologies. The experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the framework.},

By using the DL method, the partial persistent excitation condition of the identification system is satisfied, and then, the AHGO technology is exploited to estimate the states and the neural network weights simultaneously. To analyze the convergence of the proposed method, we first analyze the uniformed completely observability (UCO) property of the linear part of the nonlinear identification system. Then, by using the Lipschitz property of the nonlinear item and the Bellman–Gronwall lemma, we show that the UCO property of the nonlinear identification system is depended on the UCO property of the linear part when the observer gain is chosen large. Therefore, by using the UCO property of the nonlinear identification system and the Lyapunov stability theorem, the convergence of the proposed learning observer is proven. The attraction of this article is based on the analysis of the UCO property of the identification system, and the convergence of the proposed learning observer can be directly proven. The simulation example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Three-dimensional (3-D) data have many applications in the field of computer vision and a point cloud is one of the most popular modalities. Therefore, how to establish a good representation for a point cloud is a core issue in computer vision, especially for 3-D object recognition tasks. Existing approaches mainly focus on the invariance of representation under the group of permutations. However, for point cloud data, it should also be rotation invariant. To address such invariance, in this article, we introduce a relation of equivalence under the action of rotation group, through which the representation of point cloud is located in a homogeneous space. That is, two point clouds are regarded as equivalent when they are only different from a rotation. Our network is flexibly incorporated into existing frameworks for point clouds, which guarantees the proposed approach to be rotation invariant. Besides, a sufficient analysis on how to parameterize the group SO (3) into a convolutional network, which captures a relation with all rotations in 3-D Euclidean space $\mathbb {R}^{3}$ . We select the optimal rotation as the best representation of point cloud and propose a solution for minimizing the problem on the rotation group SO (3) by using its geometric structure. To validate the rotation invariance, we combine it with two existing deep models and evaluate them on ModelNet40 dataset and its subset ModelNet10. Experimental results indicate that the proposed strategy improves the performance of those existing deep models when the data involve arbitrary rotations.},

In the local inner loop, an extended state observer is employed to estimate the unknown disturbances due to the model uncertainties and environmental disturbances. Based on the estimated information from the extended state observer, an event-triggered anti-disturbance control law is developed to reduce the execution rate of actuators at the kinetic level. The stability of the closed-loop path-tracking system is proved based on the input-to-state stability and cascade stability theory.

Bearing all the adopted mechanisms in mind, the composite control strategy is designed in a backstepping manner.

Due to the constraint on the upper bound of the sampling interval being no greater than the dwell time, the issue concerning the asynchronization between the sampled-data controller mode and the system mode is hence considered to be caused by subsystems that may switch in a sampling interval. By considering the sampling interval without switching and the sampling interval with switching, the parameters-dependent loop-based Lyapunov functionals are constructed, respectively. With the help of the constructed functional, mean-square exponential stability criteria for the error polytopic uncertain switched complex dynamical networks are presented under the definition of average dwell time. Furthermore, based on the stability criteria, the asynchronous aperiodic sampled-data controller is designed for polytopic uncertain switched complex dynamical networks subject to actuator saturation. The polytopic uncertain switched complex dynamical networks can be guaranteed to exponentially synchronize with the target node based on the proposed stability conditions and aperiodic sampled-data controller design method. Finally, by transforming the proposed theoretical conditions into the LMI-based objective optimization problem, the domain of attraction of polytopic uncertain switched complex dynamical networks is estimated.

In this work, we present new fully uncalibrated visual servoing approaches for position control of the 2DOFs planar manipulator with a fixed camera. In the proposed approaches, no camera calibration is required, and numerical optimization algorithms or adaptive laws for parameter estimation are not needed. One benefit of such features is that exponential convergence of the image position errors can be ensured regardless of the camera parameter uncertainties. Generally, existing uncalibrated approaches only can guarantee asymptotical convergence of the position errors. Moreover, different from most existing approaches which assume that the robot motion plane and the image plane are parallel, one of the proposed approaches allows the camera to be installed at a general pose. This also simplifies the controller implementation and improves the system design flexibility. Finally, simulation and experimental results are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the presented fully uncalibrated visual servoing approaches.},

  abstract     = {The development of electric vehicle (EV) techniques has led to a new vehicle routing problem (VRP) called the capacitated EV routing problem (CEVRP). Because of the limited number of charging stations and the limited cruising range of EVs, not only the service order of customers but also the recharging schedules of EVs should be considered. However, solving these two aspects of the problem together is very difficult. To address the above issue, we treat CEVRP as a bilevel optimization problem and propose a novel bilevel ant colony optimization algorithm in this article, which divides CEVRP into two levels of subproblem: 1) capacitated VRP and 2) fixed route vehicle charging problem. For the upper level subproblem, the electricity constraint is ignored and an order-first split-second max–min ant system algorithm is designed to generate routes that fulfill the demands of customers. For the lower level subproblem, a new effective heuristic is designed to decide the charging schedule in the generated routes to satisfy the electricity constraint. The objective values of the resultant solutions are used to update the pheromone information for the ant system algorithm in the upper level. Through good orchestration of the two components, the proposed algorithm can significantly outperform state-of-the-art algorithms on a wide range of benchmark instances.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates the model-free containment control of multiple underactuated unmanned surface vessels (USVs) subject to unknown kinetic models. A novel cooperative control architecture is presented for achieving a containment formation under switching topologies. Specifically, a path-guided distributed containment motion generator (CMG) is first proposed for generating reference points according to the underlying switching topologies. Next, guiding-vector-field-based guidance laws are designed such that each USV can track its reference point, enabling smooth transitions during topology switching. Finally, data-driven neural predictors by utilizing real-time and historical data are developed for estimating total uncertainties and unknown input gains, simultaneously. Based on the learned knowledge from neural predictors, adaptive kinetic control laws are designed and no prior information on kinetic model parameters is required. By using the proposed method, the fleet is able to converge to the convex hull spanned by multiple virtual leaders under switching topologies regardless of fully unknown kinetic models. Through stability analyses, it is proven that the closed-loop control system is input-to-state stable and the tracking errors are uniformly ultimately bounded. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed cooperative control architecture for multiple underactuated USVs with fully unknown kinetic models.},

  abstract     = {In convolutional neural networks (CNNs), generating noise for the intermediate feature is a hot research topic in improving generalization. The existing methods usually regularize the CNNs by producing multiplicative noise (regularization weights), called multiplicative regularization (Multi-Reg). However, Multi-Reg methods usually focus on improving generalization but fail to jointly consider optimization, leading to unstable learning with slow convergence. Moreover, Multi-Reg methods are not flexible enough since the regularization weights are generated from a definite manual-design distribution. Besides, most popular methods are not universal enough, because these methods are only designed for the residual networks. In this article, we, for the first time, experimentally and theoretically explore the nature of generating noise in the intermediate features for popular CNNs. We demonstrate that injecting noise in the feature space can be transformed to generating noise in the input space, and these methods regularize the networks in a Mini-batch in Mini-batch (MiM) sampling manner. Based on these observations, this article further discovers that generating multiplicative noise can easily degenerate the optimization due to its high dependence on the intermediate feature. Based on these studies, we propose a novel additional regularization (Addi-Reg) method, which can adaptively produce additional noise with low dependence on intermediate feature in CNNs by employing a series of mechanisms. Particularly, these well-designed mechanisms can stabilize the learning process in training, and our Addi-Reg method can pertinently learn the noise distributions for every layer in CNNs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed Addi-Reg method is more flexible and universal, and meanwhile achieves better generalization performance with faster convergence against the state-of-the-art Multi-Reg methods.},

  abstract     = {As one of the most important topics in image forensics, resampling detection has developed rapidly in recent years. However, the robustness to JPEG compression is still challenging for most classical spectrum-based methods, since JPEG compression severely degrades the image contents and introduces block artifacts in the boundary of the compression grid. In this article, we propose a method to estimate the upscaling factors on double JPEG compressed images in the presence of image upscaling between the two compressions. We first analyze the spectrum of scaled images and give an overall formulation of how the scaling factors along with the parameters of JPEG compression and image contents influence the appearance of tampering artifacts. The expected positions of five kinds of characteristic peaks are analytically derived. Then, we analyze the features of double JPEG compressed images in the block discrete cosine transform (BDCT) domain and present an inverse scaling strategy for the upscaling factor estimation with a detailed proof. Finally, a fusion method is proposed that through frequency-domain analysis, a candidate set of upscaling factors is given, and through analysis in the BDCT domain, the optimal estimation from all candidates is determined. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.},

To address the problem of unbounded growth or vanishing of the learning gain matrix in classical OBE algorithms, we propose a modified OBE algorithm to ensure that the learning gain matrix has deterministic upper and lower bounds (i.e., the bounds are independent of the unpredictable excitation levels in different regressor channels and, therefore, are capable of being predetermined a priori ). Such properties are generally unavailable in the existing OBE algorithms. The upper bound prevents blow-up in cases of insufficient excitations, and the lower bound ensures good identification performance for time-varying parameters. Based on the proposed OBE identification algorithm, we developed a closed-loop controller for the Euler–Lagrange system and proved the practical asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system via the Lyapunov stability theory. Furthermore, we showed that inertial matrix inversion and noisy acceleration signals are not required in the controller. Comparative studies confirmed the validity of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {Convolutional transform learning (CTL), learning filters by minimizing the data fidelity loss function in an unsupervised way, is becoming very pervasive, resulting from keeping the best of both worlds: the benefit of unsupervised learning and the success of the convolutional neural network. There have been growing interests in developing efficient CTL algorithms. However, developing a convergent and accelerated CTL algorithm with accurate representations simultaneously with proper sparsity is an open problem. This article presents a new CTL framework with a $log$ regularizer that can not only obtain accurate representations but also yield strong sparsity. To efficiently address our nonconvex composite optimization, we propose to employ the proximal difference of the convex algorithm (PDCA) which relies on decomposing the nonconvex regularizer into the difference of two convex parts and then optimizes the convex subproblems. Furthermore, we introduce the extrapolation technology to accelerate the algorithm, leading to a fast and efficient CTL algorithm. In particular, we provide a rigorous convergence analysis for the proposed algorithm under the accelerated PDCA. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can converge more stably to desirable solutions with lower approximation error and simultaneously with stronger sparsity and, thus, learn filters efficiently. Meanwhile, the convergence speed is faster than the existing CTL algorithms.},

To effectively use the limited network bandwidth and avoid the requirement of global information, a novel adaptive event-triggered state feedback controller and a dynamic triggering law are designed jointly by employing a projection operator approach. The proposed synchronization scheme is different from existing ones that have focused on designing controllers and triggering laws independently. Besides, our scheme is extended to design an observer-based distributed adaptive event-triggered controller and corresponding dynamic triggering law when the system states are unmeasurable. Theoretical analysis shows that under the two different distributed event-triggered synchronization schemes, the following three results can be obtained: 1) fully distributed synchronization can be achieved without knowing global information associated with the underlying communication topology and node’s scale; 2) continuous communication among adjacent nodes can be avoided for both designed controllers and dynamic triggering laws; and 3) exclusion of Zeno phenomenon is shown by contradiction. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms is verified through three numerical examples.},

Fuzzy-logic systems are, therefore, utilized to approximate the unknown nonlinear functions, and the DSC technique is adopted to overcome the “curse of dimensionality” problem. A novel fuzzy adaptive decentralized controller design is presented using the proposed convex combination technique. Furthermore, it is proven that under the proposed controller and state-dependent switching law, all states of the closed-loop system are bounded and deferred asymmetric, and the time-varying full-state constraints are strictly obeyed.

There lacks a benchmark for ground mobile robots, such as robotic wheelchairs. Therefore, in this article, we first build a drivable area and road anomaly detection benchmark for ground mobile robots, evaluating existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) single-modal and data-fusion semantic segmentation CNNs using six modalities of visual features. Furthermore, we propose a novel module, referred to as the dynamic fusion module (DFM), which can be easily deployed in existing data-fusion networks to fuse different types of visual features effectively and efficiently. The experimental results show that the transformed disparity image is the most informative visual feature and the proposed DFM-RTFNet outperforms the SOTAs.

  abstract     = {Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims at learning a classifier for an unlabeled target domain by transferring knowledge from a labeled source domain with a related but different distribution. Most existing approaches learn domain-invariant features by adapting the entire information of the images. However, forcing adaptation of domain-specific variations undermines the effectiveness of the learned features. To address this problem, we propose a novel, yet elegant module, called the deep ladder-suppression network (DLSN), which is designed to better learn the cross-domain shared content by suppressing domain-specific variations. Our proposed DLSN is an autoencoder with lateral connections from the encoder to the decoder. By this design, the domain-specific details, which are only necessary for reconstructing the unlabeled target data, are directly fed to the decoder to complete the reconstruction task, relieving the pressure of learning domain-specific variations at the later layers of the shared encoder. As a result, DLSN allows the shared encoder to focus on learning cross-domain shared content and ignores the domain-specific variations. Notably, the proposed DLSN can be used as a standard module to be integrated with various existing UDA frameworks to further boost performance. Without whistles and bells, extensive experimental results on four gold-standard domain adaptation datasets, for example: 1) Digits; 2) Office31; 3) Office-Home; and 4) VisDA-C, demonstrate that the proposed DLSN can consistently and significantly improve the performance of various popular UDA frameworks.},

A many-objective model with five objectives, that is: 1) makespan; 2) total tardiness; 3) total idle time; 4) total worker cost; and 5) total energy, is built. To solve this many-objective optimization problem (MaOP), a novel fitness evaluation mechanism (FEM) based on fuzzy correlation entropy (FCE) is adopted. Two construction methods for reference points are proposed to build the bridge between MaOP and a fuzzy set. Based on FCE and cluster methods, an environmental selection mechanism (ESM) is proposed to achieve a balance between solution convergence and diversity. With the proposed FEM and ESM, two many-objective evolutionary algorithms are proposed to solve MaOP. The effect of FCE-based FEM and ESM on the performance of algorithms is verified via experiments. The proposed algorithms are compared with four well-known peers to test their performance.

  abstract     = {The user alignment problem that establishes a correspondence between users across networks is a fundamental issue in various social network analyses and applications. Since symbolic representations of users suffer from sparsity and noise when computing their cross-network similarities, the state-of-the-art methods embed users into the low-dimensional representation space, where their features are preserved and establish user correspondence based on the similarities of their low-dimensional embeddings. Many embedding-based methods try to align latent spaces of two networks by learning a mapping function before computing similarities. However, most of them learn the mapping function largely based on the limited labeled aligned user pairs and ignore the distribution discrepancy of user representations from different networks, which may lead to the overfitting problem and affect the performance. To address the above problems, we propose a cycle-consistent adversarial mapping model to establish user correspondence across social networks. The model learns mapping functions across the latent representation spaces, and the representation distribution discrepancy is addressed through the adversarial training between the mapping functions and the discriminators as well as the cycle-consistency training. Besides, the proposed model utilizes both labeled and unlabeled users in the training process, which may alleviate the overfitting problem and reduce the number of labeled users required. Results of extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model on user alignment on real social networks.},

The constraint resulting from collision avoidance is also taken into account for safe operations of the formation system. Furthermore, the preselected specifications on transient and steady-state performance are provided by considering the time-varying and asymmetric constraint requirements on formation tracking errors for each robot. To address the constraint problems, we incorporate a novel barrier Lyapunov function into controller design and analysis. Based on the recursive adaptive backstepping procedure and neural-network approximation, we develop a vision-based formation tracking control protocol such that formation tracking errors can converge into a small neighborhood of the origin in finite time while meeting the requirements of visibility and performance constraints. The proposed protocol is decentralized in the sense that the control action on each robot only depends on the local relative information, without the need for explicit network communication. Moreover, the control protocol could extend to an unconstrained multirobot system. Both simulation and experimental results show the effectiveness of the control protocol.},

Then, we concentrate on stability analyses on dissipativity-based switched IT2 fuzzy systems with stochastic perturbation through linear matrix inequalities, Lyapunov function, free-weighting matrices, and average dwell time, discussing it according to different values of disturbance.

  abstract     = {Tensor singular value decomposition (t-SVD) has recently become increasingly popular for tensor recovery under partial and/or corrupted observations. However, the existing $t$ -SVD-based methods neither make use of a rank prior nor provide an accurate rank estimation (RE), which would limit their recovery performance. From the practical perspective, the tensor RE problem is nontrivial and difficult to solve. In this article, we, therefore, aim to determine the correct rank of an intrinsic low-rank tensor from corrupted observations based on t-SVD and further improve recovery results with the estimated rank . Specifically, we first induce the equivalence of the tensor nuclear norm (TNN) of a tensor and its $f$ -diagonal tensor. We then simultaneously minimize the reconstruction error and TNN of the $f$ -diagonal tensor, leading to RE. Subsequently, we relax our model by removing the TNN regularizer to improve the recovery performance. Furthermore, we consider more general cases in the presence of missing data and/or gross corruptions by proposing robust tensor principal component analysis and robust tensor completion with RE. The robust methods can achieve successful recovery by refining the models with correct estimated ranks. Experimental results show that the proposed methods outperform the state-of-the-art methods with significant improvements.},

  abstract     = {Bilevel optimization involves two levels of optimization, where one optimization problem is nested within the other. The structure of the problem often requires solving a large number of inner optimization problems that make these kinds of optimization problems expensive to solve. The reaction set mapping and the lower level optimal value function mapping are often used to reduce bilevel optimization problems to a single level; however, the mappings are not known a priori , and the need is to be estimated. Though there exist a few studies that rely on the estimation of these mappings, they are often applied to problems where one of these mappings has a known form, that is, piecewise linear, convex, etc. In this article, we utilize both these mappings together to solve general bilevel optimization problems without any assumptions on the structure of these mappings. Kriging approximations are created during the generations of an evolutionary algorithm, where the population members serve as the samples for creating the approximations. One of the important features of the proposed algorithm is the creation of an auxiliary optimization problem using the Kriging-based metamodel of the lower level optimal value function that solves an approximate relaxation of the bilevel optimization problem. The auxiliary problem when used for local search is able to accelerate the evolutionary algorithm toward the bilevel optimal solution. We perform experiments on two sets of test problems and a problem from the domain of control theory. Our experiments suggest that the approach is quite promising and can lead to substantial savings when solving bilevel optimization problems. The approach is able to outperform state-of-the-art methods that are available for solving bilevel problems, in particular, the savings in function evaluations for the lower level problem are substantial with the proposed approach.},

In addition, finding the right level of abstraction to represent any generic MAS mission is important for being able to provide general solution to the automated planning problem. In this article, we show how a mission for heterogeneous MASs can be cast as an extension of the traveling salesperson problem (TSP), and we propose a mixed-integer linear programming formulation. In order to solve this problem, a genetic mission planner (GMP), with a local plan refinement algorithm, is proposed. In addition, the comparative evaluation of CPLEX and GMP is presented in terms of timing and optimality of the obtained solutions. The algorithms are benchmarked on a proposed set of different problem instances. The results show that, in the presence of timing constraints, GMP outperforms CPLEX in the majority of test instances.},

The existing methods suffer from the issues like noise, improper seed-point detection, and oversegmentation problems, which are solved here using a Laplacian-of-Gaussian (LoG)-based modified highboosting operation, bounded opening followed by fast radial symmetry (BOFRS)-based seed-point detection, and hybrid ellipse fitting (EF), respectively. This article proposes a novel hybrid EF-based blood-cell segmentation approach, which may be used for detecting various hematological disorders. Our prime contributions are: 1) more accurate seed-point detection based on BO-FRS; 2) a novel least-squares (LS)-based geometric EF approach; and 3) an improved segmentation performance by employing a hybridized version of geometric and algebraic EF techniques retaining the benefits of both approaches. It is a computationally efficient approach since it hybridizes noniterative-geometric and algebraic methods. Moreover, we propose to estimate the minor and major axes based on the residue and residue offset factors. The residue offset parameter, proposed here, yields more accurate segmentation with proper EF. Our method is compared with the state-of-the-art methods. It outperforms the existing EF techniques in terms of dice similarity, Jaccard score, precision, and F1 score. It may be useful for other medical and cybernetics applications.},

One of the distinguishing features of the attack-free protocols lies in the prohibition on information transmission via the communication channel. By viewing the relative control input as the unknown input on the dynamics of each agent, a class of new unknown input observers is introduced with only the relative output measurement involved. The appointed-time estimation of the consensus error is achieved by utilizing jump discontinuity in the observer design and employing the property of the nilpotent matrix. Moreover, a linear transformation is made on the system of consensus error to realize the observer order reduction. Both theoretical analysis and simulation illustration are presented to reveal the effectiveness of the proposed attack-free protocols.},

As the environmental constraints for the positions are considered, we further provide an enhanced optimal control scheme by applying the $\epsilon $ -exact penalty function method. Different from the existing optimal control schemes of networked EL systems, the proposed adaptive control schemes have two merits. First, they are fully distributed in the sense without requiring any global information. Second, the control schemes are designed under the general unbalanced directed communication graphs.

Then, the operating performance grade is assessed by a threshold division method. Next, the operating performance grade guides the control of the burn-through point to improve the operating performance.

  abstract     = {Evolutionary multitask learning has achieved great success due to its ability to handle multiple tasks simultaneously. However, it is rarely used in the hyperheuristic domain, which aims at generating a heuristic for a class of problems rather than solving one specific problem. The existing multitask hyperheuristic studies only focus on heuristic selection, which is not applicable to heuristic generation. To fill the gap, we propose a novel multitask generative hyperheuristic approach based on genetic programming (GP) in this article. Specifically, we introduce the idea in evolutionary multitask learning to GP hyperheuristics with a suitable evolutionary framework and individual selection pressure. In addition, an origin-based offspring reservation strategy is developed to maintain the quality of individuals for each task. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach, comprehensive empirical studies have been conducted on the homogeneous and heterogeneous multitask dynamic flexible job shop scheduling. The results show that the proposed algorithm can significantly improve the quality of scheduling heuristics for each task in all the examined scenarios. In addition, the evolved scheduling heuristics verify the mutual help among the tasks in a multitask scenario.},

  abstract     = {Global principal component analysis (PCA) has been successfully introduced for modeling distributed parameter systems (DPSs). In spite of the merits, this method is not feasible due to parameter variations and multiple operating domains. A novel multimode spatiotemporal modeling method based on the locally weighted PCA (LW-PCA) method is developed for large-scale highly nonlinear DPSs with parameter variations, by separating the original dataset into tractable subsets. This method implements the decomposition by making full use of the dependence among subset densities. First, the spatiotemporal snapshots are divided into multiple different Gaussian components by using a finite Gaussian mixture model (FGMM). Once the components are derived, a Bayesian inference strategy is then applied to calculate the posterior probabilities of each spatiotemporal snapshot belonging to each component, which will be regarded as the local weights of the LW-PCA method. Second, LW-PCA is adopted to calculate each locally weighted snapshot matrix, and the corresponding local spatial basis functions (SBFs) can be generated by the PCA method. Third, all the local temporal models are estimated using the extreme learning machine (ELM). Thus, the local spatiotemporal models can be produced with local SBFs and corresponding temporal model. Finally, the original system can be approximated using the sum form of each local spatiotemporal model. Unlike global PCA, which uses global SBFs to construct a global spatiotemporal model, LW-PCA approximates the original system by multiple local reduced SBFs. Numerical simulations verify the effectiveness of the developed multimode spatiotemporal model.},

  abstract     = {Multiview clustering aims to leverage information from multiple views to improve the clustering performance. Most previous works assumed that each view has complete data. However, in real-world datasets, it is often the case that a view may contain some missing data, resulting in the problem of incomplete multiview clustering (IMC). Previous approaches to this problem have at least one of the following drawbacks: 1) employing shallow models, which cannot well handle the dependence and discrepancy among different views; 2) ignoring the hidden information of the missing data; and 3) being dedicated to the two-view case. To eliminate all these drawbacks, in this work, we present the adversarial IMC (AIMC) framework. In particular, AIMC seeks the common latent representation of multiview data for reconstructing raw data and inferring missing data. The elementwise reconstruction and the generative adversarial network are integrated to evaluate the reconstruction. They aim to capture the overall structure and get a deeper semantic understanding, respectively. Moreover, the clustering loss is designed to obtain a better clustering structure. We explore two variants of AIMC, namely: 1) autoencoder-based AIMC (AAIMC) and 2) generalized AIMC (GAIMC), with different strategies to obtain the multiview common representation. Experiments conducted on six real-world datasets show that AAIMC and GAIMC perform well and outperform the baseline methods.},

Control performances of the robots always suffer from unknown matched and mismatched time-varying disturbances. Traditional SMC exists with a chattering phenomenon and cannot cope with mismatched time-varying disturbances due to its inherent structure property. For this reason, two HOSMOs are devised to estimate the time-varying disturbances on the link and motor side, respectively. Then, by fusing the states and disturbance estimations into a novel terminal sliding-mode surface, a continuous robust FTC scheme is developed. The proposed control strategy can not only handle both matched and mismatched time-varying disturbances but also obtain a finite-time convergence performance. The rigorous finite-time stability analysis of the closed-loop system under the proposed control method is guaranteed. The results are illustrated to verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed design approach.},

  abstract     = {Given $m~d$ -dimensional responsors and $n~d$ -dimensional predictors, sparse regression finds at most $k$ predictors for each responsor for linear approximation, $1\leq k \leq d-1$ . The key problem in sparse regression is subset selection, which usually suffers from high computational cost. In recent years, many improved approximate methods of subset selection have been published. However, less attention has been paid to the nonapproximate method of subset selection, which is very necessary for many questions in data analysis. Here, we consider sparse regression from the view of correlation and propose the formula of conditional uncorrelation. Then, an efficient nonapproximate method of subset selection is proposed in which we do not need to calculate any coefficients in the regression equation for candidate predictors. By the proposed method, the computational complexity is reduced from $O([{1}/{6}]{k^{3}}\!+(m+1)k^{2}\!+\!mkd)$ to $O([{1}/{6}]{k^{3}}\!+[{1}/{2}](m+1)k^{2})$ for each candidate subset in sparse regression. Because the dimension $d$ is generally the number of observations or experiments and large enough, the proposed method can greatly improve the efficiency of nonapproximate subset selection. We also apply the proposed method in real scenarios of dental age assessment and sparse coding to validate the efficiency of the proposed method.},

This makes it the first general sampling method for classification that not only can reduce the data size but also enhance the classification accuracy of a classifier, especially in the label-noisy classification. The “general” means that it is not restricted to any specific classifiers or datasets (regardless of whether a dataset is linear or not). Furthermore, the RSDS can online accelerate most classifiers because of its lower time complexity than most classifiers. Moreover, the RSDS can be used as an undersampling method for imbalanced classification. The experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency.

  abstract     = {Deep learning methods have played a more important role in hyperspectral image classification. However, general deep learning methods mainly take advantage of the samplewise information to formulate the training loss while ignoring the intrinsic data structure of each class. Due to the high spectral dimension and great redundancy between different spectral channels in the hyperspectral image, these former training losses usually cannot work so well for the deep representation of the image. To tackle this problem, this work develops a novel deep manifold embedding method (DMEM) for deep learning in hyperspectral image classification. First, each class in the image is modeled as a specific nonlinear manifold, and the geodesic distance is used to measure the correlation between the samples. Then, based on the hierarchical clustering, the manifold structure of the data can be captured and each nonlinear data manifold can be divided into several subclasses. Finally, considering the distribution of each subclass and the correlation between different subclasses under data manifold, DMEM is constructed as the novel training loss to incorporate the special classwise information in the training process and obtain discriminative representation for the hyperspectral image. Experiments over four real-world hyperspectral image datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method when compared with general sample-based losses and showed superiority when compared with state-of-the-art methods.},

This fundamental data property is not considered in the generative adversarial network (GAN) model along with its its variants; such that original data and generated data often hold different intrinsic dimensions . The different intrinsic dimensions of both generated and original data may cause generated data distribution to not match original data distribution completely, and it certainly will hurt the quality of generated data. In this study, we first show that GAN is often unable to generate simulation data, holding the same intrinsic dimension as the original data with both theoretical analysis and experimental illustration. Next, we propose a new model, called Hausdorff GAN, which removes the issue of different intrinsic dimensions and introduces the Hausdorff metric into GAN training to generate higher quality data. This provides new insights into the success of Hausdorff GAN. Specifically, we utilize a mapping function to map both original and generated data into the same manifold. We then calculate the Hausdorff distance to measure the difference between the mapped original data and the mapped generated data, toward pushing generated data to the side of original data. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments (using MNIST, CIFAR10, and CelebA datasets) to demonstrate the significant performance improvement of the Hausdorff GAN in achieving the largest Inception Score and the smallest Frechet inception distance (FID) score as well as producing diverse generated data at different resolutions.},

First, we propose a new semisupervised framework with novel category discovery to guide label propagation processing, which is reinforced by the parameter-insensitive anchor-based graph obtained from balanced $K$ -means and hierarchical $K$ -means (BKHK). Second, we design a novel representative point selected strategy based on our semisupervised framework to discover each representative point and endow pseudolabel progressively, where every pseudolabel hypothetically corresponds to a real category in each self-supervised label propagation. Third, when sufficient representative points have been found, the labels of all samples will be finally predicted to obtain terminal clustering results. In addition, the experimental results on several toy examples and benchmark data sets comprehensively demonstrate that our method outperforms other clustering approaches.},

To reduce the bandwidth usage, a discrete-time Markovian chain is employed to implement the stochastic communication protocol (SCP) scheduling of the sensor nodes, by which only one sensor node is chosen to access the network at each transmission instant. Moreover, due to the effect of amplitude attenuation, time delay, and random interference/noise, the transmission may be inevitably subject to the Rice fading phenomenon. All of these constraints make the controller only receive the fading signal from one activated sensor node at each instant. A merge approach is first used to deal with two Markovian chains; meanwhile, a compensator is designed to provide available information for the controller. By a compensator and mode-based sliding-mode controller, the resulting closed-loop system is ensured to be input-to-state stable in probability (ISSiP), and the quasisliding mode is attained. Moreover, an iteration optimizing algorithm is provided to reduce the convergence domain around the sliding surface via searching a desirable sliding gain, which constitutes an effective GA-based sliding-mode control strategy. Finally, the proposed control scheme is verified via the simulation results.},

The goal of the transparent DT-BRB is not only to model the complex relationships between the system inputs and output but also to conduct output control by identifying and optimizing the key parameters in the model inputs. The proposed DT-BRB approach is composed of three major steps. First, BRB is adopted to model the relationships between the inputs and output of the physical system. Second, an analytical procedure is proposed to identify only the key parameters in the system inputs with the highest contribution to the output. Being consistent with the inferencing, integration, and unification procedures of BRB, there are also three parts in the contribution calculation in this step. Finally, the data-driven optimization is performed to control the system output. A practical case study on the Wuhan Metro System is conducted for reducing the building tilt rate (BTR) in tunnel construction. By comparing the results following different standards, the 80\% contribution standard is proved to have the highest marginal contribution that identifies only 43.5\% parameters as the key parameters but can reduce the BTR by 73.73\%. Moreover, it is also observed that the proposed DT-BRB approach is so effective that iterative optimizations are not necessarily needed.},

To overcome this problem, a type-2 fuzzy BLS (FBLS) is designed and analyzed in this article. First, a group of interval type-2 fuzzy neurons was used to replace the feature neurons of BLS. Then, the representation of BLS can be improved to obtain good robustness. Second, a fuzzy pseudoinverse learning algorithm was designed to adjust the parameter of type-2 FBLS. Then, the proposed type-2 FBLS was able to maintain the fast computational nature of BLS. Third, a theoretical analysis on the convergence of type-2 FBLS was given to show the computational efficiency. Finally, some benchmark and practical problems were used to test the merits of type-2 FBLS. The experimental results indicated that the proposed type-2 FBLS can achieve outstanding performance.},

  abstract     = {An intelligent robot requires episodic memory that can retrieve a sequence of events for a service task learned from past experiences to provide a proper service to a user. Various episodic memories, which can learn new tasks incrementally without forgetting the tasks learned previously, have been designed based on adaptive resonance theory (ART) networks. The conventional ART-based episodic memories, however, do not have the adaptability to the changing environments. They cannot utilize the retrieved task episode adaptively in the working environment. Moreover, if a user wants to receive multiple services of the same kind in a given situation, the user should repeatedly command multiple times. To tackle these limitations, in this article, a novel hierarchical clustering resonance network (HCRN) is proposed, which has a high clustering performance on multimodal data and can compute the semantic relations between learned clusters. Using HCRN, a semantic relation-aware episodic memory (SR-EM) is designed, which can adapt the retrieved task episode to the current working environment to carry out the task intelligently. Experimental simulations demonstrate that HCRN outperforms the conventional ART in terms of clustering performance on multimodal data. Besides, the effectiveness of the proposed SR-EM is verified through robot simulations for two scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Domain adaptation (DA) aims at facilitating the target model training by leveraging knowledge from related but distribution-inconsistent source domain. Most of the previous DA works concentrate on homogeneous scenarios, where the source and target domains are assumed to share the same feature space. Nevertheless, frequently, in reality, the domains are not consistent in not only data distribution but also the representation space and feature dimensions. That is, these domains are heterogeneous. Although many works have attempted to handle such heterogeneous DA (HDA) by transforming HDA to homogeneous counterparts or performing DA jointly with domain transformation, nearly all of them just concentrate on the feature and distribution alignment across domains, neglecting the structure and classification space preservation for domains themselves. In this work, we propose a novel HDA model, namely, heterogeneous classification space alignment (HCSA), which leverages knowledge from both the source samples and model parameters to the target. In HCSA, structure preservation, distribution, and classification space alignment are implemented, jointly with feature representation by transferring both the source-domain representation and model knowledge. Moreover, we design an alternating algorithm to optimize the HCSA model with guaranteed convergence and complexity analysis. In addition, the HCSA model is further extended with deep network architecture. Finally, we experimentally evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method by showing its superiority to the compared approaches.},

This article aims at providing a resilient event-triggered framework to defend a kind of sequential scaling attack by exploring the relationship among the attack duration and frequency, and event-triggered parameters.

Under the proposed dynamic event-triggered control, consensus criteria involving triggering parameters, attack constraints, and system matrices are obtained. It proves that the Zeno behavior can be excluded. Moreover, the impacts of the scaling factor, triggering parameters, and attack properties are discussed.

With this motivation, this article considers the adaptive tracking consensus problem of uncertain second-order multiagent systems via impulsive communication. The tracking consensus is achieved by designing proper adaptive control schemes with neural networks. Two control strategies are proposed for different cases. One considers that all state information is available while another considers only partial information can be used. Estimators equipped by followers are designed, which do not need any information about neighbors during the time interval without communication. Even though the estimators and followers are under control continuously over time, the communication among all agents is only permitted at impulsive instants. In such situations, some sufficient conditions to guarantee the estimation and convergence are obtained for both cases. It is proved that by the proposed adaptive schemes for uncertain multiagent systems, errors exist both for estimation and consensus due to uncertain dynamics and adaptive schemes. Numerical simulations, including a practical example, are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

It combines the capability of NN to learn rich representations under massive data and the nonparametric property of GP to achieve automatic regularization that incorporates a tradeoff between model fit and model complexity. However, the deterministic NN encoder may weaken the model regularization of the following GP part, especially on small datasets, due to the free latent representation. We, therefore, present a complete deep latent-variable kernel learning (DLVKL) model wherein the latent variables perform stochastic encoding for regularized representation. We further enhance the DLVKL from two aspects: 1) the expressive variational posterior through neural stochastic differential equation (NSDE) to improve the approximation quality and 2) the hybrid prior taking knowledge from both the SDE prior and the posterior to arrive at a flexible tradeoff. Extensive experiments imply that DLVKL-NSDE performs similar to the well-calibrated GP on small datasets, and shows superiority on large datasets.},

In this article, a physics-guided distributed model predictive control (DMPC) framework for reflector shape control with input saturation is proposed. First, guided by the actual physical characteristics, an overall structural system is decomposed into multilevel subsystems with the help of a so-called substructuring technique. For each subsystem, a prediction model with information interaction is discretized by an explicit Newmark- $\boldsymbol{\beta }$ method. Then, to improve the system-wide control performance, a coordinator among all the subsystems is designed in an iterative fashion. The input saturation constraints are addressed by transforming the original problem into a linear complementarity problem (LCP). Finally, by solving the LCP, the input trajectory can be obtained. The performance of the proposed DMPC algorithm is validated through an experiment on the shape control of an antenna reflector structure.},

Based on the reference measure method, the closed-form expression of the nonlinear RS estimator is derived. Moreover, stability conditions for the designed estimator are established by extending the contraction analysis of the linear cases. In contrast to the linear cases, a novel cost function is designed to obtain the finite-dimensional nonlinear estimate, which counteracts the linearization errors by treating them as model uncertainties.

Second, when DoS jamming attacks are involved, the transmitted data are blocked and the old control input is kept by using the zero-order holder (ZOH). On the basis of this process, the effect of DoS attacks on ETS is further discussed. Next, by utilizing the state-feedback controller and multiple Lyapunov functions method, some criteria incorporating the restriction of DoS jamming attacks are proposed to guarantee the $\mathcal {L}_{\infty }$ control performance of the event-triggered Markov closed-loop jump system. In particular, the bounded transition rates rather than the exact ones are taken into account. That is appropriate for the practical environment in which transition rates of the Markov process are difficult to measure accurately.

The local appointed-time state observer is skillfully designed for each agent to estimate the agent’s actual state value at the appointed time, even in the presence of unknown malicious attacks. Based on the state estimation, a new kind of resilient control strategy is proposed, where a virtual system is constructed for each agent to generate an ideal state value such that the consensus of normal agents can be achieved with the exchange of ideal state values among neighboring agents. To specify the consensus trajectory while achieving resilient consensus, the leader–follower resilient consensus is further studied, where the leader is assumed to be a trusted agent with a bounded control input. Compared with the existing results on the resilient consensus, the proposed distributed resilient controller design reduces the requirement on communication connectivity significantly, where the allowable communication graph is only assumed to contain a directed spanning tree.

  abstract     = {Mode information is of great significance when investigating the Markov jump systems (MJSs). However, it is common in practical scenarios that the mode information is not completely accessible, which probably induces nonsynchronization problems. Taking this into consideration, in this article, we study nonsynchronous $\mathcal H_{\infty }$ model order reduction for 2-D MJSs with model uncertainty. The considered 2-D system and reduced-order model are characterized by the Roesser model. The nonsynchronization phenomenon between the original system and the reduced-order model is dealt with under the framework of the hidden Markov model. By appropriately selecting the Lyapunov function, the asymptotic mean-square stability and the $\mathcal H_{\infty }$ performance of the error system are analyzed, and sufficient conditions are proposed. Based on this, an efficient design method for nonsynchronous model order reduction is further proposed with the help of a projection lemma. Finally, the correctness and effectiveness of the designed reduced-order model are verified through some simulations.},

  abstract     = {Constrained multiobjective optimization problems (CMOPs) involve both conflicting objective functions and various constraints. Due to the presence of constraints, CMOPs’ Pareto-optimal solutions are very likely lying on constraint boundaries. The experience from the constrained single-objective optimization has shown that to quickly obtain such an optimal solution, the search should surround the boundary of the feasible region from both the feasible and infeasible sides. In this article, we extend this idea to cope with CMOPs and, accordingly, we propose a novel constrained multiobjective evolutionary algorithm with bi directional co evolution, called BiCo. BiCo maintains two populations, that is: 1) the main population and 2) the archive population. To update the main population, the constraint-domination principle is equipped with an NSGA-II variant to move the population into the feasible region and then to guide the population toward the Pareto front (PF) from the feasible side of the search space. While for updating the archive population, a nondominated sorting procedure and an angle-based selection scheme are conducted in sequence to drive the population toward the PF within the infeasible region while maintaining good diversity. As a result, BiCo can get close to the PF from two complementary directions. In addition, to coordinate the interaction between the main and archive populations, in BiCo, a restricted mating selection mechanism is developed to choose appropriate mating parents. Comprehensive experiments have been conducted on three sets of CMOP benchmark functions and six real-world CMOPs. The experimental results suggest that BiCo can obtain quite competitive performance in comparison to eight state-of-the-art-constrained multiobjective evolutionary optimizers.},

  abstract     = {It has been proved that the determination of independent components (ICs) in the independent component analysis (ICA) can be attributed to calculating the eigenpairs of high-order statistical tensors of the data. However, previous works can only obtain approximate solutions, which may affect the accuracy of the ICs. In addition, the number of ICs would need to be set manually. Recently, an algorithm based on semidefinite programming (SDP) has been proposed, which utilizes the first-order gradient information of the Lagrangian function and can obtain all the accurate real eigenpairs. In this article, for the first time, we introduce this into the ICA field, which tends to further improve the accuracy of the ICs. Note that the number of eigenpairs of symmetric tensors is usually larger than the number of ICs, indicating that the results directly obtained by SDP are redundant. Thus, in practice, it is necessary to introduce second-order derivative information to identify local extremum solutions. Therefore, originating from the SDP method, we present a new modified version, called modified SDP (MSDP), which incorporates the concept of the projected Hessian matrix into SDP and, thus, can intellectually exclude redundant ICs and select true ICs. Some cases that have been tested in the experiments demonstrate its effectiveness. Experiments on the image/sound blind separation and real multi/hyperspectral image also show its superiority in improving the accuracy of ICs and automatically determining the number of ICs. In addition, the results on hyperspectral simulation and real data also demonstrate that MSDP is also capable of dealing with cases, where the number of features is less than the number of ICs.},

  abstract     = {Existing techniques on dealing with uncertain optimization problems (UOPs) mostly rely on the preference information of decision makers (DMs) or the knowledge involved in probability distributions on uncertainties. Actually, accurate preferences and distribution information of uncertainties are hard to obtain due to the lack of knowledge. Besides, it is risky to make assumptions on this information to handle uncertainties when DMs do not have sufficient knowledge about the problem. This article attempts to treat UOPs in an a posteriori manner and proposes a subproblem co-solving evolutionary algorithm (EA) for UOPs, namely, S-CoEA. It decomposes a UOP into a series of correlated subproblems by using the proposed decomposition strategy embedded with an original ordered weighted-sum (OWS) operator. These subproblems are formulated in different aggregation forms of sampled function values and represent different preferences on uncertainties. They are co-solved in parallel by using information from neighboring subproblems. The sampling strategy is used to gather the distribution information of uncertain functions and alleviate the detrimental effects of uncertainties. A sample-updating scheme based on historical information is presented to further improve the performance of S-CoEA. The proposed S-CoEA is compared with two state-of-the-art competitors, including the EA with the exponential sampling method (E-sampling) and the population-controlled covariance matrix self-adaptation evolution strategy (pcCMSA-ES). Numerical experiments are conducted on a series of test instances with various characteristics and different strength levels of uncertainties. Experimental results show that S-CoEA outperforms or performs competitively against competitors in the majority of 26 continuous test instances and four test cases of discrete redundancy allocation problems.},

It is shown that under the planar motion assumption or with knowledge of a vertical direction, a single affine correspondence is sufficient to recover the relative camera pose. The four cases considered are two-view planar relative motion for calibrated cameras as a closed-form and least-squares solutions, a closed-form solution for unknown focal length, and the case of a known vertical direction. These algorithms can be used efficiently for outlier detection within a RANSAC loop and for initial motion estimation. All the methods are evaluated on both synthetic data and real-world datasets.

To this aim, a novel amplitude-limited PD-SMC control scheme is established to ensure a stable performance-oriented tracking control of the overall closed-loop system. Importantly, different from most existing control methods, the designed tracking controller purposely employs beneficial nonlinear stiffness and damping of a novel bioinspired reference model and deliberately utilizes useful disturbance response on the active suspension system, so as to improve the convergence speed and reduce control energy cost simultaneously. The asymptotic stability is theoretically proved by a rigorous Lyapunov-based analysis. To the best of our knowledge, this is a unique control scheme for active suspension systems which can technically take several critical control practice issues into account with guaranteed excellent performance simultaneously, including energy savings, actuator saturation, unexpected disturbances, etc. The superior performance is well validated with a series of experiments, and carefully compared to several existing control methods. The results of this study would definitely present a unique insight and an alternative approach to active controller designs via exploiting beneficial nonlinear and disturbance effects for better control performance and lower energy cost simultaneously.},

Moreover, the closed-loop system asymptotic stability with PCR is ensured simultaneously. To deal with this problem, a modified game algebraic Riccati equation (MGARE) is proposed, which is different from the game algebraic Riccati equation in the traditional ${H}_{\infty } $ control problem due to the state cost being lost. Therefore, a unique positive-definite solution of the MGARE is theoretically analyzed with its existing conditions. In addition, based on this formulation, a novel approach is proposed to solve the actuator magnitude saturation problem with the system dynamics being exactly known. To relax the requirement of the knowledge of system dynamics, a model-free policy iteration approach is proposed to compute the solution of this problem.

  abstract     = {Recently, supervised cross-modal hashing has attracted much attention and achieved promising performance. To learn hash functions and binary codes, most methods globally exploit the supervised information, for example, preserving an at-least-one pairwise similarity into hash codes or reconstructing the label matrix with binary codes. However, due to the hardness of the discrete optimization problem, they are usually time consuming on large-scale datasets. In addition, they neglect the class correlation in supervised information. From another point of view, they only explore the global similarity of data but overlook the local similarity hidden in the data distribution. To address these issues, we present an efficient supervised cross-modal hashing method, that is, fast cross-modal hashing (FCMH). It leverages not only global similarity information but also the local similarity in a group. Specifically, training samples are partitioned into groups; thereafter, the local similarity in each group is extracted. Moreover, the class correlation in labels is also exploited and embedded into the learning of binary codes. In addition, to solve the discrete optimization problem, we further propose an efficient discrete optimization algorithm with a well-designed group updating scheme, making its computational complexity linear to the size of the training set. In light of this, it is more efficient and scalable to large-scale datasets. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that FCMH outperforms some state-of-the-art cross-modal hashing approaches in terms of both retrieval accuracy and learning efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Increasingly, the task of detecting and recognizing the actions of a human has been delegated to some form of neural network processing camera or wearable sensor data. Due to the degree to which the camera can be affected by lighting and wearable sensors scantiness, neither one modality can capture the required data to perform the task confidently. That being the case, range sensors, like light detection and ranging (LiDAR), can complement the process to perceive the environment more robustly. Most recently, researchers have been exploring ways to apply convolutional neural networks to 3-D data. These methods typically rely on a single modality and cannot draw on information from complementing sensor streams to improve accuracy. This article proposes a framework to tackle human activity recognition by leveraging the benefits of sensor fusion and multimodal machine learning. Given both RGB and point cloud data, our method describes the activities being performed by subjects using regions with a convolutional neural network (R-CNN) and a 3-D modified Fisher vector network. Evaluated on a custom captured multimodal dataset demonstrates that the model outputs remarkably accurate human activity classification (90\%).

  abstract     = {This article proposes a neighbors’ similarity-based fuzzy community detection (FCD) method, which we call “NeSiFC.” In the proposed NeSiFC approach, we compute the similarity between two neighbors by introducing a modified local random walk (mLRW). Basically, in a network, a node and its’ neighbors with noticeable similarities among them construct a community. To measure this similarity, we introduce a new metric, called the peripheral similarity index (PSI). This PSI is used to construct the transition probability matrix for the mLRW. The mLRW is applied for each node until it meets a parameter called step coefficient. The mLRW gives better neighbors’ similarity for community detection. Finally, a fuzzy membership function is used iteratively to compute the membership degrees for all nodes with reference to existing communities. The proposed NeSiFC has no dependence on the network characteristics, and no adjustment or fine tuning of more than one parameter is needed. To show the efficacy of the proposed NeSiFC approach, we provide a thorough comparative performance analysis considering a set of well-known FCD algorithms viz., the genetic algorithm for fuzzy community detection, membership degree propagation, center-based fuzzy graph clustering, FMM/H2, and FuzAg on a set of popular benchmarks, as well as real-world datasets. For both disjoint and overlapping community structures, results of various accuracy and quality metrics indicate the outstanding performance of our proposed NeSiFC approach. The asymptotic complexity of the proposed NeSiFC is found as O(n 2 ).},

  abstract     = {Thanks to large-scale labeled training data, deep neural networks (DNNs) have obtained remarkable success in many vision and multimedia tasks. However, because of the presence of domain shift, the learned knowledge of the well-trained DNNs cannot be well generalized to new domains or datasets that have few labels. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) studies the problem of transferring models trained on one labeled source domain to another unlabeled target domain. In this article, we focus on UDA in visual emotion analysis for both emotion distribution learning and dominant emotion classification. Specifically, we design a novel end-to-end cycle-consistent adversarial model, called CycleEmotionGAN++. First, we generate an adapted domain to align the source and target domains on the pixel level by improving CycleGAN with a multiscale structured cycle-consistency loss. During the image translation, we propose a dynamic emotional semantic consistency loss to preserve the emotion labels of the source images. Second, we train a transferable task classifier on the adapted domain with feature-level alignment between the adapted and target domains. We conduct extensive UDA experiments on the Flickr-LDL and Twitter-LDL datasets for distribution learning and ArtPhoto and Flickr and Instagram datasets for emotion classification. The results demonstrate the significant improvements yielded by the proposed CycleEmotionGAN++ compared to state-of-the-art UDA approaches.},

  abstract     = {Label distribution learning (LDL) is the state-of-the-art approach to dealing with a number of real-world applications, such as chronological age estimation from a face image, where there is an inherent similarity among adjacent age labels. LDL takes into account the semantic similarity by assigning a label distribution to each instance. The well-known Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence is the widely used loss function for the LDL framework. However, the KL divergence does not fully and effectively capture the semantic similarity among age labels, thus leading to suboptimal performance. In this article, we propose a novel loss function based on the optimal transport theory for the LDL-based age estimation. A ground metric function plays an important role in the optimal transport formulation. It should be carefully determined based on the underlying geometric structure of the label space of the application in-hand. The label space in the age estimation problem has a specific geometric structure, that is, closer ages have more inherent semantic relationships. Inspired by this, we devise a novel ground metric function, which enables the loss function to increase the influence of highly correlated ages; thus exploiting the semantic similarity among ages more effectively than the existing loss functions. We then use the proposed loss function, namely, $\gamma $ –Wasserstein loss, for training a deep neural network (DNN). This leads to a notoriously computationally expensive and nonconvex optimization problem. Following the standard methodology, we formulate the optimization function as a convex problem and then use an efficient iterative algorithm to update the parameters of the DNN. Extensive experiments in age estimation on different benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.},

  abstract     = {This article introduces an uncertainty-aware cloud-fog-based framework for power management of smart grids using a multiagent-based system. The power management is a social welfare optimization problem. A multiagent-based algorithm is suggested to solve this problem, in which agents are defined as volunteering consumers and dispatchable generators. In the proposed method, every consumer can voluntarily put a price on its power demand at each interval of operation to benefit from the equal opportunity of contributing to the power management process provided for all generation and consumption units. In addition, the uncertainty analysis using a deep learning method is also applied in a distributive way with the local calculation of prediction intervals for sources with stochastic nature in the system, such as loads, small wind turbines (WTs), and rooftop photovoltaics (PVs). Using the predicted ranges of load demand and stochastic generation outputs, a range for power consumption/generation is also provided for each agent called “preparation range” to demonstrate the predicted boundary, where the accepted power consumption/generation of an agent might occur, considering the uncertain sources. Besides, fog computing is deployed as a critical infrastructure for fast calculation and providing local storage for reasonable pricing. Cloud services are also proposed for virtual applications as efficient databases and computation units. The performance of the proposed framework is examined on two smart grid test systems and compared with other well-known methods. The results prove the capability of the proposed method to obtain the optimal outcomes in a short time for any scale of grid.},

Multiple redundant communication channels are utilized between the sensors and the remote estimator to enhance the reliability of data transmissions. In order to characterize the transmission delays in network-based communication, a family of random variables with partly known probabilities, which are independent and identically distributed, is adopted to describe the random behavior of the transmission delays with the redundant channels. The objective of this work is to put forward a PI state estimator such that the dynamics of the estimation error is exponentially mean-square stable and satisfies the prescribed $H_{\infty }$ performance index of the disturbance attenuation/rejection. By employing the stochastic analysis approach, the error dynamics of the SE under the proposed state estimator is analyzed and sufficient conditions are obtained to ensure the existence of the required PI state estimator. Furthermore, the desired estimator parameters are derived by solving a nonlinear optimization problem. Finally, two simulation examples are exploited to demonstrate the validity of the proposed SE scheme.},

In this regard, the transient faults in the power lines, and subsequent switching of associated circuit breakers are modeled as a Markov chain. Based on this, the power systems are described as discrete-time Markov jump systems. The focus is mainly to design the control for Markov jump-based power systems (MJPSs) when modes of the control asynchronously run with the modes of power systems. To do this, a hidden Markov model technique is used to characterize the nonsynchronization between the control and system. By constructing the mode-dependent stochastic Lyapunov function, the sufficient conditions are acquired in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), which ensure not only the stochastic stability of the resulting hidden MJPSs but also the existence of the desired control.

The asynchronous impulsive protocols only permit communication at impulsive instants and each agent has its own communication instants independently. Moreover, to improve system performance, an offset only containing desired formation information is introduced.

Many topological and dynamic properties of complex networks can be studied in this way. In this article, the $m$ -fission operation is constructed based on the phenomenon of node splitting in the network, which is quite common in complex networks. Many network models, including dual Sierpinski gaskets, are built based on this operation, but it has never been systematically studied. Then, the topological and dynamic properties of the $m$ -fission operation and the corresponding iterative fission network model are studied, and the influence of the operation on the network structure is revealed. Among them, the topological properties of the network include diameter, degree distribution, clustering coefficient, average distance, and modularity. By studying these properties, it can be concluded that the iterative fission network is a fractal homogeneous network with high clustering and high community characteristics. Since the dynamic properties are closely related to the spectrum of the Laplacian matrix corresponding to the network, the iterative relation of the spectrum in operation is studied, and the complete solution of the spectrum of the iterative fission network is obtained. Based on the above results, we calculate the analytical expressions of the characteristic quantities related to the dynamic properties on the network, including the Kirchhoff index and the average of hitting times. Finally, due to the close connection between the network model and the system, we further analyzed the consensus problems on the system corresponding to the network, including convergence rate, delay robustness, first-order noise coherence, and second-order noise coherence.},

Consequently, the study of neural networks with multiring structure is of more practical significance. In this article, a class of high-dimensional neural networks with three rings and multiple delays is proposed. Such network has an asymmetric structure, which entails that each ring has a different number of neurons. Simultaneously, three rings share a common node. Selecting the time delay as the bifurcation parameter, the stability switches are ascertained and the sufficient condition of Hopf bifurcation is derived. It is further revealed that both the number of neurons in the ring and the total number of neurons have obvious influences on the stability and bifurcation of the neural network. Ultimately, some numerical simulations are given to illustrate our qualitative results and to underpin the discussion.},

  abstract     = {Particle swarm optimizer (PSO) and mobile robot swarm are two typical swarm techniques. Many applications emerge separately along both of them while the similarity between them is rarely considered. When a solution space is a certain region in reality, a robot swarm can replace a particle swarm to explore the optimal solution by performing PSO. In this way, a mobile robot swarm should be able to efficiently explore an area just like the particle swarm and uninterruptedly work even under the shortage of robots or in the case of unexpected failure of robots. Furthermore, the moving distances of robots are highly constrained because energy and time can be costly. Inspired by such requirements, this article proposes a moving-distance-minimized PSO (MPSO) for a mobile robot swarm to minimize the total moving distance of its robots while performing optimization. The distances between the current robot positions and the particle ones in the next generation are utilized to derive paths for robots such that the total distance that robots move is minimized, hence minimizing the energy and time for a robot swarm to locate the optima. Experiments on 28 CEC2013 benchmark functions show the advantage of the proposed method over the standard PSO. By adopting the given algorithm, the moving distance can be reduced by more than 66\% and the makespan can be reduced by nearly 70\% while offering the same optimization effects.},

  abstract     = {This work explores the effectiveness of the intensity-varied closed-loop noise stimulation on the oscillation suppression in the Parkinsonian state. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is the standard therapy for Parkinson’s disease (PD), but its effects need to be improved. The noise stimulation has compelling results in alleviating the PD state. However, in the open-loop control scheme, the noise stimulation parameters cannot be self-adjusted to adapt to the amplitude of the synchronized neuronal activities in real time. Thus, based on the delayed-feedback control algorithm, an intensity-varied closed-loop noise stimulation strategy is proposed. Based on a computational model of the basal ganglia (BG) that can present the intrinsic properties of the BG neurons and their interactions with the thalamic neurons, the proposed stimulation strategy is tested. Simulation results show that the noise stimulation suppresses the pathological beta (12–35 Hz) oscillations without any new rhythms in other bands compared with traditional high-frequency DBS. The intensity-varied closed-loop noise stimulation has a more profound role in removing the pathological beta oscillations and improving the thalamic reliability than open-loop noise stimulation, especially for different PD states. And the closed-loop noise stimulation enlarges the parameter space of the delayed-feedback control algorithm due to the randomness of noise signals. We also provide a theoretical analysis of the effective parameter domain of the delayed-feedback control algorithm by simplifying the BG model to an oscillator model. This exploration may guide a new approach to treating PD by optimizing the noise-induced improvement of the BG dysfunction.},

  abstract     = {Evolutionary multiobjective clustering (MOC) algorithms have shown promising potential to outperform conventional single-objective clustering algorithms, especially when the number of clusters $k$ is not set before clustering. However, the computational burden becomes a tricky problem due to the extensive search space and fitness computational time of the evolving population, especially when the data size is large. This article proposes a new, hierarchical, topology-based cluster representation for scalable MOC, which can simplify the search procedure and decrease computational overhead. A coarse-to-fine-trained topological structure that fits the spatial distribution of the data is utilized to identify a set of seed points/nodes, then a tree-based graph is built to represent clusters. During optimization, a bipartite graph partitioning strategy incorporated with the graph nodes helps in performing a cluster ensemble operation to generate offspring solutions more effectively. For the determination of the final result, which is underexplored in the existing methods, the usage of a cluster ensemble strategy is also presented, whether $k$ is provided or not. Comparison experiments are conducted on a series of different data distributions, revealing the superiority of the proposed algorithm in terms of both clustering performance and computing efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Bayesian optimization (BO) is well known to be sample efficient for solving black-box problems. However, BO algorithms may get stuck in suboptimal solutions even with plenty of samples. Intrinsically, such a suboptimal problem of BO can attribute to the poor surrogate accuracy of the trained Gaussian process (GP), particularly that in the regions where the optimal solutions locate. Hence, we propose to build multiple GP models instead of a single GP surrogate to complement each other, thus resolving the suboptimal problem of BO. Nevertheless, according to the bias-variance tradeoff equation, the individual prediction errors can increase when increasing the diversity of models, which may lead even worse overall surrogate accuracy. On the other hand, based on the theory of the Rademacher complexity, it has been proven that exploiting the agreement of models on unlabeled information can reduce the complexity of hypothesis space, therefore achieving the required surrogate accuracy with fewer samples. Such value of model agreement has been extensively demonstrated for co-training style algorithms to boost model accuracy with a small portion of samples. Inspired by the above, we propose a novel BO algorithm labeled as co-learning BO (CLBO), which exploits both model diversity and agreement on unlabeled information to improve the overall surrogate accuracy with limited samples, therefore achieving more efficient global optimization. Through tests on five numerical toy problems and three engineering benchmarks, the effectiveness of the proposed CLBO has been well demonstrated.},

However, current studies usually concentrated on only one of the two features. Toward filling this gap, in the present study, we develop a novel knowledge-aware Bayesian model taking into consideration accuracy and transparency simultaneously. Real-world case studies based on four years’ territory-wide electronic health records are conducted to test the model.

  abstract     = {A colored traveling salesman problem (CTSP) as a generalization of the well-known multiple traveling salesman problem utilizes colors to distinguish the accessibility of individual cities to salesmen. This work formulates a precedence-constrained CTSP (PCTSP) over hypergraphs with asymmetric city distances. It is capable of modeling the problems with operations or activities constrained to precedence relationships in many applications. Two types of precedence constraints are taken into account, i.e., 1) among individual cities and 2) among city clusters. An augmented variable neighborhood search (VNS) called POPMUSIC-based VNS (PVNS) is proposed as a main framework for solving PCTSP. It harnesses a partial optimization metaheuristic under special intensification conditions to prepare candidate sets. Moreover, a topological sort-based greedy algorithm is developed to obtain a feasible solution at the initialization phase. Next, mutation and multi-insertion of constraint-preserving exchanges are combined to produce different neighborhoods of the current solution. Two kinds of constraint-preserving $k$ -exchange are adopted to serve as a strong local search means. Extensive experiments are conducted on 34 cases. For the sake of comparison, Lin–Kernighan heuristic, two genetic algorithms and three VNS methods are adapted to PCTSP and fine-tuned by using an automatic algorithm configurator-irace package. The experimental results show that PVNS outperforms them in terms of both search ability and convergence rate. In addition, the study of four PVNS variants each lacking an important operator reveals that all operators play significant roles in PVNS.},

  abstract     = {Unsupervised cross-domain fault diagnosis has been actively researched in recent years. It learns transferable features that reduce distribution inconsistency between source and target domains without target supervision. Most of the existing cross-domain fault diagnosis approaches are developed based on the consistency assumption of the source and target fault category sets. This assumption, however, is generally challenged in practice, as different working conditions can have different fault category sets. To solve the fault diagnosis problem under both domain and category inconsistencies, a multisource-refined transfer network is proposed in this article. First, a multisource-domain-refined adversarial adaptation strategy is designed to reduce the refined categorywise distribution inconsistency within each source–target domain pair. It avoids the negative transfer trap caused by conventional global-domainwise-forced alignments. Then, a multiple classifier complementation module is developed by complementing and transferring the source classifiers to the target domain to leverage different diagnostic knowledge existing in various sources. Different classifiers are complemented by the similarity scores produced by the adaptation module, and the complemented smooth predictions are used to guide the refined adaptation. Thus, the refined adversarial adaptation and the classifier complementation can benefit from each other in the training stage, yielding target-faults-discriminative and domain-refined-indistinguishable feature representations. Extensive experiments on two cases demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method when domain and category inconsistencies coexist.},

  abstract     = {When a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D) is applied to solve problems with discontinuous Pareto front (PF), a set of evenly distributed weight vectors may lead to many solutions assembling in boundaries of the discontinuous PF. To overcome this limitation, this article proposes a mechanism of resetting weight vectors (RWVs) for MOEA/D. When the RWV mechanism is triggered, a classic data clustering algorithm DBSCAN is used to categorize current solutions into several parts. A classic statistical method called principal component analysis (PCA) is used to determine the ideal number of solutions in each part of PF. Thereafter, PCA is used again for each part of PF separately and virtual targeted solutions are generated by linear interpolation methods. Then, the new weight vectors are reset according to the interrelationship between the optimal solutions and the weight vectors under the Tchebycheff decomposition framework. Finally, taking advantage of the current obtained solutions, the new solutions in the decision space are updated via a linear interpolation method. Numerical experiments show that the proposed MOEA/D-RWV can achieve good results for bi-objective and tri-objective optimization problems with discontinuous PF. In addition, the test on a recently proposed MaF benchmark suite demonstrates that MOEA/D-RWV also works for some problems with other complicated characteristics.},

First, tendency features are selected based on the batch samples. Then, a dynamic multistep regression model is built for well describing the influence of uncertainties. Furthermore, the degradation tendency is estimated to monitor degradation status continuously. As poorly estimated hyperparameters of RVM may result in low prediction accuracy, the established RVM model is extended to the probabilistic manifold for estimating the degradation tendency exactly. The RUL is then prognosticated by the first hitting time (FHT) method based on the estimated degradation tendency.

The analysis approach is to use a linear transformation to convert the original system into an equivalent system and then merge the nonlinear error term into the convex null of the agents’ states so as to prove the consensus convergence of the system based on the properties of the non-negative matrices. It is shown that all agents finally converge to a consensus point while their positions stay in the corresponding constraint sets as long as the union of the communication graphs among each certain time interval is strongly connected even when the communication delays are considered.

The fuzzy $\beta $ neighborhood serves as the basic granulation unit of fuzzy $\beta $ covering. In this article, a new discernibility measure with respect to the fuzzy $\beta $ neighborhood is proposed to characterize the distinguishing ability of a fuzzy covering family. To this end, the parameterized fuzzy $\beta $ neighborhood is introduced to describe the similarity between samples, where the distinguishing ability of a given fuzzy covering family can be evaluated. Some variants of the discernibility measure, such as the joint discernibility measure, conditional discernibility measure, and mutual discernibility measure, are then presented to reflect the change of distinguishing ability caused by different fuzzy covering families. These measures have similar properties as the Shannon entropy. Finally, to deal with knowledge reduction with fuzzy $\beta $ covering, we formalize a new type of decision table, that is, fuzzy $\beta $ covering decision tables. The data reduction of fuzzy covering decision tables is addressed from the viewpoint of maintaining the distinguishing ability of a fuzzy covering family, and a forward attribute reduction algorithm is designed to reduce redundant fuzzy coverings. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method can effectively evaluate the uncertainty of different types of datasets and exhibit better performance in attribute reduction compared with some existing algorithms.},

By designing a generalized performance index, the $H_{\infty }$ , $L_{2}-L_{\infty }$ , and dissipative fuzzy filtering problems with network transmission delay are addressed. The adaptive event-triggered scheme (ETS) is proposed to guarantee that the IT2 T–S fuzzy MJSs are finite-time boundedness (FTB) and, thus, lower the energy consumption of communication while ensuring the performance of the system with extended dissipativity. Different from the conventional triggering mechanism, in this article, the parameters of the triggering function are based on an adaptive law, which is obtained online rather than as a predefined constant. Besides, the asynchronous phenomenon between the plant and the filter is considered, which is described by a hidden Markov model (HMM). Finally, two examples are presented to show the availability of the proposed algorithms.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) have been demonstrated to show promising performance in feature selection (FS) tasks. However, designing an MOEA for high-dimensional FS is more challenging due to the curse of dimensionality. To address this problem, in this article, a steering-matrix-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithm, called SM-MOEA, is proposed. In SM-MOEA, a steering matrix is suggested and harnessed to guide the evolution of the population, which not only improves the search efficiency greatly but also obtains the feature subsets with high quality. Specifically, each element SM $(i, j)$ in the steering matrix SM reflects the probability of the $j$ th feature that is selected in the $i$ th individual (feature subset), which is generated by considering the importance of both the feature $j$ and the individual $i$ . Based on the suggested steering matrix, two important operators referred to as dimensionality reduction and individual repairing operators are developed to effectively steer the population evolution in each generation. In addition, an effective initialization and update strategy for the steering matrix is also designed to further improve the performance of SM-MOEA. The experimental results on 12 high-dimensional datasets with the number of features ranging from 3000 to 13 000 demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over several state-of-the-art algorithms (including single-objective and MOEAs for high-dimensional FS) in terms of both the number and quality of the selected features.},

  abstract     = {Electronic health records (EHR) consist of longitudinal clinical observations portrayed with sparsity, irregularity, and high dimensionality, which become major obstacles in drawing reliable downstream clinical outcomes. Although there exist great numbers of imputation methods to tackle these issues, most of them ignore correlated features, temporal dynamics, and entirely set aside the uncertainty. Since the missing value estimates involve the risk of being inaccurate, it is appropriate for the method to handle the less certain information differently than the reliable data. In that regard, we can use the uncertainties in estimating the missing values as the fidelity score to be further utilized to alleviate the risk of biased missing value estimates. In this work, we propose a novel variational-recurrent imputation network, which unifies an imputation and a prediction network by taking into account the correlated features, temporal dynamics, as well as uncertainty. Specifically, we leverage the deep generative model in the imputation, which is based on the distribution among variables, and a recurrent imputation network to exploit the temporal relations, in conjunction with utilization of the uncertainty. We validated the effectiveness of our proposed model on two publicly available real-world EHR datasets: 1) PhysioNet Challenge 2012 and 2) MIMIC-III, and compared the results with other competing state-of-the-art methods in the literature.},

  abstract     = {The broad learning system (BLS) is an algorithm that facilitates feature representation learning and data classification. Although weights of BLS are obtained by analytical computation, which brings better generalization and higher efficiency, BLS suffers from two drawbacks: 1) the performance depends on the number of hidden nodes, which requires manual tuning, and 2) double random mappings bring about the uncertainty, which leads to poor resistance to noise data, as well as unpredictable effects on performance. To address these issues, a kernel-based BLS (KBLS) method is proposed by projecting feature nodes obtained from the first random mapping into kernel space. This manipulation reduces the uncertainty, which contributes to performance improvements with the fixed number of hidden nodes, and indicates that manually tuning is no longer needed. Moreover, to further improve the stability and noise resistance of KBLS, a progressive ensemble framework is proposed, in which the residual of the previous base classifiers is used to train the following base classifier. We conduct comparative experiments against the existing state-of-the-art hierarchical learning methods on multiple noisy real-world datasets.

Since most of the negative samples can be easily discriminated from positive samples in graphs, their poor competitiveness weakens the function of the generator. Inspired by the sales skills in the market, in this article, we present tripartite adversarial training for network embeddings (TriATNE), a novel adversarial learning framework for learning stable and robust node embeddings. TriATNE consists of three players: 1) producer; 2) seller; and 3) customer. The producer strives to learn the representation of each sample (node pair), making it easy for the customer to differentiate between the positive and the negative, while the seller tries to confuse the customer by selecting realistic-looking samples. The customer, a biased evaluation metric, provides feedback for training the producer and the seller. To further enhance the robustness of node embedding, we model the customer as a two-layer neural network, where each unit in the hidden layer can be regarded as a customer with different preferences. TriATNE also plays against the producer by adjusting the weight of each customer. We test the performance of TriATNE on two common tasks: classification as well as link prediction. The experimental results on various publicly available datasets show that TriATNE can exploit the network structure well.},

Compared with the existing results, where only the boundedness of the estimation error is guaranteed under DoS attacks, the exponential convergence of the estimation error is achieved by employing the proposed observer scheme, such that the estimation performance is improved.

To this end, three kinds of FS methods are effectively integrated into the proposed algorithm based on their respective advantages. In the first and second phases, a filter FS method and a feature clustering-based method with low computational cost are designed to reduce the search space used by the third phase. After that, the third phase applies oneself to finding an optimal feature subset by using an evolutionary algorithm with the global searchability. Moreover, a symmetric uncertainty-based feature deletion method, a fast correlation-guided feature clustering strategy, and an improved integer PSO are developed to improve the performance of the three phases, respectively. Finally, the proposed algorithm is validated on 18 publicly available real-world datasets in comparison with nine FS algorithms.

  abstract     = {Hierarchical structures of labels usually exist in large-scale classification tasks, where labels can be organized into a tree-shaped structure. The nodes near the root stand for coarser labels, while the nodes close to leaves mean the finer labels. We label unseen samples from the root node to a leaf node, and obtain multigranularity predictions in the hierarchical classification. Sometimes, we cannot obtain a leaf decision due to uncertainty or incomplete information. In this case, we should stop at an internal node, rather than going ahead rashly. However, most existing hierarchical classification models aim at maximizing the percentage of correct predictions, and do not take the risk of misclassifications into account. Such risk is critically important in some real-world applications, and can be measured by the distance between the ground truth and the predicted classes in the class hierarchy. In this work, we utilize the semantic hierarchy to define the classification risk and design an optimization technique to reduce such risk. By defining the conservative risk and the precipitant risk as two competing risk factors, we construct the balanced conservative/precipitant semantic (BCPS) risk matrix across all nodes in the semantic hierarchy with user-defined weights to adjust the tradeoff between two kinds of risks. We then model the classification process on the semantic hierarchy as a sequential decision-making task. We design an algorithm to derive the risk-minimized predictions. There are two modules in this model: 1) multitask hierarchical learning and 2) deep reinforce multigranularity learning. The first one learns classification confidence scores of multiple levels.

  abstract     = {This article studies the distributed average tracking (DAT) problem pertaining to a discrete-time linear time-invariant multiagent network, which is subject to, concurrently, input delays, random packet drops, and reference noise. The problem amounts to an integrated design of delay and a packet-drop-tolerant algorithm and determining the ultimate upper bound of the tracking error between agents’ states and the average of the reference signals. The investigation is driven by the goal of devising a practically more attainable average tracking algorithm, thereby extending the existing work in the literature, which largely ignored the aforementioned uncertainties. For this purpose, a blend of techniques from Kalman filtering, multistage consensus filtering, and predictive control is employed, which gives rise to a simple yet comepelling DAT algorithm that is robust to the initialization error and allows the tradeoff between communication/computation cost and stationary-state tracking error. Due to the inherent coupling among different control components, convergence analysis is significantly challenging. Nevertheless, it is revealed that the allowable values of the algorithm parameters rely upon the maximal degree of an expected network, while the convergence speed depends upon the second smallest eigenvalue of the same network’s topology. The effectiveness of the theoretical results is verified by a numerical example.},

The proposed FDHLRNN is a fully regulated network, which can be simply considered as a combination of a fuzzy neural network (FNN) and a radial basis function neural network (RBF NN) to improve the accuracy of a nonlinear approximation, so it has the advantages of these two neural networks. The main advantage of the proposed new FDHLRNN is that the output values of the FNN and DHLRNN are considered at the same time, and the outer layer feedback is added to increase the dynamic approximation ability. FDHLRNN was designed to approximate the nonlinear sliding-mode equivalent control term to reduce the switching gain. To ensure the best approximation capability and control performance, the proposed FDHLRNN using TSMC is applied for the second-order nonlinear model. Two simulation examples are implemented to verify that the proposed FDHLRNN has faster convergence speed and the FDHLRNN with TSMC has good dynamic property and robustness, and a hardware experimental study with an active power filter proves the feasibility of the method.},

To this end, we first introduce a complex dynamical network model with distributed delayed couplings, and design both the linear feedback pinning control and adaptive feedback pinning control to push SLS to the desired trajectories. Second, we obtain a series of sufficient conditions to achieve SLS to a desired trajectory with global stability. What is more, the control flow of SLS is given to show how to pick the pinned nodes accurately and set the feedback gains as well. Finally, since time-varying delay is common, we extend the constant time delay in SLS to be time varying. We find that the proposed pinning control schemes are still feasible if the coupling terms are appropriately adjusted.

With the rapid growth of spatial datasets, the usefulness of co-location patterns is strongly limited by the huge amount of discovered patterns. Although several methods have been proposed to reduce the number of discovered patterns, these statistical algorithms are unable to guarantee that the extracted co-location patterns are user preferred. Therefore, it is crucial to help the decision maker discover his/her preferred co-location patterns via efficient interactive procedures. This article proposes a new interactive approach that enables the user to discover his/her preferred co-location patterns. First, we present a novel and flexible interactive framework to assist the user in discovering his/her preferred co-location patterns. Second, we propose using ontologies to measure the similarity of two co-location patterns. Furthermore, we design a pruning scheme by introducing a pattern filtering model for expressing the user’s preference, to reduce the number of the final output. By applying our proposed approach over voluminous sets of co-location patterns, we show that the number of filtered co-location patterns is reduced to several dozen or less and, on average, 80\% of the selected co-location patterns are user preferred.},

However, most of the CCA-based FD methods assume both Gaussianity of measurement signals and linear relationships among variables. These assumptions may be improper in some practical scenarios so that direct applications of these CCA-based FD strategies are arguably not optimal. With the aid of neural networks, this work proposes a new nonlinear counterpart called a single-side CCA (SsCCA) to enhance FD performance. The contributions of this work are four-fold: 1) an objective function for the nonlinear CCA is first reformulated, based on which a generalized solution is presented; 2) for the practical implementation, a particular solution of SsCCA is developed; 3) an SsCCA-based FD algorithm is designed for nonlinear systems, whose optimal FD ability is illustrated via theoretical analysis; and 4) based on the difference in FD results between two test statistics, fault diagnosis can be directly achieved. The studies on a nonlinear three-tank system are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed SsCCA method.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, single modality-based gait recognition has been extensively explored in the analysis of medical images or other sensory data, and it is recognized that each of the established approaches has different strengths and weaknesses. As an important motor symptom, gait disturbance is usually used for diagnosis and evaluation of diseases; moreover, the use of multimodality analysis of the patient’s walking pattern compensates for the one-sidedness of single modality gait recognition methods that only learn gait changes in a single measurement dimension. The fusion of multiple measurement resources has demonstrated promising performance in the identification of gait patterns associated with individual diseases. In this article, as a useful tool, we propose a novel hybrid model to learn the gait differences between three neurodegenerative diseases, between patients with different severity levels of Parkinson’s disease, and between healthy individuals and patients, by fusing and aggregating data from multiple sensors. A spatial feature extractor (SFE) is applied to generating representative features of images or signals. In order to capture temporal information from the two modality data, a new correlative memory neural network (CorrMNN) architecture is designed for extracting temporal features. Afterward, we embed a multiswitch discriminator to associate the observations with individual state estimations. Compared with several state-of-the-art techniques, our proposed framework shows more accurate classification results.},

However, there is still a large space for theoretical explanation of the mechanism of PPO’s horizontal clipping operation, which is a key means to improve the performance of PPO. In addition, while PPO is inspired by the learning theory of trust region policy optimization (TRPO), the theoretical connection between PPO’s clipping operation and TRPO’s trust region constraint has not been well studied. In this article, we first analyze the effect of PPO’s clipping operation on the objective function of conservative policy iteration, and strictly give the theoretical relationship between PPO and TRPO. Then, a novel first-order policy gradient algorithm called authentic boundary PPO (ABPPO) is proposed, which is based on the authentic boundary setting rule. To ensure the difference between the new and old policies is better kept within the clipping range, by borrowing the idea of ABPPO, we proposed two novel improved PPO algorithms called rollback mechanism-based ABPPO (RMABPPO) and penalized point policy difference-based ABPPO (P3DABPPO), which are based on the ideas of rollback clipping and penalized point policy difference, respectively. Experiments on the continuous robotic control tasks implemented in MuJoCo show that our proposed improved PPO algorithms can effectively improve the learning stability and accelerate the learning speed compared with the original PPO.},

The proposed method can effectively identify the drift region and utilize information on the drift region to filter the data sample for training models.

  abstract     = {This article is concerned with the quantized output-feedback control problem for unmanned marine vehicles (UMVs) with thruster faults and ocean environment disturbances via a sliding-mode technique. First, based on output information and compensator states, an augmented sliding surface is constructed and sliding-mode stability through linear matrix inequalities can be guaranteed. An improved quantization parameter dynamic adjustment scheme, with a larger quantization parameter adjustment range, is then given to compensate for quantization errors effectively. Combining the quantization parameter adjustment strategy and adaptive mechanism, a novel robust sliding-mode controller is designed to guarantee the asymptotic stability of a closed-loop UMV system. As a result, a smaller lower bound of the thruster fault factor than that of the existing result can be tolerated, which brings more practical applications. Finally, the comparison simulation results have illustrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {The location information of road and lane lines is the supremely important thing for the automatic drive and auxiliary drive. The detection accuracy of these two elements dramatically affects the reliability and practicality of the whole system. In real applications, the traffic scene can be very complicated, which makes it particularly challenging to obtain the precise location of road and lane lines. Commonly used deep learning-based object detection models perform pretty well on the lane line and road detection tasks, but they still encounter false detection and missing detection frequently. Besides, existing convolution neural network (CNN) structures only pay attention to the information flow between layers, while it cannot fully utilize the spatial information inside the layers. To address those problems, we propose an attention-based spatial segmentation network for traffic scene understanding. We use the convolutional attention module to improve the network’s understanding capacity of spatial location distribution. Spatial CNN (SCNN) obtains through the information flow within one single convolutional layer and improves the spatial relationship modeling ability of the network. The experimental results demonstrate that this method effectively improves the neural network’s application ability of the spatial information, thereby improving the effect of traffic scene understanding. Furthermore, a pixel-level road segmentation dataset called NWPU Road Dataset is built to help improve the process of traffic scene understanding.},

  abstract     = {We present a framework to address a class of sequential decision-making problems. Our framework features learning the optimal control policy with robustness to noisy data, determining the unknown state and action parameters, and performing sensitivity analysis with respect to problem parameters. We consider two broad categories of sequential decision-making problems modeled as infinite horizon Markov decision processes (MDPs) with (and without) an absorbing state. The central idea underlying our framework is to quantify exploration in terms of the Shannon entropy of the trajectories under the MDP and determine the stochastic policy that maximizes it while guaranteeing a low value of the expected cost along a trajectory. This resulting policy enhances the quality of exploration early on in the learning process, and consequently allows faster convergence rates and robust solutions even in the presence of noisy data as demonstrated in our comparisons to popular algorithms, such as $Q$ -learning, Double $Q$ -learning, and entropy regularized Soft $Q$ -learning. The framework extends to the class of parameterized MDP and RL problems, where states and actions are parameter dependent, and the objective is to determine the optimal parameters along with the corresponding optimal policy. Here, the associated cost function can possibly be nonconvex with multiple poor local minima. Simulation results applied to a 5G small cell network problem demonstrate the successful determination of communication routes and the small cell locations. We also obtain sensitivity measures to problem parameters and robustness to noisy environment data.},

  abstract     = {In this article, a novel training paradigm inspired by quantum computation is proposed for deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with experience replay. In contrast to the traditional experience replay mechanism in DRL, the proposed DRL with quantum-inspired experience replay (DRL-QER) adaptively chooses experiences from the replay buffer according to the complexity and the replayed times of each experience (also called transition), to achieve a balance between exploration and exploitation. In DRL-QER, transitions are first formulated in quantum representations and then the preparation operation and depreciation operation are performed on the transitions. In this process, the preparation operation reflects the relationship between the temporal-difference errors (TD-errors) and the importance of the experiences, while the depreciation operation is taken into account to ensure the diversity of the transitions. The experimental results on Atari 2600 games show that DRL-QER outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms, such as DRL-PER and DCRL on most of these games with improved training efficiency and is also applicable to such memory-based DRL approaches as double network and dueling network.},

  abstract     = {For safe and efficient navigation of heterogeneous multiple mobile robots (HMRs), it is essential to incorporate dynamics (mass and inertia) in motion control algorithms. Many methods rely only on kinematics or point-mass models, resulting in conservative results or occasionally failure. This is especially true for robots with different masses. In this article, we develop a novel navigation methodology for a distributed scheme by incorporating the robots’ dynamics through calculating the time to collision (TTC) and designing a new controller accordingly that avoids collisions. We first propose a new predictive collision term by TTC that will be used to quantify imminent collisions among HMRs. Subsequently, using this term, we develop a novel nonlinear controller that explicitly incorporates TTC in the design and guarantees collision-free motion. Simulations and experiments were performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed methods. We first compared the results of our proposed approach with controllers that only consider the robots’ kinematics. It was shown that the proposed control strategy (a TTC-based controller) proves to be less conservative when determining safe motions. Specifically, for environments with limited space, it was demonstrated that using robots’ kinematics may result in a collision, while our strategy results in safe motion. We also performed experiments that proved collision-free navigation of HMRs with this approach. The outcomes of this work provide more reliable motion control for HMRs, especially when the robots’ masses or inertias are significantly different, for example, warehouses. The developments in this work are also applicable to vehicles and can therefore be beneficial in automated collision avoidance in autonomous driving and intelligent transportation.},

If the dataset used to train the network lacks diversity, modality, or sufficient quantities, the driver policy that controls the vehicle may induce safety risks. Although most autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs) perform well in structured surroundings, the need for human intervention significantly rises when presented with unstructured niche environments. To this end, we developed an AGV for seamless indoor and outdoor navigation to collect realistic multimodal data streams. We demonstrate one application of the AGV when applied to a self-evolving FSD framework that leverages online active machine-learning (ML) paradigms and sensor data fusion. In essence, the self-evolving AGV queries image data against a reliable data stream, ultrasound, before fusing the sensor data to improve robustness. We compare the proposed framework to one of the most prominent free space segmentation methods, DeepLabV3+ [1] . DeepLabV3+ [1] is a state-of-the-art semantic segmentation model composed of a CNN and an autodecoder. In consonance with the results, the proposed framework outperforms DeepLabV3+ [1] . The performance of the proposed framework is attributed to its ability to self-learn free space. This combination of online and active ML removes the need for large datasets typically required by a CNN. Moreover, this technique provides case-specific free space classifications based on the information gathered from the scenario at hand.},

First, by using the nominal model of the active suspension system without the uncertain parameters and the external random disturbances, an optimal control performance index is given, and the initial optimal controller is designed by using the LQR control strategy. Then, to handle the parameter uncertainties and the external disturbances, a robust optimal integral sliding-mode control strategy based on the initial optimal controller is designed, which not only can achieve the optimal control objective but also has good robustness to the uncertain parameters and external disturbances. By using the Lyapunov stability theory, stability analysis of the proposed robust optimal integral sliding-mode control strategy is performed.

  abstract     = {Falling down is a serious problem for health and has become one of the major etiologies of accidental death for the elderly living alone. In recent years, many efforts have been paid to fall recognition based on wearable sensors or standard vision sensors. However, the prior methods have the risk of privacy leaks, and almost all these methods are based on video clips, which cannot localize where the falls occurred in long videos. For these reasons, in this article, the bioinspired vision sensor-based falls temporal localization framework is proposed. The bioinspired vision sensors, such as dynamic and active-pixel vision sensor (DAVIS) camera applied in this work responds to pixels’ brightness change, and each pixel works independently and asynchronously compared to the standard vision sensors. This property makes it have a very high dynamic range and privacy preserving. First, to better represent event data, compared with the typical constant temporal window mechanism, an adaptive temporal window conversion mechanism is developed. The temporal localization framework follows a proven proposal and classification paradigm. Second, for the high-efficient and recall proposal generation, different from the traditional sliding window scheme, the event temporal density as the actionness score is set and the 1D-watershed algorithm to generate proposals is applied. In addition, we combine the temporal and spatial attention mechanism with our feature extraction network to temporally model the falls. Finally, to evaluate the performance of our framework, 30 volunteers are recruited to join the simulated fall experiments. According to the results of experiments, our framework can realize precise falls temporal localization and achieve the state-of-the-art performance.},

The hybrid secure control scheme is developed to mitigate the influence of arbitrary cyber attacks on system performance. Specifically, this article proposes a hybrid control law containing multiple controllers, each of which is designed to counter different types of cyber attacks. By using the stochastic analysis approach, two sufficient criteria are provided to guarantee that the time-varying MASs satisfy the finite horizon $H_{\infty }$ consensus performance. Then, the controller parameters are obtained by solving the recursive linear matrix inequality. The usefulness of the theoretic results presented is demonstrated via a numerical example that contains a performance comparison of different secure control schemes.},

  abstract     = {In this article, the problem of intermittent fault (IF) detection is investigated for linear stochastic systems over sensor networks, where the appearing and disappearing times, and magnitude of IF are all nondeterministic. By utilizing the moving-horizon estimator, a novel residual generator is designed to realize the distributed detection of IFs in sensor networks. Different from the traditional moving horizon estimation algorithms, weight matrices of the quadratic cost function in this article are regulated by an unreliability index of the prior estimate to suppress the smearing effect of IFs. In virtue of the matrix transformation method and statistical theory, estimator parameters are obtained and the detectability of a single IF is analyzed by using the residual. In order to avoid the collisions of detection results from different residuals, the global detectability condition is given for all IFs. A cooperative decision-making strategy is proposed such that the only detection result can be guaranteed, which includes the appearing and disappearing times of IFs, and the nodes suffering from IFs. Finally, an illustrative example is provided to show the feasibility and effectiveness of the derived results.},

  abstract     = {Medical image classification is an important task in computer-aided diagnosis systems. Its performance is critically determined by the descriptiveness and discriminative power of features extracted from images. With rapid development of deep learning, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely used to learn the optimal high-level features from the raw pixels of images for a given classification task. However, due to the limited amount of labeled medical images with certain quality distortions, such techniques crucially suffer from the training difficulties, including overfitting, local optimums, and vanishing gradients. To solve these problems, in this article, we propose a two-stage selective ensemble of CNN branches via a novel training strategy called deep tree training (DTT). In our approach, DTT is adopted to jointly train a series of networks constructed from the hidden layers of CNN in a hierarchical manner, leading to the advantage that vanishing gradients can be mitigated by supplementing gradients for hidden layers of CNN, and intrinsically obtain the base classifiers on the middle-level features with minimum computation burden for an ensemble solution. Moreover, the CNN branches as base learners are combined into the optimal classifier via the proposed two-stage selective ensemble approach based on both accuracy and diversity criteria. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 benchmark and two specific medical image datasets illustrate that our approach achieves better performance in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score measurement.},

  abstract     = {Multiview subspace clustering (MSC) has attracted growing attention due to the extensive value in various applications, such as natural language processing, face recognition, and time-series analysis. In this article, we are devoted to address two crucial issues in MSC: 1) high computational cost and 2) cumbersome multistage clustering. Existing MSC approaches, including tensor singular value decomposition (t-SVD)-MSC that has achieved promising performance, generally utilize the dataset itself as the dictionary and regard representation learning and clustering process as two separate parts, thus leading to the high computational overhead and unsatisfactory clustering performance. To remedy these two issues, we propose a novel MSC model called joint skinny tensor learning and latent clustering (JSTC), which can learn high-order skinny tensor representations and corresponding latent clustering assignments simultaneously. Through such a joint optimization strategy, the multiview complementary information and latent clustering structure can be exploited thoroughly to improve the clustering performance. An alternating direction minimization algorithm, which owns low computational complexity and can be run in parallel when solving several key subproblems, is carefully designed to optimize the JSTC model. Such a nice property makes our JSTC an appealing solution for large-scale MSC problems. We conduct extensive experiments on ten popular datasets and compare our JSTC with 12 competitors. Five commonly used metrics, including four external measures (NMI, ACC, F-score, and RI) and one internal metric (SI), are adopted to evaluate the clustering quality. The experimental results with the Wilcoxon statistical test demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in both clustering performance and operational efficiency.},

However, a few of them consider the prior knowledge of the system of interest, which is beneficial for fault diagnosis. To this end, a new fault diagnosis method based on the graph convolutional network (GCN) using a hybrid of the available measurement and the prior knowledge is proposed. Specifically, this method first uses the structural analysis (SA) method to prediagnose the fault and then converts the prediagnosis results into the association graph. Then, the graph and measurements are sent into the GCN model, in which a weight coefficient is introduced to adjust the influence of measurements and the prior knowledge. In this method, the graph structure of GCN is used as a joint point to connect SA based on the model and GCN based on data. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, an experiment is carried out. The results show that the proposed method, which combines the advantages of both SA and GCN, has better diagnosis results than the existing methods based on common evaluation indicators.},

  abstract     = {By modeling the tumor sensitization and targeting (TST) as a natural computational process, we have proposed the framework of nanorobots-assisted in vivo computation. The externally manipulable nanorobots are steered to detect the tumor in the high-risk tissue, which is analogous to the process of searching for the optimal solution by the computing agents in the search space. To overcome the constraint of a nanorobotic platform that can only generate a uniform magnetic field to actuate the nanorobots, we have proposed the weak priority evolution strategy (WP-ES) in our previous works. However, these works do not consider the proportions of the nanorobot control and tracking operations, which are part and parcel of in vivo computation as the control operation aims at searching for the tumor effectively while the tracking mode is used for gathering information about the biological gradient function (BGF). Careful planning about the durations spent in these operations is needed for optimal performance of the TST strategy. To account for this issue, in the current article, we propose a novel computational principle, called the tension-relaxation (T-R) principle, to balance the displacements of nanorobots during each control and tracking cycle. Furthermore, we build three tumor vascular models with different sizes to represent three different targeting regions as the morphology of tumor vasculature determined by the tumor growth process is an important factor affecting TST. We carry out the computational experiments for tumors with three different sizes for several representative landscapes by introducing the T-R principle into the WP-ES-based swarm intelligence algorithms and considering the realistic internal constraints. The experimental outcomes demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed TST strategy.},

In the proposed control method, an interval type-2 fuzzy neural network (IT2FNN) is first developed for each UA to approximate the unknown term associated with the loss-of-effectiveness faults in the distributed error dynamics, and then a disturbance observer (DO) is proposed to compensate for the approximation error and bias fault encountered by each UA, such that the composite learning strategy composed of the IT2FNN and the DO is obtained for each UA. Moreover, fractional-order (FO) calculus is incorporated into the control scheme to provide an extra degree of freedom for the parameter adjustments. The salient feature of the proposed control scheme is that the composite learning algorithm and FO calculus are integrated to achieve a satisfactory fault-tolerant formation-containment control performance even when a portion of leader/follower UAs is subjected to the actuator faults in a distributed communication network. Furthermore, it is shown by Lyapunov stability analysis that all leader UAs can track the virtual leader UA with time-varying offset vectors, and all follower UAs can converge into the convex hull spanned by the leader UAs. Finally, comparative hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experimental results are presented to show the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.},

In particular, the global cost function is the sum of all the local cost functions assigned to each agent and only available to itself. The objective is to minimize the global cost function in a distributed manner while achieving a consensus on its optimal solution. Since the model parameters of the considered EL systems are not available, a new auxiliary system is introduced as a reference model, and its outputs exponentially converge the optimal solution of the global cost function. A fully distributed optimal control algorithm without requiring global information is first proposed. Then, an alternative distributed optimal algorithm via the event-triggered mechanism is proposed to reduce the communication cost. In particular, by combining an edge-based adaptive gain method, the proposed event-triggered optimal algorithm is also fully distributed.

Specifically, an improved upper bound is given for the maximum eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix and the (out-) in-degree of the degree matrix, and an improved consensuability and non-negativevity condition is obtained. The sufficient condition presented only requires the number of edges of a nodal network without the connection topology. Also, with the introduction of slack matrix variables, two equivalent conditions of consensuability and non-negativevity are obtained. In the conditions, the system matrices, controller gain, as well as Lyapunov matrices are separated, which is helpful for parameterization. Based on the results, a semidefinite programming algorithm for the controller is readily developed.

In this study, we focus on the granulation of time series and discover the overall structure of the original time series by clustering the granular time series. During the granulation process, when time series exhibit some trend (up trend, equal trend, or down trend) or consist of a variety of tendencies, the trend is essential to be involved to construct the granular time series. Following the principle of justifiable granularity, we propose to form a series of trend-based information granules to describe the original time series and effectively reduce its dimensionality. Then, the similarity measure between trend-based information granules is provided, and considering the dynamic feature of time-series data, dynamic time warping (DTW) distance is generalized to measure the distance for granular time series. In sum, we show here a novel way of forming trend-based granular time series and the corresponding similarity measure, then based on this, the hierarchical clustering of granular time series is realized. The proposed approach can capture the main essence of time series and help to reduce the computing overhead. Experimental results show that the designed approach can reveal meaningful trend-based information granules, and provide promising clustering results on UCR and real-world datasets.},

To address this, we explore an independent distributed and parallel framework by dividing big data/variable matrices and regularization by both columns and rows. Specifically, LS 2 C is independently decomposed into many subproblems by distributing those matrices into different machines by columns since the regularization of the code matrix is equal to a sum of that of its submatrices (e.g., square-of-Frobenius/ $\ell _{1}$ -norm). Consensus optimization is designed to solve these subproblems in a parallel way for saving communication costs. Moreover, we provide theoretical guarantees that LS 2 C can recover consensus subspace representations of high-dimensional data points under broad conditions. Compared with the state-of-the-art LS 2 C methods, our approach achieves better clustering results in public datasets, including a million images and videos.},

In this context, by resorting to the techniques of incremental homogeneity, a nonlinear ET distributed estimation scheme is designed to estimate the states and regulate the data transmission. Under this scheme, the resilient state estimation is achieved by employing a multimode switching estimator, and the problem of efficiency loss of the ET mechanism caused by DoS attacks is solved by designing a dynamic trigger threshold with switched update laws. Then, based on the decay rates of the Lyapunov function corresponding to different communication modes, sufficient conditions are given to guarantee the stability of the estimation error system under DoS attacks.

To reveal the effect of diversity on the generalization of classification ensembles, we investigate three issues on diversity, that is, the measurement of diversity, the relationship between the proposed diversity and the generalization error, and the utilization of this relationship for ensemble pruning. In the diversity measurement, we measure diversity by error decomposition inspired by regression ensembles, which decompose the error of classification ensembles into accuracy and diversity. Then, we formulate the relationship between the measured diversity and ensemble performance through the theorem of margin and generalization and observe that the generalization error is reduced effectively only when the measured diversity is increased in a few specific ranges, while in other ranges, larger diversity is less beneficial to increasing the generalization of an ensemble. Besides, we propose two pruning methods based on diversity management to utilize this relationship, which could increase diversity appropriately and shrink the size of the ensemble without much-decreasing performance. The empirical results validate the reasonableness of the proposed relationship between diversity and ensemble generalization error and the effectiveness of the proposed pruning methods.},

  abstract     = {In this article, a frequency-domain approach is developed to deal with the global consensus problem for a class of general second-order multiagent systems (MASs) subject to actuator saturations. By employing the describing function and the generalized Nyquist criterion, the global consensus problem is thoroughly investigated for both undirected and directed topologies. First, the describing function is introduced to characterize the actuator saturations in the $s$ -plane, and the inherent representation error is quantitatively analyzed from a frequency-domain perspective. Then, by means of the Kronecker product, the addressed consensus problem of the MAS is transformed into a corresponding stability analysis problem for a certain multi-input–multi-output (MIMO) system and, consequently, the generalized Nyquist criterion for MIMO systems is exploited to derive the condition for the global consensus of the MAS where the impact from the actuator saturation is explicitly reflected. Finally, numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the validity of the proposed theoretical result.},

  abstract     = {The bionic flapping-wing robotic aircraft is inspired by the flight of birds or insects. This article focuses on the flexible wings of the aircraft, which has great advantages, such as being lightweight, having high flexibility, and offering low energy consumption. However, flexible wings might generate the unexpected deformation and vibration during the flying process. The vibration will degrade the flight performance, even shorten the lifespan of the aircraft. Therefore, designing an effective control method for suppressing vibrations of the flexible wings is significant in practice. The main purpose of this article is to develop an adaptive fault-tolerant control scheme for the flexible wings of the aircraft. Dynamic modeling, control design, and stability verification for the aircraft system are conducted. First, the dynamic model of the flexible flapping-wing aircraft is established by an improved rigid finite element (IRFE) method. Second, a novel adaptive fault-tolerant controller based on the fuzzy neural network (FNN) and nonsingular fast terminal sliding-mode (NFTSM) control scheme are proposed for tracking control and vibration suppression of the flexible wings, while successfully addressing the issues of system uncertainties and actuator failures. Third, the stability of the closed-loop system is analyzed through Lyapunov’s direct method. Finally, co-simulations through MapleSim and MATLAB/Simulink are carried out to verify the performance of the proposed controller.},

Several easy-to-check and less conservative Lyapunov-based sufficient criteria are derived for ensuring the stability of studied systems, where the upper bound estimation for the diffusion operator of the Lyapunov function is time-varying, piecewise continuous, and indefinite. It should be stressed that our results can be directly used to analyze the stabilization of HSDSs via aperiodically intermittent control (AIC). Compared with the existing results about AIC, the restrictions on the bound of each control/rest width and the maximum proportion of rest width in each control period are removed. Thus, the conservativeness is reduced. Finally, two examples, together with their numerical simulations, are provided to demonstrate the theoretical results.},

In addition, two Bernoulli distributed variables are utilized to describe the influence of denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and false-data injection (FDI) attacks in the proposed observer-based security control strategy. Moreover, some sufficient criterions are derived for the stochastic stability with an $H_{\infty }$ attenuation level of augmented systems.

However, they still suffer some of these drawbacks: they encounter the expensive time overhead, they fail to explore the explicit clusters, and cannot generalize to unseen data points. In this work, we propose a scalable graph learning framework, seeking to address the above three challenges simultaneously. Specifically, it is based on the ideas of anchor points and bipartite graph. Rather than building an $n\times n$ graph, where $n$ is the number of samples, we construct a bipartite graph to depict the relationship between samples and anchor points. Meanwhile, a connectivity constraint is employed to ensure that the connected components indicate clusters directly. We further establish the connection between our method and the $K$ -means clustering. Moreover, a model to process multiview data is also proposed, which is linearly scaled with respect to $n$ . Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our approach with respect to many state-of-the-art clustering methods.},

The major reason is that tensor-nuclear norm minimization (TNNM) used in t-SVD regularizes each singular value equally, which does not make sense in matrix completion and coefficient matrix learning. In this case, the singular values represent different perspectives and should be treated differently. To well exploit the significant difference between singular values, we study the weighted tensor Schatten $p$ -norm based on t-SVD and develop an efficient algorithm to solve the weighted tensor Schatten $p$ -norm minimization (WTSNM) problem. After that, applying WTSNM to learn the coefficient matrix in multiview subspace clustering, we present a novel multiview clustering method by integrating coefficient matrix learning and spectral clustering into a unified framework. The learned coefficient matrix well exploits both the cluster structure and high-order information embedded in multiview views.

The controller is updated in a batch wise only when the event-triggering condition is satisfied, thus saving significant communication resources and reducing the number of the actuator updates. The convergence is proved mathematically. In addition, the results are also extended from linear discrete-time systems to nonlinear nonaffine discrete-time systems.

The optimal-distributed control problem is formulated to differential graphical games, and the Pareto optimum to multiplayer games is sought based on the viability theory and reinforcement learning techniques. The viability theory characterizes the controllability of a wide range of constrained nonlinear systems; and the viability kernel and the capture basin are the pillars of the viability theory. The capture basin is the set of all initial states, in which there exist control strategies that enable the states to reach the target in finite time while remaining inside a set before reaching the target. In this regard, the feasible learning region is characterized by the reinforcement learner. In addition, the approximation of the capture basin provides the learner with prior knowledge. Unlike the existing works that employ the viability theory to solve control problems with only one agent and differential games with only two players, the viability theory, in this article, is utilized to solve multiagent control problems and multiplayer differential games. The distributed control law is composed of two parts: 1) the approximation of the capture basin and 2) reinforcement learning, which are computed offline and online, respectively. The convergence properties of the parameters’ estimation errors in reinforcement learning are proved, and the convergence of the control policy to the Pareto optimum of the differential graphical game is discussed. The guaranteed approximation results of the capture basin are provided and the simulation results of the differential graphical game are provided for multivehicle systems with the proposed distributed control policy.},

  abstract     = {The integration of semisupervised modeling and discriminative information has been sporadically discussed in the research literature of traditional classification modeling, while the former one would make full use of the collected data and the latter one would further improve the classification performance. In this article, the Hessian semisupervised scatter regularized classification model is proposed as a coherent framework for the nonlinear process classification upon both labeled and unlabeled data. It is innovatively designed with a loss function to evaluate the classification accuracy and three regularization terms, respectively, corresponding to the geometry information, discriminative information, and model complexity. Both cases of the coherent framework, respectively, casted to the reproducing kernel Hilbert space and linear space, enjoy a theoretically guaranteed analytical solution. Experiments on process classification tasks on a benchmark dataset and a real industrial polyethylene process illustrate the merits of the proposed method in a sense that the class information of novel collected data is accurately predicted.},

  abstract     = {The superiority of deeply learned representations relies on large-scale labeled datasets. However, annotating data are usually expensive or even infeasible in some scenarios. To address this problem, we propose an unsupervised method to leverage instance discrimination and similarity for deep visual representation learning. The method is based on an observation that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can learn a meaningful visual representation with instancewise classification, in which each instance is treated as an individual class. By this instancewise discriminative learning, instances can reasonably distribute in the representation space, which reveals their similarities. In order to further improve visual representations, we propose a dual-level progressive similar instance selection (DPSIS) method to build a bridge from instance to class by selecting similar instances (neighbors) for each instance (anchor) and treating the anchor and its neighbors as the same class. To be specific, DPSIS adaptively selects two levels of neighbors, that is: 1) an “absolutely similar level” and 2) a “relatively similar level.” Instances in the absolutely similar level are used as hard labels, while instances in the relatively similar level are used as soft labels. Moreover, during training, DPSIS is able to progressively select more neighbors without human supervision. At the beginning of training, because CNNs are weak, most instances are distributed relatively randomly in the representation space and only a few easy-to-recognize instances are selected as neighbors. As CNN models become stronger, the semantic meaning of each instance grows clearer. Those instances originally distributed in a relatively random manner gradually move to meaningful positions. This consequently facilitates CNN training since the number of reliable samples increases. Experiments on seven benchmarks, including three small-scale and two large-scale coarse-grained image classification datasets, and two fine-grained categorization datasets, demonstrate the effectiveness of our DPSIS.

The distinguishing feature of the proposed design, besides guaranteeing closed-loop stability, is that some transient-state and steady-state metrics (e.g., maximum overshoot and convergence rate) can be preselected a priori by devising a novel performance function. More precisely, as opposed to conventional prescribed performance functions, a new asymmetry local tracking error-transformed variable is designed to circumvent the singularity problem and alleviate the computational burden caused by the conventional transformation function and its inverse function, and to solve the nondifferentiability issue that exists in most existing designs. Furthermore, the consensus tracking error is shown to converge to a residual set, whose size can be adjusted as small as desired through selecting proper parameters, while ensuring closed-loop stability and preassigned performances.

It is not a trivial task, as there are various short-term and/or long-term temporal dependencies. Multiscale modeling has been considered as a promising strategy to solve this problem. However, the existing multiscale models either apply an implicit way to model the temporal dependencies or ignore the interrelationships between multiscale subseries. In this article, we propose a multiscale interactive recurrent network (MiRNN) to jointly capture multiscale patterns. MiRNN employs a deep wavelet decomposition network to decompose the raw time series into multiscale subseries. MiRNN introduces three key strategies (truncation, initialization, and message passing) to model the inherent interrelationships between multiscale subseries, as well as a dual-stage attention mechanism to capture multiscale temporal dependencies. Experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that our model achieves promising performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods.},

Thus, TVQP problem solving plays an important role in practical applications. Many existing neural networks, such as the gradient neural network (GNN) or zeroing neural network (ZNN), were designed to solve TVQP problems, but the convergent rate is limited. The recent varying-parameter convergent-differential neural network (VP-CDNN) can accelerate the convergent rate, but it can only solve the equality-constrained problem. To remedy this deficiency, a novel barrier varying-parameter dynamic learning network (BVDLN) is proposed and designed, which can solve the equality-, inequality-, and bound-constrained problem. Specifically, the constrained TVQP problem is first converted into a matrix equation. Second, based on the modified Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) conditions and varying-parameter neural dynamic design method, the BVDLN model is conducted. The superiorities of the proposed BVDLN model can solve multiple-constrained TVQP problems, and the convergent rate can achieve superexponentially convergence. Comparative simulative experiments verify that the proposed BVDLN is more effective and more accurate. Finally, the proposed BVDLN is applied to solve a robot motion planning problems, which verifies the applicability of the proposed model.},

This formulation covers the cases with both the TPs and the MDPs being fully known, or one of them being fully known but another being partly known, or both them being partly known but without the certain estimation errors, which were considered in some previous literature.

  abstract     = {Hyperspectral images (HSIs) are inevitably contaminated by the mixed noise (such as Gaussian noise, impulse noise, deadlines, and stripes), which could influence the subsequent processing accuracy. Generally, HSI restoration can be transformed into the low-rank matrix recovery (LRMR). In the LRMR, the nuclear norm is widely used to substitute the matrix rank, but its effectiveness is still worth improving. Besides, the $l_{0}$ -norm cannot capture the sparse noise’s structured sparsity property. To handle these issues, the adaptive rank and structured sparsity corrections (ARSSC) are presented for HSI restoration. The ARSSC introduces two convex regularizers, that is: 1) the rank correction (RC) and 2) the structured sparsity correction (SSC), to, respectively, approximate the matrix rank and the $l_{2,0}$ -norm. The RC and the SSC can adaptively offset the penalization of large entries from the nuclear norm and the $l_{2,1}$ -norm, respectively, where the larger the entry, the greater its offset. Therefore, the proposed ARSSC achieves a tighter approximation of the noise-free HSI low-rank structure and promotes the structured sparsity of sparse noise. An efficient alternative direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm is applied to solve the resulting convex optimization problem. The superiority of the ARSSC in terms of the mixed noise removal and spatial-spectral structure information preserving, is demonstrated by several experimental results both on simulated and real datasets, compared with other state-of-the-art HSI restoration approaches.},

However, these methods do not necessarily produce interpretable results. Restricting the solutions to the set of interpretable solutions increases the computational burden of the learning problem significantly, leading to computationally prohibitive run times for some important biomedical applications. That is why we propose a multitask MKL formulation with a clustering of tasks and develop a highly time-efficient solution approach for it. Our solution method is based on the Benders decomposition and treating the clustering problem as finding a given number of tree structures in a graph; hence, it is called the forest formulation. We use our method to discriminate early-stage and late-stage cancers using genomic data and gene sets and compare our algorithm against two other algorithms. The two other algorithms are based on different approaches for linearization of the problem while all algorithms make use of the cutting-plane method. Our results indicate that as the number of tasks and/or the number of desired clusters increase, the forest formulation becomes increasingly favorable in terms of computational performance.},

  abstract     = {Finite-time control is concerned with steering a system state to the origin before a certain settling-time limit, ignoring any consideration of when each state element converges relative to the others. In this article, a control problem called time-synchronized control is investigated, where all the system state elements have to converge to the origin at the same time . To facilitate this problem formulation, we introduce the notion of time-synchronized stability together with sufficient Lyapunov conditions. Based on these, the analytical solution of a time-synchronized stable system is obtained and discussed, explicitly offering a quantitative method to preview and predesign the control system performance in prior . Following these results, a robust time-synchronized control law is designed for multivariable systems under external disturbances and model uncertainties. Finally, comparative numerical simulations between time-synchronized control and finite/fixed/prescribed-time control are conducted to showcase the time-synchronized features attained.},

  abstract     = {In some practical systems, it often remains difficult to directly measure all state variables. This article investigates the memory output sliding-mode control (SMC) for the finite-time consensus of singularly perturbed multiagent systems (SPMASs). First, the virtual state-feedback sliding surface (SFSS) is constructed to ensure the consensus of all agent states. Then, the unknown output derivatives in SFSS are approximated by a moving finite difference method with error estimation and refinement, which gives rise to a new delay-dependent sliding surface. On this basis, the memory output switching control law is designed to stabilize the consensus errors in finite time, even in the presence of estimation biases, singular perturbations, and input noises. Different from the observer-based SMC, the proposed memory output SMC is of simple static form without introducing extra dynamical structures for state estimation. The effectiveness and superiority of the design method are verified in an SPMAS with double-integrator dynamics.},

  abstract     = {Multiview clustering has aroused increasing attention in recent years since real-world data are always comprised of multiple features or views. Despite the existing clustering methods having achieved promising performance, there still remain some challenges to be solved: 1) most existing methods are unscalable to large-scale datasets due to the high computational burden of eigendecomposition or graph construction and 2) most methods learn latent representations and cluster structures separately. Such a two-step learning scheme neglects the correlation between the two learning stages and may obtain a suboptimal clustering result. To address these challenges, a pseudo-label guided collective matrix factorization (PLCMF) method that jointly learns latent representations and cluster structures is proposed in this article. The proposed PLCMF first performs clustering on each view separately to obtain pseudo-labels that reflect the intraview similarities of each view. Then, it adds a pseudo-label constraint on collective matrix factorization to learn unified latent representations, which preserve the intraview and interview similarities simultaneously. Finally, it intuitively incorporates latent representation learning and cluster structure learning into a joint framework to directly obtain clustering results. Besides, the weight of each view is learned adaptively according to data distribution in the joint framework. In particular, the joint learning problem can be solved with an efficient iterative updating method with linear complexity. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets indicate the superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the-art multiview clustering methods in both clustering accuracy and computational efficiency.},

This study proposes a deep-learning-based technique to automatically search for the minimum number of channels applicable to general BMI paradigms using a compact convolutional neural network for electroencephalography (EEG)-based BMIs. For verification, three types of BMI paradigms are assessed: 1) the typical P300 auditory oddball; 2) the new top-down steady-state visually evoked potential; and 3) the endogenous motor imagery. We observe that the optimized minimal EEG-channel sets are automatically selected in all three cases. Their decoding accuracies using the minimal channels are statistically equivalent to (or even higher than) those based on all channels. The brain areas of the selected channel set are neurophysiologically interpretable for all of these cognitive task paradigms. This study shows that the minimal EEG channel set can be automatically selected, irrespective of the types of BMI paradigms or EEG input features using a deep-learning approach, which also contributes to their portability.},

Through a systematic co-design of the adaptive control law and the event-triggered mechanism, including fixed and relative threshold strategies, a control scheme with low structure and calculation complexity is designed to conserve system communication and computation resources. In this design, the output asymptotic tracking is achieved. The Nussbaum gain technique is incorporated to overcome unknown control directions with a new adaptive law, and a type of barrier Lyapunov function is adopted to handle the prescribed performance control problem, which contributes to a novel control law with strong robustness. The robust controller can address the uncertainties and couplings derived from the system structure, actuator faults, and event-triggered rules, without using approximating structures or compensators. Besides, the explosion of complexity is avoided. It is proved that all signals of the closed-loop system remain bounded, and system tracking errors asymptotically approach 0 with the prescribed performance, while the Zeno behavior is prevented. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is evaluated via an application example of the half-car active suspension system.},

The decentralized control signal at each agent in the network requires information about the states of the leader agent, as well as the desired formation variables of the agents in a local coordinate frame. These two sets of variables are provided at each agent by utilizing two recently proposed distributed observers. It is shown that only a spanning-tree rooted at the leader agent is enough for the convergence and stability of the proposed cooperative control and observer algorithms. Two simulation studies are provided to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm in comparison with two state-of-the-art distributed model-free control algorithms. With lower control effort as well as fewer offline gain tuning, the same level of consensus errors is achieved.

While task-specific solutions may eliminate the respective issue in certain applications, finding a generic method for missing data estimation is rather complex. In this regard, this article proposes a novel missing data imputation algorithm, which has supreme generalization ability for a vast variety of applications. Making use of both complete and incomplete parts of data, the proposed algorithm reduces the effect of missing ratio, which makes it suitable for situations with very high missing ratios. In addition, this feature enables model construction on incomplete training sets, which is rarely addressed in the literature. Moreover, the nonparametric nature of this new algorithm brings about supreme flexibility against all variations of missing values and data distribution. We incorporate the advantages of denoising autoencoders and ladder architecture into a novel formulation based on deep neural networks. To evaluate the proposed algorithm, a comparative study is performed using a number of reputable imputation techniques. In this process, real-world benchmark datasets from different domains are selected. On top of that, a real cyber-physical system is also evaluated to study the generalization ability of the proposed algorithm for distinct applications. To do so, we conduct studies based on three missing data mechanisms, namely: 1) missing completely at random; 2) missing at random; and 3) missing not at random.

  abstract     = {Clustering is one of the fundamental tasks in computer vision and pattern recognition. Recently, deep clustering methods (algorithms based on deep learning) have attracted wide attention with their impressive performance. Most of these algorithms combine deep unsupervised representation learning and standard clustering together. However, the separation of representation learning and clustering will lead to suboptimal solutions because the two-stage strategy prevents representation learning from adapting to subsequent tasks (e.g., clustering according to specific cues). To overcome this issue, efforts have been made in the dynamic adaption of representation and cluster assignment, whereas current state-of-the-art methods suffer from heuristically constructed objectives with the representation and cluster assignment alternatively optimized. To further standardize the clustering problem, we audaciously formulate the objective of clustering as finding a precise feature as the cue for cluster assignment. Based on this, we propose a general-purpose deep clustering framework, which radically integrates representation learning and clustering into a single pipeline for the first time. The proposed framework exploits the powerful ability of recently developed generative models for learning intrinsic features, and imposes an entropy minimization on the distribution of the cluster assignment by a dedicated variational algorithm. The experimental results show that the performance of the proposed method is superior, or at least comparable to, the state-of-the-art methods on the handwritten digit recognition, fashion recognition, face recognition, and object recognition benchmark datasets.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning-based object detection and instance segmentation have achieved unprecedented progress. In this article, we propose complete-IoU (CIoU) loss and Cluster-NMS for enhancing geometric factors in both bounding-box regression and nonmaximum suppression (NMS), leading to notable gains of average precision (AP) and average recall (AR), without the sacrifice of inference efficiency. In particular, we consider three geometric factors, that is: 1) overlap area; 2) normalized central-point distance; and 3) aspect ratio, which are crucial for measuring bounding-box regression in object detection and instance segmentation. The three geometric factors are then incorporated into CIoU loss for better distinguishing difficult regression cases. The training of deep models using CIoU loss results in consistent AP and AR improvements in comparison to widely adopted $\ell _{n}$ -norm loss and IoU-based loss. Furthermore, we propose Cluster-NMS, where NMS during inference is done by implicitly clustering detected boxes and usually requires fewer iterations. Cluster-NMS is very efficient due to its pure GPU implementation, and geometric factors can be incorporated to improve both AP and AR. In the experiments, CIoU loss and Cluster-NMS have been applied to state-of-the-art instance segmentation (e.g., YOLACT and BlendMask-RT), and object detection (e.g., YOLO v3, SSD, and Faster R-CNN) models. Taking YOLACT on MS COCO as an example, our method achieves performance gains as +1.7 AP and +6.2 AR 100 for object detection, and +1.1 AP and +3.5 AR 100 for instance segmentation, with 27.1 FPS on one NVIDIA GTX 1080Ti GPU.

By utilizing the useful information from related tasks while solving the tasks concurrently, improved performance has been shown in various problems. Despite the success enjoyed by the existing evolutionary multitasking algorithms, still there is a lack of theoretical studies guaranteeing faster convergence compared to the conventional single task case. To analyze the effects of transferred information from related tasks, in this article, we first put forward a novel multitask gradient descent (MTGD) algorithm, which enhances the standard gradient descent updates with a multitask interaction term. The convergence of the resulting MTGD is derived. Furthermore, we present the first proof of faster convergence of MTGD relative to its single task counterpart. Utilizing MTGD, we formulate a gradient-free evolutionary multitasking algorithm called multitask evolution strategies (MTESs). Importantly, the single task evolution strategies (ESs) we utilize are shown to asymptotically approximate gradient descent and, hence, the faster convergence results derived for MTGD extend to the case of MTES as well. Numerical experiments comparing MTES with single task ES on synthetic benchmarks and practical optimization examples serve to substantiate our theoretical claim.},

Although previous works address that by enhancing the diversities of filters, they have not considered the complementarity and the completeness of the internal convolutional structure. To respond to this problem, we propose a novel inner-imaging (InI) architecture, which allows relationships between channels to meet the above requirement. Specifically, we organize the channel signal points in groups using convolutional kernels to model both the intragroup and intergroup relationships simultaneously. A convolutional filter is a powerful tool for modeling spatial relations and organizing grouped signals, so the proposed methods map the channel signals onto a pseudoimage, like putting a lens into the internal convolution structure. Consequently, not only is the diversity of channels increased but also the complementarity and completeness can be explicitly enhanced. The proposed architecture is lightweight and easy to be implement. It provides an efficient self-organization strategy for convolutional networks to improve their performance. Extensive experiments are conducted on multiple benchmark datasets, including CIFAR, SVHN, and ImageNet. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of the InI mechanism with the most popular convolutional networks as the backbones.},

  abstract     = {This article presents an improved equivalent-input-disturbance (EID) approach to handle unknown disturbances and plant uncertainties. The disturbances and uncertainties are treated as a lumped disturbance in an EID-based control system. The effect of the lumped disturbance is compensated by an EID estimator. A constraint between design parameters and uncertainties is imposed on the design of the estimator. In addition, there are insufficient analyses of the influence of uncertainties on the control performance and the stability of the system. A new filter is devised for an improved EID estimator in this article to remove the constraint. This ensures that the sensitivity of the system to disturbances at low frequencies can be freely decreased. An analysis of the system reveals that uncertainties not only influence disturbance-rejection and reference-tracking performance but also affect system stability. A sufficient stability criterion is derived with consideration of uncertainties. The validity of the presented method is demonstrated by simulation and experimental results.},

  abstract     = {This article studies the distributed linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) estimation problem for large-scale systems with local information (LSLI). Large-scale systems are composed of numerous subsystems. Each subsystem only transmits information to its neighbors. Thus, only the local information is available to each subsystem. This implies that the information available to different subsystems is different. Using local information to design an LMMSE estimator, the gains of the estimator must satisfy the sparse structure constraint, which makes the estimator design challenging and complicates the boundedness analysis of the estimation error covariance (EEC). In this article, a framework of the distributed LMMSE estimation for LSLI is established. The gains of the LMMSE estimator are effectively constructed by solving linear matrix equations. A gradient descent algorithm is exploited to design the gains of the LMMSE estimator numerically. Sufficient conditions are derived to ensure the boundedness of the EEC. Also, a gradient-based search algorithm is developed to verify whether the sufficient conditions hold or not. Finally, an example is used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed results.},

An unknown system dynamics estimator (USDE), which employs first-order low-pass filter operations and has only one tuning parameter, is constructed to deal with unknown nonlinearities. With this USDE, the widely used function approximators (e.g., neural networks and fuzzy-logic systems) are not needed, and the intermediate variables and observer used in the traditional estimators are not required. This estimator has a reduced computational burden, trivial parameter tuning and guaranteed convergence. Moreover, a predictor-based compensation strategy is developed to handle the time-varying input delay. Finally, we combine the suggested USDE and predictor to design a feedback controller to attenuate the vibrations of vehicle body and retain the required suspension performances. Theoretical analysis is carried out via the Lyapunov–Krasovkii functional to prove the stability of the closed-loop system. Simulation results based on professional vehicle simulation software Carsim are provided to show the efficiency of the proposed control scheme.},

Such faults include the partial failure of communication links and some classes of data manipulation attacks. This practical and important yet challenging issue has been taken into limited consideration by existing approaches, which commonly assume that the measurement or communication between the distributed generations (DGs) is ideal or satisfies some restrictive assumptions. To achieve communication resilience, a novel adaptive observer is first proposed for each individual DG to estimate the desired reference voltage and frequency under unknown communication faults. Then, to guarantee the stability of the closed-loop system, voltage and frequency restoration, and accurate power sharing regardless of unknown communication faults, sufficient conditions are derived.

With a GCN, node features are locally smoothed based on the information aggregated from their neighborhoods defined by the graph topology. In most of the existing methods, the graph typologies only contain positive links which are deemed as descriptions for the feature similarity of connected nodes. In this article, we develop a novel GCN-based learning framework that improves the node representation inference capability by including negative links in a graph. Negative links in our method define the inverse correlations for the nodes connected by them and are adaptively generated through a neural-network-based generation model. To make the generated negative links beneficial for the classification performance, this negative link generation model is jointly optimized with the GCN used for class inference through our designed training algorithm. Experiment results show that the proposed learning framework achieves better or matched performance compared to the current state-of-the-art methods on several standard benchmark datasets.},

Generalizations of the 1-D QWT into multilevel and multidimension have been investigated but restricted to the quantum wavelet packet transform (QWPTs), which is the direct product of 1-D QWPTs, and there is no transform between the packets in different dimensions. A 2-D QWT is vital for image processing. We construct the multilevel 2-D QWT’s general theory. Explicitly, we built multilevel 2-D Haar QWT and the multilevel Daubechies D4 QWT, respectively. We have given the complete quantum circuits for these wavelet transforms, using both noniterative and iterative methods. Compared to the 1-D QWT and wavelet packet transform, the multilevel 2-D QWT involves the entanglement between components in different degrees. Complexity analysis reveals that the proposed transforms offer exponential speedup over their classical counterparts. Also, the proposed wavelet transforms are used to realize quantum image compression. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed wavelet transforms are significant and obtain the same results as their classical counterparts with an exponential speedup.},

It has numerous applications, such as image retrieval, machine vision in robotics, visual question answer (VQA), and visual reasoning. However, this problem is difficult since relationships are not definite, and the number of possible relations is much larger than objects. So the complete annotation for visual relationships is much more difficult, making this task hard to learn. Many approaches have been proposed to tackle this problem especially with the development of deep neural networks in recent years. In this survey, we first introduce the background of visual relations. Then, we present categorization and frameworks of deep learning models for visual relationship detection.

In this article, we introduce fuzzy rough sets (FRSs) to deal with the problem of outlier detection in mixed attribute data. Since the outlier detection model of the classical rough set is only applicable to the categorical attribute data, we use FRS to generalize the outlier detection model and construct a generalized outlier detection model based on fuzzy rough granules. First, the granule outlier degree (GOD) is defined to characterize the outlier degree of fuzzy rough granules by employing the fuzzy approximation accuracy. Then, the outlier factor based on fuzzy rough granules is constructed by integrating the GOD and the corresponding weights to characterize the outlier degree of objects. Furthermore, the corresponding fuzzy rough granules-based outlier detection (FRGOD) algorithm is designed. The effectiveness of the FRGOD algorithm is evaluated through experiments on 16 real-world datasets. The experimental results show that the algorithm is more flexible for detecting outliers and is suitable for numerical, categorical, and mixed attribute data.},

  abstract     = {Differing from the common linear matrix equation, the future different-level linear matrix system is considered, which is much more interesting and challenging. Because of its complicated structure and future-computation characteristic, traditional methods for static and same-level systems may not be effective on this occasion. For solving this difficult future different-level linear matrix system, the continuous different-level linear matrix system is first considered. On the basis of the zeroing neural network (ZNN), the physical mathematical equivalency is thus proposed, which is called ZNN equivalency (ZE), and it is compared with the traditional concept of mathematical equivalence. Then, on the basis of ZE, the continuous-time synthesis (CTS) model is further developed. To satisfy the future-computation requirement of the future different-level linear matrix system, the 7-instant discrete-time synthesis (DTS) model is further attained by utilizing the high-precision 7-instant Zhang et al. discretization (ZeaD) formula. For a comparison, three different DTS models using three conventional ZeaD formulas are also presented. Meanwhile, the efficacy of the 7-instant DTS model is testified by the theoretical analyses. Finally, experimental results verify the brilliant performance of the 7-instant DTS model in solving the future different-level linear matrix system.},

  abstract     = {For a broad range of applications, hyperspectral image (HSI) classification is a hot topic in remote sensing, and convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods are drawing increasing attention. However, to train millions of parameters in CNN requires a large number of labeled training samples, which are difficult to collect. A conventional Gabor filter can effectively extract spatial information with different scales and orientations without training, but it may be missing some important discriminative information. In this article, we propose the Gabor ensemble filter (GEF), a new convolutional filter to extract deep features for HSI with fewer trainable parameters. GEF filters each input channel by some fixed Gabor filters and learnable filters simultaneously, then reduces the dimensions by some learnable $1\times 1$ filters to generate the output channels. The fixed Gabor filters can extract common features with different scales and orientations, while the learnable filters can learn some complementary features that Gabor filters cannot extract. Based on GEF, we design a network architecture for HSI classification, which extracts deep features and can learn from limited training samples. In order to simultaneously learn more discriminative features and an end-to-end system, we propose to introduce the local discriminant structure for cross-entropy loss by combining the triplet hard loss. Results of experiments on three HSI datasets show that the proposed method has significantly higher classification accuracy than other state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the proposed method is speedy for both training and testing.},

  abstract     = {Modern industrial plants generally consist of multiple manufacturing units, and the local correlation within each unit can be used to effectively alleviate the effect of spurious correlation and meticulously reflect the operation status of the process system. Therefore, the local correlation, which is called spatial information here, should also be taken into consideration when developing the monitoring model. In this study, a cascaded monitoring network (MoniNet) method is proposed to develop the monitoring model with concurrent analytics of temporal and spatial information. By implementing convolutional operation to each variable, the temporal information that reveals dynamic correlation of process data and spatial information that reflects local characteristics within individual operation unit can be extracted simultaneously. For each convolutional feature, a submodel is developed and then all the submodels are integrated to generate a final monitoring model. Based on the developed model, the operation status of the newly collected sample can be identified by comparing the calculated statistics with their corresponding control limits. Similar to the convolutional neural network (CNN), the MoniNet can also expand its receptive field and capture deeper information by adding more convolutional layers. Besides, the filter selection and submodel development in MoniNet can be replaced to generalize the proposed network to many existing monitoring strategies. The performance of the proposed method is validated using two real industrial processes. The illustration results show that the proposed method can effectively detect process anomalies by concurrent analytics of temporal and spatial information.},

  abstract     = {This work is geared toward a real-world manufacturing planning (MP) task, whose two objectives are to maximize the order fulfillment rate and minimize the total cost. More important, the requirements and constraints in real manufacturing make the MP task very challenging in several aspects. For example, the MP needs to cover many production components of multiple plants over a 30-day horizon, which means that it involves a large number of decision variables. Furthermore, the MP task’s two objectives have extremely different magnitudes, and some constraints are difficult to handle. Facing these uncompromising practical requirements, we introduce an interactive multiobjective optimization-based MP system in this article. It can help the decision maker reach a satisfactory tradeoff between the two objectives without consuming massive calculations. In the MP system, the submitted MP task is modeled as a multiobjective integer programming (MOIP) problem. Then, the MOIP problem is addressed via a two-stage multiobjective optimization algorithm (TSMOA). To alleviate the heavy calculation burden, TSMOA transforms the optimization of the MOIP problem into the optimization of a series of single-objective problems (SOPs). Meanwhile, a new SOP solving strategy is used in the MP system to further reduce the computational cost. It utilizes two sequential easier SOPs as the approximator of the original complex SOP for optimization. As part of the MP system, TSMOA and the SOP solving strategy are demonstrated to be efficient in real-world MP applications. In addition, the effectiveness of TSMOA is also validated on benchmark problems. The results indicate that TSMOA as well as the MP system are promising.},

To capture the uncertainty characteristics in a real-life scenario, we design a new form of disturbance on travel time and construct robust multiobjective VRP with the time window, where the perturbation range of travel time is determined by the maximum disturbance degree. Two conflicting objectives include: 1)the minimization of both the total distance and: 2)the number of vehicles. A robust multiobjective particle swarms optimization approach is developed by incorporating an advanced encoding and decoding scheme, a robustness measurement metric, as well as the local search strategy. First, through particle flying in the decision space, the problem space characteristic under deterministic environment is fully exploited to provide guidance for robust optimization. Then, a designed metric is adopted to measure the robustness of solutions and help to search for the robust optimal solutions during the particle flying process. In addition to the updating process of particle, two local search strategies, problem-based local search and route-based local search, are developed for further improving the performance of solutions. For comparison, we develop several robust optimization problems by adding disturbances on selected benchmark problems. The experimental results validate our proposed algorithm has a distinguished ability to generate enough robust solutions and ensure the optimality of these solutions.},

The large-scale multidepot CARP (LSMDCARP) is an important CARP variant, which is very challenging due to its vast search space. To solve LSMDCARP, we propose an iterative improvement heuristic, called route clustering and search heuristic (RoCaSH). In each iteration, it first (re)decomposes the original LSMDCARP into a set of smaller single-depot CARP subproblems using route cutting off and clustering techniques. Then, it solves each subproblem using the effective Ulusoy’s split operator and local search. On one hand, the route clustering helps the search for each subproblem by focusing more on the promising areas. On the other hand, the subproblem solving provides better routes for the subsequent route cutting off and clustering, leading to better problem decomposition. The proposed RoCaSH was compared with the state-of-the-art MDCARP algorithms on a range of MDCARP instances, including different problem sizes. The experimental results showed that RoCaSH significantly outperformed the state-of-the-art algorithms, especially for the large-scale instances.

  abstract     = {Being able to learn discriminative features from low-quality images has raised much attention recently due to their wide applications ranging from autonomous driving to safety surveillance. However, this task is difficult due to high variations across images, such as scale, rotation, illumination, and viewpoint, and distortions in images, such as blur, low contrast, and noise. Image preprocessing could improve the quality of the images, but it often requires human intervention and domain knowledge. Genetic programming (GP) with a flexible representation can automatically perform image preprocessing and feature extraction without human intervention. Therefore, this study proposes a new evolutionary learning approach using GP (EFLGP) to learn discriminative features from images with blur, low contrast, and noise for classification. In the proposed approach, we develop a new program structure (individual representation), a new function set, and a new terminal set. With these new designs, EFLGP can detect small regions from a large input low-quality image, select image operators to process the regions or detect features from the small regions, and output a flexible number of discriminative features. A set of commonly used image preprocessing operators is employed as functions in EFLGP to allow it to search for solutions that can effectively handle low-quality image data. The performance of EFLGP is comprehensively investigated on eight datasets of varying difficulty under the original (clean), blur, low contrast, and noise scenarios, and compared with a large number of benchmark methods using handcrafted features and deep features. The experimental results show that EFLGP achieves significantly better or similar results in most comparisons. The results also reveal that EFLGP is more invariant than the benchmark methods to blur, low contrast, and noise.},

We believe that a student’s learning ability always changes over time.

A unified framework is proposed by capturing the maximal disc-guaranteed gain margin (GGM) of the discrete-time linear quadratic regulator (LQR). Sufficient and necessary conditions on consensusability are established. Two bounds of the consensus region are derived only in terms of the unstable eigenvalues of the agent’ dynamics. For the single-input MAS, by proving that the radius of the consensus region exactly equals the reciprocal of the Mahler measure of the agent’ dynamics, we incidentally reveal the relation between the maximal GGM and the intrinsic entropy rate of the system dynamics for single-input discrete-time linear systems. By employing the inverse optimal control approach, it is proved that the globally optimal consensus is achieved, if and only if the associated Laplacian matrix is a simple matrix and all its nonzero eigenvalues can be radially projected into a specific subset of the consensus region. Moreover, the limitation on the eigenvalues vanishes for the marginally stable MAS. As an application of the global optimality, the minimum-energy-distributed consensus control problem is solved for the marginally stable MAS.

However, the lack of control inputs brings about many difficulties for controller design and stability/convergence analysis., some unavoidable practical issues, e.g., plant uncertainties and actuator deadzones, make the control of underactuated systems even more challenging. Hence, with the aid of elaborately constructed finite-time convergent surfaces, this article provides the first solution to address the control problem for a class of multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) underactuated systems subject to plant uncertainties and actuator deadzones. Specifically, this article overcomes the main obstacle in sliding-mode surface analysis for MIMO underactuated systems, that is, by the presented analysis method, the asymptotic stability of the system equilibrium point is strictly proven based on the composite surfaces. In addition, the unknown parts of the actuated/unactuated dynamic equations and actuator deadzones can be simultaneously handled, which is important for real applications. Furthermore, we apply the proposed method to two kinds of typical underactuated systems, that is: 1) tower cranes and 2) double-pendulum cranes, and implement a series of hardware experiments to verify its effectiveness and robustness.},

Distributed control algorithms are designed for the leaders and followers over directed graphs, respectively, where the formation’s maneuver parameters, such as geometric pattern, translation, orientation, and scale of formation are decided by the first leader.

  abstract     = {In the complex practical engineering systems, many interferences and attacking signals are inevitable in industrial applications. This article investigates the reinforcement learning (RL)-based resilient control algorithm for a class of Markovion jump systems with completely unknown transition probability information. Based on the Takagi–Sugeno logical structure, the resilient control problem of the nonlinear Markovion systems is converted into solving a set of local dynamic games, where the control policy and attacking signal are considered as two rival players. Combining the potential learning and forecasting abilities, the new integral RL (IRL) algorithm is designed via system data to compute the zero-sum games without using the information of stationary transition probability. Besides, the matrices of system dynamics can also be partially unknown, and the new architecture requires less transmission and computation during the learning process. The stochastic stability of the system dynamics under the developed overall resilient control is guaranteed based on the Lyapunov theory. Finally, the designed IRL-based resilient control is applied to a typical multimode robot arm system, and implementing results demonstrate the practicality and effectiveness.},

The plant considered in this article is a kind of dual-rate networked control system, where the sensor samples the measurement output at a slow rate and the actuator updates the control input at a fast rate. Despite the slow-rate sampling of the sensor, a new output predictor-based observer is proposed to accurately estimate system state and disturbance in the intersample time interval, and an active anti-disturbance controller that updates at a fast rate is accordingly proposed, such that the desirable control performance and disturbance rejection performance can be achieved. At each fast-rate updating time instant, we use the prediction technique to generate a data packet, including the computed current control input and the predicted values of the control inputs for the future finite steps, and design a new periodic event-triggered mechanism to determine whether to transmit the data packet via a communication network or not. The proposed control method is easily implemented in digital platform since it has a discrete-time form. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed control method, we finally present the simulation results of a practical speed control system.},

  abstract     = {Zero-shot learning (ZSL) is a pretty intriguing topic in the computer vision community since it handles novel instances and unseen categories. In a typical ZSL setting, there is a main visual space and an auxiliary semantic space. Most existing ZSL methods handle the problem by learning either a visual-to-semantic mapping or a semantic-to-visual mapping. In other words, they investigate a unilateral connection from one end to the other. However, the connection between the visual space and the semantic space are bilateral in reality, that is, the visual space depicts the semantic space; the semantic space, on the other hand, describes the visual space. In this article, therefore, we investigate the bilateral connections in ZSL and present a novel model, called Boomerang-GAN, by taking advantage of conditional generative adversarial networks (GANs). Specifically, we generate unseen visual samples from their category semantic embeddings by a conditional GAN. Different from the existing generative ZSL methods that only consider generating visual features from class descriptions, our method also considers that the generated visual features can be translated back to their corresponding semantic embeddings by introducing a multimodal cycle-consistent loss. Extensive experiments of both ZSL and generalized ZSL on five widely used datasets verify that our method is able to outperform previous state-of-the-art approaches in both recognition and segmentation tasks.},

  abstract     = {Dynamic flexible job shop scheduling (JSS) has received widespread attention from academia and industry due to its practical application value. It requires complex routing and sequencing decisions under unpredicted dynamic events. Genetic programming (GP), as a hyperheuristic approach, has been successfully applied to evolve scheduling heuristics for JSS due to its flexible representation. However, the simulation-based evaluation is computationally expensive since there are many calculations based on individuals for making decisions in the simulation. To improve training efficiency, this article proposes a novel multifidelity-based surrogate-assisted GP. Specifically, multifidelity-based surrogate models are first designed by simplifying the problem expected to be solved. In addition, this article proposes an effective collaboration mechanism with knowledge transfer for utilizing the advantages of multifidelity-based surrogate models to solve the desired problems. This article examines the proposed algorithm in six different scenarios. The results show that the proposed algorithm can dramatically reduce the computational cost of GP without sacrificing the performance in all scenarios. With the same training time, the proposed algorithm can achieve significantly better performance than its counterparts in most scenarios while no worse in others.},

To address these issues, we present a novel mobility learning method—MetaMove, the first metalearning-based model generalizing mobility prediction and classification in a unified framework. MetaMove deals with the problem of training for unseen mobility patterns by generalizing from the known patterns. It trains the model over a variety of patterns sampled from different users and optimizes it on their distribution. To update and fine tune the individual pattern learners, we employ a fast adapting model-agnostic method for very few available trajectory samples. MetaMove exploits unlabeled trajectory data at both metatraining and adaptation levels, thereby alleviating the problem of data sparsity while enforcing less sensitivity to negative samples. We conducted extensive experiments to demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency on two practical applications—motion trace discrimination and next check-in prediction. The results demonstrated significant improvements of MetaMove over the state-of-the-art benchmarks.},

  abstract     = {In pattern classification, we may have a few labeled data points in the target domain, but a number of labeled samples are available in another related domain (called the source domain). Transfer learning can solve such classification problems via the knowledge transfer from source to target domains. The source and target domains can be represented by heterogeneous features. There may exist uncertainty in domain transformation, and such uncertainty is not good for classification. The effective management of uncertainty is important for improving classification accuracy. So, a new belief-based bidirectional transfer classification (BDTC) method is proposed. In BDTC, the intraclass transformation matrix is estimated at first for mapping the patterns from source to target domains, and this matrix can be learned using the labeled patterns of the same class represented by heterogeneous domains (features). The labeled patterns in the source domain are transferred to the target domain by the corresponding transformation matrix. Then, we learn a classifier using all the labeled patterns in the target domain to classify the objects. In order to take full advantage of the complementary knowledge of different domains, we transfer the query patterns from target to source domains using the K-NN technique and do the classification task in the source domain. Thus, two pieces of classification results can be obtained for each query pattern in the source and target domains, but the classification results may have different reliabilities/weights. A weighted combination rule is developed to combine the two classification results based on the belief functions theory, which is an expert at dealing with uncertain information. We can efficiently reduce the uncertainty of transfer classification via the combination strategy. Experiments on some domain adaptation benchmarks show that our method can effectively improve classification accuracy compared with other related methods.},

The single quantitative value lacks the ability to describe the statistical property of reliability, which leads to unreasonable results. In this article, a new ER rule with continuous probability distribution of reliability denoted by ERr-CR is proposed. The combination of two pieces of evidence is discussed in detail, where the reliability is profiled as random variables with specific probability distribution. To characterize the output of ERr-CR, a novel concept of expectation of the expected utility is proposed. In addition, the ERr-CR is expanded to multiple pieces of evidence to show its universality. Further, the basic performances of the ERr-CR are explored to illustrate the rationality. Moreover, a case study of safety assessment of natural gas storage tanks (NGSTs) is conducted to show the potential applications of ERr-CR, which makes the proposed method more practical.},

  abstract     = {Lithology identification plays an essential role in formation characterization and reservoir exploration. As an emerging technology, intelligent logging lithology identification has received great attention recently, which aims to infer the lithology type through the well-logging curves using machine-learning methods. However, the model trained on the interpreted logging data is not effective in predicting new exploration well due to the data distribution discrepancy. In this article, we aim to train a lithology identification model for the target well using a large amount of source-labeled logging data and a small amount of target-labeled data. The challenges of this task lie in three aspects: 1) the distribution misalignment; 2) the data divergence; and 3) the cost limitation. To solve these challenges, we propose a novel active adaptation for logging lithology identification (AALLI) framework that combines active learning (AL) and domain adaptation (DA). The contributions of this article are three-fold: 1) the domain-discrepancy problem in intelligent logging lithology identification is first investigated in this article, and a novel framework that incorporates AL and DA into lithology identification is proposed to handle the problem; 2) we design a discrepancy-based AL and pseudolabeling (PL) module and an instance importance weighting module to query the most uncertain target information and retain the most confident source information, which solves the challenges of cost limitation and distribution misalignment; and 3) we develop a reliability detecting module to improve the reliability of target pseudolabels, which, together with the discrepancy-based AL and PL module, solves the challenge of data divergence. Extensive experiments on three real-world well-logging datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to the baselines.},

By introducing time-varying gains into observers, two types of novel continuous-discrete-time observers are presented to estimate state information of agents under two sampling mechanisms, respectively, namely: 1) a synchronous nonuniform sampling (SNS) mechanism and 2) an asynchronous nonuniform sampling (ANS) mechanism. A new design method of the time-varying gain observer is proposed, in that it can allow for one to select a consensus protocol with lower cost observers to attain the consensus task. Only sampled position information needs to be transmitted in designing consensus protocols for the MSAs, and neither velocity information nor control input information is required. Under the SNS mechanism, a consensus condition is obtained and it is shown that the introduction of time-varying gains in the observers indeed can improve their convergence. Under the ANS mechanism, the corresponding consensus protocol allows the sampling and transmission of different agents to be asynchronous and aperiodic, which means that each agent may sample and transmit its information in line with its own sampling requirements. Furthermore, each sampling period can be arbitrarily selected within a certain range while ensuring the consensus of the MASs. Finally, numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the obtained results.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we present a novel matrix-factorization-based model, labeled here as Vicinal vertex allocated matrix factorization (VVAMo), for uncovering clusters in network data. Different from the past related efforts of network clustering, which consider the edge structure, vertex features, or both in their design, the proposed model includes the additional detail on vertex inclinations with respect to topology and features into the learning. In particular, by taking the latent preferences between vicinal vertices into consideration, VVAMo is then able to uncover network clusters composed of proximal vertices that share analogous inclinations, and correspondingly high structural and feature correlations. To ensure such clusters are effectively uncovered, we propose a unified likelihood function for VVAMo and derive an alternating algorithm for optimizing the proposed function. Subsequently, we provide the theoretical analysis of VVAMo, including the convergence proof and computational complexity analysis. To investigate the effectiveness of the proposed model, a comprehensive empirical study of VVAMo is conducted using extensive commonly used realistic network datasets. The results obtained show that VVAMo attained superior performances over existing classical and state-of-the-art approaches.},

  abstract     = {This article aims to stabilize an $n$ -dimensional linear time-invariant (LTI) system, whose feedback packets are transmitted through a digital communication network. The digital network suffers from network delay and independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) feedback dropouts, which may destabilize the system. The coupling among multiple state variables may further harm the stability of the system. In order to deal with these issues and save the occupied bandwidth of the feedback network, we propose a periodic event-triggering strategy. In our strategy, the state is measured periodically, but only quantized and transmitted when a certain condition is triggered. By well balancing the state coupling and making full use of both the information inside transmitted feedback packets and the one carried by sampling time instants, our strategy can maintain the desired mean square stability at a lower bit rate than conventional periodic sampling policies. The obtained stabilizing bit rate conditions are determined by the processing and network delays, the dropout rate, and the unstable eigenvalues of the system matrix, but independent of the process noise. Moreover, the lack of the direct state access does not incur any additional stabilizing bit rate. Simulations are done to confirm the effectiveness of the obtained stabilizing bit rate conditions.},

Such a matrix can be represented by a non-negative latent factor analysis model relying on a single latent factor (LF)-dependent, non-negative, and multiplicative update algorithm. However, existing models’ representative abilities are limited due to their specialized learning objective. To address this issue, this study proposes an $\alpha - \beta $ -divergence-generalized model that enjoys fast convergence. Its ideas are three-fold: 1) generalizing its learning objective with $\alpha - \beta $ -divergence to achieve highly accurate representation of HiDS data; 2) incorporating a generalized momentum method into parameter learning for fast convergence; and 3) implementing self-adaptation of controllable hyperparameters for excellent practicability. Empirical studies on six HiDS matrices from real RSs demonstrate that compared with state-of-the-art LF models, the proposed one achieves significant accuracy and efficiency gain to estimate huge missing data in an HiDS matrix.},

For reducing the switching frequency, the combined switching paradigm constituted by the time-dependent and state-dependent switching strategies is then constructed. In light of the proposed dwell-time-dependent storage functional, sufficient conditions with less conservativeness are formulated, under which the resultant synchronization error system is strictly $(\mathcal {\tilde {X}},\mathcal {\tilde {Y}},\mathcal {\tilde {Z}})$ - $\vartheta $ -dissipative on the basis of the combined switching mechanism or the joint action of the switching mechanism and time-varying control input. Finally, the applicability and superiority of the theoretical results are adequately substantiated with the synchronization issue of two discrete-time switched Hopfield neural networks with time-varying delay, and the relationship among the performance index, time delay, and minimum dwell time is also revealed.},

From a computational standpoint, these challenges arise from constraints related to computer memory and processing speed. Statistically, the challenges relate to constructing procedures that can handle the so-called concept drift —the tendency of future data to have different underlying properties to current and historic data. The issue of handling structure, such as trend and periodicity, remains a difficult problem for streaming estimation. We propose the real-time adaptive component (RAC), a penalized-regression modeling framework that satisfies the computational constraints of streaming data, and provides the capability for dealing with concept drift. At the core of the estimation process are techniques from adaptive filtering. The RAC procedure adopts a specified basis to handle local structure, along with a least absolute shrinkage operator-like penalty procedure to handle over fitting. We enhance the RAC estimation procedure with a streaming anomaly detection capability. The experiments with simulated data suggest the procedure can be considered as a competitive tool for a variety of scenarios, and an illustration with real cyber-security data further demonstrates the promise of the method.},

  abstract     = {Brain–computer interface (BCI) technologies are popular methods of communication between the human brain and external devices. One of the most popular approaches to BCI is motor imagery (MI). In BCI applications, the electroencephalography (EEG) is a very popular measurement for brain dynamics because of its noninvasive nature. Although there is a high interest in the BCI topic, the performance of existing systems is still far from ideal, due to the difficulty of performing pattern recognition tasks in EEG signals. This difficulty lies in the selection of the correct EEG channels, the signal-to-noise ratio of these signals, and how to discern the redundant information among them. BCI systems are composed of a wide range of components that perform signal preprocessing, feature extraction, and decision making. In this article, we define a new BCI framework, called enhanced fusion framework, where we propose three different ideas to improve the existing MI-based BCI frameworks. First, we include an additional preprocessing step of the signal: a differentiation of the EEG signal that makes it time invariant. Second, we add an additional frequency band as a feature for the system: the sensorimotor rhythm band, and we show its effect on the performance of the system. Finally, we make a profound study of how to make the final decision in the system. We propose the usage of both up to six types of different classifiers and a wide range of aggregation functions (including classical aggregations, Choquet and Sugeno integrals, and their extensions and overlap functions) to fuse the information given by the considered classifiers. We have tested this new system on a dataset of 20 volunteers performing MI-based brain–computer interface experiments. On this dataset, the new system achieved 88.80\% accuracy. We also propose an optimized version of our system that is able to obtain up to 90.76\%. Furthermore, we find that the pair Choquet/Sugeno integrals and overlap functions are the ones providing the best results.},

The sensors of the plant are grouped into several nodes according to their physical distribution. For resource-saving purposes, the signal transmission between each sensor node and the controller is implemented based on the dynamical ETM. Taking the node-based idea into account, a general multiloop decentralized fuzzy PID-like controller is designed with fixed integral windows to reduce the potential accumulation error. The overall decentralized fuzzy PID-like control scheme involves multiple single-loop controllers, each of which is designed to generate the local control law based on the measurements of the corresponding sensor node. These kinds of local controllers are convenient to apply in practice. Sufficient conditions are obtained under which the controlled system is exponentially stable with the prescribed $H_{\infty }$ performance index. The desired controller gains are then characterized by solving an iterative optimization problem.

By observing that both the matrix encoding PCs, called pairwise constraint matrix (PCM) and the empirically constructed affinity matrix (EAM), express the similarity between samples, we assume that both of them are generated from a latent affinity matrix (LAM) that can depict the ideal pairwise relation between samples. Specifically, the PCM can be thought of as a partial observation of the LAM, while the EAM is a fully observed one but corrupted with noise/outliers. To this end, we innovatively cast the semisupervised affinity matrix learning as the recovery of the LAM guided by the PCM and EAM, which is technically formulated as a convex optimization problem. We also provide an efficient algorithm for solving the resulting model numerically. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the significant superiority of our method over state-of-the-art ones when used for constrained clustering and dimensionality reduction.

  abstract     = {Understanding the emotional contagion process in the crowd will help to take measures in advance to avoid the large-scale spread of negative emotions in emergencies and reduce the loss of lives and properties. Studying the phase transition phenomenon is fundamental to analyzing and evaluating the crowd emotional contagion. However, it is a challenging issue since most people participate in both the physical and cyber networks at the same time. In this article, we focus on the emotional contagion in physical–cyber integrated networks from the phase transition perspective. To achieve this, we first construct a physical–cyber integrated network model to describe the interactions between physical and cyber networks. Second, we build an emotional contagion model to capture the characteristics of emotional contagion in the physical and cyber integrated networks accurately. Finally, we study the phase transition phenomenon of emotional contagion and identify the critical threshold by mapping the emotional contagion to the joint site/bond percolation model. Numerical simulations and experiments further support and enrich our conclusions. The proposed method is expected to provide guidance for controlling emotional contagion in emergencies.},

When most event-triggered schemes in MASs only reduce each agent’s data transmissions to neighbor agents, CETMs further reduce data transmissions to actuators with one triggered function in each agent. To guarantee the switching links utilized by CETMs contain a directed spanning tree at any time, triggered decisions are improved to include the instants at which each agent’s output links or leader link change. Furthermore, a less conservative method based on matrix inequalities is combined to minimize the allowable average dwell time (ADT) of switching topologies under the design conditions of CETMs. Based on multiple Lyapunov functions (MLFs), the sufficient conditions for controller gains that guarantee the leader-following consensus of MASs are proposed when the ADT of switching topologies is larger than the allowable value.

It is a challenging vision task, in which the diversity and interactivity of human actions result in great difficulty to learn an adaptive classifier to catch ambiguous interclass information. Therefore, traditional FSL methods usually perform unsatisfactorily in complex HOI scenes. To this end, we propose dynamic graph-in-graph networks (DGIG-Net), a novel graph prototypes framework to learn a dynamic metric space by embedding a visual subgraph to a task-oriented cross-modal graph for few-shot HOI. Specifically, we first build a knowledge reconstruction graph to learn latent representations for HOI categories by reconstructing the relationship among visual features, which generates visual representations under the category distribution of every task. Then, a dynamic relation graph integrates both reconstructible visual nodes and dynamic task-oriented semantic information to explore a graph metric space for HOI class prototypes, which applies the discriminative information from the similarities among actions or objects. We validate DGIG-Net on multiple benchmark datasets, on which it largely outperforms existing FSL approaches and achieves state-of-the-art results.},

EMT solves multiple optimization tasks simultaneously using evolutionary algorithms with the aim to improve the solution for each task via intertask knowledge transfer. The effectiveness of intertask knowledge transfer is the key to the success of EMT. The multifactorial evolutionary algorithm (MFEA) represents one of the most widely used implementation paradigms of EMT. However, it tends to suffer from noneffective or even negative knowledge transfer. To address this issue and improve the performance of MFEA, we incorporate a prior-knowledge-based multiobjectivization via decomposition (MVD) into MFEA to construct strongly related meme helper-tasks. In the proposed method, MVD creates a related multiobjective optimization problem for each component task based on the corresponding problem structure or decision variable grouping to enhance positive intertask knowledge transfer. MVD can reduce the number of local optima and increase population diversity. Comparative experiments on the widely used test problems demonstrate that the constructed meme helper-tasks can utilize the prior knowledge of the target problems to improve the performance of MFEA.},

Via fully exploiting system states influenced by time delays directly, this novel reconstructed method is proposed with a controller isolated. Hence, when the PID controllers are unknown, the stability criterion based on this model can resolve controller gains with less time consumed. For given PID gains, this model can be employed to establish criteria for stability analysis, which can realize the tradeoff between the calculation accuracy and efficiency. The case study is first based on a two-area traditional LFC system to validate the merits of a novel reconstructed model, including accurately estimating the influence of time delay on system frequency stability with increased computational capability. Then, under traditional and deregulated environments, case studies are carried out on the two-area and three-area schemes, respectively. Through the novel reconstructed model, the efficiency of obtaining controller parameters is highly improved while their robustness against the random wind power, tie-line power changes, inertial reductions, and time delays remains almost unchanged.},

Through nonlinear transformation, a continuous valued vector (i.e., a concatenation of the continuous variables associated with the edges) is transferred to a discrete valued community grouping solution. Further, two objective functions for the single-attribute and multiattribute network are proposed to evaluate the attribute homogeneity of the nodes in communities, respectively. Based on the new encoding method and the two objectives, a MOEA based upon NSGA-II, called continuous encoding MOEA, is developed for the transformed community detection problem with continuous decision variables. Experimental results on single-attribute and multiattribute networks with different types show that the developed algorithm performs significantly better than some well-known evolutionary- and nonevolutionary-based algorithms. The fitness landscape analysis verifies that the transformed community detection problems have smoother landscapes than those of the original problems, which justifies the effectiveness of the proposed graph neural network encoding method.},

  abstract     = {In the past several years, it has become apparent that the effectiveness of Pareto-dominance-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithms deteriorates progressively as the number of objectives in the problem, given by $M$ , grows. This is mainly due to the poor discriminability of Pareto optimality in many-objective spaces (typically $M\geq 4$ ). As a consequence, research efforts have been driven in the general direction of developing solution ranking methods that do not rely on Pareto dominance (e.g., decomposition-based techniques), which can provide sufficient selection pressure. However, it is still a nontrivial issue for many existing non-Pareto-dominance-based evolutionary algorithms to deal with unknown irregular Pareto front shapes. In this article, a new many-objective evolutionary algorithm based on the generalization of Pareto optimality (GPO) is proposed, which is simple, yet effective, in addressing many-objective optimization problems. The proposed algorithm used an “( $M-1$ ) + 1” framework of GPO dominance, ( $M-1$ )-GPD for short, to rank solutions in the environmental selection step, in order to promote convergence and diversity simultaneously. To be specific, we apply $M$ symmetrical cases of ( $M-1$ )-GPD, where each enhances the selection pressure of $M-1$ objectives by expanding the dominance area of solutions, while remaining unchanged for the one objective left out of that process. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is very competitive with the state-of-the-art methods to which it is compared, on a variety of scalable benchmark problems. Moreover, experiments on three real-world problems have verified that the proposed algorithm can outperform the others on each of these problems.},

For the case of leader–follower, a distributed continuous adaptive controller is put forward to converge the tracking error to a bounded domain by using the Lyapunov function, graph theory, and PDE theory. Furthermore, a corollary that the tracking error tends to zero by replacing the continuous controller with the discontinuous controller is given.

Deep-LIFT extracts features for each label by aligning each label and its region. Specifically, Deep-LIFTs are achieved through learning multiple correlation maps between image convolutional features and label embeddings. Moreover, we construct two variant graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to further capture the interdependency among labels.

However, all existing methods consider networks as error-free sources and treat feature content in each node as independent and equally important to model node relations. Noisy node content, combined with sparse features, provides essential challenges for existing methods to be used in real-world noisy networks. In this article, we propose feature-based attention GCN (FA-GCN), a feature-attention graph convolution learning framework, to handle networks with noisy and sparse node content. To tackle noise and sparse content in each node, FA-GCN first employs a long short-term memory (LSTM) network to learn dense representation for each node feature. To model interactions between neighboring nodes, a feature-attention mechanism is introduced to allow neighboring nodes to learn and vary feature importance, with respect to their connections. By using a spectral-based graph convolution aggregation process, each node is allowed to concentrate more on the most determining neighborhood features aligned with the corresponding learning task. Experiments and validations, w.r.t. different noise levels, demonstrate that FA-GCN achieves better performance than the state-of-the-art methods in both noise-free and noisy network environments.},

  abstract     = {Cross-manifold clustering is an extreme challenge learning problem. Since the low-density hypothesis is not satisfied in cross-manifold problems, many traditional clustering methods failed to discover the cross-manifold structures. In this article, we propose multiple flat projections clustering (MFPC) for cross-manifold clustering. In our MFPC, the given samples are projected into multiple localized flats to discover the global structures of implicit manifolds. Thus, the intersected clusters are distinguished in various projection flats. In MFPC, a series of nonconvex matrix optimization problems is solved by a proposed recursive algorithm. Furthermore, a nonlinear version of MFPC is extended via kernel tricks to deal with a more complex cross-manifold learning situation. The synthetic tests show that our MFPC works on the cross-manifold structures well. Moreover, experimental results on the benchmark datasets and object tracking videos show excellent performance of our MFPC compared with some state-of-the-art manifold clustering methods.},

By using an appropriate Lyapunov function, several algebraic conditions are given for quasisynchronization of MNNs with communication delays. More important, there is no restriction on the derivation of the Lyapunov function, even if it is an increasing function over a period of time.

Second, in order to avoid the extra information transmission, a new sliding-mode switching function consisting of the triggering state information is proposed to design the event-triggered integral SMC (ISMC) law. In addition, the ultimate boundedness of sliding motion can be ensured via using a designed event-triggered ISMC law.

To address this, in this article, we propose a novel MVSC with grouping effect (MvSCGE) approach. Particularly, our approach simultaneously learns the multiple subspace representations for multiple views with smooth regularization, and then exploits the subspacewise grouping effect in these learned subspaces by means of a unified optimization framework. Meanwhile, the proposed approach is able to ensure the cross-view consistency and learn a consistent cluster indicator matrix for the final clustering results. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets have been conducted to validate the superiority of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {Diagnosing the fault as early as possible is significant to guarantee the safety and reliability of the high-speed train. Incipient fault always makes the monitored signals deviate from their normal values, which may lead to serious consequences gradually. Due to the obscure early stage symptoms, incipient faults are difficult to detect. This article develops a stacked generalization (stacking)-based incipient fault diagnosis scheme for the traction system of high-speed trains. To extract the fault feature from the faulty data signals, which are similar to the normal ones, the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), random forest (RF), extra trees (ET), and light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM) are chosen as the base estimators in the first layer of the stacking. Then, the logistic regression (LR) is taken as the meta estimator in the second layer to integrate the results from the base estimators for fault classification. Thanks to the generalization ability of stacking, the incipient fault diagnosis performance of the proposed stacking-based method is better than that of the single model (XGBoost, RF, ET, and LightGBM), although they can be used to detect the incipient faults, separately. Moreover, to find out the optimal hyperparameters of the base estimators, a swarm intelligent optimization algorithm, pigeon-inspired optimization (PIO), is employed. The proposed method is tested on a semiphysical platform of the CRH2 traction system in CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Company Ltd. The results show that the fault diagnosis rate of the proposed scheme is over 96\%.},

To make membership degrees of each image pixel closer to those of its neighbors, a KL divergence term on the partition matrix is introduced as a part of FCM, thus resulting in KL divergence-based FCM. To make the proposed FCM robust, a filtered term is augmented in its objective function, where MR is used for image filtering. Since tight wavelet frames provide redundant representations of images, the proposed FCM is performed in a feature space constructed by tight wavelet frame decomposition. To further improve its segmentation accuracy (SA), a segmented feature set is reconstructed by minimizing the inverse process of its objective function. Each reconstructed feature is reassigned to the closest prototype, thus modifying abnormal features produced in the reconstruction process. Moreover, a segmented image is reconstructed by using tight wavelet frame reconstruction. Finally, supporting experiments coping with synthetic, medical, and real-world images are reported. The experimental results exhibit that the proposed algorithm works well and comes with better segmentation performance than other peers. In a quantitative fashion, its average SA improvements over its peers are 4.06\%, 3.94\%, and 4.41\%, respectively, when segmenting synthetic, medical, and real-world images.

  abstract     = {Adversarial attack can be deemed as a necessary prerequisite evaluation procedure before the deployment of any reinforcement learning (RL) policy. Most existing approaches for generating adversarial attacks are gradient based and are extensive, viz., perturbing every pixel of every frame. In contrast, recent advances show that gradient-free selective perturbations (i.e., attacking only selected pixels and frames) could be a more realistic adversary. However, these attacks treat every frame in isolation, ignoring the relationship between neighboring states of a Markov decision process; thus resulting in high computational complexity that tends to limit their real-world plausibility due to the tight time constraint in RL. Given the above, this article showcases the first study of how transferability across frames could be exploited for boosting the creation of minimal yet powerful attacks in image-based RL. To this end, we introduce three types of frame-correlation transfers (FCTs) (i.e., anterior case transfer, random projection-based transfer, and principal components-based transfer) with varying degrees of computational complexity in generating adversaries via a genetic algorithm. We empirically demonstrate the tradeoff between the complexity and potency of the transfer mechanism by exploring four fully trained state-of-the-art policies on six Atari games. Our FCTs dramatically speed up the attack generation compared to existing methods, often reducing the computation time required to nearly zero; thus, shedding light on the real threat of real-time attacks in RL.},

The proposed approach synthesizes an offline optimization problem to design a look-up table and an online tube-based output feedback RMPC with tightened constraints and scaled terminal constraint sets. In the offline optimization problem, a sequence of nested robust positively invariant (RPI) sets and robust control invariant (RCI) sets, respectively, for estimation errors and control errors is optimized and stored in the look-up table. In the online optimization problem, real-time control parameters are searched based on the bounds of time-varying estimation error sets. Considering the characteristics of the uncertain scheduling parameter in LPV systems, the online tube-based output feedback RMPC scheme adopts one-step nominal system prediction with scaled terminal constraint sets. The formulated simple and efficient online optimization problem with fewer decision variables and constraints has a lower online computational burden. Recursive feasibility of the optimization problem and robust stability of the controlled LPV system are guaranteed by ensuring that the nominal system converges to the terminal constraint set, and uncertain state trajectories are constrained within robust tubes with the center of the nominal system.

  abstract     = {In this article, we consider the formation tracking problem of nonholonomic multiagent systems only using relative bearing measurements between the agents. Such a practical and important yet challenging issue has been taken into limited consideration by existing approaches, which usually requires additional measurements such as relative positions. The contributions of this article are two-fold. First, a fully distributed reference velocity estimator is proposed. Under the proposed adaptive estimator, each agent can estimate the time-varying reference velocity asymptotically. Second, an input-to-state stable controller is designed according to the bearing rigid theory. Under the proposed controller, the formation with bearing-only constraints can be achieved. Finally, the proposed scheme is demonstrated and its effectiveness is verified by presenting some simulation and experimental tests.},

  abstract     = {This article studies the problem of synthesis with guaranteed cost and less human intervention for linear human-in-the-loop (HiTL) control systems. Initially, the human behaviors are modeled via a hidden controlled Markov process, which not only considers the inference’s stochasticity and observation’s uncertainty of the human internal state but also takes the control input to human into account. Then, to integrate both models of human and machine as well as their interaction, a hidden controlled Markov jump system (HCMJS) is constructed. With the aid of the stochastic Lyapunov functional together with the bilinear matrix inequality technique, a sufficient condition for the existence of human-assistance controllers is derived on the basis of the HCMJS model, which not only guarantees the stochastic stability of the closed-loop HiTL system but also provides a prescribed upper bound for the quadratic cost function. Moreover, to achieve less human intervention while meeting the desired cost level, an algorithm that mixes the particle swarm optimization and linear matrix inequality technique is proposed to seek a suitable feedback control law to the human and a human-assistance control law to the machine. Finally, the proposed method is applied to a driver-assistance system to verify its effectiveness.},

Especially, Siamese trackers, which aim to learn a decision making-based similarity evaluation, are widely utilized in the tracking community. However, the online updating of the Siamese fashion is still a tricky issue due to the limitation, which is a tradeoff between model adaption and degradation. To address such an issue, in this article, we propose a novel attentional transfer learning-based Siamese network (SiamATL), which fully exploits the previous knowledge to inspire the current tracker learning in the decision-making module. First, we explicitly model the template and surroundings by using an attentional online update strategy to avoid template pollution. Then, we introduce an instance-transfer discriminative correlation filter (ITDCF) to enhance the distinguishing ability of the tracker. Finally, we suggest a mutual compensation mechanism that integrates cross-correlation matching and ITDCF detection into the decision-making subnetwork to achieve online tracking. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art tracking algorithms on multiple large-scale tracking datasets.},

To strengthen the classification ability and robustness of the enhanced layer, we propose a selective ensemble model based on enhanced attention convolutional neural networks (EnCNNs). To increase the diversity of the ensemble system, these EnCNNs are generated by using two manners: 1) different sample subsets and 2) different granularity kernels. Then, an evaluation criterion that considers both accuracy and diversity is proposed in LES to obtain effective integration results. Furthermore, to make better use of information flow, we develop an adaptive dense ensemble structure with multiple enhanced layers in GDES to mitigate the issue that there may be redundant or invalid enhanced layers in the cascade structure. We conducted extensive experiments against state-of-the-art methods on multiple real-world datasets, including long and short texts, which has verified the effectiveness and generality of our method.},

Therefore, this article proposes a novel fault diagnosis method based on short-time wavelet entropy integrating the long short-term memory network (LSTM) and the support vector machine (SVM). The proposed short-time wavelet entropy calculation method is used to extract the fault information. First, the optimal short-term wavelet packet calculation period is determined. Moreover, the improved LSTM topology can process the wavelet entropy fault information in the time dimension. Then, the output of the LSTM is set as the input of the SVM to obtain the fault diagnosis result based on the adaptive classification. Finally, through the MMC fault diagnosis experiment of the double-ended MMC-HVDC transmission system, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified. Compared with the traditional fault diagnosis method, the proposed method has better robustness, adaptability, and accuracy, which can greatly reduce the number of electrical signal samples and realize the fault diagnosis of multiple fault types by collecting a single signal.},

It is strictly proven that the system under consideration is stable in the sense of uniformly ultimate boundedness provided by the solutions of event-triggered Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equations. Different from the traditional adaptive critic design methods, we present an identifier-critic network architecture to relax the restrictions posed on the system dynamics, and the actor network commonly used to approximate the optimal control law is circumvented. The weights in the critic network are tuned on the basis of the gradient descent approach as well as the historical data, such that the persistence of excitation condition is no longer needed.

  abstract     = {Domain adaptation aims to facilitate the learning task in an unlabeled target domain by leveraging the auxiliary knowledge in a well-labeled source domain from a different distribution. Almost existing autoencoder-based domain adaptation approaches focus on learning domain-invariant representations to reduce the distribution discrepancy between source and target domains. However, there is still a weakness existing in these approaches: the class-discriminative information of the two domains may be damaged while aligning the distributions of the source and target domains, which makes the samples with different classes close to each other, leading to performance degradation. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel dual-representation autoencoder (DRAE) to learn dual-domain-invariant representations for domain adaptation. Specifically, DRAE consists of three learning phases. First, DRAE learns global representations of all source and target data to maximize the interclass distance in each domain and minimize the marginal distribution and conditional distribution of both domains simultaneously. Second, DRAE extracts local representations of instances sharing the same label in both domains to maintain class-discriminative information in each class. Finally, DRAE constructs dual representations by aligning the global and local representations with different weights. Using three text and two image datasets and 12 state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods, the extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of DRAE.},

However, the recent scheme of generating an image caption by maximizing the likelihood of target sentences lacks the capacity of recognizing the human–object interaction (HOI) and semantic relationship between HOIs and scenes, which are the essential parts of an image caption. This article proposes a novel two-phase framework to generate an image caption by addressing the above challenges: 1) a hybrid deep learning and 2) an image description generation. In the hybrid deep-learning phase, a novel factored three-way interaction machine was proposed to learn the relational features of the human–object pairs hierarchically. In this way, the image recognition problem is transformed into a latent structured labeling task. In the image description generation phase, a lexicalized probabilistic context-free tree growing scheme is innovatively integrated with a description generator to transform the descriptions generation task into a syntactic-tree generation process. Extensively comparing state-of-the-art image captioning methods on benchmark datasets, we demonstrated that our proposed framework outperformed the existing captioning methods in different ways, such as significantly improving the performance of the HOI and relationships between HOIs and scenes (RHIS) predictions, and quality of generated image captions in a semantically and structurally coherent manner.},

Considering that NMS has been an integral part of OD systems, thwarting the functionality of NMS can result in unexpected or even lethal consequences for such systems. In this article, an adversarial example attack that triggers malfunctioning of NMS in OD models is proposed. The attack, namely, Daedalus , compresses the dimensions of detection boxes to evade NMS. As a result, the final detection output contains extremely dense false positives. This can be fatal for many OD applications, such as autonomous vehicles and surveillance systems. The attack can be generalized to different OD models, such that the attack cripples various OD applications. Furthermore, a way of crafting robust adversarial examples is developed by using an ensemble of popular detection models as the substitutes. Considering the pervasive nature of model reuse in real-world OD scenarios, Daedalus examples crafted based on an ensemble of substitutes can launch attacks without knowing the parameters of the victim models. The experimental results demonstrate that the attack effectively stops NMS from filtering redundant bounding boxes. As the evaluation results suggest, Daedalus increases the false positive rate in detection results to 99.9\% and reduces the mean average precision scores to 0, while maintaining a low cost of distortion on the original inputs. It also demonstrates that the attack can be practically launched against real-world OD systems via printed posters.},

Complete disassembly is generally not suitable for disassembly enterprises; most often, the maximum profit is realized through partial disassembly. Thus, this article proposes a partial disassembly method and establishes a new DLB model that addresses both economic benefits and environmental impacts. The objective of the model is to maximize the effectiveness of workers, increase profit, reduce energy consumption, and balance the loads of workers. Moreover, the model considers the impact of disassembly face and tool changes on the disassembly process. A discrete multiobjective artificial bee colony (MOABC) algorithm is developed, and it takes the precedence constraints into account to obtain the Pareto solutions. The MOABC algorithm is applied to the disassembly lines of two real-world EOL products, including those of an LCD TV and a refrigerator. Experiments show that the performance of the MOABC algorithm is better than those of five well-known multiobjective algorithms. The proposed model and method can provide multiple disassembly schemes for decision makers of disassembly enterprises based on their preferences.},

  abstract     = {Uncertainty is inevitable in the decision-making process of real applications. Quantum mechanics has become an interesting and popular topic in predicting and explaining human decision-making behaviors, especially regarding interference effects caused by uncertainty in the process of decision making, due to the limitations of Bayesian reasoning. In addition, complex evidence theory (CET), as a generalized Dempster–Shafer evidence theory, has been proposed to represent and handle uncertainty in the framework of the complex plane, and it is an effective tool in uncertainty reasoning. Particularly, the complex mass function, also known as a complex basic belief assignment in CET, is complex-value modeled, which is superior to the classical mass function in expressing uncertain information. CET is considered to have certain inherent connections with quantum mechanics since both are complex-value modeled and can be applied in handling uncertainty in decision-making problems. In this article, therefore, by bridging CET and quantum mechanics, we propose a new complex evidential quantum dynamical (CEQD) model to predict interference effects on human decision-making behaviors. In addition, uniform and weighted complex Pignistic belief transformation functions are proposed, which can be used effectively in the CEQD model to help explain interference effects. The experimental results and comparisons demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. In summary, the proposed CEQD method provides a new perspective to study and explain the interference effects involved in human decision-making behaviors, which is significant for decision theory.},

  abstract     = {This article proposes a navigation scheme for a wheeled robot in unknown environments. The navigation scheme consists of obstacle boundary following (OBF), target seeking (TS), and vertex point seeking (VPS) behaviors and a behavior supervisor. The OBF behavior is achieved by a fuzzy controller (FC). This article formulates the FC design problem as a new constrained multiobjective optimization problem and finds a set of nondominated FC solutions through the combination of expert knowledge and data-driven multiobjective ant colony optimization. The TS behavior is achieved by new fuzzy proportional-integral-derivative (PID) and proportional–derivative (PD) controllers that control the orientation and speed of the robot, respectively. The VPS behavior is proposed to shorten the navigation route by controlling the robot to move toward a new subgoal determined from the vertex point of an obstacle. A new behavior supervisor that manages the switching among the OBF, TS, and VPS behaviors in unknown environments is proposed. In the navigation of a real robot, a new robot localization method through the fusion of encoders and an infrared localization sensor using a particle filter is proposed. Finally, this article presents simulations and experiments to verify the feasibility and advantages of the navigation scheme.},

For the sake of complying with the digitized data exchange, a feedback-type dynamic quantizer is introduced to reflect the transformation from the raw signals into the discrete-valued ones. Then, a quantized pinning control scheme takes place on a small fraction of the network nodes with the hope of cutting down the control expenses while achieving the expected global synchronization objective. Subsequently, by resorting to the completing-the-square technique, a sufficient condition is established to ensure the finite-horizon $H_{\infty }$ index of the synchronization error dynamics against both quantization errors and external noises. Moreover, a controller design algorithm is put forward via an auxiliary $H_{2}$ -type criterion, and the desired controller gains are acquired in terms of two coupled backward Riccati equations. Finally, the validity of the presented results is verified via a simulation example.},

  abstract     = {Multipoint dynamic aggregation is a meaningful optimization problem due to its important real-world applications, such as post-disaster relief, medical resource scheduling, and bushfire elimination. The problem aims to design the optimal plan for a set of robots to execute geographically distributed tasks. Unlike the majority of scheduling and routing problems, the tasks in this problem can be executed by multiple robots collaboratively. Meanwhile, the demand of each task changes over time at an incremental rate and is affected by the abilities of the robots executing it. This poses extra challenges to the problem, as it has to consider complex coupled relationships among robots and tasks. To effectively solve the problem, this article develops a new metaheuristic algorithm, called adaptive coordination ant colony optimization (ACO). We develop a novel coordinated solution construction process using multiple ants and pheromone matrices (each robot/ant forages a path according to its own pheromone matrix) to effectively handle the collaborations between robots. We also propose adaptive heuristic information based on domain knowledge to promote efficiency, a pheromone-based repair mechanism to tackle the tight constraints of the problem, and an elaborate local search to enhance the exploitation ability of the algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed adaptive coordination ACO significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency.},

The ET scheme can be applied to cut down the transmission times from the system to FAFDF. It is assumed that the system modes cannot be obtained synchronously by the filter, and instead, there is a detector that can measure the estimated modes of the system. The asynchronous phenomenon between the system and the filter is characterized via a hidden Markov model with partly accessible mode detection probabilities. Applying the Lyapunov function methods, sufficient conditions for the presence of FAFDF are obtained. Finally, an application of a wheeled mobile manipulator with hybrid joints is employed to clarify that the devised FAFDF can detect the faults without any incorrect alarm.},

The adaptive observer and controller are designed based on fuzzy approximation. The main characteristic of discussed systems is that the state variables are not available for measurement and need to be kept within the constraint set. In order to estimate the unmeasured states, the adaptive fuzzy state observer is constructed. To guarantee that all the states do not violate the time-varying bounds, the tangent barrier Lyapunov functions (BLF-Tans) are selected in the design procedure. Based on the common Lyapunov function method, the stability of considered systems is analyzed. It is demonstrated that all the signals in the resulting system are bounded, and all the states are limited in their constrained sets.

The first is that it can solve the Riemannian stochastic optimization problem directly, in contrast to RAMSGrad which only achieves a low regret. The other is that it can use constant learning rates, which makes it implementable in practice. Additionally, we apply the proposed algorithm to Poincaré embeddings that embed the transitive closure of the WordNet nouns into the Poincaré ball model of hyperbolic space. Numerical experiments show that regardless of the initial value of the learning rate, our algorithm stably converges to the optimal solution and converges faster than the existing algorithms.},

On one hand, the existing data-driven methods neglect the evolution dynamics of the processes and cannot guarantee that they work for highly dynamic or transient processes; on the other hand, model-based methods reported so far are mostly based on the backstepping technique, which does not possess enough redundancy for fault detection since only the boundary measurement is considered. Motivated by these considerations, we intend to investigate the robust fault detection problem for distributed parameter processes in a model-based perspective covering both boundary and in-domain measurement cases. A real-time fault detection filter (FDF) is presented, which gets rid of a large amount of data collection and offline training procedures. Rigorous theoretic analysis is presented for guiding the parameters selection and threshold computation. A time-varying threshold is designed such that the false alarm in the transient stage can be avoided. Successful application results on a hot strip mill cooling system demonstrate the potential for real industrial applications.},

First, the pointing control system is constructed as a coupled, nonlinear, and uncertain dynamical system with two interconnected (horizontal and vertical) subsystems. Second, for the horizontal pointing control, robust control is proposed to render the horizontal subsystem to be practically stable. Third, for the vertical pointing control, an uncertainty bound-based state transformation is constructed in a similar way of backstepping to convert the original mismatched system (i.e., the vertical subsystem) to be locally matched and then robust control is proposed to render the transformed system to be practically stable. Finally, it is proved that when the transformed system is rendered to be practically stable, the original system renders the same performance; therefore, vertical pointing control is achieved. This work should be among the first ever endeavor to cast all the coupling , nonlinearity , and (both matched and mismatched) uncertainty into the pointing control framework of the marching tank gun.},

  abstract     = {Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is a well-known technique for supervised dimensionality reduction and has been extensively applied in many real-world applications. LDA assumes that the samples are Gaussian distributed, and the local data distribution is consistent with the global distribution. However, real-world data seldom satisfy this assumption. To handle the data with complex distributions, some methods emphasize the local geometrical structure and perform discriminant analysis between neighbors. But the neighboring relationship tends to be affected by the noise in the input space. In this research, we propose a new supervised dimensionality reduction method, namely, locality adaptive discriminant analysis (LADA). In order to directly process the data with matrix representation, such as images, the 2-D LADA (2DLADA) is also developed. The proposed methods have the following salient properties: 1) they find the principle projection directions without imposing any assumption on the data distribution; 2) they explore the data relationship in the desired subspace, which contains less noise; and 3) they find the local data relationship automatically without the efforts for tuning parameters. The performance of dimensionality reduction shows the superiorities of the proposed methods over the state of the art.},

For such applications, parsimonious learning machines (PALMs) are suitable candidates due to their structural simplicity. However, these parsimonious algorithms depend upon predefined thresholds to adjust their structures in terms of adding or deleting rules. Besides, another adjustable parameter of PALM is the fuzziness in membership grades. The best set of such hyper parameters is determined by experts’ knowledge or by optimization techniques such as greedy algorithms. To mitigate such experts’ dependency or usage of computationally expensive greedy algorithms, in this work, a meta heuristic-based optimization technique, called the multimethod-based optimization technique (MOT), is utilized to develop an advanced PALM. The performance has been compared with some popular optimization techniques, namely, the greedy search, local search, genetic algorithm (GA), and particle swarm optimization (PSO). The proposed parsimonious learning algorithm with MOT outperforms the others in most cases. It validates the multioperator-based optimization technique’s advantages over the single operator-based variants in selecting the best feasible hyperparameters for the autonomous learning algorithm by maintaining a compact architecture.},

Concerning the probabilistic approach, a new place–object fusion method is proposed based on Bayesian inference. For deep learning, the proposed place–object fusion method is trained using a convolutional neural network in an end-to-end framework. Furthermore, a new recurrent neural network, called the Bayesian filtering network (BFN), is proposed to conduct time-domain fusion.

Notably, to characterize the fallibility of the communication links between the MO and the filter, the packet dropouts, DAs, and quantization effects are taken into account simultaneously, which signifies that the resulting system is much more applicable than the existing results. Meanwhile, to deal with the phenomenon of asynchronous switching, a hierarchical structure approach is adopted, which involves the existing nonsynchronous/synchronous strategy as special cases. By means of a fuzzy-basis-dependent Lyapunov strategy, sufficient criteria are formulated such that the resulting system is stochastic finite-time boundedness under randomly occurring DAs.

  abstract     = {A single dataset could hide a significant number of relationships among its feature set. Learning these relationships simultaneously avoids the time complexity associated with running the learning algorithm for every possible relationship, and affords the learner with an ability to recover missing data and substitute erroneous ones by using available data. In our previous research, we introduced the gate-layer autoencoders (GLAEs), which offer an architecture that enables a single model to approximate multiple relationships simultaneously. GLAE controls what an autoencoder learns in a time series by switching on and off certain input gates, thus, allowing and disallowing the data to flow through the network to increase network’s robustness. However, GLAE is limited to binary gates. In this article, we generalize the architecture to weighted gate layer autoencoders (WGLAE) through the addition of a weight layer to update the error according to which variables are more critical and to encourage the network to learn these variables. This new weight layer can also be used as an output gate and uses additional control parameters to afford the network with abilities to represent different models that can learn through gating the inputs. We compare the architecture against similar architectures in the literature and demonstrate that the proposed architecture produces more robust autoencoders with the ability to reconstruct both incomplete synthetic and real data with high accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Switch-based adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) is an optimal control problem in which a cost must be minimized by switching among a family of dynamical modes. When the system dimension increases, the solution to switch-based ADP is made prohibitive by the exponentially increasing structure of the value function approximator and by the exponentially increasing modes. This technical correspondence proposes a distributed computational method for solving switch-based ADP. The method relies on partitioning the system into agents, each one dealing with a lower dimensional state and a few local modes. Each agent aims to minimize a local version of the global cost while avoiding that its local switching strategy has conflicts with the switching strategies of the neighboring agents. A heuristic algorithm based on the consensus dynamics and Nash equilibrium is proposed to avoid such conflicts. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified via traffic and building test cases.},

  abstract     = {Feature selection (FS) is an important data preprocessing technique in data mining and machine learning, which aims to select a small subset of information features to increase the performance and reduce the dimensionality. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) has been successfully applied to FS due to being efficient and easy to implement. However, most of the existing PSO-based FS methods face the problems of trapping into local optima and computationally expensive high-dimensional data. Multifactorial optimization (MFO), as an effective evolutionary multitasking paradigm, has been widely used for solving complex problems through implicit knowledge transfer between related tasks. Inspired by MFO, this study proposes a novel PSO-based FS method to solve high-dimensional classification via information sharing between two related tasks generated from a dataset. To be specific, two related tasks about the target concept are established by evaluating the importance of features. A new crossover operator, called assortative mating, is applied to share information between these two related tasks. In addition, two mechanisms, which are variable-range strategy and subset updating mechanism, are also developed to reduce the search space and maintain the diversity of the population, respectively. The results show that the proposed FS method can achieve higher classification accuracy with a smaller feature subset in a reasonable time than the state-of-the-art FS methods on the examined high-dimensional classification problems.},

Fuzzy set theory is used to describe the inexact boundary and then the problem of robust control of uncertain dynamical systems is studied. Based on two adjustable design parameters, a robust control method for general mechanical systems is proposed. The control is deterministic, not the conventional IF-THEN rule based. By using the Lyapunov minimax approach, it is proved that the proposed control can guarantee system performance to be uniformly bounded and uniformly ultimately bounded. In order to find the optimal solution in the prescribed range, a two-player cooperative game is used. To reduce costs while ensuring control performance, two performance indices are developed, each of which is controlled by an adjustable parameter (i.e., player). Both necessary and sufficient conditions for Pareto-optimality are established. Using these conditions, the Pareto-optimal solution can be obtained. The effectiveness of the control design is demonstrated by the simulation of the two-body pendulum.},

  abstract     = {The core prerequisite of most modern trackers is a motion assumption, defined as predicting the current location in a limited search region centering at the previous prediction. For clarity, the central subregion of a search region is denoted as the tracking anchor (e.g., the location of the previous prediction in the current frame). However, providing accurate predictions in all frames is very challenging in the complex nature scenes. In addition, the target locations in consecutive frames often change violently under the attribute of fast motion. Both facts are likely to lead the previous prediction to an unbelievable tracking anchor, which will make the aforementioned prerequisite invalid and cause tracking drift. To enhance the reliability of tracking anchors, we propose a real-time multianchor visual tracking mechanism, called multianchor tracking (MAT). Instead of directly relying on the tracking anchor inherited from the previous prediction, MAT selects the best anchor from an anchor ensemble, which includes several objectness-based anchor proposals and the anchor inherited from the previous prediction. The objectness-based anchors provide several complementary selective search regions, and an entropy-minimization-based selection method is introduced to find the best anchor. Our approach offers two benefits: 1) selective search regions can increase the chance of tracking success with affordable computational load and 2) anchor selection introduces the best anchor for each frame, which breaks the limitation of solo depending on the previous prediction. The extensive experiments of nine base trackers upgraded by MAT on four challenging datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MAT.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning technology has been widely used in fault diagnosis for chemical processes. However, most deep learning technologies currently adopted only use a single network stack or a certain network stack with multilayer perceptron (MLP) behind it. Compared with traditional fault diagnosis technologies, this method has made progress in both the diagnosis accuracy and speed, but due to the limited performance of a single network, the accuracy or speed cannot meet the requirements to the greatest extent. In order to overcome such problems, this article proposes a fault diagnosis method using deep learning multimodel fusion. Different from previous deep learning diagnosis methods, this method uses long short-term memory (LSTM) and convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract features separately. The extracted features are then fused and MLP is taken as the input for further feature compression and extraction, and finally the diagnosis results will be obtained. LSTM has long-term memory capabilities, the extracted features have temporal characteristics, and CNNs have a good effect on the extraction of spatial features. The proposed method integrates these two aspects for diagnosis such that the features finally extracted by the network have both spatial and temporal characteristics, thereby improving the network’s diagnostic performance. Finally, a TE chemical process and an industrial coking furnace process are taken for simulation testing. It is proved that the performance of this method is superior to existing deep learning fault diagnosis methods with simple sequential stacking for unilateral feature extraction.},

First, multitype generative networks with heterogeneous parameter-updating mechanisms are designed to explore a variety of different solutions and eliminate the potential risks of instable training and scenario collapse. Then, based on expert experience, two data constraints are proposed to describe leak characteristics and further evaluate the quality of generated leak data in the training process. Through integrating the particle swarm optimization algorithm into generative model training, mixed-GAN has better generation performance than the conventional gradient descent algorithm.

However, the QR code is often limited in many scenarios because of its random and dull appearance. Therefore, this article proposes a novel approach to embed hyperlinks into common images, making the hyperlinks invisible for human eyes but detectable for mobile devices equipped with a camera. Our approach is an end-to-end neural network with an encoder to hide messages and a decoder to extract messages. To maintain the hidden message resilient to cameras, we build a distortion network between the encoder and the decoder to augment the encoded images. The distortion network uses differentiable 3-D rendering operations, which can simulate the distortion introduced by camera imaging in both printing and display scenarios. To maintain the visual attraction of the image with hyperlinks, a loss function conforming to the human visual system (HVS) is used to supervise the training of the encoder. Experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms the previous work on both robustness and quality. Based on the proposed approach, many applications become possible, for example, “image hyperlinks” for advertisement on TV, website, or poster, and “invisible watermark” for copyright protection on digital resources or product packagings.},

  abstract     = {This study investigates a quantized feedback design problem for distributed adaptive leader-following consensus of uncertain strict-feedback nonlinear multiagent systems with state quantizers. It is assumed that all system nonlinearities of followers are unknown and heterogeneous, all state variables of each follower are quantized by a uniform state quantizer, and quantized states of followers are only communicated under a directed network. Compared with previous approximation-based distributed consensus tracking methods for uncertain lower triangular multiagent systems, the main contribution of this article is addressing the distributed quantized state communication problem in the adaptive leader-following consensus tracking field of uncertain lower triangular multiagent systems. A quantized-states-based local adaptive control law for each follower is derived by designing quantized-signals-based weight tuning laws for neural-network-based function approximators. By analyzing the boundedness of the local quantization errors, it is shown that the total closed-loop signals are uniformly ultimately bounded and the consensus tracking errors converge to a sufficiently small domain around the origin. Finally, simulation examples, including multiple ship steering systems, are considered to verify the effectiveness of the proposed theoretical approach.},

With an elaborate design of the adaptive law of the dynamic gain, a novel adaptive event-triggered output-feedback controller is developed to ensure that the closed-loop system is globally asymptotically stable.

Due to the presence of system modeling error, it is impossible to construct a model that fits exactly the experimental evidence and, at the same time, exhibits high generalization capabilities. To alleviate these problems, in this study, we elaborate on a realization of granular outputs for rule-based fuzzy models with the aim of effectively quantifying the associated modeling errors. Through analyzing the characteristics of modeling errors, an error model is constructed to characterize deviations among the estimated outputs and the expected ones. The resulting granular model comes into play as an aggregation of the regression model and the error model. Information granularity plays a central role in the construction of granular outputs (intervals). The quality of the produced interval estimates is quantified in terms of the coverage and specificity criteria. The optimal allocation of information granularity is determined through a combined index involving these two criteria pertinent to the evaluation of interval outputs. A series of experimental studies is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and show its superiority over the traditional statistical-based method.},

In the SNOAE model, it is assumed that each agent has a CODA for a certain issue. Agents’ opinions are private and invisible, that is, an individual agent only knows its own opinion and cannot obtain other agents’ opinions unless there is a social network connection edge that allows their communication; agents’ actions are public and visible to all agents and impact other agents’ actions. Opinions and actions evolve in a directed social network. In the limitation of the bounded confidence, other agents’ actions or agents’ opinions noticed or obtained by network communication, respectively, are used by agents to update their opinions. Based on the SNOAE model, the evolution of the opinions and actions with bounded confidence is investigated in social networks both theoretically and experimentally with a detailed simulation analysis. Theoretical research results show that discrete actions can attract agents who trust the discrete action, and make agents to express extreme opinions. Simulation experiments results show that social network connection probability, bounded confidence, and the opinion threshold of action choice parameters have strong impacts on the evolution of opinions and actions. However, the number of agents in the social network has no obvious influence on the evolution of opinions and actions.},

By introducing an observer, a distributed output-feedback control protocol is designed for each follower agent under a directed communication topology. It is proved by the Lyapunov–Razumikhin theorem that the consensus of the multiagent system is achieved with the proposed consensus protocol. Different from the existing results, the dynamic gain is constructed for each follower to propose the consensus protocol, without resorting to the celebrated backstepping technique.

In contrast with the correlative literature, the systems permit multiple uncertainties (not only in control coefficients but also in inherent nonlinearities), and typically the consensus protocol is pursued in a fully distributed fashion (independent from any global information of network topology). This essentially challenges the realization of the finite-time consensus. To overcome the challenge, a new continuous fully distributed protocol is proposed by combining adaptive techniques such that the finite-time consensus of the systems under investigation is achieved. Remarkably, a dynamic high gain, rather than multiple ones in the related literature, is adequate to resist two kinds of uncertainties and to guarantee the fully distributed fashion of the consensus protocol. Moreover, the adaptive finite-time consensus protocol is specified on the scenario of leader-following multiagent systems. Simulation results of three interaction topologies are acquired to illustrate the validity and the wider applicability of the proposed protocol.},

  abstract     = {Due to the high resistance/reactance (R/X) ratio of a low-voltage microgrid (LVMG), virtual complex impedance-based $P-\dot {V}/Q-\omega $ droop control is adopted in this article as the primary control (PC) technique for stabilizing the system. A distributed event-triggered restoration mechanism (ETSM) is proposed as the secondary control (SC) technique to restore the output-voltage frequency and improve power sharing accuracy. The proposed ETSM ensures that neighboring communication happens only at some discrete instants when a predefined event-triggering condition (ETC) is fulfilled. In general, the design of the ETC is the crucial challenge of an event-triggered mechanism (ETM). Thus, in this article, a static ETM (SETM) is proposed as the ETC at first, where two static parameters are utilized to reduce the triggering frequency. Bounded stability is ensured under the SETM, which means that the output-voltage frequency is restored to the vicinity of its nominal value, and close to fair utilization of the distributed generators (DGs) is achieved. To further improve the power sharing accuracy and accelerate the regulation process, a dynamic ETM (DETM) is then introduced. In the DETM, two dynamic parameters that converge to zero in the steady state are designed, which promises asymptotic stability of the system. Besides, Zeno behavior is excluded in both mechanisms. An LVMG consisting of four DGs is constructed in MATLAB/Simulink to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, and the simulations correspond with our theoretical analysis.},

  abstract     = {This article proposes a hierarchical multiobjective heuristic (HMOH) to optimize printed-circuit board assembly (PCBA) in a single beam-head surface mounter. The beam-head surface mounter is the core facility in a high-mix and low-volume PCBA line. However, as a large-scale, complex, and multiobjective combinatorial optimization problem, the PCBA optimization of the beam-head surface mounter is still a challenge. This article provides a framework for optimizing all the interrelated objectives, which has not been achieved in the existing studies. A novel decomposition strategy is applied. This helps to closely model the real-world problem as the head task assignment problem (HTAP) and the pickup-and-place sequencing problem (PAPSP). These two models consider all the factors affecting the assembly time, including the number of pickup-and-place (PAP) cycles, nozzle changes, simultaneous pickups, and the PAP distances. Specifically, HTAP consists of the nozzle assignment and component allocation, while PAPSP comprises place allocation, feeder set assignment, and place sequencing problems. Adhering strictly to the lexicographic method, the HMOH solves these subproblems in a descending order of importance of their involved objectives. Exploiting the expert knowledge, each subproblem is solved by an elaborately designed heuristic. Finally, the proposed HMOH realizes the complete and optimal PCBA decision making in real time. Using industrial PCB datasets, the superiority of HMOH is elucidated through comparison with the built-in optimizer of the widely used Samsung SM482.},

In contrast to the previous studies where the agents have access to the measurements of their own states, an estimation algorithm is provided based on the measurements relative to the adjacent agents, and the considered DoS attacks jam each channel independently while the attack durations are constrained. To estimate the states and effectively schedule the information transmissions over the network possibly subject to malicious attacks, a prediction-based switching observer scheme with an event-triggered communication strategy is proposed, and the invalidation problem of the event-triggering mechanism caused by the DoS attacks is solved. Based on the decay rates of the Lyapunov function corresponding to different transmission modes, sufficient conditions for the stability of the estimation error dynamics are presented in the presence of DoS attacks. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed strategy is demonstrated by simulation results.},

  abstract     = {This study investigates a simple design method of the robust state/fault estimation and fault-tolerant control (FTC) of discrete-time Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) fuzzy systems. To avoid the corruption of the fault signal on state estimation, a novel smoothing signal model of fault signal is embedded in the T-S fuzzy model for the robust $H_{\infty }$ state/fault estimation of the discrete-time nonlinear system with external disturbance by the traditional fuzzy observer. When the component and sensor faults are generated from different fault sources, two smoothing signal models for component and sensor faults are both embedded in the T-S fuzzy system for robust state/fault estimation. Since the nonsingular smoothing signal model and T-S fuzzy model are augmented together for signal reconstruction, the traditional fuzzy Luenberger-type observer can be employed to robustly estimate state/fault signal simultaneously from the $H_{\infty }$ estimation perspective. By utilizing the estimated state and fault signal, a traditional $H_{\infty }$ observer-based controller is also introduced for the FTC with powerful disturbance attenuation capability of the effect caused by the smoothing model error and external disturbance. Moreover, the robust $H_{\infty }$ observer-based FTC design is transformed into a linear matrix inequality (LMI) -constrained optimization problem by the proposed two-step design procedure. With the help of LMI TOOLBOX in MATLAB, we can easily design the fuzzy Luenberger-type observer for efficient robust $H_{\infty }$ state/fault estimation and solve the $H_{\infty }$ observer-based FTC design problem of discrete nonlinear systems. Two simulation examples are given to validate the performance of state/fault estimation and FTC of the proposed methods.},

The agents have individual nominal dynamics with unknown parameters, and the unmodeled dynamics are in the form of multiplicative perturbations. A novel design framework is developed based on an event-triggered internal reference model and a distributed model reference adaptive controller. To deal with the heterogeneity of the multiagent system, the event-triggered internal reference model is designed to generate a virtual reference signal for each agent with a dynamic event-triggering mechanism being adopted to reduce the communication burden between neighboring agents. To handle the unknown parameters and unmodeled dynamics, the robust model reference adaptive controller is then designed to follow the generated virtual reference signal. It is shown that if the unmodeled dynamics satisfy certain conditions, then the boundedness of all the signals and variables in the closed-loop system and convergence of consensus errors to a residual set are guaranteed. Moreover, the consensus errors will converge to zero asymptotically in the absence of unmodeled dynamics. Compared with existing related works, the proposed framework is able to deal with the agents with individual unknown nominal dynamics and unmodeled dynamics. Moreover, the proposed framework is fully distributed in the sense that no knowledge of any global information is needed. Finally, the performance of the proposed method is validated by examples.},

  abstract     = {While input or output-perturbation-based adversarial training techniques have been exploited to enhance the generalization capability of a variety of nonfuzzy and fuzzy classifiers by means of dynamic regularization, their performance may perhaps be very sensitive to some inappropriate adversarial samples. In order to avoid this weakness and simultaneously ensure enhanced generalization capability, this work attempts to explore a novel knowledge adversarial attack model for the zero-order Tagaki–Sugeno–Kang (TSK) fuzzy classifiers. The proposed model is motivated by exploiting the existence of special knowledge adversarial attacks from the perspective of the human-like thinking process when training an interpretable zero-order TSK fuzzy classifier. Without any direct use of adversarial samples, which is different from input or output perturbation-based adversarial attacks, the proposed model considers adversarial perturbations of interpretable zero-order fuzzy rules in a knowledge-oblivion and/or knowledge-bias or their ensemble to mimic the robust use of knowledge in the human thinking process. Through dynamic regularization, the proposed model is theoretically justified for its strong generalization capability. Accordingly, a novel knowledge adversarial training method called KAT is devised to achieve promising generalization performance, interpretability, and fast training for zero-order TSK fuzzy classifiers. The effectiveness of KAT is manifested by the experimental results on 15 benchmarking UCI and KEEL datasets.},

As a major challenge of our work, the quasiperiodic disturbance to be treated is always submerged by untargeted waves, leading to complicated coupling between disturbance separation and frequency identification. Existing approaches on quasiperiodic disturbance rejection have circumvented, rather than overcome, this challenge by assuming either a known frequency or a measurable disturbance signal. In this work, an expectation–maximization (EM) framework is proposed where disturbance signal separation and frequency identification are carried out in an iterative manner. In the E-step, the expected log-likelihood function is evaluated via reconstruction of the quasiperiodic signal based on the latest frequency estimate; and in the M-step, the frequency estimate is updated by maximizing the log-likelihood function obtained in the E-step. To facilitate recursive frequency estimation, an online EM algorithm is also developed based on the forward-only smoothing techniques. Furthermore, we show that the proposed method can be easily extended to deal with nonlinear system models and time-varying frequencies.},

  abstract     = {Functional connectivity (FC) networks built from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) has shown promising results for the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease and its prodromal stage, that is, mild cognitive impairment (MCI). FC is usually estimated as a temporal correlation of regional mean rs-fMRI signals between any pair of brain regions, and these regions are traditionally parcellated with a particular brain atlas. Most existing studies have adopted a predefined brain atlas for all subjects. However, the constructed FC networks inevitably ignore the potentially important subject-specific information, particularly, the subject-specific brain parcellation. Similar to the drawback of the “single view” (versus the “multiview” learning) in medical image-based classification, FC networks constructed based on a single atlas may not be sufficient to reveal the underlying complicated differences between normal controls and disease-affected patients due to the potential bias from that particular atlas. In this study, we propose a multiview feature learning method with multiatlas-based FC networks to improve MCI diagnosis. Specifically, a three-step transformation is implemented to generate multiple individually specified atlases from the standard automated anatomical labeling template, from which a set of atlas exemplars is selected. Multiple FC networks are constructed based on these preselected atlas exemplars, providing multiple views of the FC network-based feature representations for each subject. We then devise a multitask learning algorithm for joint feature selection from the constructed multiple FC networks. The selected features are jointly fed into a support vector machine classifier for multiatlas-based MCI diagnosis. Extensive experimental comparisons are carried out between the proposed method and other competing approaches, including the traditional single-atlas-based method. The results indicate that our method significantly improves the MCI classification, demonstrating its promise in the brain connectome-based individualized diagnosis of brain diseases.},

First, radial basis function neural networks (NNs) are utilized to approximate the unknown functions of the considered uncertain nonlinear system. By constructing the prediction errors from the serial–parallel nonsmooth estimation models, the prediction errors and the tracking errors are fused to update the weights of the NNs. Afterward, the composite adaptive neural backstepping control scheme is proposed via nonsmooth command filter and adaptive disturbance estimation techniques. The proposed control scheme ensures that high-precision tracking performances and NN approximation performances can be achieved simultaneously. Meanwhile, it can avoid the singularity problem in the finite-time backstepping framework. Moreover, it is proved that all signals in the closed-loop control system can be convergent in finite time.

To address the curse of dimensionality, this article proposes an evolutionary algorithm for solving large-scale SMOPs, which aims to mine the sparse distribution of the Pareto-optimal solutions and, thus, considerably reduces the search space. More specifically, the proposed algorithm suggests an evolutionary pattern mining approach to detect the maximum and minimum candidate sets of the nonzero variables in the Pareto-optimal solutions, and uses them to limit the dimensions in generating offspring solutions. For further performance enhancement, a binary crossover operator and a binary mutation operator are designed to ensure the sparsity of solutions.

First, we establish a dynamic model of the system by using the assumed mode method (AMM) and the Lagrangian modeling method. Then, we obtain the dynamic coupling relationship of the two links based on the dynamic model. According to this dynamic coupling relationship, we find that the passive rigid link can be controlled indirectly by controlling the active flexible link. Thus, we calculate the target angles of the two links by using the inverse kinematic method and design a controller for the active flexible link to stabilize it at its target angle and to suppress its vibration. Next, we optimize the parameters of this controller by using the genetic algorithm (GA). GA helps us simultaneously stabilize the passive rigid link at its target angle while realizing the control objective of the active flexible link.

  abstract     = {This article studies the lag-bipartite formation tracking (LBFT) problem of the networked robotic systems (NRSs) with directed matrix-weighted signed graphs. Unlike the traditional formation tracking problems with only cooperative interactions, solving the LBFT problem implies that: 1) the robots of the NRS are divided into two complementary subgroups according to the signed graph, describing the coexistence of cooperative and antagonistic interactions; 2) the states of each subgroup form a desired geometric pattern asymptotically in the local coordinate; and 3) the geometric center of each subgroup is forced to track the same leader trajectory with different plus–minus signs and a time lag.

  abstract     = {The searching ability of the population-based search algorithms strongly relies on the coordinate system on which they are implemented. However, the widely used coordinate systems in the existing multifactorial optimization (MFO) algorithms are still fixed and might not be suitable for various function landscapes with differential modalities, rotations, and dimensions; thus, the intertask knowledge transfer might not be efficient. Therefore, this article proposes a novel intertask knowledge transfer strategy for MFOs implemented upon an active coordinate system that is established on a common subspace of two search spaces. The proper coordinate system might identify some common modality in a proper subspace to some extent. In this article, to seek the intermediate subspace, we innovatively introduce the geodesic flow that starts from a subspace, reaching another subspace in unit time. A low-dimension intermediate subspace is drawn from a uniform distribution defined on the geodesic flow, and the corresponding coordinate system is given. The intertask trial generation method is applied to the individuals by first projecting them on the low-dimension subspace, which reveals the important invariant features of the multiple function landscapes. Since intermediate subspace is generated from the major eigenvectors of tasks’ spaces, this model turns out to be intrinsically regularized by neglecting the minor and small eigenvalues. Therefore, the transfer strategy can alleviate the influence of noise led by redundant dimensions. The proposed method exhibits promising performance in the experiments.},

To ensure reliability and validity of the decision solution, a certain modification of entries of the matrix is usually needed to improve the consistency of the reciprocal matrix. This study aims to present a consistency improvement method by admitting some level of information granularity in the evaluation process. This gives rise to a granular rather than numeric matrix of pairwise comparisons. First, with a given average level of information granularity, we present an optimal granularity model that is characterized by maximal consistency. One can maximize the consistency degree by invoking a process of allocation of information granularity across the corresponding modifications of the reciprocal matrix. Based on the optimal granularity model, an interactive consistency improvement process is presented with the involvement of the decision maker. Then, an adaptive differential evolution algorithm is applied to optimize entries of the modified reciprocal matrix.

The signal transmission among agents is implemented through a digital communication network subject to both uniform quantization and round-robin protocol as a reflection of network constraints. The consensus strategy is designed by adopting the estimates of the relative states of the agent to its neighbors, which renders the distributed nature of the controller. A new consensus concept, namely, quasiconsensus in probability, is employed to evaluate the state response of the agents to the stochastic noises, the exogenous disturbances, and the quantization error. An augmented system is first formed that relies on the deviations of the individual state from the average state, the observer error of the relative state, as well as the relative measurement output. Based on the augmented model, an analysis approach on dynamical behaviors is developed to facilitate the consensus analysis of MASs by means of the switching Lyapunov function technique and the stochastic analysis methods. Then, the existence condition and the explicit expression of the time-varying gain matrices are proposed for the expected controller by resorting to the feasibility of several matrix inequalities. Numerical simulation results are presented to demonstrate the applicability of the theoretical results.},

Taking into account this fact, this article aims to extend the dynamics of tracking consensus to signed networks containing both cooperative and competitive relationships among agents. A group of agents with general linear dynamics is considered. The cases of the fixed network as well as switching networks are analyzed, respectively. In the end, some algebraic conditions related to the network structure and the positive/negative edge weight are established to ensure the implementation of tracking consensus. Moreover, the single decoupling system is allowed to be strictly unstable in theory, and the upper bound of the eigenvalue modulus of the system matrix related to the system instability is given.},

Especially, in the control variable analysis, for each search direction, the convergence relevance degree of each decision variable is measured by a projection-based detection method. In the decision variable optimization, the grouped decision variables are optimized with an adaptive scalarization strategy, which is able to adaptively balance the convergence and diversity of the solutions in the objective space. The proposed algorithm is evaluated with a suite of test problems with 2–10 objectives and 200–1000 variables.

Traditional video temporal consistency methods reconstruct an original frame containing flickers from corresponding nonflickering frames, but the inaccurate correspondence realized by optical flow restricts their practical use. In this article, we propose a temporally broad learning system (TBLS), an approach that enforces temporal consistency between frames. We establish the TBLS as a flat network comprising the input data, consisting of an original frame in an original video, a corresponding frame in the temporally inconsistent video on which the image-based technique was applied, and an output frame of the last original frame, as mapped features in feature nodes. Then, we refine extracted features by enhancing the mapped features as enhancement nodes with randomly generated weights. We then connect all extracted features to the output layer with a target weight vector. With the target weight vector, we can minimize the temporal information loss between consecutive frames and the video fidelity loss in the output videos. Finally, we remove the temporal inconsistency in the processed video and output a temporally consistent video. Besides, we propose an alternative incremental learning algorithm based on the increment of the mapped feature nodes, enhancement nodes, or input data to improve learning accuracy by a broad expansion. We demonstrate the superiority of our proposed TBLS by conducting extensive experiments.},

The low-level scheme is developed to guarantee system performances in the fault-free scenario. With the low-level scheme, the high-level topology reconfiguration protocols, each of which corresponds to one partial LoCE fault scenario, are then proposed to mitigate the fault impact by adjusting the underlying topology. Accordingly, without modifying the structure or the design parameter of the low-level control scheme, the proposed framework can guarantee the synchronization and tracking errors of the MVS asymptotically convergent to zero in both fault-free and fault scenarios.

  abstract     = {A numerical solution of the problem of the general synthesis of a stabilization system by a symbolic regression method is considered. The goal is to automatically find a feedback control function using a computer so that the control object can reach a given terminal position from anywhere in a given region of the initial conditions with an optimal value of the quality criterion. Usually, the control synthesis problem is solved analytically or technically taking into account the specific properties of the mathematical model. We suppose that modern numerical approaches of symbolic regression can be applied to find a solution without reference to specific model equations. It is proposed to use the numerical method of Cartesian genetic programming (CGP). It was developed for automatic writing of programs but has never been used to solve the synthesis problem. In the present work, the method was modified with the principle of small variations in order to reduce the search area and increase the rate of convergence. To apply the general principle of small variations to CGP, we developed special types of variations and coding. The modified CGP searches for the mathematical expression of the feedback control function in the form of a code and, at the same time, the optimal value of the parametric vector which is also a new feature—simultaneous tuning of the parameters inside the search process. This approach enables working with objects and functions of any type, which is not always possible with analytical methods. The need to use the received solution on the onboard processor of the control object imposes certain restrictions on the used basic set of elementary functions. This article proposes the theoretical foundations of the study of these functions, and the concept of the space of machine-made functions is introduced. The capabilities of the approach are demonstrated on the numerical solution of the control system synthesis problems for a mobile robot and a Duffing model.},

Some event-based consensus protocols are formulated so as to reduce the redundant execution of control. By using an extended differential inequality with a time-dependent coefficient, criteria for tracking consensus under time- and state-dependent triggering conditions are constructed, respectively. It is proved that the time average of the control gain, together with the agent dynamics, network topology, and triggering conditions, governs the consensus despite the fluctuation of control gain. The derived theorem can be utilized to ensure consensus with intermittent strategies aiming to lessen the burden in communications, including aperiodic on–off control with periodic perturbation and pulse-modulated on–off control. Unlike existing works, the requirement of a positive lower bound of control ratios is removed and, thus, a wide range of control gain patterns is possible, signifying higher flexibility in intermittent policy design. Finally, numerical examples are provided to further illustrate the theoretical results.},

Through the use of the switched system theory related to the PDT, the convex optimization technique together with some straightforward decoupling methods, an appropriate mode-dependent controller with nonfragility is developed to acclimatize itself to some practical circumstances. Simultaneously, sufficient conditions of ensuring the $\mathcal {H}_{\infty }$ performance and exponential stability for the resulting switched synchronization error system are derived. Finally, a numerical example is utilized to show the validity of the model constructed and the influence of the PDT on the $\mathcal {H}_{\infty }$ performance. In addition, an image encryption example is employed to show the potential application prospect of the investigated system.},

The nonaffine terms are indifferentiable and the controllability condition is not required for each subsystem, which allows the considered tracking problem to not be efficiently solved by the traditional adaptive control algorithms. To solve the problem, NNs are utilized to separate and approximate the nonaffine functions, and then the dynamic surface control and convex combination method are utilized to construct a controller and a switching strategy. In addition, an adaptive law is considered for each subsystem to reduce the conservativeness. Under the designed controller and switching strategy, all the signals of the resulting closed-loop system are bounded, and the tracking performance is achieved with a prescribed level.},

  abstract     = {The principal component analysis network (PCANet) is an unsupervised deep network, utilizing principal components as convolution filters in its layers. Albeit powerful, the PCANet suffers from two fundamental problems responsible for its performance degradation. First, the principal components transform the data as column vectors (which we call the amalgamated view) and incur a loss of spatial information present in the data. Second, the generalized pooling in the PCANet is unable to incorporate spatial statistics of the natural images, and it also induces redundancy among the features. In this research, we first propose a tensor-factorization-based deep network called the tensor factorization network (TFNet). The TFNet extracts features by preserving the spatial view of the data (which we call the minutiae view). We then proposed HybridNet , which simultaneously extracts information with the two views of the data since their integration can improve the performance of classification systems. Finally, to alleviate the feature redundancy among hybrid features, we propose Attn-HybridNet to perform attention-based feature selection and fusion to improve their discriminability. Classification results on multiple real-world datasets using features extracted by our proposed Attn-HybridNet achieves significantly better performance over other popular baseline methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.},

Recently, the transfer learning paradigm that can transfer sentiment knowledge from resource-rich languages, for example, English, to resource-poor languages, for example, Chinese, has gained particular interest. Along this line, in this article, we propose semisupervised learning with SCL and space transfer (ssSCL-ST), a semisupervised transfer learning approach that makes use of structural correspondence learning as well as space transfer for cross-lingual sentiment analysis. The key idea behind ssSCL-ST, at a high level, is to explore the intrinsic sentiment knowledge in the target-lingual domain and to reduce the loss of valuable knowledge due to the knowledge transfer via semisupervised learning. ssSCL-ST also features in pivot set extension and space transfer, which helps to enhance the efficiency of knowledge transfer and improve the classification accuracy in the target language domain. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of ssSCL-ST to the state-of-the-art approaches without using any parallel corpora.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we focus on the task of zero-shot image classification (ZSIC) that equips a learning system with the ability to recognize visual images from unseen classes. In contrast to the traditional image classification, ZSIC more easily suffers from the class-imbalance issue since it is more concerned with the class-level knowledge transferring capability. In the real world, the sample numbers of different categories generally follow a long-tailed distribution, and the discriminative information in the sample-scarce seen classes is hard to transfer to the related unseen classes in the traditional batch-based training manner, which degrades the overall generalization ability a lot. To alleviate the class-imbalance issue in ZSIC, we propose a sample-balanced training process to encourage all training classes to contribute equally to the learned model. Specifically, we randomly select the same number of images from each class across all training classes to form a training batch to ensure that the sample-scarce classes contribute equally as those classes with sufficient samples during each iteration. Considering that the instances from the same class differ in class representativeness, we further develop an efficient semantic-guided feature fusion model to obtain the discriminative class visual prototype for the following visual–semantic interaction process via distributing different weights to the selected samples based on their class representativeness. Extensive experiments on three imbalanced ZSIC benchmark datasets for both traditional ZSIC and generalized ZSIC tasks demonstrate that our approach achieves promising results, especially for the unseen categories that are closely related to the sample-scarce seen categories. Besides, the experimental results on two class-balanced datasets show that the proposed approach also improves the classification performance against the baseline model.},

To address these problems, we propose a clustering ensemble framework that consists of three parts. First, three view transformation methods, including random principal component analysis, random nearest neighbor, and modified fuzzy extension model, are used as base learners to learn different clustering views. A random transformation and hybrid multiview learning-based clustering ensemble method (RTHMC) is then designed to synthesize the multiview clustering results. Second, a new random subspace transformation is integrated into RTHMC to enhance its performance. Finally, a view-based self-evolutionary strategy is developed to further improve the proposed method by optimizing random subspace sets.

The experimental results show its competitive performance on the MPIIGaze dataset and the improvement of 14.7\% for static head pose and 46.7\% for moving head pose on the EYEDIAP dataset compared with the state-of-the-art gaze estimation algorithms. After projecting the obtained gaze vector onto the screen coordinate, we apply accumulated histogram to taking into account both spatial and temporal information of estimated gaze-point and head-pose sequences. Finally, classification is conducted on our self-collected autistic children video dataset (ACVD), which contains 405 videos from 135 different ASD children, 135 typically developing (TD) children in a primary school, and 135 TD children in a kindergarten. The classification results on ACVD shows the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method, with the accuracy 94.8\%, the sensitivity 91.1\% and the specificity 96.7\% for ASD.},

A linear dynamic self-synchronization protocol of the same structure is adopted as the one proposed in Zhang et al. 2016. That is, the Lur’e-type nonlinearity is not involved in our self-synchronization protocol. It is in fact unknown and only assumed to be incrementally sector bounded within a given sector. In the absence of a leader Lur’e system defining the synchronization trajectory, we construct a novel self-synchronization manifold in order to derive the self-synchronization error dynamics. Meanwhile, the connectivity of the general directed graph having a directed spanning tree is quantified by the global connectivity, instead of the so-called general algebraic connectivity used in the directed graph case under static relative state feedback. The global connectivity plays a crucial role in handling self-synchronization problems of directed nonlinear networks via dynamic relative output feedback, including directed networks with the Lipschitz nonlinear node dynamics, which is also discussed in this article. The protocol parameter matrix design is performed by solving the obtained LMI conditions in sequence. In addition, some discussions are complemented on the important technical details in our self-synchronization protocol design along with extensions. Finally, our theoretical results are illustrated through numerical simulations over a directed nonlinear dynamical network.},

  abstract     = {Multipopulation methods are highly effective in solving dynamic optimization problems. Three factors affect this significantly: 1) the exclusion mechanisms to avoid the convergence to the same peak by multiple subpopulations; 2) the resource allocation mechanism that assigns the computational resources to the subpopulations; and 3) the control mechanisms to adaptively adjust the number of subpopulations by considering the number of optima and available computational resources. In the existing exclusion mechanisms, when the distance (i.e., the distance between their best found positions) between two subpopulations becomes less than a predefined threshold, the inferior one will be removed/reinitialized. However, this leads to incapability of algorithms in covering peaks/optima that are closer than the threshold. Moreover, despite the importance of resource allocation due to the limited available computational resources between environmental changes, it has not been well studied in the literature. Finally, the number of subpopulations should be adapted to the number of optima. However, in most existing adaptive multipopulation methods, there is no predefined upper bound for generating subpopulations. Consequently, in problems with large numbers of peaks, they can generate too many subpopulations sharing limited computational resources. In this article, a multipopulation framework is proposed to address the aforementioned issues by using three adaptive approaches: 1) subpopulation generation; 2) double-layer exclusion; and 3) computational resource allocation. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework over several peer approaches in solving various benchmark problems.},

The subjects are divided into four groups. All groups interact with the same dynamic system, but each group performs a different sequence of command-following tasks. All reference commands have frequency content between 0 and 0.5 Hz. We use a subsystem identification algorithm to estimate the control strategy (feedback and feedforward) that each subject uses on each trial. The experimental and identification results are used to examine the impact of the command-following tasks on the subjects’ performance and the control strategies that the subjects learn. Results demonstrate that certain reference commands (e.g., a sum of sinusoids) are more difficult for subjects to learn to follow than others (e.g., a chirp), and the difference in difficulty is related to the subjects’ ability to match the phase of the reference command. In addition, the identification results show that differences in command-following performance for different tasks can be attributed to three aspects of the subjects’ identified controllers: 1) compensating for time delay in feedforward; 2) using a comparatively accurate approximation of the inverse dynamics in feedforward; and 3) using a feedback controller with comparatively high gain. Results also demonstrate that subjects generalize their control strategy when the command changes. Specifically, when the command changes, subjects maintain relatively high gain in feedback and retain their feedforward internal model of the inverse dynamics. Finally, we provide evidence that subjects use prediction of the command (if possible) to improve performance but that subjects can learn to improve performance without prediction. Specifically, subjects learn to use feedback controllers with comparatively high gain to improve performance even though the command is unpredictable.},

  abstract     = {From the perspective of philosophy, ontology relations denote ultimate semantic relations of related knowledge concepts. Beyond doubt, it is still a very difficult problem on how to automatically depict and construct ontology relations because of its high abstractness. Some latest research attempted to realize ontology relation learning by learning abstract hierarchies or similarities among knowledge concepts. Inspired by the requirements of associative semantic cognition like in the human brain, a constructivist ontology relation learning (CORL) method is put forward in this study by borrowing the idea of the constructivist learning theory. Wherein, two following points are supposed: 1) each symbol knowledge is looked as a token of representing certain abstract pattern and 2) each pattern denotes a type of relation structures on other patterns, or a directly observed event data, such as physical sensing data, natural image, sound data, text word etc. So, ontology relation could be considered as the associative support degrees from other knowledge concepts to the target concept, which reflects how one knowledge ontology can be demarcated by other knowledge concepts. Then, the knowledge network can be employed to represent an entire domain knowledge system. Meanwhile, an associative random walk mechanism (ARWM) on knowledge network can be considered to explain the semantic generative process of every document. Thus, CORL can be realized by integrating ARWM into an extended latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model. Some theoretical and experimental analysis are done. The corresponding results demonstrate that CORL can obtain effective associative semantic relations among concept words, and gain some novel characteristics in better representing knowledge ontology than existing methods.},

The concepts of granular computing (GrC) help deliver a higher level of abstraction to address this problem. Most of the existing data imputation and related modeling methods are of numeric nature and require prior numeric models to be provided. The underlying objective of this study is to introduce a novel and straightforward approach that uses information granules as a vehicle to effectively represent missing data and build granular fuzzy models directly from resulting hybrid granular and numeric data. The evaluation and optimization of this method are guided by the principle of justifiable granularity engaging the coverage and specificity criteria and carried out with the help of particle swarm optimization. We provide a collection of experimental studies using a synthetic dataset and several publicly available real-world datasets to demonstrate the feasibility and analyze the main features of this method.},

  abstract     = {Fuzzy rule-based models (FRBMs) are sound constructs to describe complex systems. However, in reality, we may encounter situations, where the user or owner of a system only owns either the input or output data of that system (the other part could be owned by another user); and due to the consideration of data privacy, he/she could not obtain all the needed data to build the FRBMs. Since this type of situation has not been fully realized (noticed) and studied before, our objective is to come up with some strategy to address this challenge to meet the specific privacy consideration during the modeling process. In this study, the concept and algorithm of the collaborative fuzzy clustering (CFC) are applied to the identification of FRBMs, describing either multiple-input–single-output (MISO) or multiple-input–multiple-output (MIMO) systems. The collaboration between input and output spaces based on their structural information (conveyed in terms of the corresponding partition matrices) makes it possible to build FRBMs when input and output data could not be collected and used in unison. Surprisingly, on top of this primary pursuit, with the collaboration mechanism the input and output spaces of a system are endowed with an innovative way to comprehensively share, exchange, and utilize the structural information between each other, which results in their more relevant structures that guarantee better model performance compared with performance produced by some state-of-the-art modeling strategies. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by experiments on a series of synthetic and publicly available datasets.},

This article formulates and solves the asynchronous tracking control problem of multiagent systems with input uncertainties on switching signed digraphs. In the interaction setting, we assume that the leader moves at a time-varying acceleration that cannot be measured by the followers accurately, and further suppose that each agent receives its neighbors’ states information at certain instants determined by its own clock, which is not necessary to be synchronized with those of other agents. Using dynamically changing spanning subdigraphs of signed digraphs to describe graphically asynchronous interactions, the asynchronous tracking problem is equivalently transformed into a convergence problem of products of general substochastic matrices (PGSSM), in which the matrix elements are not necessarily non-negative and the row sums are less than or equal to 1. With the help of the matrix analysis technique and the composition of binary relations, we propose a new and original method to deal with the convergence problem of PGSSM, and further establish a spanning tree condition for asynchronous tracking control. Finally, the validity of the theoretical findings is verified through several numerical examples.},

The key feature of PD is an unbounded time-varying delay. By considering the comparison principle and combining the extended formula for the variation of parameters, we conquer the difficulty in consideration of PD effects for such networks for the first time, where the subsystems addressed may be stable or unstable. New delay-dependent conditions with respect to the mean-square ES of systems are established by employing the average dwell-time (ADT) technique, stochastic analysis theory, and Lyapunov approach. It is shown that the acquired minimum average dwell time (MADT) is not only relevant to the stable subsystems (SSs) and unstable subsystems (USs) but also dependent on the decay ratio (DR), increasing ratio (IR), as well as PD. Finally, the availability of the derived results under an average dwell-time-switched regulation (ADTSR) is illustrated through two numerical simulation examples.},

Although the ICM has been widely used, few studies concern the internal activities and firing conditions of the neuron, which may lead to an invalid model in the application. Furthermore, the lack of theoretical analysis has led to inappropriate parameter settings and consequent limitations on ICM applications. To address this deficiency, we first study the continuous firing condition of ICM neurons to determine the restrictions that exist between network parameters and the input signal. Second, we investigate the neuron pulse period to understand the neural firing mechanism. Third, we derive the relationship between the continuous firing condition and the neural pulse period, and the relationship can prove the validity of the continuous firing condition and the neural pulse period as well. A solid understanding of the neural firing mechanism is helpful in setting appropriate parameters and in providing a theoretical basis for widespread applications to use the ICM model effectively. Extensive experiments of numerical tests with a common image reveal the rationality of our theoretical results.},

Given the FC shapes, an algorithm is first proposed to obtain the stress matrix while satisfying certain conditions, based on which a novel adaptive distributed observer to the convex hull is proposed for every follower. An adaptive updating gain is applied to make the observer fully distributed without using the global information of the graph, and a continuous function is designed to restrain the influence of the inputs of the leaders. Then, a local control law using the adaptive distributed observer is presented to accomplish the FC control of EL systems. Based on the Lyapunov stability theory, it is proved that the FC error can be designed as small as possible by adjusting some parameters in the observer.},

The main objective of this article is to simplify the distributed reduced-order observer design for the LTI system on the basis of the consensus communication pattern. For observers interacting on a directed graph, we first address the problem of the distributed reduced-order observer design for the detectable target system and provide sufficient conditions involving the topology information to guarantee the existence of the distributed reduced-order observer. Then, the dependence on the topology information in the sufficient conditions will be eliminated by using the adaptive strategy and so that a completely distributed reduced-order observer can be designed for the target system.

The geometric feature of trajectories is parameterized by a set of trajectory states defined as required lengths along the trajectory to reduce the distance to its ending point to specific values. To solve this special consensus problem involving coupled state variables, the conventional consensus model is extended by attaching it to a mapping from the state variables to the trajectory’s geometry. This mapping is established using a homotopic structure that creates a compact and efficient form for the mapping. The geometry of the homotopic structure is based on the shapes of its envelopes, and the elements in the structure are derived from their deformation. Through a homotopic search in the structure, an asymptotic consensus of trajectory states is achieved. Simulation results show the proposed coupled state consensus method can achieve better performance on the consensus of multiple vehicles than the conventional isolated state consensus method.},

The previous works related to its stability and robustness mainly concentrated on how the output values were changed with perturbation parameters of input values. However, the works on estimating oscillation bounds of output values with regard to varying limits of input, are lacking. In this study, we investigate the oscillation-bound estimation of perturbations for BKS. First, the BKS output variation scopes are acquired for interval perturbation, where the $R$ -implication, ( $S, N$ )-implication, QL-implication, and $t$ -norm implication are adopted. Second, in allusion to the more sophisticated problem of the fuzzy reasoning chain with BKS, the oscillation bounds of BKS output resulting from input interval perturbation are offered. Third, we construct the upper and lower bounds of BKS output deviation originated in the simple perturbation of the input fuzzy set, in which the situations of one rule and multiple rules are both dissected. Finally, the stable properties of all these BKS strategies are confirmed. It is emphasized that interval perturbation and simple perturbation are more general ways to give expression describing the robustness issue, and the obtained oscillation bounds also deliver more detailed characterization of the output deviation along with the input perturbation. This study further validates the sound properties of the BKS method.},

  abstract     = {Topology identification of complex networks is an important and meaningful research direction. In recent years, the topology identification method based on adaptive synchronization has been developed rapidly. However, a critical shortcoming of this method is that inner synchronization of a network breaks the precondition of linear independence and leads to the failure of topology identification. Hence, how to identify the network topology when possible inner synchronization occurs within the network has been a challenging research issue. To solve this problem, this article proposes improved topology identification methods by regulating the original network to synchronize with an auxiliary network composed of isolated chaotic exosystems. The proposed methods do not require the sophisticated assumption of linear independence. The topology identification observers incorporating a series of isolated chaotic exosignals can accurately identify the network structure. Finally, numerical simulations show that the proposed methods are effective to identify the structure of a network even with large weights of edges and abundant connections between nodes.},

To guarantee that the time-varying state constraints are not violated, the corresponding Barrier Lyapunov functions are constructed. At the same time, a continuous differentiable asymmetric saturation model is developed to improve the stability of the system. Then, the Lyapunov stability theory is used to verify that all signals of the resulting system are semi globally uniformly ultimately bounded, time-varying state constraints are not violated, and error variables can converge to the small neighborhood of 0.

  abstract     = {Sentiment analysis uses a series of automated cognitive methods to determine the author’s or speaker’s attitudes toward an expressed object or text’s overall emotional tendencies. In recent years, the growing scale of opinionated text from social networks has brought significant challenges to humans’ sentimental tendency mining. The pretrained language model designed to learn contextual representation achieves better performance than traditional learning word vectors. However, the existing two basic approaches for applying pretrained language models to downstream tasks, feature-based and fine-tuning methods, are usually considered separately. What is more, different sentiment analysis tasks cannot be handled by the single task-specific contextual representation. In light of these pros and cons, we strive to propose a broad multitask transformer network (BMT-Net) to address these problems. BMT-Net takes advantage of both feature-based and fine-tuning methods. It was designed to explore the high-level information of robust and contextual representation. Primarily, our proposed structure can make the learned representations universal across tasks via multitask transformers. In addition, BMT-Net can roundly learn the robust contextual representation utilized by the broad learning system due to its powerful capacity to search for suitable features in deep and broad ways. The experiments were conducted on two popular datasets of binary Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST-2) and SemEval Sentiment Analysis in Twitter (Twitter). Compared with other state-of-the-art methods, the improved representation with both deep and broad ways is shown to achieve a better $F1$ -score of 0.778 in Twitter and accuracy of 94.0\% in the SST-2 dataset, respectively. These experimental results demonstrate the abilities of recognition in sentiment analysis and highlight the significance of previously overlooked design decisions about searching contextual features in deep and broad spaces.},

  abstract     = {Evolutionary multitasking (EMT) is a newly emerging research topic in the community of evolutionary computation, which aims to improve the convergence characteristic across multiple distinct optimization tasks simultaneously by triggering knowledge transfer among them. Unfortunately, most of the existing EMT algorithms are only capable of boosting the optimization performance for homogeneous problems which explicitly share the same (or similar) fitness landscapes. Seldom efforts have been devoted to generalize the EMT for solving heterogeneous problems. A few preliminary studies employ domain adaptation techniques to enhance the transferability between two distinct tasks. However, almost all of these methods encounter a severe issue which is the so-called degradation of intertask mapping. Keeping this in mind, a novel rank loss function for acquiring a superior intertask mapping is proposed in this article. In particular, with an evolutionary-path-based representation model for optimization instance, an analytical solution of affine transformation for bridging the gap between two distinct problems is mathematically derived from the proposed rank loss function. It is worth mentioning that the proposed mapping-based transferability enhancement technique can be seamlessly embedded into an EMT paradigm. Finally, the efficacy of our proposed method against several state-of-the-art EMTs is verified experimentally on a number of synthetic multitasking and many-tasking benchmark problems, as well as a practical case study.},

This article investigates the reliable coprognosability issue for decentralized stochastic DESs (SDESs) facing the possible unavailability of some local agents. The main contributions are as follows. First, we formalize the notion of $r$ -reliable coprognosability for SDESs. In general, an $r$ -reliably coprognosable SDES with $n$ local sites $(1 \leq r \leq n)$ can predict the occurrences of faults even though $n-r$ local agents are invalid. Second, we construct a reliable coprognoser from the given stochastic system and present a necessary and sufficient condition for testing $r$ -reliable coprognosability by the reliable coprognoser. Third, due to the exponential complexity of testing $r$ -reliable coprognosability by reliable coprognoser, a reliable coverifier is constructed and an alternate necessary and sufficient condition for verifying $r$ -reliable coprognosability of SDESs by the reliable coverifier is proposed, which is polynomial time.},

Each player’s cost function and feasible action set in the noncooperative game are both determined by actions of others who may not be neighbors, as well as his/her own action. Particularly, feasible action sets are constrained by private convex inequalities and shared linear equations. Each player can only have access to his or her own cost function, private constraint, and a local block of shared constraints, and can only communicate with his or her neighbours via a digraph. To address this problem, a novel continuous-time distributed primal–dual algorithm involving Clarke’s generalized gradient is proposed based on consensus algorithms and the primal–dual algorithm. Under mild assumptions on cost functions and graph, we prove that players’ actions asymptotically converge to a GNE. Finally, a simulation is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results.},

Furthermore, to improve the search efficiency, an adaptive ${k}$ -means operation has been designed and employed at the niche level of population. The performance of the proposed algorithm has been evaluated on synthetic as well as real datasets and compared with related methods. The experimental results reveal that the proposed algorithm is able to reliably and efficiently deliver high quality clustering solutions and generally outperforms related methods implemented for comparisons.},

  abstract     = {Singular spectral analysis (SSA) has recently been successfully applied to feature extraction in hyperspectral image (HSI), including conventional (1-D) SSA in spectral domain and 2-D SSA in spatial domain. However, there are some drawbacks, such as sensitivity to the window size, high computational complexity under a large window, and failing to extract joint spectral–spatial features. To tackle these issues, in this article, we propose superpixelwise adaptive SSA (SpaSSA), that is superpixelwise adaptive SSA for exploiting local spatial information of HSI. The extraction of local (instead of global) features, particularly in HSI, can be more effective for characterizing the objects within an image. In SpaSSA, conventional SSA and 2-D SSA are combined and adaptively applied to each superpixel derived from an oversegmented HSI. According to the size of the derived superpixels, either SSA or 2-D singular spectrum analysis (2D-SSA) is adaptively applied for feature extraction, where the embedding window in 2D-SSA is also adaptive to the size of the superpixel. Experimental results on the three datasets have shown that the proposed SpaSSA outperforms both SSA and 2D-SSA in terms of classification accuracy and computational complexity. By combining SpaSSA with the principal component analysis (SpaSSA-PCA), the accuracy of land-cover analysis can be further improved, outperforming several state-of-the-art approaches.},

To solve this problem, we propose deeply supervised nonlinear aggregation (DNA) for better leveraging the complementary information of various side-outputs. Compared with existing methods, it: 1) aggregates side-output features rather than predictions and 2) adopts nonlinear instead of linear transformations. Experiments demonstrate that DNA can successfully break through the bottleneck of the current linear approaches.

Faced with these issues, this article proposes a knowledge learning strategy for change response in the dynamic multiobjective optimization. Unlike prediction approaches that estimate the future optima from previously obtained solutions, in the proposed strategy, we react to changes via learning from the historical search process. We introduce a method to extract the knowledge within the previous search experience. The extracted knowledge can accelerate convergence as well as introduce diversity for the optimization of the future environment. We conduct a comprehensive experiment on comparing the proposed strategy with the state-of-the-art algorithms.

  abstract     = {Following the principle of to set one’s own spear against one’s own shield, we study how to design adversarial completely automated public turing test to tell computers and humans apart (CAPTCHA) in this article. We first identify the similarity and difference between adversarial CAPTCHA generation and existing hot adversarial example (image) generation research. Then, we propose a framework for text-based and image-based adversarial CAPTCHA generation on top of state-of-the-art adversarial image generation techniques. Finally, we design and implement an adversarial CAPTCHA generation and evaluation system, called aCAPTCHA, which integrates 12 image preprocessing techniques, nine CAPTCHA attacks, four baseline adversarial CAPTCHA generation methods, and eight new adversarial CAPTCHA generation methods. To examine the performance of aCAPTCHA, extensive security and usability evaluations are conducted. The results demonstrate that the generated adversarial CAPTCHAs can significantly improve the security of normal CAPTCHAs while maintaining similar usability. To facilitate the CAPTCHA security research, we also open source the aCAPTCHA system, including the source code, trained models, datasets, and the usability evaluation interfaces.},

  abstract     = {As one of the most effective technologies for network reconstruction, compressive sensing can recover signals from a small amount of observed data through sparse search or greedy algorithms in the assumption that the unknown signal is sufficiently sparse on a specific basis. However, there often occurs loss of precision even failure in the process of reconstruction without enough prior information. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to solve the problem of low reconstruction accuracy by mining implicit structural information in the network. Specifically, we propose a novel and efficient algorithm (MCM_TRA) for reconstructing the structure of the $K$ -forked tree network. Based on evolutionary game dynamics, the modified clustering method (MCM) classifies all nodes into two sets, then a two-stage reconstruction algorithm (TRA) is illustrated to recover the node signals in different sets. The experimental results demonstrate that the MCM_TRA enhances the reconstruction accuracy prominently than previous algorithms. Moreover, extensive sensitivity analysis shows that the reconstruction effect can be promoted for a broad range of parameters, which further indicates the superiority of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {As an increasing number of asteroids are being discovered, detecting them using limited propulsion resources and time has become an urgent problem in the aerospace field. However, there is no universal fast asteroid sequence selection method that finds the trajectories for multiple low-thrust spacecraft for detecting a large number of asteroids. Furthermore, the calculation efficiency of the traditional trajectory optimization method is low, and it requires a large number of iterations. Therefore, this study combines Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) with spacecraft trajectory optimization. A fast MCTS pruning algorithm is proposed, which can quickly complete asteroid sequence selection and trajectory generation for multispacecraft exploration of multiple asteroids. By combining the Bezier shape-based (SB) method and MCTS, this study realizes the fast search of the exploration sequence and the efficient optimization of the continuous transfer trajectories. In the simulation example, compared with the traversal algorithm, the MCTS pruning algorithm obtained the global optimal detection sequence of the search tree in a very short time. Under the same conditions, the Bezier SB method obtained the transfer trajectory with a better performance index faster than the finite Fourier series SB method. Performances of the proposed method are illustrated through a complex asteroid multiflyby mission design.},

  abstract     = {Multimodal optimization problems (MMOPs) require algorithms to locate multiple optima simultaneously. When using evolutionary algorithms (EAs) to deal with MMOPs, an intuitive idea is to divide the population into several small “niches,” where different niches focus on locating different optima. These population partition strategies are called “niching” techniques, which have been frequently used for MMOPs. The algorithms for simultaneously locating multiple optima of MMOPs are called multimodal algorithms. However, many multimodal algorithms still face the difficulty of population partition since most of the niching techniques involve the sensitive niching parameters. Considering this issue, in this article, we propose a parameter-free niching method based on adaptive estimation distribution (AED) and develop a distributed differential evolution (DDE) algorithm, which is called AED-DDE, for solving MMOPs. In AED-DDE, each individual finds its own appropriate niche size to form a niche and acts as an independent unit to find a global optimum. Therefore, we can avoid the difficulty of population partition and the sensitivity of niching parameters. Different niches are co-evolved by using the master–slave multiniche distributed model. The multiniche co-evolution mechanism can improve the population diversity for fully exploring the search space and finding more global optima. Moreover, the AED-DDE algorithm is further enhanced by a probabilistic local search (PLS) to refine the solution accuracy. Compared with other multimodal algorithms, even the winner of CEC2015 multimodal competition, the comparison results fully demonstrate the superiority of AED-DDE.},

The computation complexity caused by the state-associated extra variable in $\lambda $ -return value computing of the traditional value-gradient learning method can be reduced. However, as the iteration number increases, calculation costs have grown dramatically that bring huge challenge for the optimal control process with limited bandwidth and computational units. In this article, we propose an event-triggered HDP (ETHDP) ( $\lambda $ ) optimal control strategy for nonlinear discrete-time (NDT) systems with unknown dynamics. The iterative relation for $\lambda $ -return of the final target value is derived first. The event-triggered condition ensuring system stability is designed to reduce the computation and communication requirements. Next, we build a model-actor–critic neural network (NN) structure, in which the model NN evaluates the system state for getting $\lambda $ -return of the current time target value, which is used to obtain the critic NN real-time update errors. The event-triggered optimal control signal and one-step-return value are approximated by actor and critic NN, respectively. Then, the event trigger-based uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) stability of the system state and NN weight errors are demonstrated by applying the Lyapunov technology. Finally, we illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed ETHDP ( $\lambda $ ) strategy by two cases.},

The sampling process is typically assessed by an informative, representative, or diverse evaluation policy. However, the policy, which needs an initial labeled set to start, may degenerate its performance in a cold-start hypothesis. In this article, we first show that typical AL sampling can be equivalently formulated as geometric sampling over minimum enclosing ballsMEB of this article denotes a conceptual geometry over the cluster in generalization analysis. In the SVM community, it is related to hard-margin support vector data description.(MEBs) of clusters. Following the $\gamma $ -tube structure in geometric clustering, we then divide one MEB covering a cluster into two parts: 1) a $\gamma $ -tube and 2) a $\gamma $ -ball. By estimating the error disagreement between sampling in MEB and $\gamma $ -ball, our theoretical insight reveals that $\gamma $ -tube can effectively measure the disagreement of hypotheses in original space over MEB and sampling space over $\gamma $ -ball. To tighten our insight, we present generalization analysis, and the results show that sampling in $\gamma $ -tube can derive higher probability bound to achieve a nearly zero generalization error. With these analyses, we finally apply the informative sampling policy of AL over $\gamma $ -tube to present a tube AL (TAL) algorithm against the cold-start sampling issue. As a result, the dependency between the querying process and the evaluation policy of active sampling can be alleviated. Experimental results show that by using the $\gamma $ -tube structure to deal with cold-start sampling, TAL achieves the superior performance than standard AL evaluation baselines by presenting substantial accuracy improvements. Image edge recognition extends our theoretical results.},

The effects of faults and malicious injections are modeled by unknown bounded signals. The signals are produced by any finite- $L_{2}$ -gain dynamical system and a Lipschitz and derivable function with respect to states, so that the considered fault model contains some reported ones as special cases. By employing the available state and input data, a function, which is equivalent to a fictitious dynamical system comprising the information about compensation errors for unknown actuator faults, is presented. Then, based on the virtual system, a novel actuator failure compensator (AFC) with the structure of dynamic feedbacks is proposed, so that the compensation capability is improved via cooperative interaction designs between the virtual dynamical systems and closed-loop systems. Furthermore, through the equivalence class and Lyapunov theories, it is proved that the presented robust dynamic AFC-based fuzzy controller ensures the asymptotic convergence of system states to zero. Different from the existing FTRCs, good transient performance is guaranteed, even in the presence of unforeseen actuator faults.

By a penalty-based method, the robots’ states asymptotically converge to the estimated optimal solution to an equivalent time-varying optimization problem, whose optimal solution can achieve simultaneous formation and optimization.

The constraint on system outputs, system uncertainty, and input saturation is addressed under the fixed-time convergence framework. A novel adaptive law for neural networks is integrated into the backstepping method, which enhances the learning rate of neural networks. The imposed constraint on the vibration amplitude is guaranteed by using the barrier Lyapunov function (BLF).

Inspired by this observation, in this article, we propose a relation regularized network (R2-Net), which can predict whether there is a relationship between two objects and encode this relation into object feature refinement and better SGG. Specifically, we first construct an affinity matrix among detected objects to represent the probability of a relationship between two objects. Graph convolution networks (GCNs) over this relation affinity matrix are then used as object encoders, producing relation-regularized representations of objects. With these relation-regularized features, our R2-Net can effectively refine object labels and generate scene graphs. Extensive experiments are conducted on the visual genome dataset for three SGG tasks (i.e., predicate classification, scene graph classification, and scene graph detection), demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed method. Ablation studies also verify the key roles of our proposed components in performance improvement.},

  abstract     = {Hashing methods have sparked great attention on multimedia tasks due to their effectiveness and efficiency. However, most existing methods generate binary codes by relaxing the binary constraints, which may cause large quantization error. In addition, most supervised cross-modal approaches preserve the similarity relationship by constructing an ${n}\times {n}$ large-size similarity matrix, which requires huge computation, making these methods unscalable. To address the above challenges, this article presents a novel algorithm, called scalable discrete matrix factorization and semantic autoencoder method (SDMSA). SDMSA is a two-stage method. In the first stage, the matrix factorization scheme is utilized to learn the latent semantic information, the label matrix is incorporated into the loss function instead of the similarity matrix. Thereafter, the binary codes can be generated by the latent representations. During optimization, we can avoid manipulating a large ${n}\times {n}$ similarity matrix, and the hash codes can be generated directly. In the second stage, a novel hash function learning scheme based on the autoencoder is proposed. The encoder–decoder paradigm aims to learn projections, the feature vectors are projected to code vectors by encoder, and the code vectors are projected back to the original feature vectors by the decoder. The encoder–decoder scheme ensures the embedding can well preserve both the semantic and feature information. Specifically, two algorithms SDMSA-lin and SDMSA-ker are developed under the SDMSA framework. Owing to the merit of SDMSA, we can get more semantically meaningful binary hash codes. Extensive experiments on several databases show that SDMSA-lin and SDMSA-ker achieve promising performance.},

  abstract     = {Attributed networks are ubiquitous in the real world, such as social networks. Therefore, many researchers take the node attributes into consideration in the network representation learning to improve the downstream task performance. In this article, we mainly focus on an untouched “oversmoothing” problem in the research of the attributed network representation learning. Although the Laplacian smoothing has been applied by the state-of-the-art works to learn a more robust node representation, these works cannot adapt to the topological characteristics of different networks, thereby causing the new oversmoothing problem and reducing the performance on some networks. In contrast, we adopt a smoothing parameter that is evaluated from the topological characteristics of a specified network, such as small worldness or node convergency and, thus, can smooth the nodes’ attribute and structure information adaptively and derive both robust and distinguishable node features for different networks. Moreover, we develop an integrated autoencoder to learn the node representation by reconstructing the combination of the smoothed structure and attribute information. By observation of extensive experiments, our approach can preserve the intrinsical information of networks more effectively than the state-of-the-art works on a number of benchmark datasets with very different topological characteristics.},

  abstract     = {A striking discovery in the field of network science is that the majority of real networked systems have some universal structural properties. In general, they are simultaneously sparse, scale-free, small-world, and loopy. In this article, we investigate the second-order consensus of dynamic networks with such universal structures subject to white noise at vertices. We focus on the network coherence H SO characterized in terms of the $\mathcal {H}_{2}$ -norm of the vertex systems, which measures the mean deviation of vertex states from their average value. We first study numerically the coherence of some representative real-world networks. We find that their coherence H SO scales sublinearly with the vertex number $N$ . We then study analytically H SO for a class of iteratively growing networks—pseudofractal scale-free webs (PSFWs), and obtain an exact solution to H SO , which also increases sublinearly in $N$ , with an exponent much smaller than 1. To explain the reasons for this sublinear behavior, we finally study H SO for Sierpinśki gaskets, for which H SO grows superlinearly in $N$ , with a power exponent much larger than 1. Sierpinśki gaskets have the same number of vertices and edges as the PSFWs but do not display the scale-free and small-world properties. We thus conclude that the scale-free, small-world, and loopy topologies are jointly responsible for the observed sublinear scaling of H SO .},

  abstract     = {Network embedding aims to learn the low-dimensional node representations for networks, which has attracted an increasing amount of attention in recent years. Most existing efforts in this field attempt to embed the network based on node similarity, which generally relies on edge existence statistics of the network. Instead of relying on the global edge existence statistics for every node pair, in this article, we utilize the information between a pair of nodes in a local way and propose a model, called node pair information preserving network embedding (NINE), based on adversarial networks. The main idea lies in preserving the node pair information (NI) by means of adversarial networks. The architecture of the proposed NINE model consists of three main components, namely: 1) NI embedder; 2) NI generator; and 3) NI discriminator. In the NI embedder, to avoid the complicated similarity calculation for a pair of nodes, the original NI vector calculated from the direct neighbor information of the two nodes is adopted as features, and the edge existence information is taken as labels to learn the embedded NI vector in a supervised learning manner. The second component is the NI generator, which takes the original node representation vectors of a node pair as input and outputs the generated NI vector. In order to make the generated NI vector follow the same distribution of the corresponding embedded NI vector, the generative adversarial network (GAN) is adopted, resulting in the third component, called the NI discriminator. Extensive experiments are conducted on seven real-world datasets in three downstream tasks, namely: 1) network reconstruction; 2) link prediction; and 3) node classification. Comparison results with seven state-of-the-art models demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, and rationality of our model.},

First, a 3-D pipeline graph model is designed to represent the possible projection position of drones, and the objective function is proposed for optimal drone deployment. Then, in the first phase, based on the features of the 3-D pipeline graph, the drone flight rules and constraint conditions are presented to calculate the number of drones and the initial layout sequence. In the second phase, according to the objective function and the above results, every drone is continuously moved in a small area to achieve a tradeoff between signal coverage and interference. Moreover, the key parameters of the objective function can be discussed to further optimize drone deployment.

A unified distributed finite-time attitude control framework, based on the sliding-mode control (SMC) principle, is developed. Different from the current state of the art, the proposed attitude control method is suitable for not only the leader spacecraft but also the follower spacecraft, and only the neighbor state information among spacecraft is required, allowing the resulting control scheme to be truly distributed. Furthermore, the proposed method is inherently continuous, which eliminates the undesired chattering problem. Such features are deemed favorable in practical spacecraft applications. In addition, upon using the proposed neuro-adaptive control technique, the attitude formation-containment deployment can be achieved in finite time with sufficient accuracy, despite the involvement of both the uncertain inertia matrices and external disturbances. The effectiveness of the developed control scheme is confirmed by numerical simulations.},

The system contains (possibly fast) time-varying uncertainty that lies in a fuzzy set. It aims at an optimal controller for the system to render bounded constraint-following error such that it can stay within a predetermined bound at all time and be sufficiently small eventually. First, for deterministic performance, the original system is transformed into a constructed system. A deterministic (not the usual IF-THEN rules-based) robust control is then designed for the constructed system to render it to be uniformly bounded and uniformly ultimately bounded, regardless of the uncertainty. Second, for optimal performance, a performance index, including the average fuzzy system performance and control effort, is proposed based on the fuzzy information. An optimal design problem associated with the control gain is then formulated and solved by minimizing the performance index. Finally, it is proved when the constructed system renders uniform boundedness and uniform ultimate boundedness, the original system achieves the desired performance of bounded constraint following.},

  abstract     = {In general, image restoration involves mapping from low-quality images to their high-quality counterparts. Such optimal mapping is usually nonlinear and learnable by machine learning. Recently, deep convolutional neural networks have proven promising for such learning processing. It is desirable for an image processing network to support well with three vital tasks, namely: 1) super-resolution; 2) denoising; and 3) deblocking. It is commonly recognized that these tasks have strong correlations, which enable us to design a general framework to support all tasks. In particular, the selection of feature scales is known to significantly impact the performance on these tasks. To this end, we propose the cross-scale residual network to exploit scale-related features among the three tasks. The proposed network can extract spatial features across different scales and establish cross-temporal feature reusage, so as to handle different tasks in a general framework. Our experiments show that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations for multiple image restoration tasks.},

Conventional GPCs, however, suffer from: 1) poor scalability for big data due to the full kernel matrix and 2) intractable inference due to the non-Gaussian likelihoods. Hence, various scalable GPCs have been proposed through: 1) the sparse approximation built upon a small inducing set to reduce the time complexity and 2) the approximate inference to derive analytical evidence lower bound (ELBO). However, these scalable GPCs equipped with analytical ELBO are limited to specific likelihoods or additional assumptions. In this work, we present a unifying framework that accommodates scalable GPCs using various likelihoods. Analogous to GP regression (GPR), we introduce additive noises to augment the probability space for: 1) the GPCs with step , (multinomial) probit , and logit likelihoods via the internal variables and 2) particularly, the GPC using softmax likelihood via the noise variables themselves. This leads to unified scalable GPCs with analytical ELBO by using variational inference. Empirically, our GPCs showcase superiority on extensive binary/multiclass classification tasks with up to two million data points.},

  abstract     = {In the natural language processing family, learning representations is a pioneering study, especially in sequence-to-sequence tasks where outputs are generated, totally relying on the learning representations of source sequence. Generally, classic methods infer that each word occurring in the source sequence, having more or less influence on the target sequence, should all be considered when generating outputs. As the summarization task requires the output sequence to only retain the essence, classic full consideration of the source sequence may not work well on it, which calls for more suitable methods with the ability to discard the misleading noise words. Motivated by this, with both relevance retaining and redundancy removal in mind, we propose a summarization learning model by implementing an encoder with copious contextual information represented and a decoder with a selecting mechanism integrated. Specifically, we equip the encoder with an asynchronous bi directional parallel structure, in order to obtain abundant semantic representation. The decoder, different from the classic attention-based works, employs a self-aware context selecting mechanism to generate summary in a more productive way. We evaluate the proposed methods on three benchmark summarization corpora. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed framework in relation to several well-practiced and state-of-the-art summarization methods.},

Besides, although they are the type-1 fuzzy model in nature, however, they show the high level of robustness to the noises and parametric uncertainties, which is comparable to the type-2 fuzzy models.

Pothole detection is typically performed by either structural engineers or certified inspectors. However, this task is not only hazardous for the personnel but also extremely time consuming. This article presents an efficient pothole detection algorithm based on road disparity map estimation and segmentation. We first incorporate the stereo rig roll angle into shifting distance calculation to generalize perspective transformation. The road disparities are then efficiently estimated using semiglobal matching. A disparity map transformation algorithm is then performed to better distinguish the damaged road areas. Subsequently, we utilize simple linear iterative clustering to group the transformed disparities into a collection of superpixels. The potholes are finally detected by finding the superpixels, whose intensities are lower than an adaptively determined threshold. The proposed algorithm is implemented on an NVIDIA RTX 2080 Ti GPU in CUDA. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed road pothole detection algorithm achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Human-centered systems of systems, such as social networks, the Internet of Things, or healthcare systems are growingly becoming significant facets of modern life. Realistic models of human behavior in such systems play an essential role in their accurate modeling and prediction. Nevertheless, human behavior under uncertainty often violates the predictions by the conventional probabilistic models. Recently, quantum-like decision theories have shown a considerable potential to explain the contradictions in human behavior by applying quantum probabilities. But providing a quantum-like decision theory that could predict rather than describe the current state of human behavior is still one of the unsolved challenges. The fundamental contribution of this work is introducing the concept of entanglement from quantum information theory to Bayesian networks (BNs). This concept leads to an entangled quantum-like BN (QBN), in which each human is a part of the entire society. Accordingly, society’s effect on the dynamic evolution of the decision-making process, which is less often considered in decision theories, is modeled by entanglement measures. To reach this aim, we introduce a quantum-like witness and find the relationship between this witness and the famous concurrence entanglement measure. The proposed predictive entangled QBN (PEQBN) is evaluated on 22 experimental tasks. Results confirm that PEQBN provides more realistic predictions of human decisions under uncertainty when compared with classical BNs and three recent quantum-like approaches.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we investigate the robust stabilization for an interconnected power system with a doubly fed induction generator (DFIG)-based wind farm via retarded sampled-data control (RSDC). Generally, the interconnected power system with DFIG-based wind farm considers a mechanical torque, and load deviation, which is taken into disturbance of the proposed model. The main concern of this article is to stabilize and mitigate the frequency fluctuation, and speed deviation of the DFIG-based wind farm. To do this, a more general sampled-data control strategy, involving the effect of constant time delay is considered and the sampling period is assumed to vary within an interval. In addition, the defined disturbances are attenuated by using the $H_{\infty }$ performance-based RSDC scheme. An appropriate Lyapunov Krasovskii functional (LKF) is constructed to obtain the delay-dependent sufficient conditions in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) by using the RSDC strategy. The obtained conditions ensure the proposed closed-loop system is asymptotically stable under the designed controller. Finally, simulation results and comparative results are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the designed control scheme.},

To solve the multimodality problem, this article proposes a new feature selection method for semisupervised task, namely, semisupervised structured manifold learning (SSML). The new method learns a new structured graph which consists of more clusters than the known classes. Meanwhile, we propose to exploit the submanifold in both labeled data and unlabeled data by consuming the nearest neighbors of each object in both labeled and unlabeled objects. An iterative optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the new model. A series of experiments was conducted on both synthetic and real-world datasets and the experimental results verify the ability of the new method to solve the multimodality problem and its superior performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {The constant development of sensing applications using innovative and affordable measurement devices has increased the amount of data transmitted through networks, carrying in many cases, redundant information that requires more time to be analyzed or larger storage centers. This redundancy is mainly present because the network nodes do not recognize environmental variations requiring exploration, which causes a repetitive data collection in a set of limited locations. In this work, we propose a multiagent learning framework that uses the Gaussian process regression (GPR) to allow the agents to predict the environmental behavior by means of the neighborhood measurements, and the rate distortion function to establish a border in which the environmental information is neither misunderstood nor redundant. We apply this framework to a mobile sensor network and demonstrate that the nodes can tune the parameter $s$ of the Blahut–Arimoto algorithm in order to adjust the gathered environment information and to become more or less exploratory within a sensing area.},

While it is difficult to obtain the optimal solution of 2E-VRP, this study finds a breakthrough that the structure of the optimal route planning for 2E-VRP is usually an embedded Hamiltonian graph. In the graph, routes can be drawn in a planar graph as Hamiltonian circuits without intersections. Based on this finding, an embedded Hamiltonian graph-guided heuristic algorithm is proposed to solve 2E-VRP. As a crucial part of the algorithm, an initialization scheme is designed to search for the farthest vertices from each route and insert the rest of the vertices. In the satellite-adjustment process, a dynamic adjustment for satellites scheme is proposed to adjust the state of satellites. The two schemes aim to construct Hamiltonian circuits with few intersections. Experiments have been conducted on 207 instances to demonstrate the effect of the proposed algorithm on solving 2E-VRP. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can obtain more solutions of 2E-VRP with significantly smaller objective-function values. Furthermore, the number of intersections in routes generated by the proposed algorithm is much less than those obtained by the compared algorithms. With the use of the two schemes, the embedded Hamiltonian graph-guided heuristic algorithm significantly outperforms the compared algorithms for 2E-VRP.},

  abstract     = {Accurately classifying sceneries with different spatial configurations is an indispensable technique in computer vision and intelligent systems, for example, scene parsing, robot motion planning, and autonomous driving. Remarkable performance has been achieved by the deep recognition models in the past decade. As far as we know, however, these deep architectures are incapable of explicitly encoding the human visual perception, that is, the sequence of gaze movements and the subsequent cognitive processes. In this article, a biologically inspired deep model is proposed for scene classification, where the human gaze behaviors are robustly discovered and represented by a unified deep active learning (UDAL) framework. More specifically, to characterize objects’ components with varied sizes, an objectness measure is employed to decompose each scenery into a set of semantically aware object patches. To represent each region at a low level, a local–global feature fusion scheme is developed which optimally integrates multimodal features by automatically calculating each feature’s weight. To mimic the human visual perception of various sceneries, we develop the UDAL that hierarchically represents the human gaze behavior by recognizing semantically important regions within the scenery. Importantly, UDAL combines the semantically salient region detection and the deep gaze shifting path (GSP) representation learning into a principled framework, where only the partial semantic tags are required. Meanwhile, by incorporating the sparsity penalty, the contaminated/redundant low-level regional features can be intelligently avoided. Finally, the learned deep GSP features from the entire scene images are integrated to form an image kernel machine, which is subsequently fed into a kernel SVM to classify different sceneries. Experimental evaluations on six well-known scenery sets (including remote sensing images) have shown the competitiveness of our approach.},

The sliding window method, which is the typical approach in segmenting the continuous data stream, operates with optimal segment sizes chosen considering the type and duration of the activities. Nevertheless, activity type and duration are usually unknown to the detection unit in practice. In this study, we proposed the nonpredetermined size windowing (NSW) scheme to spot the target activity performed in a sequence of unseen activities. NSW is built on classifying progress-based features in multilayer training and prediction stages where the time-domain progress is expressed in terms of polynomials. Thus, it operates without incorporating the information regarding duration and type of the activities. We verified our method with a proof-of-concept use case where data are acquired by a single wrist-worn 3-D accelerometer. We compared our method against fixed size windowing performed with varying window sizes and feature extraction schemes; windowed energy , peak frequency , Shannon entropy , and wavelet entropy . Our method outperforms the compared schemes, reaching a median accuracy of 89\% and a median true positive rate of 1 in both intrasubject and intersubject cases based on an independent test set where each test instance contains a sequence of nine different activities.},

First, we design an adaptive neural controller such that each mode of the closed-loop $x$ -system is ISpS with respect to the state of dynamic uncertainties. Then, fast average dwell time (fast ADT) and slow average dwell time (slow ADT) are simultaneously used to limit the switching law. In this way, both the closed-loop $x$ -system and the unmodeled $z$ -dynamics are ISpS under switching. By assigning the ISpS gains with small-gain theorem, we can guarantee that the whole closed-loop system is semiglobal uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB), and meanwhile, the system output is steered to a small region of zero.

  abstract     = {Deep probabilistic aspect models are widely utilized in document analysis to extract the semantic information and obtain descriptive topics. However, there are two problems that may affect their applications. One is that common words shared among all documents with low representational meaning may reduce the representation ability of learned topics. The other is introducing supervision information to hierarchical topic models to fully utilize the side information of documents that is difficult. To address these problems, in this article, we first propose deep diverse latent Dirichlet allocation (DDLDA), a deep hierarchical topic model that can yield more meaningful semantic topics with less common and meaningless words by introducing shared topics. Moreover, we develop a variational inference network for DDLDA, which helps us to further generalize DDLDA to a supervised deep topic model called max-margin DDLDA (mmDDLDA) by employing max-margin principle as the classification criterion. Compared to DDLDA, mmDDLDA can discover more discriminative topical representations. In addition, a continual hybrid method with stochastic-gradient MCMC and variational inference is put forward for deep latent Dirichlet allocation (DLDA)-based models to make them more practical in real-world applications. The experimental results demonstrate that DDLDA and mmDDLDA are more efficient than existing unsupervised and supervised topic models in discovering highly discriminative topic representations and achieving higher classification accuracy. Meanwhile, DLDA and our proposed models trained by the proposed continual learning approach cannot only show good performance on preventing catastrophic forgetting but also fit the evolving new tasks well.},

The dynamics of each following agent is unknown, obeying a strict-feedback form. With the help of fuzzy-logic systems, input filters, and constraint-handling schemes, a fully distributed output-feedback control algorithm is proposed to achieve output synchronization with prescribed performance and guarantee boundedness of signals in the closed-loop systems. In addition, the algorithm exhibits a simplicity control attribute in the sense that: 1) the control design utilizes only relative output measurements, and no extra information needs to be transmitted via the network and 2) the issue of explosion of complexity is addressed, without employing command filters or dynamic surface control techniques. Finally, the simulation results clarify and verify the established theoretical findings.},

In the network, nodes are ontologies allowing for various data contextualisation, while edges are general-purpose computational procedures elaborating data. Arianna + provides a flexible interface between the inputs and outputs of procedures and statements , which are atomic representations of ontological knowledge. Arianna + schedules procedures on the basis of events by employing logic-based reasoning, that is, by checking the classification of certain statements in the ontologies. Each procedure involves input and output statements that are differently contextualized in the ontologies based on specific prior knowledge. Arianna + allows to design networks that encode data within multiple contexts and, as a reference scenario, we present a modular network based on a spatial context shared among all activities and a temporal context specialized for each activity to be recognized. In the article, we argue that a network of small ontologies is more intelligible and has a reduced computational load than a single ontology encoding the same knowledge. Arianna + integrates in the same architecture heterogeneous data processing techniques, which may be better suited to different contexts. Thus, we do not propose a new algorithmic approach to activity recognition, instead, we focus on the architectural aspects for accommodating logic-based and data-driven activity models in a context-oriented way. Also, we discuss how to leverage data contextualization and reasoning for activity recognition, and to support an iterative development process driven by domain experts.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, many learning systems have been developed for higher level forms of data, such as learning on distributions in which each example itself is a distribution. This article proposes active robust learning on distributions. In learning on distributions, there is no access to distributions themselves but rather access is through a sample drawn from a distribution. Therefore, similar to robust learning, any estimates of examples are inexact. In order to address these difficulties, we provide an upper bound on the risk of the classifier in the next stage of active learning, where the size of the labeled dataset increases. Based on this upper bound, we propose probabilistic minimax active learning (PMAL) as a general multiclass active learning method that is easy to use in many Bayesian settings, which provably selects an example with knowledge of its label minimizing the expected risk. We present an efficient approximation of the objective with a known error bound to deal with the intractability of the proposed method for active robust learning. Here, we face a nonconvex problem, which we solve by means of a related convex problem with a bound on the norm of the difference between their solutions. To utilize the information about the estimates of distributions, we propose active robust learning on the distributions method based on learning the kernel embedding of distributions by a recent Bayesian method. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the resulting method on a set of synthetic and real-world distributional datasets.},

  abstract     = {Attribute reduction is one of the most important preprocessing steps in machine learning and data mining. As a key step of attribute reduction, attribute evaluation directly affects classification performance, search time, and stopping criterion. The existing evaluation functions are greatly dependent on the relationship between objects, which makes its computational time and space more costly. To solve this problem, we propose a novel separability-based evaluation function and reduction method by using the relationship between objects and decision categories directly. The degree of aggregation (DA) of intraclass objects and the degree of dispersion (DD) of between-class objects are first defined to measure the significance of an attribute subset. Then, the separability of attribute subsets is defined by DA and DD in fuzzy decision systems, and we design a sequentially forward selection based on the separability (SFSS) algorithm to select attributes. Furthermore, a postpruning strategy is introduced to prevent overfitting and determine a termination parameter. Finally, the SFSS algorithm is compared with some typical reduction algorithms using some public datasets from UCI and ELVIRA Biomedical repositories. The interpretability of SFSS is directly presented by the performance on MNIST handwritten digits. The experimental comparisons show that SFSS is fast and robust, which has higher classification accuracy and compression ratio, with extremely low computational time.},

We then propose a novel coalition structure generation (CSG) approach for ISGs that is based on graph clustering, which outperforms existing CSG approaches for ISGs by using off-the-shelf optimization solvers. Finally, we provide theoretical guarantees on the value of the optimal CSG solution of $G$ with respect to the optimal CSG solution of the approximately equivalent ISG. As a consequence, our approach allows one to compute approximate CSG solutions with quality guarantees for any CFG.

  abstract     = {Unsupervised feature selection (UFS) aims to remove the redundant information and select the most representative feature subset from the original data, so it occupies a core position for high-dimensional data preprocessing. Many proposed approaches use self-expression to explore the correlation between the data samples or use pseudolabel matrix learning to learn the mapping between the data and labels. Furthermore, the existing methods have tried to add constraints to either of these two modules to reduce the redundancy, but no prior literature embeds them into a joint model to select the most representative features by the computed top ranking scores. To address the aforementioned issue, this article presents a novel UFS method via a convex non-negative matrix factorization with an adaptive graph constraint (CNAFS). Through convex matrix factorization with adaptive graph constraint, it can dig up the correlation between the data and keep the local manifold structure of the data. To our knowledge, it is the first work that integrates pseudo label matrix learning into the self-expression module and optimizes them simultaneously for the UFS solution. Besides, two different manifold regularizations are constructed for the pseudolabel matrix and the encoding matrix to keep the local geometrical structure. Eventually, extensive experiments on the benchmark datasets are conducted to prove the effectiveness of our method. The source code is available at: https://github.com/misteru/CNAFS .},

  abstract     = {Agent advising is one of the main approaches to improve agent learning performance by enabling agents to share advice. Existing advising methods have a common limitation that an adviser agent can offer advice to an advisee agent only if the advice is created in the same state as the advisee’s state. However, in complex environments, it is a very strong requirement that two states are the same, because a state may consist of multiple dimensions and two states being the same means that all these dimensions in the two states are correspondingly identical. Therefore, this requirement may limit the applicability of existing advising methods to complex environments. In this article, inspired by the differential privacy scheme, we propose a differential advising method that relaxes this requirement by enabling agents to use advice in a state even if the advice is created in a slightly different state. Compared with the existing methods, agents using the proposed method have more opportunity to take advice from others. This article is the first to adopt the concept of differential privacy on advising to improve agent learning performance instead of addressing security issues. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is more efficient in complex environments than the existing methods.},

It means that, according to different tasks and situations, the following agents can have nonidentical orders or different numbers of states to be synchronized, which is more general for the practical cooperative applications. The leader is a higher-order nonautonomous system and contains full state information to be synchronized for all agents with mixed-order dynamics. Accordingly, the spanning tree is defined based on the specific state rather than on the agent to guarantee that each following agent can receive adequate state information. Distributed control protocols are designed for all agents to achieve the ultimate state synchronization to the leader in finite time. The Lyapunov approach is used for the stability analysis and a practical example of mixed-order mechanical MASs verifies the effectiveness and performance of the proposed distributed control protocols.},

Moreover, a novel composite adaptive control algorithm is proposed under a much weaker interval-excitation (IE) condition. More specifically, parameter adaptive estimation accuracy and speed are quantificationally ensured by employing a composite technique. Therefore, both steady-state performance and transient-state performance are achieved for the position synchronization and parameter estimation with the proposed control strategy. The Lyapunov function and the multidimensional small-gain framework are utilized to derive system stability criteria. It demonstrates that the allowable maximal derivatives of the transmission delays can be easily computed with the given parameters of the control algorithm and the nonlinear performance functions.

  abstract     = {Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) classification has drawn tremendous attention in the field of Earth observation. In the big data era, explosive growth has occurred in the amount of data obtained by advanced remote sensors. Inevitably, new data classes and refined categories appear continuously, and such data are limited in terms of the timeliness of application. These characteristics motivate us to build an HSI classification model that learns new classifying capability rapidly within a few shots while maintaining good performance on the original classes. To achieve this goal, we propose a linear programming incremental learning classifier (LPILC) that can enable existing deep learning classification models to adapt to new datasets. Specifically, the LPILC learns the new ability by taking advantage of the well-trained classification model within one shot of the new class without any original class data. The entire process requires minimal new class data, computational resources, and time, thereby making LPILC a suitable tool for some time-sensitive applications. Moreover, we utilize the proposed LPILC to implement fine-grained classification via the well-trained original coarse-grained classification model. We demonstrate the success of LPILC with extensive experiments based on three widely used hyperspectral datasets, namely, PaviaU, Indian Pines, and Salinas. The experimental results reveal that the proposed LPILC outperforms state-of-the-art methods under the same data access and computational resource. The LPILC can be integrated into any sophisticated classification model, thereby bringing new insights into incremental learning applied in HSI classification.},

  abstract     = {This article addresses the problems of the dissipative asynchronous Takagi–Sugeno–Kong fuzzy control for a kind of singular semi-Markov jump system. An adjustable quantized approach is presented to deal with the uncertainties, nonlinear disturbance, actuator faults, and time-varying delay of the system. To deal with the problem of the nonsynchronous between system modes and controller modes, an asynchronous method is utilized. Then, a novel asynchronous sliding-mode controller is designed with an output measurement quantizer that is adaptive to the actuator faults and has good performance in practical applications. By solving the linear matrix inequalities, the sufficient conditions are obtained to guarantee the closed system stochastically admissible and strictly $(Q,R,S)-\alpha -$ dissipative and ensure the reachability of the sliding-mode surface. Finally, two numerical examples and comparisons are provided to illustrate the effectiveness and the priority of the proposed technique.},

Unfortunately, developed theory so far is not sufficient to deal with challenging problems of the decay rate, time-varying delays, and nonautonomous issues. These problems have not been tackled in the existing literature. Consequently, under the weak constraints, this article focuses on the general decay, including the exponential stability and the polynomial stability, for nonlinear nonautonomous hybrid neutral stochastic systems with time-varying delays by the approach of the multiple degenerate functionals.

The existing BDR methods usually obtain a self-expression coefficient matrix from the original features by a shallow linear model. However, the underlying structure of real-world data is often nonlinear, thus those methods cannot faithfully reflect the intrinsic relationship among samples. To address this problem, we propose a novel latent BDR (LBDR) model to perform the subspace clustering on a nonlinear structure, which jointly learns an autoencoder and a BDR matrix. The autoencoder, which consists of a nonlinear encoder and a linear decoder, plays an important role to learn features from the nonlinear samples. Meanwhile, the learned features are used as a new dictionary for a linear model with block-diagonal regularization, which can ensure good performances for spectral clustering. Moreover, we theoretically prove that the learned features are located in the linear space, thus ensuring the effectiveness of the linear model using self-expression. Extensive experiments on various real-world datasets verify the superiority of our LBDR over the state-of-the-art subspace clustering approaches.},

  abstract     = {Surrogate-based-constrained optimization for some optimization problems involving computationally expensive objective functions and constraints is still a great challenge in the optimization field. Its difficulties are of two primary types. One is how to handle the constraints, especially, equality constraints; another is how to sample a good point to improve the prediction of the surrogates in the feasible region. Overcoming these difficulties requires a reliable constraint-handling method and an efficient infill-sampling strategy. To perform inequality- and equality-constrained optimization of expensive black-box systems, this work proposes a hybrid surrogate-based-constrained optimization method (HSBCO), and the main innovation is that a new constraint-handling method is proposed to map the feasible region into the origin of the Euclidean subspace. Thus, if the constraint violation of an infeasible solution is large, then it is far from the origin in the Euclidean subspace. Therefore, all constraints of the problem can be transformed into an equivalent equality constraint, and the distance between an infeasible point and the origin in the Euclidean subspace represents the constraint violation of the infeasible solution. Based on the distance, the objective function of the problem can be penalized by a Gaussian penalty function, and the original constrained optimization problem becomes an unconstrained optimization problem. Thus, the feasible solutions of the original minimization problem always have a lower objective function value than any infeasible solution in the penalized objective space. To improve the optimization performance, kriging-based efficient global optimization (EGO) is used to find a locally optimal solution in the first phase of HSBCO, and starting from this locally optimal solution, RBF-model-based global search and local search strategies are introduced to seek global optimal solutions. Such a hybrid optimization strategy can help the optimization process converge to the global optimal solution within a given maximum number of function evaluations, as demonstrated in the experimental results on 23 test problems. The method is shown to achieve the global optimum more closely and efficiently than other leading methods.},

  abstract     = {Due to its strong performance in handling uncertain and ambiguous data, the fuzzy ${k}$ -nearest-neighbor method (FKNN) has realized substantial success in a wide variety of applications. However, its classification performance would be heavily deteriorated if the number k of nearest neighbors was unsuitably fixed for each testing sample. This study examines the feasibility of using only one fixed k value for FKNN on each testing sample. A novel FKNN-based classification method, namely, fuzzy KNN method with adaptive nearest neighbors (A-FKNN), is devised for learning a distinct optimal k value for each testing sample. In the training stage, after applying a sparse representation method on all training samples for reconstruction, A-FKNN learns the optimal ${k}$ value for each training sample and builds a decision tree (namely, A-FKNN tree) from all training samples with new labels (the learned optimal ${k}$ values instead of the original labels), in which each leaf node stores the corresponding optimal ${k}$ value. In the testing stage, A-FKNN identifies the optimal ${k}$ value for each testing sample by searching the A-FKNN tree and runs FKNN with the optimal ${k}$ value for each testing sample. Moreover, a fast version of A-FKNN, namely, FA-FKNN, is designed by building the FA-FKNN decision tree, which stores the optimal k value with only a subset of training samples in each leaf node. Experimental results on 32 UCI datasets demonstrate that both A-FKNN and FA-FKNN outperform the compared methods in terms of classification accuracy, and FA-FKNN has a shorter running time.},

  abstract     = {Dynamic memristor (DM)-cellular neural networks (CNNs), which replace a linear resistor with flux-controlled memristor in the architecture of each cell of traditional CNNs, have attracted researchers’ attention. Compared with common neural networks, the DM-CNNs have an outstanding merit: when a steady state is reached, all voltages, currents, and power consumption of DM-CNNs disappeared, in the meantime, the memristor can store the computation results by serving as nonvolatile memories. The previous study on stability of DM-CNNs rarely considered time delay, while delay is quite common and highly impacts the stability of the system. Thus, taking the time delay effect into consideration, we extend the original system to DM-D(delay)CNNs model. By using the Lyapunov method and the matrix theory, some new sufficient conditions for the global asymptotic stability and global exponential stability with a known convergence rate of DM-DCNNs are obtained. These criteria generalized some known conclusions and are easily verified. Moreover, we find DM-DCNNs have $3^{n}$ equilibrium points (EPs) and $2^{n}$ of them are locally asymptotically stable. These results are obtained via a given constitutive relation of memristor and the appropriate division of state space. Combine with these theoretical results, the applications of DM-DCNNs can be extended to other fields, such as associative memory, and its advantage can be used in a better way. Finally, numerical simulations are offered to illustrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results.},

Under the mild condition that the union network of all communication network candidates is connected, we show that the players’ actions could converge to an arbitrarily small neighborhood of the NE in the mean-square sense by adjusting the algorithm parameters. It is further found that the unique NE is mean-square stable when it is not restricted by any constraint set. In addition, we show that the proposed distributed discrete-time NE seeking algorithm can be utilized to deal with the energy trading problem in microgrids where each microgrid is modeled as a rational player using a purchase price as its action to buy energy from other microgrids with surplus supplies. The energy market allocates the excess energy according to the principle of proportional distribution. Some numerical simulations are finally presented to verify the validity of the present discrete-time NE seeking algorithm in solving the energy trading problem.},

The challenges lie in the limited access to the information of the target formation in the sense that the prescribed values of the formation parameters, that is, the scaling size and rotation angle, are known only by one agent which we call the leader. Motivated by the fact that three agents (say, leaders) can determine the shape of a planar triangular formation using the stress matrix, we propose a class of estimators to guarantee that two agents in the leader set can gain access to the formation parameters. Then, an integrated control scheme is designed such that the target formation can be uniquely stabilized among all its affine transformations. The sufficient condition ensuring the stability of the closed-loop system is also given based on the cyclic-small-gain theorem.

  abstract     = {In this article, we propose a novel economic model-predictive control (MPC) algorithm for a group of disturbed linear systems and implement it in a distributed manner. The system consists of multiple subsystems interacting with each other via dynamics and aims to optimize an economic objective. Each subsystem is subject to constraints both on states and inputs as well as unknown but bounded disturbances. First, we divide the computation of control inputs into several local optimization problems based on each subsystem’s local information. This is done by introducing compatibility constraints to confine the difference between the actual information and the previously published reference information of each subsystem, which is the key feature of the proposed distributed algorithm. Then, to ensure the satisfaction of both state and input constraints under disturbances, constraints are tightened on the state and the input of nominal systems by considering explicitly the effect of uncertainties. Moreover, based on an overall optimal steady state, a dissipativity constraint and a terminal constraint are designed and incorporated in the local optimization problems to establish recursive feasibility and guarantee stability for the resulting closed-loop system. Finally, the efficiency of the distributed economic MPC algorithm is demonstrated in a building temperature control case study.},

  abstract     = {This article discusses the issue of disturbance rejection and anti-windup control for a class of complex systems with both saturating actuators and diverse types of disturbances. At the input port, to better characterize those irregular disturbances, exogenous dynamic neural network (DNN) models with adjustable weight parameters are first introduced. A novel disturbance observer-based adaptive control (DOBAC) technique is then established, which realizes the dynamic monitoring for the unknown input disturbance. To handle the system disturbance with a bounded norm, the attenuation performance is concurrently analyzed by optimizing the $L_{1}$ gain index. Moreover, the PI-type dynamic tracking controller is proposed by integrating the polytopic description of the saturating input with the estimation of the input disturbance. The favorable stability, tracking, and robustness performances of the augmented system are achieved within a given domain of attraction by employing the convex optimization theory. Finally, using DNN-based modeling for three kinds of different irregular disturbances, simulation studies for an A4D aircraft model are conducted to substantiate the superiority of the designed algorithm.},

This article proposes an evolutionary multitasking algorithm with learning task relationships (LTR) for MO-MFO. In the proposed algorithm, a procedure of LTR is well designed. The decision space of each task is treated as a manifold, and all decision spaces of different tasks are jointly modeled as a joint manifold. Then, through solving a generalized eigenvalue decomposition problem, the joint manifold is projected to a latent space while keeping the necessary features for all tasks and the topology of each manifold. Finally, the task relationships are represented as the joint mapping matrix, which is composed of multiple mapping functions, and they are utilized for information transfer across different decision spaces during the evolutionary process. In the empirical experiments, the performance of the proposed algorithm is verified and compared with several state-of-the-art solvers for MO-MFO on three suites of MO-MFO test problems. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm surpasses other competitors on most test instances, and can well tackle complicated MO-MFO problems which involve distinct optimization tasks with heterogeneous decision spaces.},

In this article, taking into account human–vehicle interaction and heterogeneous driver behavior, an adaptive optimal control design method is proposed for a platoon mixed with multiple preceding human-driven vehicles and one CAV at the tail. It is shown that by using reinforcement learning and adaptive dynamic programming techniques, a near-optimal controller can be learned from real-time data for the CAV with V2V communications, but without the precise knowledge of the accurate car-following parameters of any driver in the platoon. The proposed method allows the CAV controller to adapt to different platoon dynamics caused by the unknown and heterogeneous driver-dependent parameters. To improve the safety performance during the learning process, our off-policy learning algorithm can leverage both the historical data and the data collected in real time, which leads to considerably reduced learning time duration. The effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method is demonstrated by rigorous proofs and microscopic traffic simulations.},

The considered CPSs are modeled as a class of nonlinear multi-input uncertain multiagent systems, which can be used to model an AC microgrid system consisting of distributed generators. When the communication to a subsystem from one of its neighbors is attacked by a DoS attack, the transmitted information is unavailable and the existing distributed adaptive methods used to estimate the bound of the $n$ th-order derivative of the reference trajectory become nonapplicable. To overcome this difficulty, we first design a new distributed estimator for each subsystem to ensure that the magnitude of the state of the estimator is larger than the bound of the $n$ th-order derivative of the reference trajectory after a finite time. By employing the estimator state, a distributed observer with a switching mechanism is proposed. Then, a new block backstepping-based decentralized adaptive controller is developed. Based on the DoS communication duration property, convex design conditions of observer parameters are derived with the Lebesgue integral theory and the average dwell time method. It is proved that the output tracking errors will approach a compact set with the developed method. Finally, the design method is successfully applied to show the effectiveness of the proposed method to solve the power sharing problem for AC microgrids.},

In this article, we address these issues by designing a novel distributed Kalman consensus filter (DKCF) with an information-weighted consensus structure for random mobile target estimation in continuous time. A new moving target information-flow topology for the measurement of targets is developed based on the sensors’ sensing ranges, targets’ random mobility, and local information-weighted neighbors. Novel necessary and sufficient conditions about the convergence of the proposed DKCF are developed. Under these conditions, the estimates of all sensors converge to the consensus values. Simulation and comparative studies show the effectiveness and the superiority of this new DKCF.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, the recommender system has been widely used in online platforms, which can extract useful information from giant volumes of data and recommend suitable items to the user according to user preferences. However, the recommender system usually suffers from sparsity and cold-start problems. Cross-domain recommendation, as a particular example of transfer learning, has been used to solve the aforementioned problems. However, many existing cross-domain recommendation approaches are based on matrix factorization, which can only learn the shallow and linear characteristics of users and items. Therefore, in this article, we propose a novel autoencoder framework with an attention mechanism (AAM) for cross-domain recommendation, which can transfer and fuse information between different domains and make a more accurate rating prediction. The main idea of the proposed framework lies in utilizing autoencoder, multilayer perceptron, and self-attention to extract user and item features, learn the user and item-latent factors, and fuse the user-latent factors from different domains, respectively. In addition, to learn the affinity of the user-latent factors between different domains in a multiaspect level, we also strengthen the self-attention mechanism by using multihead self-attention and propose AAM++. Experiments conducted on two real-world datasets empirically demonstrate that our proposed methods outperform the state-of-the-art methods in cross-domain recommendation and AAM++ performs better than AAM on sparse and large-scale datasets.},

The proposed algorithm makes it possible to separate task optimization and task identification, specifically, the model-based learner helps to identify the pattern of a task, while the gradient-based metalearner is capable of consistently improving the performance with only a few gradient update steps through making use of the task embedding produced by the model-based learner. In addition, the choice of network for the model-based learner in the proposed method is also discussed, and the performance of networks with different depths is explored. Finally, the simulation results on reinforcement learning problems demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms compared metalearning algorithms and delivers a new state-of-the-art performance on a variety of challenging control tasks.},

This design can effectively break the “curse of dimensionality” and reduce the computational complexity by appropriately integrating emerging MFG theory with self-organizing NNs-based reinforcement learning techniques. First, the decentralized optimal control for massive MASs has been formulated into an MFG. To unfold the MFG, the coupled Hamilton–Jacobian–Bellman (HJB) equation and Fokker–Planck–Kolmogorov (FPK) equation needed to be solved simultaneously, which is challenging in real time. Therefore, a novel actor–critic–mass (ACM) structure has been developed along with self-organizing NNs subsequently. In the developed ACM structure, each agent has three NNs, including: 1) mass NN learning the mass MAS’s overall behavior via online estimating the solution of the FPK equation; 2) critic NN obtaining the optimal cost function through learning the HJB equation solution along with time; and 3) actor NN estimating the decentralized optimal control by using the critic and mass NNs along with the optimal control theory. To reduce the NNs’ computational complexity, a self-organizing NN has been adopted and integrated into a developed ACM structure that can adjust the NNs’ architecture based on the NNs’ learning performance and the computation cost. Finally, numerical simulation has been provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed schemes.},

  abstract     = {Accurate and automated detection of anomalous samples in an image dataset can be accomplished with a probabilistic model. Such images have heterogeneous complexity, however, and a probabilistic model tends to overlook simply shaped objects with small anomalies. The reason is that a probabilistic model assigns undesirable lower likelihoods to complexly shaped objects, which are nevertheless consistent with the current set standards. This difficulty is critical, especially for a defect detection task, where the anomaly can be a small scratch or grime. To overcome this difficulty, we propose an unregularized score for deep generative models (DGMs). We found that the regularization terms of the DGMs considerably influence the anomaly score depending on the complexity of the samples. By removing these terms, we obtain an unregularized score, which we evaluated on toy datasets, two in-house manufacturing datasets, and on open manufacturing and medical datasets. The empirical results demonstrate that the unregularized score is robust to the apparent complexity of given samples and detects anomalies selectively.},

  abstract     = {The problem of reconstructing nonlinear and complex dynamical systems from available data or time series is prominent in many fields, including engineering, physical, computer, biological, and social sciences. Many methods have been proposed to address this problem and their performance is satisfactory. However, none of them can reconstruct network structure from large-scale real-time streaming data, which leads to the failure of real-time and online analysis or control of complex systems. In this article, to overcome the limitations of current methods, we first extend the network reconstruction problem (NRP) to online settings, and then develop a follow-the-regularized-leader (FTRL)-Proximal style method to address the online complex NRP; we refer to it as Online-NR. The performance of Online-NR is validated on synthetic evolutionary game network reconstruction datasets and eight real-world networks. The experimental results demonstrate that Online-NR can effectively solve the problem of online network reconstruction with large-scale real-time streaming data. Moreover, Online-NR outperforms or matches nine state-of-the-art network reconstruction methods.},

  abstract     = {These days, the increasing incremental cost consensus-based algorithms are designed to tackle the economic dispatch (ED) problem in smart grids (SGs). However, one principal obstruction lies in privacy disclosure for generators and consumers in electricity activities between supply and demand sides, which may bring great losses to them. Hence, it is extraordinarily essential to design effective privacy-preserving approaches for ED problems. In this article, we propose a two-phase distributed and effective heterogeneous privacy-preserving consensus-based (DisEHPPC) ED scheme, where a demand response (DR)-based framework is constructed, including a DR server, data manager, and a set of local controllers. The first phase is that Kullback–Leibler (KL) privacy is guaranteed for the privacy of consumers’ demand by the differential privacy method. The second phase is that $({\varepsilon,\delta })$ -privacy is, respectively, achieved for the generation energy of generators and the sensitivity of electricity consumption to electricity price by designing the privacy-preserving incremental cost consensus-based (PPICC) algorithm. Meanwhile, the proposed PPICC algorithm tackles the formulated ED problem. Subsequently, we further carry out the detailed theoretical analysis on its convergence, optimality of final solution, and privacy degree. It is found that the optimal solution for the ED problem and the privacy preservation of both supply and demand sides can be guaranteed simultaneously. By evaluation of a numerical experiment, the correctness and effectiveness of the DisEHPPC scheme are confirmed.},

  abstract     = {We present results from an experiment in which 33 human subjects interact with a dynamic system 40 times over a one-week period. The subjects are divided into three groups. For each interaction, a subject performs a command-following task, where the reference command is the same for all trials and all subjects. However, each group interacts with a different dynamic system, which is represented by a transfer function. The transfer functions have the same poles but different zeros. One has a minimum-phase zero $z_{\textrm {m}} &amp;lt; 0$ , another has a nonminimum-phase zero $z_{\textrm {n}} = - z_{\textrm {m}} &amp;gt; 0$ , and the last has a slower (i.e., closer to the imaginary axis) nonminimum-phase zero $z_{\textrm {sn}} \in (0,z_{\textrm {n}})$ . The experimental results show that nonminimum-phase zeros tend to make dynamic systems more difficult for humans to learn to control. We use a subsystem identification algorithm to identify the control strategy that each subject uses on each trial. The identification results show that the identified feedforward controllers approximate the inverse dynamics of the system with which the subjects interact better on the last trial than on the first trial. However, the subjects interacting with the minimum-phase system are able to approximate the inverse dynamics in feedforward more accurately than the subjects interacting with the nonminimum-phase system. This observation suggests that nonminimum-phase zeros are an impediment to approximating inverse dynamics in feedforward. Finally, we provide evidence that humans rely on feedforward-step-like-control strategies with systems (e.g., nonminimum-phase systems) for which it is difficult to approximate the inverse dynamics in feedforward.},

These methods generally involve extensive computer vision algorithms and are tightly coupled with various sensors. We develop a generic method for the key challenging scenarios in multiagent 3-D mapping based on different camera systems. The proposed framework performs actively in terms of localizing each agent after the first loop closure between them. It is shown that the proposed system only uses monocular cameras to yield real-time multiagent large-scale localization and 3-D global mapping. Based on the initial matching, our system can calculate the optimal scale difference between multiple 3-D maps and then estimate an accurate relative pose transformation for large-scale global mapping.},

  abstract     = {A growing number of clinical studies have provided substantial evidence of a close relationship between the microbe and the disease. Thus, it is necessary to infer potential microbe–disease associations. But traditional approaches use experiments to validate these associations that often spend a lot of materials and time. Hence, more reliable computational methods are expected to be applied to predict disease-associated microbes. In this article, an innovative mean for predicting microbe–disease associations is proposed, which is based on network consistency projection and label propagation (NCPLP). Given that most existing algorithms use the Gaussian interaction profile (GIP) kernel similarity as the similarity criterion between microbe pairs and disease pairs, in this model, Medical Subject Headings descriptors are considered to calculate disease semantic similarity. In addition, 16S rRNA gene sequences are borrowed for the calculation of microbe functional similarity. In view of the gene-based sequence information, we use two conventional methods (BLAST+ and MEGA7) to assess the similarity between each pair of microbes from different perspectives. Especially, network consistency projection is added to obtain network projection scores from the microbe space and the disease space. Ultimately, label propagation is utilized to reliably predict microbes related to diseases. NCPLP achieves better performance in various evaluation indicators and discovers a greater number of potential associations between microbes and diseases. Also, case studies further confirm the reliable prediction performance of NCPLP. To conclude, our algorithm NCPLP has the ability to discover these underlying microbe–disease associations and can provide help for biological study.},

By exploiting smooth, similar spaces’ information provided by the samples’ manifold learning and LDL, we link the two spaces’ manifolds. This facilitates using the topological relationship of the manifolds in the feature space to guide the manifold construction of the label space. The smoothest regression function is used to fit the manifold data, and a locally constrained multioutput regression is designed to improve the data’s local fitting. Based on the regression results, we enhance the logical labels into the label distributions, thereby mining and revealing the label’s hidden information regarding importance or significance. Extensive experimental results using real-world multilabel datasets show that the proposed MDLRML algorithm significantly improves the multilabel distribution learning accuracy and efficiency over several existing state-of-the-art schemes.},

As the integration of these two problems, the distributed energy-efficient scheduling problem is of great realistic significance. To the best of our knowledge, the distributed energy-efficient parallel machines scheduling problem (DEPMSP) has not been studied yet. This article aims to solve DEPMSP by integrating factory assignment and machine assignment into an extended machine assignment to handle the coupled relations of subproblems. A knowledge-based two-population optimization (KTPO) algorithm is proposed to minimize total energy consumption and total tardiness simultaneously. Five properties are derived by analyzing the characteristics of DEPMSP. The population is initialized by using two heuristics based on problem-specific knowledge and a random heuristic. The nondominated sorting genetic algorithm-II and differential evolution perform cooperatively on the population in parallel. Moreover, two knowledge-based local search operators are proposed to enhance the exploitation. Extensive simulation experiments are conducted by comparing KTPO with four algorithms from the literature. The comparative results and statistical analysis demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of KTPO in solving DEPMSP.},

Current clustering methods rely heavily on accurate affinity measurements among samples. The samplewise affinity is costive to be constructed yet easy to corrupt by the heterogeneous gap. In the era of big data, fast and accurate clustering of multiple modality data remains challenging. To fill the gap, we propose a novel approach to achieve the clustering by focusing on feature matching across different modalities instead of samplewise affinity. First, a feature matching matrix is calculated by measuring the potential featurewise correlations. The obtained matching matrix is decomposed into two bases corresponding to the column and row spaces of feature matching, acting as coded bases within feature spaces of the different modalities. Then, the sample assignment is obtained by jointly reconstructing the samples by the two bases. The feature matching potential and sample assignment are collaboratively learned by an alternating optimization scheme. The proposed method dramatically reduces the computational cost by avoiding the costive samplewise affinity estimation, without sacrificing accuracy. Extensive experiments on the synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate its superior speed and high accuracy.},

To overcome these drawbacks, in this article, we introduce the label information into the nuclear norm minimization problem and propose a labeled-robust principal component analysis (L-RPCA) to realize nuclear norm minimization on multisubspace data. Compared with the standard nuclear norm minimization, our method can effectively utilize the discriminant information in multisubspace rank minimization and avoid excessive elimination of local information and multisubspace characteristics of the data. Then, an effective labeled-robust regression (L-RR) method is proposed to simultaneously recover the data and labels of the observed data.

  abstract     = {Beyond generating long and topic-coherent paragraphs in traditional captioning tasks, the medical image report composition task poses more task-oriented challenges by requiring both the highly accurate medical term diagnosis and multiple heterogeneous forms of information, including impression and findings. Current methods often generate the most common sentences due to dataset bias for the individual case, regardless of whether the sentences properly capture key entities and relationships. Such limitations severely hinder their applicability and generalization capability in medical report composition, where the most critical sentences lie in the descriptions of abnormal diseases that are relatively rare. Moreover, some medical terms appearing in one report are often entangled with each other and co-occurred, for example, symptoms associated with a specific disease. To enforce the semantic consistency of medical terms to be incorporated into the final reports and encourage the sentence generation for rare abnormal descriptions, we propose a novel framework that unifies template retrieval and sentence generation to handle both common and rare abnormality while ensuring the semantic coherency among the detected medical terms. Specifically, our approach exploits hybrid-knowledge co-reasoning: 1) explicit relationships among all abnormal medical terms to induce the visual attention learning and topic representation encoding for better topic-oriented symptoms descriptions and 2) adaptive generation mode that changes between the template retrieval and sentence generation according to a contextual topic encoder. The experimental results on two medical report benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework in terms of both human and metrics evaluation.},

  abstract     = {Syndrome-trellis codes (STCs) are commonly used in image steganographic schemes, which aim at minimizing the embedding distortion, but most distortion models cannot capture the mutual interaction of embedding modifications (MIEMs). In this article, a secure halftone image steganographic scheme based on a feature space and layer embedding is proposed. First, a feature space is constructed by a characterization method that is designed based on the statistics of $4 \times 4$ pixel blocks in halftone images. Upon the feature space, a generalized steganalyzer with good classification ability is proposed, which is used to measure the embedding distortion. As a result, a distortion model based on a hybrid feature space is constructed, which outperforms some state-of-the-art models. Then, as the distortion model is established on the statistics of local regions, a layer embedding strategy is proposed to reduce MIEM. It divides the host image into multiple layers according to their relative positions in $4 \times 4$ blocks, and the embedding procedure is executed layer by layer. In each layer, any two pixels are located at different $4 \times 4$ blocks in the original image, and the distortion model makes sure that the calculation of pixel distortions is independent. Between layers, the pixel distortions of the current layer are updated according to the previous embedding modifications, thus reducing the total embedding distortion. Comparisons with prior schemes demonstrate that the proposed steganographic scheme achieves high statistical security when resisting the state-of-the-art steganalysis.},

  abstract     = {Compared to other system modeling techniques, the fuzzy discrete event systems (FDESs) methodology has the unique capability of modeling a class of event-driven systems as fuzzy automata with ambiguous state and event-invoked state transition. In two recent papers, we developed algorithms for online-supervised learning of the fuzzy automaton’s event transition matrix using fuzzy states before and after the occurrence of fuzzy events. The post-event state was assumed to be readily available while the pre-event state was either directly available or estimatable through learning. This article is focused on algorithm development for learning the transition matrix in a different setting—when the pre-event state is available but the post-event state is not. We suppose the post-event state is described by a fuzzy set that is linked to a (physical) variable whose value is available. Stochastic-gradient-descent-based algorithms are developed that can learn the transition matrix plus the parameters of the fuzzy sets when the fuzzy sets are of the Gaussian type. Computer simulation results are presented to confirm the theoretical development.},

  abstract     = {This article studies an event-triggered tracking control problem for linear systems subject to output feedback and disturbances, where a new configuration incorporating filtered outputs and impulsive observers is proposed. The transmissions in the sensor-to-controller and controller-to-actuator channels are scheduled by dynamic event-triggered control (ETC) mechanisms to save communication resources. To eliminate the effects of the derivatives of output noises on the tracking and transmission performance, a low-pass filter is introduced to preprocess the raw output signals. Both the filter state and raw output will be transmitted to the controller node while the latter is only utilized by an impulsive observer at some discrete instants. Then, it is proved that the proposed dynamic ETC schemes can solve the practical tracking control problem with fixed reference points and avoid Zeno behavior in both channels. Meanwhile, when some user-specified parameters in the event-triggering conditions are small enough, the tracking control problem can be solved asymptotically for disturbance-free systems. In addition, to further improve the transient performance, reduced-order impulsive observers and optimization of impulsive gain matrices are studied. Finally, simulation results are provided to illustrate the efficiency and feasibility of the obtained results.},

In such targeting systems, nanoswimmers assembled by magnetic nanoparticles are externally manipulated to search for the tumor in the high-risk tissue by a rotating magnetic field produced by a coil system. This process can be interpreted as in vivo computation, where the tumor in the high-risk tissue corresponds to the global maximum or minimum of the in vivo optimization problem, the nanoswimmers are seen as the computational agents, the tumor-triggered biological gradient field (BGF) is used for fitness evaluation of the agents, and the high-risk tissue is the search space. Considering that the state-of-the-art magnetic nanoswimmer control method can only actuate all the nanoswimmers heading in the same direction simultaneously, we introduce the orthokinetic movement strategies into the agent location updating in the existing swarm intelligence algorithms. Especially, the gravitational search algorithm (GSA) is revisited and the corresponding in vivo optimization algorithm called orthokinetic GSA (OGSA) is proposed to carry out the TST. Furthermore, to determine the direction of the orthokinetic agent movement in every iteration of the operation, we propose several strategies according to the fitness ranking of the nanoswimmers in the BGF. To verify the superiority of the OGSA and choose the optimal evolution strategy, some numerical experiments are presented and compared with that of the brute-force search, which represents the traditional method for TST. It is found that the TST performance can be improved by the weak priority evolution strategy (WP-ES) in most of the scenarios},

  abstract     = {Given a graph whose vertex set is partitioned, the partition coloring problem (PCP) requires the selection of one vertex from each partite set, such that the subgraph induced by the set of the selected vertices has the minimum chromatic number. Motivated by the routing and wavelength assignment problem for optical networks, PCP has been used to model many other real-world applications, such as dichotomy-based constraint encoding and scheduling problems. Solving PCP for large graphs is still a challenge since it is $\mathcal {NP}$ -complete. In this article, we first propose a key concept called a partition independent set (PIS) and design an efficient algorithm called FastPIS to find a maximum PIS. By applying FastPIS with a simple coloring procedure, we can obtain a high-quality initial solution for PCP. Moreover, we propose a reduction rule based on another novel concept called an $\ell $ -clustering-degree bound ordered set ( $\ell $ -CDBOS), by which the scale of the working graph can be iteratively reduced. Based on these techniques, we develop an efficient method called HotPGC for solving PCP. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on benchmark graphs, and computational results show that HotPGC achieves highly competitive performance, compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms. The influence of the proposed reduction rule on the efficiency of HotPGC is also analyzed.},

However, on the optimization of sparse learning systems, regularization and data augmentation are both powerful, but currently isolated. We believe that regularization and data augmentation can cooperate to generate a breakthrough in robust image classification. In this article, we propose a novel framework, regularization on augmented data (READ), which creates diversification in the data using the generic augmentation techniques to implement robust sparse representation-based image classification. When the training data are augmented, READ applies a distinct regularizer, $l_{1}$ or $l_{2}$ , in particular, on the augmented training data apart from the original data, so that regularization and data augmentation are utilized and enhanced synchronously. We introduce an elaborate theoretical analysis on how to optimize the sparse representation by both $l_{1}$ -norm and $l_{2}$ -norm with the generic data augmentation and demonstrate its performance in extensive experiments. The results obtained on several facial and object datasets show that READ outperforms many state-of-the-art methods when using deep features.},

Furthermore, it is adjusted to be available for the controller solution, which also solves the coupling between two kinds of disturbances. On this basis, the optimal controller is provided in a recursive way, with which the closed-loop stability and good antidisturbance ability can be guaranteed simultaneously.

In some cases, the overall convergence must be achieved through establishing a local information interaction between one agent and its neighbors via the multiagent system consistency theory and algorithms. So the goals of the multiagent consistency algorithm and the Nash equilibrium of GANs are virtually identical. Then, the existence of the Degroot model solution proves that the generator and discriminator in GANs can reach a consensus on the distribution function. Therefore, a new sufficient and necessary condition for the existence of a Nash equilibrium in GANs is obtained. Furthermore, a novel multiagent distributed GAN (MADGAN) is proposed to address the multiagent cognitive consistency problem in large-scale distributed network, based on the social group wisdom and the influence of the network structure on the agent. The nodes of a multiagent network are regarded as discriminators and generators, the discriminator with a relatively large degree of influence as a leader, and the generator as a follower, the lines with the degree denote the influence between the agents. The conditions of consensus are presented for a multigenerator and multidiscriminator (multiagent) distributed GAN by analyzing the existence of stationary distribution to the Markov chain of multiple agent states.

An iterative linear data model (iLDM) is established first to represent the nonlinear nonaffine system for subsequent control algorithm design and analysis under a data-driven framework. A quantitative data-driven adaptive ILC (QDDAILC) is then developed using quantized tracking errors based on the nonlifted iLDM and, thus, additional available input information from previous time instants can be utilized to improve control performance. The parameter estimation derived from an adaptive updating law makes the learning gain of the QDDAILC adjustable, therefore improving the robustness to uncertainties. Due to the coupled dynamics among inputs and tracking errors, a new double-dynamics analysis method is introduced besides the contraction mapping principle to show error convergence. A quantized data-driven adaptive point-to-point ILC (QDDAPTPILC) is further presented using partial quantized measurements at the specified instants for multi-intermediate-point tracking. Simulation examples verify theoretical results and illustrate that the QDDAPTPILC outperforms the QDDAILC for multi-intermediate-point tracking tasks because it removes the unnecessary constraints.},

In this article, we propose an iteration-driven in-painting approach, which combines the deep context model with the backpropagation mechanism to fine-tune the learning-based in-painting process and hence, achieves further improvement over the existing state of the arts. Our iterative approach fine tunes the image generated by a pretrained deep context model via backpropagation using a weighted context loss. Extensive experiments on public available test sets, including the CelebA, Paris Streets, and PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset, show that our proposed method achieves better visual perceptual quality in terms of hole-edge artifacts compared with the state-of-the-art in-painting methods using various context models.},

  abstract     = {3-D action recognition is referred to as the classification of action sequences which consist of 3-D skeleton joints. While many research works are devoted to 3-D action recognition, it mainly suffers from three problems: 1) highly complicated articulation; 2) a great amount of noise; and 3) low implementation efficiency. To tackle all these problems, we propose a real-time 3-D action-recognition framework by integrating the locally aggregated kinematic-guided skeletonlet (LAKS) with a supervised hashing-by-analysis (SHA) model. We first define the skeletonlet as a few combinations of joint offsets grouped in terms of the kinematic principle and then represent an action sequence using LAKS, which consists of a denoising phase and a locally aggregating phase. The denoising phase detects the noisy action data and adjusts it by replacing all the features within it with the features of the corresponding previous frame, while the locally aggregating phase sums the difference between an offset feature of the skeletonlet and its cluster center together over all the offset features of the sequence. Finally, the SHA model combines sparse representation with a hashing model, aiming at promoting the recognition accuracy while maintaining high efficiency. Experimental results on MSRAction3D , UTKinectAction3D , and Florence3DAction datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both recognition accuracy and implementation efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Modifying facial attributes without the paired dataset proves to be a challenging task. Previously, approaches either required supervision from a ground-truth transformed image or required training a separate model for mapping every pair of attributes. These limit the scalability of the models to accommodate a larger set of attributes since the number of models that we need to train grows exponentially large. Another major drawback of the previous approaches is the unintentional gain of the identity of the person as they transform the facial attributes. We propose a method that allows for controllable and identity-aware transformations across multiple facial attributes using only a single model. Our approach is to train a generative adversarial network (GAN) with a multitask conditional discriminator that recognizes the identity of the face, distinguishes real images from fake, as well as identifies facial attributes present in an image. This guides the generator into producing an output that is realistic while preserving the person’s identity and facial attributes. Through this framework, our model also learns meaningful image representations in a lower dimensional latent space and semantically associate separate parts of the encoded vector with both the person’s identity and facial attributes. This opens up the possibility of generating new faces and other transformations such as making the face thinner or chubbier. Furthermore, our model only encodes the image once and allows for multiple transformations using the encoded vector. This allows for faster transformations since it does not need to reprocess the entire image for every transformation. We show the effectiveness of our proposed method through both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, such as ablative studies, visual inspection, and face verification. Competitive results are achieved compared to the main competition (CycleGAN), however, at great space and extensibility gain by using a single model.},

Instead of adopting a game-theoretic setting, we investigate an online quadratic optimization problem driven by system noises with unknown statistics. Due to information asymmetry, it is infeasible to use the classic Kalman filter nor optimal control strategies for such systems. It is necessary and beneficial to develop an admissible approach that learns the probability statistics as time goes forward. Motivated by the online convex optimization (OCO) theory, we introduce the notion of regret, which is defined as the cumulative performance loss difference between the optimal offline-known statistics cost and the optimal online-unknown statistics cost. By utilizing dynamic programming and linear minimum mean square biased estimate (LMMSUE), we propose a new type of online state-feedback control policy and characterize the behavior of regret in a finite-time regime. The regret is shown to be sublinear and bounded by $O(\ln T)$ . Moreover, we address an online optimization problem with output-feedback control policy and propose a heuristic online control policy.},

To keep this balance, we propose a constraint handling technique, called the $\upsilon $ -level penalty function, which works by transforming a COP into an unconstrained one. Also, to improve the ability of the algorithm in handling several complex constraints, especially nonlinear inequality and equality constraints, we suggest a Broyden-based mutation that finds a feasible solution to replace an infeasible solution. By incorporating these techniques with the matrix adaptation evolution strategy (MA-ES), we develop a new constrained optimization algorithm.

A retinal ganglion cell (GC) receives excitatory inputs from neurons in previous layers as driving forces to fire spikes. Analytical methods are required to decipher these components in a systematic manner. Recently a method called spike-triggered non-negative matrix factorization (STNMF) has been proposed for this purpose. In this study, we extend the scope of the STNMF method. By using retinal GCs as a model system, we show that STNMF can detect various computational properties of upstream bipolar cells (BCs), including spatial receptive field, temporal filter, and transfer nonlinearity. In addition, we recover synaptic connection strengths from the weight matrix of STNMF. Furthermore, we show that STNMF can separate spikes of a GC into a few subsets of spikes, where each subset is contributed by one presynaptic BC. Taken together, these results corroborate that STNMF is a useful method for deciphering the structure of neuronal circuits.},

In this article, we propose applying a multitask learning loss function to share a common feature representation with other related tasks.

The proposed loss function addresses the problem of learning multiple tasks with heterogeneously labeled data, improving previous multitask approaches.

  abstract     = {A key energy consumption in steel metallurgy comes from an iron ore sintering process. Enhancing carbon utilization in this process is important for green manufacturing and energy saving and its prerequisite is a time-series prediction of carbon efficiency. The existing carbon efficiency models usually have a complex structure, leading to a time-consuming training process. In addition, a complete retraining process will be encountered if the models are inaccurate or data change. Analyzing the complex characteristics of the sintering process, we develop an original prediction framework, that is, a weighted kernel-based fuzzy C-means (WKFCM)-based broad learning model (BLM), to achieve fast and effective carbon efficiency modeling. First, sintering parameters affecting carbon efficiency are determined, following the sintering process mechanism. Next, WKFCM clustering is first presented for the identification of multiple operating conditions to better reflect the system dynamics of this process. Then, the BLM is built under each operating condition. Finally, a nearest neighbor criterion is used to determine which BLM is invoked for the time-series prediction of carbon efficiency. Experimental results using actual run data exhibit that, compared with other prediction models, the developed model can more accurately and efficiently achieve the time-series prediction of carbon efficiency. Furthermore, the developed model can also be used for the efficient and effective modeling of other industrial processes due to its flexible structure.},

  abstract     = {Schizophrenia seriously affects the quality of life. To date, both simple (e.g., linear discriminant analysis) and complex (e.g., deep neural network) machine-learning methods have been utilized to identify schizophrenia based on functional connectivity features. The existing simple methods need two separate steps (i.e., feature extraction and classification) to achieve the identification, which disables simultaneous tuning for the best feature extraction and classifier training. The complex methods integrate two steps and can be simultaneously tuned to achieve optimal performance, but these methods require a much larger amount of data for model training. To overcome the aforementioned drawbacks, we proposed a multikernel capsule network (MKCapsnet), which was developed by considering the brain anatomical structure. Kernels were set to match partition sizes of the brain anatomical structure in order to capture interregional connectivities at the varying scales. With the inspiration of the widely used dropout strategy in deep learning, we developed capsule dropout in the capsule layer to prevent overfitting of the model. The comparison results showed that the proposed method outperformed the state-of-the-art methods. Besides, we compared performances using different parameters and illustrated the routing process to reveal characteristics of the proposed method. MKCapsnet is promising for schizophrenia identification. Our study first utilized the capsule neural network for analyzing functional connectivity of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and proposed a novel multikernel capsule structure with the consideration of brain anatomical parcellation, which could be a new way to reveal brain mechanisms. In addition, we provided useful information in the parameter setting, which is informative for further studies using a capsule network for other neurophysiological signal classification.},

In this article, the difference-guided representation learning network (DGRL-Net) is proposed to guide the representation learning of time series by dynamic evolution information. The DGRL-Net consists of a difference-guided layer and a multiscale convolutional layer. First, in the difference-guided layer, we propose a difference gating LSTM to model the time dependency and dynamic evolution of the time series to obtain feature representations of both raw and difference series. Then, these two representations are used as two input channels of the multiscale convolutional layer to extract multiscale information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods on 18 MTS benchmark datasets and achieves competitive results on two skeleton-based action recognition datasets.

By using Sturm’s theorem, together with the geometrical properties of the network equation, we give a complete analysis of equilibria, including the existence, number, and dynamical properties.

  abstract     = {Surface mount technology (SMT) is a process for producing printed-circuit boards. The solder paste printer (SPP), package mounter, and solder reflow oven are used for SMT. The board on which the solder paste is deposited from the SPP is monitored by the solder paste inspector (SPI). If SPP malfunctions due to the printer defects, the SPP produces defective products, and then abnormal patterns are detected by SPI. In this article, we propose a convolutional recurrent reconstructive network (CRRN), which decomposes the anomaly patterns generated by the printer defects, from SPI data. CRRN learns only normal data and detects the anomaly pattern through the reconstruction error. CRRN consists of a spatial encoder (S-Encoder), a spatiotemporal encoder and decoder (ST-Encoder-Decoder), and a spatial decoder (S-Decoder). The ST-Encoder-Decoder consists of multiple convolutional spatiotemporal memories (CSTMs) with a spatiotemporal attention (ST-Attention) mechanism. CSTM is developed to extract spatiotemporal patterns efficiently. In addition, an ST-Attention mechanism is designed to facilitate transmitting information from the spatiotemporal encoder to the spatiotemporal decoder, which can solve the long-term dependency problem. We demonstrate that the proposed CRRN outperforms the other conventional models in anomaly detection. Moreover, we show the discriminative power of the anomaly map decomposed by the proposed CRRN through the printer defect classification.},

  abstract     = {Recently, crowd counting draws much attention on account of its significant meaning in congestion control, public safety, and ecological surveys. Although the performance is improved dramatically due to the development of deep learning, the scales of these networks also become larger and more complex. Moreover, a large model also entails more time to train for better performance. To tackle these problems, this article first constructs a lightweight model, which is composed of an image feature encoder and a simple but effective decoder, called the pixel shuffle decoder (PSD). PSD ends with a pixel shuffle operator, which can display more density information without increasing the number of convolutional layers. Second, a density-aware curriculum learning (DCL) training strategy is designed to fully tap the potential of crowd counting models. DCL gives each predicted pixel a weight to determine its predicting difficulty and provides guidance on obtaining better generalization. Experimental results exhibit that PSD can achieve outstanding performance on most mainstream datasets while training under the DCL training framework. Besides, we also conduct some experiments about adopting DCL on existing typical crowd counters, and the results show that they all obtain new better performance than before, which further validates the effectiveness of our method.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we present a semantic semisupervised learning (Semantic SSL) approach targeted at unifying two machine-learning paradigms in a mutually beneficial way, where the classical support vector machine (SVM) learns to reveal primitive logic facts from data, while axiomatic fuzzy set (AFS) theory is utilized to exploit semantic knowledge and correct the wrongly perceived facts for improving the machine-learning model. This novel semisupervised method can easily produce interpretable semantic descriptions to outline different categories by forming a fuzzy set with semantic explanations realized on the basis of the AFS theory. Besides, it is known that disagreement-based semisupervised learning (SSL) can be viewed as an excellent schema so that a co-training approach with SVM and the AFS theory can be utilized to improve the resulting learning performance. Furthermore, an evaluation index is used to prune descriptions to deliver promising performance. Compared with other semisupervised approaches, the proposed approach can build a structure to reflect data-distributed information with unlabeled data and labeled data, so that the hidden information embedded in both labeled and unlabeled data can be sufficiently utilized and can potentially be applied to achieve good descriptions of each category. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach can offer a concise, comprehensible, and precise SSL frame, which strikes a balance between the interpretability and the accuracy.},

  abstract     = {For the target-tracking problem, full state of the target may not be available since it may be expensive or impossible to obtain. Thus, the state needs to be reconstructed or estimated only according to measured inputs and outputs. The impossible case that all followers can measure the target directly yields the study of distributed methods, thus reducing the communication and computation resource while resulting in more robustness. This article confronts these problems by addressing a distributed iterative finite impulse response (DIFIR) consensus filter for leader-following systems. A solution to the underlying problem is obtained by involving a distributed measurement model wherein not only the neighbors’ estimates are applied but also the directed measurement data are used, and expressed by a computationally efficient iterative algorithm. Applying this DIFIR strategy, it is shown that the leader’s estimates by all followers reach $H_{\infty }$ consensus, whose value is the local unbiased estimates of the leader. Then, the result is extended to multiagent systems whose leader has unknown inputs. Incorporating the input estimates, a new DIFIR is proposed. Finally, examples are given to illustrate the consistency and robustness of the developed new design techniques.},

  abstract     = {Existing domain adaptation (DA) methods generally assume that different domains have identical label space, and the training data are only sampled from a single domain. This unrealistic assumption is quite restricted for real-world applications, since it neglects the more practical scenario, where the source domain can contain the categories that are not shared by the target domain, and the training data can be collected from multiple modalities. In this article, we address a more difficult but practical problem, which recognizes RGB images through training on RGB-D data under the label space inequality scenario. There are three challenges in this task: 1) source and target domains are affected by the domain mismatch issue, which results in that the trained models perform imperfectly on the test data; 2) depth images are absent in the target domain (e.g., target images are captured by smartphones), when the source domain contains both the RGB and depth data. It makes the ordinary visual recognition approaches hardly applied to this task; and 3) in the real world, the source and target domains always have different numbers of categories, which would result in a negative transfer bottleneck being more prominent. Toward tackling the above challenges, we formulate a deep model, called visual-depth matching network (VDMN), where two new modules and a matching component can be trained in an end-to-end fashion jointly to identify the common and outlier categories effectively. The significance of VDMN is that it can take advantage of depth information and handle the domain distribution mismatch under label inequality simultaneously. The experimental results reveal that VDMN exceeds the state-of-the-art performance on various DA datasets, especially under the label inequality scenario.},

When dynamic leaders are involved, the information transfer between neighboring followers is bidirectional, for which a novel distributed estimator is developed. For the leaderless synchronization control scenario, the communication network among agents is unidirectional . Three fixed-time distributed control schemes are designed for the aforementioned three cases by applying the fixed-time stability theory. The convergence of the coordination control objectives can be achieved in a fixed time that does not depend on any initial conditions of agents’ states, and the settling times are also explicitly derived.

Many extant multilabel feature selection methods target global feature selection, which means feature selection weights for each label are shared by all instances. Also, many extant multilabel classification methods exploit global label selection, which means labels correlations are shared by all instances. In real-world objects, however, different subsets of instances may share different feature selection weights and different label correlations. In this article, we propose a novel framework with local feature selection and local label correlation, where we assume instances can be clustered into different groups, and the feature selection weights and label correlations can only be shared by instances in the same group. The proposed framework includes a group-specific feature selection process and a label-specific group selection process. The former process projects instances into different groups by extracting the instance-group correlation. The latter process selects labels for each instance based on its related groups by extracting the group-label correlation. In addition, we also exploit the intergroup correlation. These three kinds of group-based correlations are combined to perform effective multilabel classification. The experimental results on various datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach.},

Combining the free-weighting method and the proposed recursive method, a sufficient condition on singular stochastic extended dissipative finite-time boundedness (SSEDFTB) for a fuzzy filtering error system is obtained. By proposing a decoupling principle called double variables-based decoupling principle (DVDP) and a variable substitution principle (VSP), a novel condition on the existence of the fuzzy filter is presented in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Compared with the existing works, the assumption on state variables and the constraints of slack matrices are overcome, which leads to more practical and less conservative results.

  abstract     = {Visual question answering (VQA) has gained increasing attention in both natural language processing and computer vision. The attention mechanism plays a crucial role in relating the question to meaningful image regions for answer inference. However, most existing VQA methods: 1) learn the attention distribution either from free-form regions or detection boxes in the image, which is intractable in answering questions about the foreground object and background form, respectively and 2) neglect the prior knowledge of human attention and learn the attention distribution with an unguided strategy. To fully exploit the advantages of attention, the learned attention distribution should focus more on the question-related image regions, such as human attention for both the questions, about the foreground object and background form. To achieve this, this article proposes a novel VQA model, called adversarial learning of supervised attentions (ALSAs). Specifically, two supervised attention modules: 1) free form-based and 2) detection-based, are designed to exploit the prior knowledge for attention distribution learning. To effectively learn the correlations between the question and image from different views, that is, free-form regions and detection boxes, an adversarial learning mechanism is implemented as an interplay between two supervised attention modules. The adversarial learning reinforces the two attention modules mutually to make the learned multiview features more effective for answer inference. The experiments performed on three commonly used VQA datasets confirm the favorable performance of ALSA.},

  abstract     = {This article introduces a new model to identify a group of trajectory outliers from a large trajectory database and proposes several algorithms. These can be split into three categories: 1) algorithms based on data mining and knowledge discovery, which study the different correlations among the trajectory data and identify the group of abnormal trajectories from the knowledge extracted; 2) algorithms based on machine learning and computational intelligence methods, which use the ensemble learning and metaheuristics to find the group of trajectory outliers; and 3) an algorithm exploring the convolution deep neural network that learns the different features of historical data to determine the group of trajectory outliers. Experiments on different trajectory databases have been carried out to investigate the proposed algorithms. The results show that the deep learning solution outperforms data mining, machine learning, and computational intelligence solutions, as well as state-of-the-art solutions in terms of runtime and accuracy performance.},

  abstract     = {While nonlinear oscillators have been widely used for central pattern generators to produce basic rhythmic signals for robot locomotion control, methods to shape and regulate the signal waveform without changing the characteristics of the oscillators have not been fully investigated, especially during the network synchronization process. To illustrate the principle and process of waveform regulation of nonlinear oscillators in detail and ensure that the influence can be controlled, we present a method for waveform regulation and synchronization and analyze the relationship of different factors (e.g., initial conditions, network parameters, phase, and waveform regulation factors) in synchronization deviation. Then, the method is indicated to be effective in other commonly used nonlinear oscillators and neural oscillators. As an example application, a three-layer behavioral control architecture for a legged robot is constructed based on the proposed method. Modules for the body behavior, leg coordination, and single-leg adjustment are established to realize diverse robot behaviors. The effectiveness of the method is validated by a series of experiments. The results prove that the method performs well in terms of signal control accuracy, behavior pattern diversity, and smooth motion transition.},

  abstract     = {These days, social media users tend to express their feelings through sharing images online. Capturing the emotions embedded in these social images involves great research challenges and practical values. Most existing works concentrate on extracting the visual feature from a global view, while ignoring the fact that visual objects are also rich in emotion. How to leverage the multilevel visual features to improve the sentiment analysis performance is important yet challenging. Besides, existing works view each social image as an independent sample while ignoring the rich correlations among social images, which may be helpful in detecting visual emotion. In this article, we propose a novel model called social relations-guided multiattention networks (SRGMANs) to incorporate both the multilevel (region-level and object-level) visual features of a single image and the correlations among multiple social images to conduct visual sentiment analysis. Specifically, we first construct a heterogeneous network consisting of various types of social relations and introduce a heterogeneous network embedding method to learn the network representation for each image. Then, two visual attention branches (region attention network and object attention network) are devised to extract emotional and discriminative visual features. For each branch, we design a self-attention module to capture the emotional dependencies among visual parts. Besides, a network-guided attention module is also designed in each branch to focus on more network-related emotional visual parts with the guidance of the topology information. Finally, the attended visual features from the two attention models, together with network representation features, are combined within a holistic framework to predict the sentiment of social images. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our model on three benchmark datasets.},

  abstract     = {Multi-label learning deals with training examples each represented by a single instance while associated with multiple class labels. Due to the exponential number of possible label sets to be considered by the predictive model, it is commonly assumed that label correlations should be well exploited to design an effective multi-label learning approach. On the other hand, class-imbalance stands as an intrinsic property of multi-label data which significantly affects the generalization performance of the multi-label predictive model. For each class label, the number of training examples with positive labeling assignment is generally much less than those with negative labeling assignment. To deal with the class-imbalance issue for multi-label learning, a simple yet effective class-imbalance aware learning strategy called cross-coupling aggregation (COCOA) is proposed in this article. Specifically, COCOA works by leveraging the exploitation of label correlations as well as the exploration of class-imbalance simultaneously. For each class label, a number of multiclass imbalance learners are induced by randomly coupling with other labels, whose predictions on the unseen instance are aggregated to determine the corresponding labeling relevancy. Extensive experiments on 18 benchmark datasets clearly validate the effectiveness of COCOA against state-of-the-art multi-label learning approaches especially in terms of imbalance-specific evaluation metrics.},

A new robust initialization-free algorithm is proposed for the distributed optimization problem of multiple Euler–Lagrange systems, and the explicit relationship of the feedback gain of the algorithm, the communication topology, the properties of the cost function, and the radius of the channel uncertainties is established in order to reach the optimal solution. This result provides a sufficient condition for the selection of the feedback gain when the uncertainty size is less than the unity.

Thus, the proposed method can make the system states follow nondifferentiable reference signals, which removes the common assumption that the reference signals have to be continuous for tracking control of continuous-time nonlinear systems in the literature.

Then, sufficient conditions are presented to realize synchronization of a complex network (with a target system) within a settling time via three different kinds of simple controllers. In general, controllers designed to achieve fixed-time stability consist of three terms and are discontinuous. However, in our mechanisms, the controllers only contain two terms or even one term and are continuous. Thus, our controllers are simpler and of more practical applicability.

Online learning can handle this task by learning a classifier incrementally from a stream of samples. In this article, we propose an online semisupervised active learning framework for multiview PolSAR data classification, called OSAM. First, a novel online active learning strategy is designed based on the relationships among multiple views and a randomized rule, which allows to only query the labels of some informative incoming samples. Then, in order to utilize both the incoming labeled and unlabeled samples to update the classifiers, a novel online semisupervised learning model is proposed based on co-regularized multiview learning and graph regularization. In addition, the proposed method can deal with the dynamic large-scale multifeature or multifrequency PolSAR data where not only the amount of data but also the number of classes gradually increases in the learning process. Moreover, the mistake bound of the proposed method is derived rigorously. Extensive experiments are conducted on real PolSAR data to evaluate the performance of our algorithm, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

In this article, based on an analysis of the difference between updating mechanisms that include both all-variable and one-variable updating mechanisms, we find that when equipped with the former strategy, the algorithm rapidly converges to an optimal region, while with the latter strategy, it searches the solution space thoroughly. To utilize multivariable and one-variable updating mechanisms on nonseparable and separable functions, respectively, we embed an improved linkage identification strategy into the ABC by detecting the linkage between variables more effectively. Then, we propose three common strategies for ABC to improve its performance. First, a new approach that considers the historic experiences of the population is proposed to balance exploration and exploitation. Second, a new strategy for initializing scout bees is used to reduce the number of function evaluations. Finally, the individual with the worst performance is updated with a defined probability on multiple dimensions instead of one dimension, causing it to follow the population steps on nonseparable functions. This article is the first to propose all these concepts, which could be adopted for other ABC variants. The effectiveness of our algorithm is validated through basic, CEC2010, CEC2013, and CEC2014 functions and real-world problems.},

In this article, a novel probabilistic LS-SVM is proposed to enhance the modeling reliability even data contaminated by the non-Gaussian noise. The stochastic effect of noise on the kernel function and the regularization parameter is first analyzed and estimated. On the basis of this, a new objective function is constructed under a probabilistic sense. A probabilistic inference method is then developed to construct the distribution of the model parameter, including distribution estimation of both the kernel function and the regularization parameter from data. Using this distribution information, a solving strategy is then developed for this new objective function. Different from the original LS-SVM that uses a deterministic scenario approach to gain the model, the proposed method builds the distribution relation between the model and noise and makes use of this distribution information in the process of modeling; thus, it is more robust for modeling of noise data.

The purpose of ETM is used to reduce the computational and communication burdens. For guaranteeing controller robustness, the practical stability of T–S fuzzy systems is considered by using the Lyapunov method and linear matrix inequality (LMI) technique. As one of the most powerful inequalities for deriving stability criteria using LMIs, Jensen’s inequality has recently been improved by various authors for the stability analysis of delayed systems. However, these results are conservative to obtain lower bounds for integrals with an exponential term. Inspired by this, improved integral inequalities are derived in this work, and they are applied to obtain practical stability criteria for aperiodically sampled control. Finally, a numerical example on flight control of a helicopter is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the obtained practical stability criteria. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the improved Jensen inequalities on the exponential stability criteria is illustrated by numerical comparisons.},

As the first step, we design an event-triggering consensus protocol in the ideal/nominal case when the interconnected systems are not affected by uncertainties and the interactions happen over a fixed interaction network. Next, the results are extended in order to take into account structured uncertainties affecting the systems’ dynamics.

Toward this end, a resilient adaptive neural control scheme is newly proposed based on a new design of the Lyapunov function candidates, a projection-associated tuning functions method, and an alternative class of smooth functions. It is proved that the system stability is guaranteed for the case of an infinite number of failures and when the number of failures is finite, asymptotic tracking performance can be automatically recovered, and besides, an explicit bound for the tracking error in terms of $L_{2}$ norm is established.

First, a descriptor state observer with a low-pass filtering characteristic being developed for each agent using output information. The convergence regions of estimation errors can be reduced by a nonsingular suppression matrix. Leader–follower event-triggered consensus protocols with continuous-time communication are designed for multiagent systems based on the estimated states. By virtue of the Jordan form of the Laplacian matrix, the stability conditions are derived by using the Lyapunov analysis. Then, new self-triggered consensus protocols are designed for the multiagent systems to remove the requirement of the continuous monitoring triggering condition and continuous communication simultaneously. The triggering interval is proved greater than 0, and the Zeno behavior is excluded for all agents. Finally, numerical simulations are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design.},

  abstract     = {Active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) is an efficient control technique to accommodate both internal uncertainties and external disturbances. In the typical ADRC framework, however, the design philosophy is to “force” the system dynamics into a double-integral form by an extended state observer (ESO) and then the controller is designed. Especially, the systems’ physical structure has been neglected in such a design paradigm. In this article, a new ADRC framework is proposed by incorporating at a fundamental level the physical structure of the Euler–Lagrange (EL) systems. In particular, the differential feedback gain can be selected considerably small or even 0, due to the effective exploitation of the system’s internal damping. The design principle stems from an analysis of the energy balance of EL systems, yielding a physically interpretable design. Moreover, the exploitation of the system’s internal damping is thoroughly discussed, which is of practical significance for applications of the proposed design. Besides, a sliding-mode ESO is designed to improve the estimation performance over traditional linear ESO. Finally, the proposed control framework is illustrated through tracking control of an omnidirectional mobile robot. Extensive experimental tests are conducted to verify the proposed design as well as the discussions.},

Most of the existing distributed controllers are invalid during the attack interval due to the paralyzed communication channels. In order to overcome this difficulty, a novel hybrid distributed control protocol is designed. Here, the controller uses the latest information saved in the buffers in the presence of malicious attacks, which will further enhance the security of MASs. Some sufficient conditions on the coupled strength and attack parameters are derived to achieve the leader-following consensus of MASs. Furthermore, we estimate the upper bounds of denial-of-service (DoS) frequency and DoS duration which the MASs can tolerate before losing consensus. Notice that we also reduce the computational complexity via the property of the Kronecker product. Besides, an observer-based model is proposed and the corresponding consensus criterion is established to reduce the effects of attackers on the controller.

Not resembling several earlier works, a more extensive range of impulses in the context of impulsive effects has been analyzed without using the known average impulsive interval strategy (AIIS). In light of the theories of differential inclusions and set-valued map, as well as impulsive control, new sufficient criteria with respect to the estimated settling time for synchronization of the related IMNNs are established using two types of switching control approaches, which sufficiently utilize information from not only the SIs, DIs, and DAFs but also the impulse sequences.

Various diagnosis models, such as Bayesian networks (BNs), have been proposed to deal with this kind of problem in the past.

This article proposes a hierarchical system diagnosis fusion framework that considers the uncertainty based on a belief model, called subjective logic (SL), which explicitly deals with uncertainty representing a lack of evidence. The proposed system diagnosis fusion framework consists of three steps: 1) individual subjective BNs (SBNs) are designed to represent the knowledge architectures of individual experts; 2) experts are clustered as expert groups according to their similarity; and 3) after inferring expert opinions from respective SBNs, the one opinion fusion method was used to combine all opinions to reach a consensus based on the aggregated opinion for system diagnosis. Via extensive simulation experiments, we show that the proposed fusion framework, consisting of two operators, outperforms the state-of-the-art fusion operator counterparts and has stable performance under various scenarios. Our proposed fusion framework is promising for advancing state-of-the-art fault diagnosis of complex engineered systems.},

In order to establish the FTS criteria of the zero solution for DI, the generalized Lyapunov function (LF) method is developed. The generalized LF of this article is relaxed to have an indefinite derivative for almost everywhere along the state trajectories of the system. However, the traditional LF is required to possess negative definite or semi-negative definite derivative for everywhere. As a result, several novel sufficient conditions for FTS are given. Moreover, the settling time of FTS is provided. Then, the theoretical results are applied to solve the fixed-time stabilization control problems of ball motion model and neural networks (NNs) with discontinuities.

  abstract     = {Multiview clustering (MVC) has recently been the focus of much attention due to its ability to partition data from multiple views via view correlations. However, most MVC methods only learn either interfeature correlations or intercluster correlations, which may lead to unsatisfactory clustering performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel dual-correlated multivariate information bottleneck (DMIB) method for MVC. DMIB is able to explore both interfeature correlations (the relationship among multiple distinct feature representations from different views) and intercluster correlations (the close agreement among clustering results obtained from individual views). For the former, we integrate both view-shared feature correlations discovered by learning a shared discriminative feature subspace and view-specific feature information to fully explore the interfeature correlation. This allows us to attain multiple reliable local clustering results of different views. Following this, we explore the intercluster correlations by learning the shared mutual information over different local clusterings for an improved global partition. By integrating both correlations, we formulate the problem as a unified information maximization function and further design a two-step method for optimization. Moreover, we theoretically prove the convergence of the proposed algorithm, and discuss the relationships between our method and several existing clustering paradigms. The experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate the superiority of DMIB compared to several state-of-the-art clustering methods.},

First, the existence of shared variables makes the problem hard to be decomposed. Second, existing cooperative co-evolutionary frameworks usually cannot maintain the two crucial factors: high cooperation frequency and effective computing resource allocation, simultaneously when optimizing the overlapping subcomponents. Aiming at these two issues, this article proposes a new contribution-based cooperative co-evolutionary algorithm to decompose and optimize nonseparable large-scale problems with overlapping subcomponents effectively and efficiently: 1) a contribution-based decomposition method is proposed to assign the shared variables. Among all the subcomponents containing a shared variable, the one that contributes the most to the entire problem will include the shared variable and 2) to achieve the two crucial factors at the same time, a new contribution-based optimization framework is designed to award the important subcomponents based on the round-robin structure. Experimental studies show that the proposed algorithm performs significantly better than the state-of-the-art algorithms due to the effective grouping structure generated by the proposed decomposition method and the fast optimizing speed provided by the new optimization framework.},

Similar to their more traditional statistical peers, these classifiers, however, have remained largely data driven, not leveraging human knowledge to their advantage. This is while human expert opinion and intuition should be a unique vantage point for such systems. We introduce here, for the first time, a human-centered framework (FLeAC) for FACs based on extended fuzzy logic and ${f}$ -transformation that uses experts’ opinions and preferences along with statistical data to solve subjective real-world problems. In FLeAC, experts take part in both constructing and reasoning of the classifier by assigning linguistic validity to each item. These validities are then aggregated using collective intelligence that determines final item validity. To examine the proposed framework, we extend an efficient and well-known FAC, CFAR, and present an extended ${f}$ -CFAR algorithm. Also, several variations of ${f}$ -CFAR are implemented to examine the effect of rule validity and different ${f}$ -transformation operators. We then run various nonparametric statistical tests, including Friedman, Nemenyi posthoc, and ROC tests on an actual medical dataset of burn patients from Ahwaz, Iran, to compare ${f}$ -CFAR performance with those of the original and nine other rule-based classifiers. Statistical analysis shows that ${f}$ -CFAR not only has a better overall diagnostic performance than CFAR but also it outperforms CFAR and the other rule-based classifiers in terms of the number of rules, the number of conditions, and the execution time, leading to a more compact and comprehensible classifier with comparable accuracy.},

Leveraging $\ell _{2,1}$ -norm regularization for feature selection is the major strategy in existing methods, which, however, confronts sparsity limitation and parameter-tuning trouble. To circumvent this problem, employing the $\ell _{2,0}$ -norm constraint to improve the sparsity of the model has gained more attention recently whereas, optimizing the subspace sparsity constraint is still an unsolved problem, which only can acquire an approximate solution and without convergence proof. To address the above challenges, we innovatively propose a novel subspace sparsity discriminative feature selection (S 2 DFS) method which leverages a subspace sparsity constraint to avoid tuning parameters. In addition, the trace ratio formulated objective function extremely ensures the discriminability of selected features. Most important, an efficient iterative optimization algorithm is presented to explicitly solve the proposed problem with a closed-form solution and strict convergence proof. To the best of our knowledge, such an optimization algorithm of solving the subspace sparsity issue is first proposed in this article, and a general formulation of the optimization algorithm is provided for improving the extensibility and portability of our method. Extensive experiments conducted on several high-dimensional text and image datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms related state-of-the-art methods in pattern classification and image retrieval tasks.},

In addition, state delay is also a general factor that affects system performance. After analyzing the stability of the system, based on convex linearization and the projection theorem, this article proposes a delay-dependent output-feedback controller design method. The IT2 membership functions (MFs) of the fuzzy controller are chosen to be different from those of the model so as to increase the freedom of controller selection.

  abstract     = {Optimization techniques are widely being used to solve large and complex economical load dispatch (ELD) and combined emission economical dispatch (CEED) problems in power systems. These techniques can solve these problems in a short computational time. In this article, a new human intelligence-based metaheuristic optimization technique, that is, aggrandized class topper optimization (CTO), is proposed to solve ELD and CEED problems. This proposed algorithm is an upgraded form of classical CTO in which the concept of remedial classes is incorporated to enhance the learning ability of weak students of a class. To validate the exploration, exploitation, convergence, and local minima avoidance capabilities of the proposed algorithm, 29 benchmark functions are considered. Furthermore, seven different test cases for the ELD problem and four test cases for a CEED problem are considered to test the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm to solve these complex problems. The result analysis proves that the proposed algorithm provides better and effective results in almost each test case.},

  abstract     = {In an era of ubiquitous large-scale evolving data streams, data stream clustering (DSC) has received lots of attention because the scale of the data streams far exceeds the ability of expert human analysts. It has been observed that high-dimensional data are usually distributed in a union of low-dimensional subspaces. In this article, we propose a novel sparse representation-based DSC algorithm, called evolutionary dynamic sparse subspace clustering (EDSSC). It can cope with the time-varying nature of subspaces underlying the evolving data streams, such as subspace emergence, disappearance, and recurrence. The proposed EDSSC consists of two phases: 1) static learning and 2) online clustering. During the first phase, a data structure for storing the statistic summary of data streams, called EDSSC summary, is proposed which can better address the dilemma between the two conflicting goals: 1) saving more points for accuracy of subspace clustering (SC) and 2) discarding more points for the efficiency of DSC. By further proposing an algorithm to estimate the subspace number, the proposed EDSSC does not need to know the number of subspaces. In the second phase, a more suitable index, called the average sparsity concentration index (ASCI), is proposed, which dramatically promotes the clustering accuracy compared to the conventionally utilized SCI index. In addition, the subspace evolution detection model based on the Page-Hinkley test is proposed where the appearing, disappearing, and recurring subspaces can be detected and adapted. Extinct experiments on real-world data streams show that the EDSSC outperforms the state-of-the-art online SC approaches.},

However, for a fast batch process with strong nonlinear dynamics, the application of the ILMPC is challenging due to the difficulty in balancing the computational efficiency and tracking accuracy. In this article, an efficient iterative learning predictive functional control (ILPFC) is proposed. The original nonlinear system is linearized along the reference trajectory to derive a 2-D tracking-error predictive model. The linearization error is compensated by utilizing the Lipschitz condition so that the objective function can be formulated with the upper bound of the actual tracking error. For enhancing control efficiency, predictive functional control (PFC) is applied in the time domain, which reduces the dimension of the decision variable in order to effectively cut down the computational burden. The stability and convergence of this ILPFC with terminal constraint are analyzed theoretically. Simulations on an unmanned ground vehicle and a typical fast batch reactor verify the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm.},

An iterative method is presented to transform the multirate system into a single-rate one, thereby facilitating the system analysis. The R-R protocol is introduced to determine the transmission sequence of sensors with the aim to alleviate undesirable data collisions. Under the R-R protocol scheduling, only one sensor can get access to transmit its measurement at each sampling time instant. The main purpose of this article is to develop a recursive state estimation scheme such that an upper bound on the estimation error covariance is guaranteed and then locally minimized through adequately designing the estimator parameter.

Given a collection of information granules (referred to as reference information granules), the essence of the granulation process (encoding) is to represent each data (either numeric or granular) in terms of these reference information granules. The degranulation process (decoding) that realizes the reconstruction of original data is associated with a certain level of reconstruction error. An important issue is how to reduce the reconstruction error such that the data could be reconstructed more accurately. In this study, the granulation process is realized by involving fuzzy clustering. A novel neural network is leveraged in the consecutive degranulation process, which could help significantly reduce the reconstruction error. We show that the proposed degranulation architecture exhibits improved capabilities in reconstructing original data in comparison with other methods. A series of experiments with the use of synthetic data and publicly available datasets coming from the machine-learning repository demonstrates the superiority of the proposed method over some existing alternatives.},

Base on this concept, we propose a novel MTL model for multivariate chaotic time-series prediction, which could learn both dynamic-shared and dynamic-specific patterns. We implement the dynamic analysis of multiple time series through a special network structure design. The model could disentangle the complex relationships among multivariate chaotic time series and derive the common evolutionary trend of the multivariate chaotic dynamical system by inductive bias. We also develop an efficient Crank—Nicolson-like curvilinear update algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for the nonconvex nonsmooth Stiefel optimization problem.

The semiglobally uniform ultimate boundness (SGUUB) of the closed-loop system is proved via Lyapunov’s stability.

Using a fixed regularization in some cases, the classification accuracy of the BLS decreases dramatically when we expand the network. To alleviate this problem, we propose a method that automatically finds appropriate regularization parameters for different datasets, which is based on the weighted generalized cross-validation (WGCV).

  abstract     = {Network controllability measures how well a networked system can be controlled to a target state, and its robustness reflects how well the system can maintain the controllability against malicious attacks by means of node removals or edge removals. The measure of network controllability is quantified by the number of external control inputs needed to recover or to retain the controllability after the occurrence of an unexpected attack. The measure of the network controllability robustness, on the other hand, is quantified by a sequence of values that record the remaining controllability of the network after a sequence of attacks. Traditionally, the controllability robustness is determined by attack simulations, which is computationally time consuming. In this article, a method to predict the controllability robustness based on machine learning using a convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed, motivated by the observations that: 1) there is no clear correlation between the topological features and the controllability robustness of a general network; 2) the adjacency matrix of a network can be regarded as a grayscale image; and 3) the CNN technique has proved successful in image processing without human intervention. Under the new framework, a fairly large number of training data generated by simulations are used to train a CNN for predicting the controllability robustness according to the input network-adjacency matrices, without performing conventional attack simulations. Extensive experimental studies were carried out, which demonstrate that the proposed framework for predicting controllability robustness of different network configurations is accurate and reliable with very low overheads.},

Two novel event-triggered control schemes are proposed. In the first strategy, an event-triggering condition, designed based on the state error between the actual system state and the optimal one, with an absolute threshold is considered. In the second strategy, an event-triggering condition with a mixed threshold is designed to further save the computational resources. The minimal interevent times of both event-triggered control schemes are obtained to avoid the Zeno behavior. Sufficient conditions of recursive feasibility for these two triggering strategies, which refer to the prediction horizon, the triggering level, and the disturbance bound, are obtained, respectively. Input-to-state practical stability (ISpS) of both event-triggered control systems is established without requiring the system state entering the terminal set in finite time, respectively. Finally, the numerical simulation shows the effectiveness of the proposed methods.},

  abstract     = {In current studies of safety assessment for complex systems with the evidential reasoning (ER) rule, the evidence reliability is generally given by experts, which makes the observation data by sensors ignored. However, sensors are inevitably affected by such various uncertainties as perturbations in engineering practice, which can reduce their quality and tracking ability. As such, the observation data may become unreliable, and the modeling accuracy of the ER rule is decreased. In this article, a new ER rule-based safety assessment method with sensor reliability for complex systems is proposed, where sensor reliability and perturbation are considered. The coefficient of the variation-based weighting (CVBW) method is employed to obtain sensor weight. The sensor reliability is calculated by static reliability and dynamic reliability, which are determined by experts and the distance-based method, respectively. The perturbation is quantified as a bounded parameter defined as the perturbation factor, which is used to describe uncertainties and aggregate static reliability and dynamic reliability. The performance analysis of safety assessment is conducted to demonstrate the rationality of perturbation and position poor sensors, followed by a safety assessment algorithm. A case study is carried out to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {With the rise of the processing power of networked agents in the last decade, second-order methods for machine learning have received increasing attention. To solve the distributed optimization problems over multiagent systems, Newton’s method has the benefits of fast convergence and high estimation accuracy. In this article, we propose a reinforced network Newton method with $K$ -order control flexibility (RNN-K) in a distributed manner by integrating the consensus strategy and the latest knowledge across the network into local descent direction. The key component of our method is to make the best of intermediate results from the local neighborhood to learn global knowledge, not just for the consensus effect like most existing works, including the gradient descent and Newton methods as well as their refinements. Such a reinforcement enables revitalizing the traditional iterative consensus strategy to accelerate the descent of the Newton direction. The biggest difficulty to design the approximated Newton descent in distributed settings is addressed by using a special Taylor expansion that follows the matrix splitting technique. Based on the truncation on the Taylor series, our method also presents a tradeoff effect between estimation accuracy and computation/communication cost, which provides the control flexibility as a practical consideration. We derive theoretically the sufficient conditions for the convergence of the proposed RNN-K method of at least a linear rate. The simulation results illustrate the performance effectiveness by being applied to three types of distributed optimization problems that arise frequently in machine-learning scenarios.},

Two faster defenders as a team cooperate to protect the target subspace by capturing an attacker which strives to enter the target subspace from the play subspace without being captured. A closed-form solution is provided from the perspectives of kind and degree. Contributions of the work include the use of the attack subspace (AS) method to construct the barrier, by which the game winner can be perfectly predicted before the game starts. In addition to this inclusion, with the priori information about the game result, a critical payoff function is designed when the defenders can win the game. Then, the optimal strategy for each player is explicitly reformulated as a saddle-point equilibrium. Finally, we apply these theoretical results to two half-space and half-plane guarding games in 3-D space and 2-D plane, respectively. Since the entire achieved developments are analytical, they require a little memory without the computational burden and allow for real-time updates, beyond the capacity of the traditional Hamilton–Jacobi–Isaacs method. It is worth noting that this is the first time in the current work to consider the target guarding games for arbitrary high-dimensional space and in a fully analytical form.},

Compared with existing multitask models, the proposed models add an extensible correlation learning layer to learn the correlation among tasks. Moreover, the proposed multitask CNP (MTCNP) networks are regarded as surrogate models and applied to a Bayesian optimization framework to replace the Gaussian process (GP) to avoid the complex covariance calculation. The proposed Bayesian optimization framework simultaneously infers multiple tasks by utilizing the possible dependencies among them to share knowledge across tasks. The proposed surrogate models augment the observed dataset with a number of related tasks to estimate model parameters confidently. The experimental studies under several scenarios indicate that the proposed algorithms are competitive in performance compared with GP-, single-task-, and other multitask model-based Bayesian optimization methods.},

Based on the parameterized curve segments from GMM, the self-organizing map (SOM) neural network is then established to achieve the coverage search. The step of winner neuron selection in SOM will prioritize and allocate the curve segments to UAVs, with the comprehensive consideration of multiple evaluation factors and allocation balance.

Despite existing moving object detection techniques that can achieve reasonable results in normal size objects, they fail to distinguish the small objects from the dynamic background. To cope with this issue, a novel method is proposed for accurate small aerial object detection under different situations. Initially, the block segmentation is introduced for reducing frame information redundancy. Meanwhile, a random projection feature (RPF) is proposed for characterizing blocks into feature vectors. Subsequently, a moving direction estimation based on feature vectors is presented to measure the motions of blocks and filter out the major directions. Finally, variable search region clustering (VSRC), together with the color feature difference, is designed for extracting pixelwise targets from the remaining moving direction blocks. The comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms the level of state-of-the-art methods upon the integrity of small aerial objects, especially on the dynamic background and scale variation targets.},

Subsequently, under the assumption that the actuators and sensors are collocated while the spatial domain is divided by several subdomains, a control scheme containing the fuzzy controllers and the guidance of mobile actuator/sensor pairs is proposed based on the obtained T–S fuzzy model, where the projection modification guidance to be designed can guarantee that each mobile actuator/sensor pair moves within the prescribed area. Then, using the Lyapunov direct method and integral inequalities, a membership-function-dependent design of fuzzy controllers plus mobile actuator/sensor guidance laws is developed to render the resulting closed-loop time-delay system exponentially stable. Moreover, the exponential decay rate can also be increased by the proposed mobile guidance laws. Finally, numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed design method and the application of mobile actuator/sensor pairs contributes to accelerating the convergence speed of the closed-loop state.},

In each local region, our model jointly learns a discriminative subspace and the corresponding classifier. Under this framework, iMMLDP combines dimensionality reduction, clustering, and classification in a principled way. Moreover, to deal with more complex data, for example, a local nonlinear separable structure, we extend the linear projection to a nonlinear case based on the kernel trick and develop an infinite kernel max-margin discriminant projection (iKMMDP) model. Thanks to the conjugate property, the parameters in these two models can be inferred efficiently via the Gibbs sampler.

Particularly, in a periodic event-triggered approach, the new form of triggering conditions and upper bound of the sampling periods are provided explicitly. As a result, all agents can reach bounded consensus. Moreover, the upper bound of the consensus error can be arbitrarily adjusted by appropriately selecting parameters, and the periodic event-triggered case will be reduced to the event-triggered case when the bound approaches 0 (sampling periods approach 0 at the same time).

Thus, it can effectively mitigate the burden of data communication, and also eliminate the effect of the matched external disturbance and the model uncertainties in both system and input. For ensuring the stability of the model dynamics and the resulting sliding-mode dynamics simultaneously, an auxiliary disturbance input is introduced to the nominal model by compensating the switching term of the designed SMC law. Furthermore, the positive lower bound for the minimum interevent time is analyzed to ensure the feasibility of the proposed approach. To illustrate the proposed model-based event-triggered SMC approach from a practical viewpoint, two design problems to maximize the system robustness and performance are proposed, respectively.

The proposed algorithm does not need to deal with the issues of predefining weight vectors and calculating indicators in the search process. It is mainly based on the thought of adaptively selecting multiple promising search directions according to crowdedness information in local objective spaces. Concretely, the proposed algorithm attempts to dynamically delete an individual of poor quality until enough individuals survive into the next generation. In this environmental selection process, the proposed algorithm considers two or three individuals in the most crowded area, which is determined by the local information in objective space, according to a probability selection mechanism, and deletes the worst of them from the current population. Thus, these surviving individuals are representative of promising search directions. The performance of the proposed algorithm is verified and compared with seven state-of-the-art algorithms [including four general multi/many-objective EAs and three algorithms specially designed for dealing with problems with irregular Pareto-optimal front (PF)] on a variety of complicated problems with different numbers of objectives ranging from 2 to 15. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has a strong competitiveness power in terms of both the performance and the algorithm compactness, and it can well deal with different types of problems with irregular PF and problems with different numbers of objectives.},

  abstract     = {Fixed-time tracking control is considered for a class of nonlinear systems in this article. Different from the conventional literature on fixed-time control studies, in this article, the nonlinearities of systems are all completely unknown. Fuzzy-logic systems are utilized to model these unknown nonlinearities. To deal with the fixed-time control under the approximation errors, three steps are taken. First, a new criterion of fixed-time stability is developed; second, a new fixed-time control scheme is proposed, which is different from the existing adaptive design method; and third, to analyze the fixed-time stability of the system, two novel inequalities are established. It shows that the proposed fuzzy control scheme can guarantee system performance in a fixed time, and the upper bound of the settling time only depends on the design parameters.},

  abstract     = {Sentiment analysis is a key component in various text mining applications. Numerous sentiment classification techniques, including conventional and deep-learning-based methods, have been proposed in the literature. In most existing methods, a high-quality training set is assumed to be given. Nevertheless, constructing a high-quality training set that consists of highly accurate labels is challenging in real applications. This difficulty stems from the fact that text samples usually contain complex sentiment representations, and their annotation is subjective. We address this challenge in this study by leveraging a new labeling strategy and utilizing a two-level long short-term memory network to construct a sentiment classifier. Lexical cues are useful for sentiment analysis, and they have been utilized in conventional studies. For example, polar and negation words play important roles in sentiment analysis. A new encoding strategy, that is, $\rho $ -hot encoding, is proposed to alleviate the drawbacks of one-hot encoding and, thus, effectively incorporate useful lexical cues. Moreover, the sentimental polarity of a word may change in different sentences due to label noise or context. A flipping model is proposed to model the polar flipping of words in a sentence. We compile three Chinese datasets on the basis of our label strategy and proposed methodology. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms on both benchmark English data and our compiled Chinese data.},

The centralized and distributed event-triggered impulsive controls are, respectively, presented. The suitable Lyapunov functions are constructed, and the triggering functions are derived, which guarantee that not only are the synchronization errors less than a non-negative bound but also the Zeno behaviors can be eliminated. It is suggested that the distributed one has great superiority in taking up fewer resources compared with the time-triggered impulsive control.

Generally, all relevant labels are considered to be available for labeled data. However, instances with a full label set are difficult to obtain in real-world applications, thus leading to the weakly multilabel learning problem, that is, relevant labels of training data are partially known and many relevant labels are missing, and even abundant training data are associated with an empty label set. To address the problem, we propose a new multilabel method to learn from weakly labeled data. To be specific, an optimization framework is constructed based on the manifold regularized sparse model, in which the correlations among labels and feature structure are considered to model global and local label correlations, thereby achieving discriminative feature analysis for mapping training data to ground-truth label space. Moreover, the proposed method has an excellent mechanism to conduct semisupervised multilabel learning by exploiting training data with the predicted label set of the unlabeled. Experiments on various real-world tasks reveal that the proposed method outperforms some state-of-the-art methods.},

This article proposes a novel feature extraction method based on advanced energy kernel-based features (AEKFs). The proposed method is evaluated on a scientific dataset which contains six types of upper limb motion with three different force variations. Furthermore, the EMG signal is acquired for eight upper limb gestures for the testing algorithm on the DSP processor. The efficiency of the proposed feature set has been investigated using classification accuracy (CA), Davies–Bouldin (DB) index-based separability measurement, and time complexity as performance metrics. Moreover, the proposed AEKF features, along with the LDA classifier, have been implemented on the DSP processor (ARM cortex M4) for real-time viability. Offline metrics comparison with the existing approaches prove that AEKF features exhibit lower time complexity along with a higher CA of 97.33\%. The algorithm is tested on the DSP processor and CA is reported $\approx ~92$\%. MATLAB 2015a has been deployed in Intel Core i7, 3.40-GHz RAM for all offline analyses.},

In this study, by stacking zero-order Takagi–Sugeno–Kang (TSK) fuzzy subclassifiers on the minority class and its problematic areas in the deep ensemble, a novel deep-ensemble-level-based TSK fuzzy classifier (IDE-TSK-FC) for imbalanced data classification tasks is presented to achieve both promising classification performance and high interpretability of zero-order TSK fuzzy classifiers. Simultaneously, according to the stacked generalization principle, the proposed classifier lifts up oversampling from the data level to the deep ensemble level with a guarantee of enhanced generalization capability for class imbalance learning. In the structure of IDE-TSK-FC, the first interpretable zero-order TSK fuzzy subclassifier is built on the original training dataset. After that, several successive zero-order TSK fuzzy subclassifiers are stacked layer by layer on the newly identified problematic areas from the original training dataset plus the corresponding interpretable predictions obtained by the averaging strategy on all previous layers. IDE-TSK-FC simply takes the classical $K$ -nearest neighboring algorithm at each layer to identify its problematic area that consists of the minority samples and its surrounding $K$ majority neighbors. After randomly neglecting certain input features and randomly selecting the five Gaussian membership functions for all the chosen input features and the augmented feature in the premise of each fuzzy rule, each subclassifier can be quickly obtained by using the least learning machine to determine the consequent part of each fuzzy rule. The experimental results on both the public datasets and a real-world healthcare dataset demonstrate IDE-TSK-FC’s superiority in class imbalanced learning.},

  abstract     = {Internet of Things (IoT) has emerged as a cutting-edge technology that is changing human life. The rapid and widespread applications of IoT, however, make cyberspace more vulnerable, especially to IoT-based attacks in which IoT devices are used to launch attack on cyber-physical systems. Given a massive number of IoT devices (in order of billions), detecting and preventing these IoT-based attacks are critical. However, this task is very challenging due to the limited energy and computing capabilities of IoT devices and the continuous and fast evolution of attackers. Among IoT-based attacks, unknown ones are far more devastating as these attacks could surpass most of the current security systems and it takes time to detect them and “cure” the systems. To effectively detect new/unknown attacks, in this article, we propose a novel representation learning method to better predictively “describe” unknown attacks, facilitating supervised learning-based anomaly detection methods. Specifically, we develop three regularized versions of autoencoders (AEs) to learn a latent representation from the input data. The bottleneck layers of these regularized AEs trained in a supervised manner using normal data and known IoT attacks will then be used as the new input features for classification algorithms. We carry out extensive experiments on nine recent IoT datasets to evaluate the performance of the proposed models. The experimental results demonstrate that the new latent representation can significantly enhance the performance of supervised learning methods in detecting unknown IoT attacks. We also conduct experiments to investigate the characteristics of the proposed models and the influence of hyperparameters on their performance. The running time of these models is about 1.3 ms that is pragmatic for most applications.},

It is inefficient as the vulnerable code only takes a tiny fraction of the entire code. In this article, we design and implement an evolutionary fuzzing framework called V-Fuzz, which aims to find bugs efficiently and quickly in limited time for binary programs. V-Fuzz consists of two main components: 1) a vulnerability prediction model and 2) a vulnerability-oriented evolutionary fuzzer . Given a binary program to V-Fuzz, the vulnerability prediction model will give a prior estimation on which parts of a program are more likely to be vulnerable. Then, the fuzzer leverages an evolutionary algorithm to generate inputs which are more likely to arrive at the vulnerable locations, guided by the vulnerability prediction result. The experimental results demonstrate that V-Fuzz can find bugs efficiently with the assistance of vulnerability prediction. Moreover, V-Fuzz has discovered ten common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs), and three of them are newly discovered.},

  abstract     = {This article focuses on the distributed maximum correntropy filtering issue for general stochastic nonlinear systems subject to deception attacks. The considered nonlinear functions consist of a determined one and a stochastic one, and the stochastic signals sent by deception attacks with identified statistic characteristics could be non-Gaussian. The corresponding calculation formulas of both the filter gains and the upper bound of the filter error covariance are proposed by means of the Taylor series expansion and the fixed-point iterative update rule, where the weighted maximum correntropy criterion is utilized to take the place of traditional minimum covariance indexes. Such an upper bound is only dependent on the local information, neighbor information, and the identified statistics of deception attacks and, therefore, the developed filtering scheme realizes the requirement of distributed calculation. Furthermore, a simplified version is obtained by removing weights in the correntropy criterion. Finally, an illustrative example is given to verify the effectiveness of developed distributed maximum correntropy filtering subject to deception attacks.},

  abstract     = {This article is concerned with the fixed-time prescribed tracking control problem for the uncertain stochastic nonlinear systems subject to input quantization and unknown measurement sensitivity. Different from existing results, the sensitivity on the sensor for measuring the system state is considered as an unknown parameter instead of the known one. Due to unknown measurement sensitivity on the sensor, the real system state cannot be obtained by measurement; hence, we put forward a new feedback control algorithm by the use of the unreal measured value of the system state. Moreover, the fixed-time prescribed performance on the output tracking error is investigated by developing a novel performance function. By means of the backstepping method, an adaptive quantized controller is designed for the system. Based on the Lyapunov stability theory, it is proved that the controller can render the output tracking error that satisfies the fixed-time prescribed performance and all signals of the resulting closed-loop system are bounded in probability. Finally, simulation results are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm.},

  abstract     = {This article tackles the problem of multilabel learning with missing labels. For this problem, it is widely accepted that label correlations can be used to recover the ground-truth label matrix. Most of the existing approaches impose the low-rank assumption on the observed label matrix to exploit label correlations by decomposing it into two matrices, which describe the latent factors of instances and labels, respectively. The quality of these latent factors highly influences the recovery of ground-truth labels and the construction of the multilabel classification model. In this article, we propose recovering the ground-truth label matrix by regularized matrix factorization. Specifically, the latent factors of instances are regularized by the local topological structure derived from the feature space, which can be further used to induce an effective multilabel model. Moreover, the latent factors of labels and the label correlations are mutually adapted via label manifold regularization. In this way, the recovery of the ground-truth label matrix and the construction of the multilabel classification model are optimized jointly and can benefit from the regularized matrix factorization. Extensive experimental studies show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms on both full-label and missing-label data.},

  abstract     = {During the last two decades, the notion of multiobjective optimization (MOO) has been successfully adopted to solve the nonconvex constrained optimization problems (COPs) in their most general forms. However, such works mainly utilized the Pareto dominance-based MOO framework while the other successful MOO frameworks, such as the reference vector (RV) and the decomposition-based ones, have not drawn sufficient attention from the COP researchers. In this article, we utilize the concepts of the RV-based MOO to design a ranking strategy for the solutions of a COP. We first transform the COP into a biobjective optimization problem (BOP) and then solve it by using the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES), which is arguably one of the most competitive evolutionary algorithms of current interest. We propose an RV-based ranking strategy to calculate the mean and update the covariance matrix in CMA-ES. Besides, the RV is explicitly tuned during the optimization process based on the characteristics of COPs in a RV-based MOO framework. We also propose a repair mechanism for the infeasible solutions and a restart strategy to facilitate the population to escape from the infeasible region. We test the proposal extensively on two well-known benchmark suites comprised of 36 and 112 test problems (at different scales) from the IEEE CEC (Congress on Evolutionary Computation) 2010 and 2017 competitions along with a real-world problem related to power flow. Our experimental results suggest that the proposed algorithm can meet or beat several other state-of-the-art constrained optimizers in terms of the performance on a wide variety of problems.},

  abstract     = {Music information retrieval is of great interest in audio signal processing. However, relatively little attention has been paid to the playing techniques of musical instruments. This work proposes an automatic system for classifying guitar playing techniques (GPTs). Automatic classification for GPTs is challenging because some playing techniques differ only slightly from others. This work presents a new framework for GPT classification: it uses a new feature extraction method based on spectral–temporal receptive fields (STRFs) to extract features from guitar sounds. This work applies a supervised deep learning approach to classify GPTs. Specifically, a new deep learning model, called the hierarchical cascade deep belief network (HCDBN), is proposed to perform automatic GPT classification. Several simulations were performed and the datasets of: 1) data on onsets of signals; 2) complete audio signals; and 3) audio signals in a real-world environment are adopted to compare the performance. The proposed system improves upon the F-score by approximately 11.47\% in setup 1) and yields an F-score of 96.82\% in setup 2). The results in setup 3) demonstrate that the proposed system also works well in a real-world environment. These results show that the proposed system is robust and has very high accuracy in automatic GPT classification.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid growth of multimedia data on the Internet, there has been a rapid rise in the demand for visual–textual cross-media retrieval between images and sentences. However, the heterogeneous property of visual and textual data brings huge challenges to measure the cross-media similarity for retrieval. Although existing methods have achieved great progress with the strong learning ability of the deep neural network, they rely heavily on the scale of training data with manual annotation, that is, either pairwise image–sentence annotation or category annotation as supervised information for visual–textual correlation learning, which are extremely labor and time consuming to collect. Without any pairwise or category annotation, it is highly challenging to construct a correlation between images and sentences due to their inconsistent distributions and representations. But people can naturally understand the correlation between visual and textual data in high-level semantic, and those images and sentences containing the same group of semantic concepts can be easily matched in human brain. Inspired by the above human cognitive process, this article proposes an unsupervised visual–textual correlation learning (UVCL) approach to construct correlations without any manual annotation. The contributions are summarized as follows: 1) unsupervised semantic-guided cross-media correlation mining is proposed to bridge the heterogeneous gap between visual and textual data. We measure the semantic matching degree between images and sentences, and generate descriptive sentences according to the concepts extracted from images to further augment the training data in an unsupervised manner. Therefore, the approach can exploit the semantic knowledge within both visual and textual data to reduce the gap between them for further correlation learning and 2) unsupervised visual–textual fine-grained semantic alignment is proposed to learn cross-media correlation by aligning the fine-grained visual local patches and textual keywords with fine-grained soft attention as well as semantic-guided hard attention, and the results can effectively highlight the fine-grained semantic information within both images and sentences to boost visual–textual alignment. Extensive experiments are conducted to perform visual–textual cross-media retrieval in unsupervised setting without any manual annotation on two widely used datasets, namely, Flickr-30K and MS-COCO, which verify the effectiveness of our proposed UVCL approach.},

Our model mainly focuses on improving a labeled data assignment among the constituent networks and exploiting unlabeled data to capture domain-specific information, such that semisupervised classification can be effectively facilitated. Different from conventional multiple choice learning models, the constituent networks learn multiple tasks in the training process. Specifically, an auxiliary reconstruction task is included to learn domain-specific representation. For the purpose of performing implicit labeling on reliable unlabeled samples, we adopt a negative $\ell _{1}$ -norm regularization when minimizing the conditional entropy with respect to the posterior probability distribution. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets are conducted to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed SemiMCL model.},

In this article, two points that influence the performance of SDR are studied and a new dominance relation, which is mainly based on SDR, is proposed (CSDR). An adaptation strategy is presented to dynamically adjust the dominance relation according to the current generation number. The CSDR is embedded into NSGA-II to substitute the Pareto dominance, labeled as NSGA-II/CSDR. The performance of our proposed method is validated by comparing it with five state-of-the-art algorithms on commonly used benchmark problems.

An analytical dynamics-based view is taken in which the prescribed tracking trajectories are viewed as servo constraints which can be linear, nonlinear, holonomic, and nonholonomic. Using this view, a novel closed form solution of adaptive robust control is found with leakage type adaptive law to guarantee deterministic system performance, including uniform boundedness and uniform ultimate boundedness. In order to find the optimal dual gain parameters of the designed control, a two-player cooperative game is proposed for which the Pareto optimality can always be guaranteed.

Under the collective observability condition, a relationship between estimation error covariance, attack intensity, and transmission efficiency is established by utilizing the covariance intersection fusion method and the property of matrix congruent transformation rank. The important features that distinguish our work from others are that the considered DoS attacks compromise each channel independently and do not have to satisfy the probabilistic property of the packet loss process. Furthermore, an event-triggered communication scheme is considered to improve the utilization of network resources between filters, and a sufficient condition for the parameter design is given which takes into account the influence of DoS attacks.

In the first stage, a set of evolutionary nondominated fuzzy controllers (FCs) for a single robot (a leader robot) in the execution of the OBF behavior is learned. In the second stage, a follower robot is controlled by two evolutionary FCs in combination with a switched compensation FC so that the leader and follower robots can cooperatively transport an object while executing the OBF behavior along obstacles containing corners with right angles. In the third stage, the third robot functions as an accompanying robot and is learned to enter into a predicted triangular formation with the leader–follower robots to transport a larger object while executing the OBF behavior.

Recent advances in online solutions for quadratic programming problems (QPPs) have created opportunities to widen the scope of applications for support vector regression (SVR). In this vein, efforts to make SVR compatible with streaming data have been met with substantial success. However, streaming data with concept drift remain problematic because the trained prediction function in SVR tends to drift as the data distribution drifts. Aiming to contribute a solution to this aspect of SVR’s advancement, we have developed continuous SVR (C-SVR) to solve regression problems with nonstationary streaming data, that is, data where the optimal input–output prediction function can drift over time. The basic idea of C-SVR is to continuously learn a series of input–output functions over a series of time windows to make predictions about different periods. However, strikingly, the learning process in different time windows is not independent. An additional similarity term in the QPP, which is solved incrementally, threads the various input–output functions together by conveying some learned knowledge through consecutive time windows. How much learned knowledge is transferred is determined by the extent of the concept drift. Experimental evaluations with both synthetic and real-world datasets indicate that C-SVR has better performance than most existing methods for nonstationary streaming data regression.},

Most studies explore data-driven pattern recognition techniques that are generally highly dependent on learning data and insufficiently effective for emotion contextual recognition. In this article, a hybrid model-based emotion contextual recognition approach for cognitive assistance services in ubiquitous environments is proposed. This model is based on: 1) a hybrid-level fusion exploiting a multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural-network model and the possibilistic logic and 2) an expressive emotional knowledge representation and reasoning model to recognize nondirectly observable emotions; this model exploits jointly the emotion upper ontology (EmUO) and the n-ary ontology of events HTemp supported by the NKRL language. For validation purposes of the proposed approach, experiments were carried out using a YouTube dataset, and in a real-world scenario dedicated to the cognitive assistance of visitors in a smart devices showroom. Results demonstrated that the proposed multimodal emotion recognition model outperforms all baseline models. The real-world scenario corroborates the effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of emotion contextual recognition and management and in the creation of emotion-based assistance services.},

  abstract     = {Conditional independence encoded in Bayesian networks (BNs) avoids combinatorial explosion on the number of variables. However, BNs are still subject to exponential growth of space and inference time on the number of causes per effect variable in conditional probability tables. A number of space-efficient local models exist that allow efficient encoding of dependency between an effect and its causes, and can also be exploited for improved inference efficiency. We focus on the Nonimpeding Noisy-AND Tree (NIN-AND Tree or NAT) models because of multiple merits. We present a novel framework, trans-causalization of NAT-modeled BNs, by which causal independence embedded in NAT models is exploited for more efficient inference. We show that trans-causalization is exact and yields polynomial space complexity. We demonstrate significant efficiency gain on inference based on lazy propagation and sum–product networks.},

It is a critical and challenging problem to evaluate the training samples collected from previous predictions and employ sample selection by their quality to train the model. To tackle the above problem, we propose a joint discriminative learning scheme with the progressive multistage optimization policy of sample selection for robust visual tracking. The proposed scheme presents a novel time-weighted and detection-guided self-paced learning strategy for easy-to-hard sample selection, which is capable of tolerating relatively large intraclass variations while maintaining interclass separability. Such a self-paced learning strategy is jointly optimized in conjunction with the discriminative tracking process, resulting in robust tracking results.

  abstract     = {Performance of multi/many-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) based on decomposition is highly impacted by the Pareto front (PF) shapes of multi/many-objective optimization problems (MOPs), as their adopted weight vectors may not properly fit the PF shapes. To avoid this mismatch, some MOEAs treat solutions as weight vectors to guide the evolutionary search, which can adapt to the target MOP’s PF automatically. However, their performance is still affected by the similarity metric used to select weight vectors. To address this issue, this article proposes a fuzzy decomposition-based MOEA. First, a fuzzy prediction is designed to estimate the population’s shape, which helps to exactly reflect the similarities of solutions. Then, ${N}$ least similar solutions are extracted as weight vectors to obtain ${N}$ constrained fuzzy subproblems ( ${N}$ is the population size), and accordingly, a shared weight vector is calculated for all subproblems to provide a stable search direction. Finally, the corner solution for each of ${m}$ least similar subproblems ( ${m}$ is the objective number) is preserved to maintain diversity, while one solution having the best aggregated value on the shared weight vector is selected for each of the remaining subproblems to speed up convergence. When compared to several competitive MOEAs in solving a variety of test MOPs, the proposed algorithm shows some advantages at fitting their different PF shapes.},

  abstract     = {Multiview subspace learning has attracted much attention due to the efficacy of exploring the information on multiview features. Most existing methods perform data reconstruction on the original feature space and thus are vulnerable to noisy data. In this article, we propose a novel multiview subspace learning method, called multiview consensus structure discovery (MvCSD). Specifically, we learn the low-dimensional subspaces corresponding to different views and simultaneously pursue the structure consensus over subspace clustering for multiple views. In such a way, latent subspaces from different views regularize each other toward a common consensus that reveals the underlying cluster structure. Compared to existing methods, MvCSD leverages the consensus structure derived from the subspaces of diverse views to better exploit the intrinsic complementary information that well reflects the essence of data. Accordingly, the proposed MvCSD is capable of producing a more robust and accurate representation structure which is crucial for multiview subspace learning. The proposed method can be optimized effectively, with theoretical convergence guarantee, by alternatively iterating the argument Lagrangian multiplier algorithm and the eigendecomposition. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate the advantages of our method over the state-of-the-art methods.},

How to extract effective feature representations from complex process data is still the difficult and hot spot in the soft sensing application field. Deep learning (DL), which has made great progresses in many fields recently, has been used for process monitoring and quality prediction purposes for its outstanding nonlinear modeling and feature extraction abilities. In this work, deep stacked autoencoder (SAE) is introduced to construct a soft sensor model. Nevertheless, conventional SAE-based methods do not take information related to target values in the pretraining stage and just use the feature representations in the last hidden layer for final prediction. To this end, a novel gated stacked target-related autoencoder (GSTAE) is proposed for improving modeling performance in view of the above two issues. By adding prediction errors of target values into the loss function when executing a layerwise pretraining procedure, the target-related information is used to guide the feature learning process. Besides, gated neurons are utilized to control the information flow from different layers to the final output neuron that take full advantage of different levels of abstraction representations and quantify their contributions. Finally, the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed approach are verified in two real industrial cases.},

  abstract     = {3-D radiotherapy is an effective treatment modality for breast cancer. In 3-D radiotherapy, delineation of the clinical target volume (CTV) is an essential step in the establishment of treatment plans. However, manual delineation is subjective and time consuming. In this study, we propose an automated segmentation model based on deep neural networks for the breast cancer CTV in planning computed tomography (CT). Our model is composed of three stages that work in a cascade manner, making it applicable to real-world scenarios. The first stage determines which slices contain CTVs, as not all CT slices include breast lesions. The second stage detects the region of the human body in an entire CT slice, eliminating boundary areas, which may have side effects for the segmentation of the CTV. The third stage delineates the CTV. To permit the network to focus on the breast mass in the slice, a novel dynamically strided convolution operation, which shows better performance than standard convolution, is proposed. To train and evaluate the model, a large dataset containing 455 cases and 50 425 CT slices is constructed. The proposed model achieves an average dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.802 and 0.801 for right-0 and left-sided breast, respectively. Our method shows superior performance to that of previous state-of-the-art approaches.},

In addition to the recognition rate and mean Jaccard index (MJI) as evaluation metrics used in previous challenges, we introduce the corrected segmentation rate (CSR) metric to evaluate the performance of temporal segmentation for continuous gesture recognition. Furthermore, we propose a bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) method, determining video division points based on skeleton points. Experiments show that the proposed Bi-LSTM outperforms state-of-the-art methods with an absolute improvement of 8.1\% (from 0.8917 to 0.9639) of CSR.},

  abstract     = {Medical time series of laboratory tests has been collected in electronic health records (EHRs) in many countries. Machine-learning algorithms have been proposed to analyze the condition of patients using these medical records. However, medical time series may be recorded using different laboratory parameters in different datasets. This results in the failure of applying a pretrained model on a test dataset containing a time series of different laboratory parameters. This article proposes to solve this problem with an unsupervised time-series adaptation method that generates time series across laboratory parameters. Specifically, a medical time-series generation network with similarity distillation is developed to reduce the domain gap caused by the difference in laboratory parameters. The relations of different laboratory parameters are analyzed, and the similarity information is distilled to guide the generation of target-domain specific laboratory parameters. To further improve the performance in cross-domain medical applications, a missingness-aware feature extraction network is proposed, where the missingness patterns reflect the health conditions and, thus, serve as auxiliary features for medical analysis. In addition, we also introduce domain-adversarial networks in both feature level and time-series level to enhance the adaptation across domains. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves good performance on both private and publicly available medical datasets. Ablation studies and distribution visualization are provided to further analyze the properties of the proposed method.},

Designing algorithms to find and track desirable solutions while facing challenges of dynamic optimization problems is an active research topic in the field of swarm and evolutionary computation. To evaluate and compare the performance of algorithms, it is imperative to use a suitable benchmark that generates problem instances with different controllable characteristics. In this article, we give a comprehensive review of existing benchmarks and investigate their shortcomings in capturing different problem features. We then propose a highly configurable benchmark suite, the generalized moving peaks benchmark, capable of generating problem instances whose components have a variety of properties, such as different levels of ill-conditioning, variable interactions, shape, and complexity. Moreover, components generated by the proposed benchmark can be highly dynamic with respect to the gradients, heights, optimum locations, condition numbers, shapes, complexities, and variable interactions. Finally, several well-known optimizers and dynamic optimization algorithms are chosen to solve generated problems by the proposed benchmark. The experimental results show the poor performance of the existing methods in facing new challenges posed by the addition of new properties.},

This delay robustness holds under the very weak connectivity assumptions on the underlying graph, that is, as long as the graph is uniformly jointly strongly connected and switches with a dwell time.

The dynamic ETM is utilized to mitigate unnecessary resource consumption occurring in the sensor-to-estimator communication channel. To guarantee resilience against possible realization errors, the estimator gain is permitted to undergo some norm-bounded parameter drifts. For the delayed MNNs, our aim is to devise an event-based resilient $H_{\infty }$ estimator that not only resists gain variations and SDs but also ensures the exponential mean-square stability of the resulting estimation error system with a guaranteed disturbance attenuation level. By resorting to the stochastic analysis technique, sufficient conditions are acquired for the expected estimator and, subsequently, estimator gains are obtained via figuring out a convex optimization problem. The validity of the $H_{\infty }$ estimator is finally shown via a numerical example.},

Since this is costly in human resources and difficult to do objectively, there is the need for automatic systems to measure it.

As a baseline, our approach first uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn facial features from VGG_Faces, which are then linked to a long short-term memory to exploit the temporal relation between video frames. We further compare the performances of using the so popular schema based on the canonically normalized appearance versus taking into account the whole image. As a result, we outperform current state-of-the-art area under the curve performance in the UNBC-McMaster Shoulder Pain Expression Archive Database. In addition, to evaluate the generalization properties of our proposed methodology on facial motion recognition, we also report competitive results in the Cohn Kanade+ facial expression database.},

One common assumption utilized in most existing results on such tracking consensus problem that the inherent dynamics of the leader are the same as those of the followers is removed in this article. In particular, two cases that the dynamics of the leader are subjected, respectively, to bounded input and unknown nonlinearity are considered. To do this, distributed event-triggered observers are first constructed to estimate the state information of the leader. Then, local event-triggered tracking control protocols are designed for each follower to complete the goal of tracking consensus. One distinguishing feature of the present distributed observers lies in the fact that they could avoid the continuous monitoring for the states of the neighbors’ observer states. It is also worth pointing out that the present tracking consensus control strategies are fully distributed as no global information related to the directed communication graph is involved in designing the strategies.

To increase the calculation efficiency, this work further provides an accelerated GIST version, that is, AGIST, through the extrapolation-based acceleration technique, which can contribute to reduce the number of iterations when solving a family of nonconvex sparse learning problems. Besides, we present the algorithmic analysis, including both local and global convergence guarantees, as well as other intermediate results for the GIST and AGIST, denoted as (A)GIST, by virtue of the Kurdyka-Łojasiewica (KŁ) property and some milder assumptions.

  abstract     = {Due to the inconsistent distributions and representations of different modalities (e.g., images and texts), it is very challenging to correlate such heterogeneous data. A standard solution is to construct one common subspace, where the common representations of different modalities are generated to bridge the heterogeneity gap. Existing methods based on common representation learning mostly adopt a less effective two-stage paradigm: first, generating separate representations for each modality by exploiting the modality-specific properties as the complementary information, and then capturing the cross-modal correlation in the separate representations for common representation learning. Moreover, these methods usually neglect that there may exist interference in the modality-specific properties, that is, the unrelated objects and background regions in images or the noisy words and incorrect sentences in the text. In this article, we hypothesize that explicitly modeling the interference within each modality can improve the quality of common representation learning. To this end, we propose a novel model private–shared subspaces separation (P3S) to explicitly learn different representations that are partitioned into two kinds of subspaces: 1) the common representations that capture the cross-modal correlation in a shared subspace and 2) the private representations that model the interference within each modality in two private subspaces. By employing the orthogonality constraints between the shared subspace and the private subspaces during the one-stage joint learning procedure, our model is able to learn more effective common representations for different modalities in the shared subspace by fully excluding the interference within each modality. Extensive experiments conducted on cross-modal retrieval verify the advantages of our P3S method compared with 15 state-of-the-art methods on four widely used cross-modal datasets.},

  abstract     = {Image classification is an important part of pattern recognition. With the development of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), many CNN methods are proposed, which have a large number of samples for training, which can have high performance. However, there may exist limited samples in some real-world applications. In order to improve the performance of CNN learning with insufficient samples, this article proposes a new method called the classifier method based on a variational autoencoder (CFVAE), which is comprised of two parts: 1) a standard CNN as a prior classifier and 2) a CNN based on variational autoencoder (VAE) as a posterior classifier. First, the prior classifier is utilized to generate the prior label and information about distributions of latent variables; and the posterior classifier is trained to augment some latent variables from regularized distributions to improve the performance. Second, we also present the uniform objective function of CFVAE and put forward an optimization method based on the stochastic gradient variational Bayes method to solve the objective model. Third, we analyze the feasibility of CFVAE based on Hoeffding’s inequality and Chernoff’s bounding method. This analysis indicates that the latent variables augmentation method based on regularized latent variables distributions can generate samples fitting well with the distribution of data such that the proposed method can improve the performance of CNN with insufficient samples. Finally, the experiments manifest that our proposed CFVAE can provide more accurate performance than state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {This article addresses two important issues of causal inference in the high-dimensional situation. One is how to reduce redundant conditional independence (CI) tests, which heavily impact the efficiency and accuracy of existing constraint-based methods. Another is how to construct the true causal graph from a set of Markov equivalence classes returned by these methods. For the first issue, we design a recursive decomposition approach where the original data (a set of variables) are first decomposed into two small subsets, each of which is then recursively decomposed into two smaller subsets until none of these subsets can be decomposed further. Redundant CI tests can be reduced by inferring causalities from these subsets. The advantage of this decomposition scheme lies in two aspects: 1) it requires only low-order CI tests and 2) it does not violate $d$ -separation. The complete causality can be reconstructed by merging all the partial results of the subsets. For the second issue, we employ regression-based CI tests to check CIs in linear non-Gaussian additive noise cases, which can identify more causal directions by $x - E(x|Z) \_{}\!\!\_{}\!\!\!\!\!\shortparallel z$ (or $y - E(y|Z) \_{}\!\!\_{}\!\!\!\!\!\shortparallel z$ ). Consequently, causal direction learning is no longer limited by the number of returned $V$ -structures and consistent propagation. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method can not only substantially reduce redundant CI tests but also effectively distinguish the equivalence classes.},

The weighted sparsity is introduced to facilitate the design of the varying degrees of the sparsity constraints imposed on the hidden units of the AE. The MOEA is exploited to adaptively seek appropriate hyperparameters, where the divide-and-conquer strategy is implemented to enhance the MOEA’s performance in the context of deep neural networks. Moreover, a sharing scheme is proposed to further reduce the time complexity of the learning process at the slight expense of the learning precision. It is shown via extensive experiments that the established adaptive learning framework is effective, where different sparse models are utilized to demonstrate the generality of the proposed results. Then, the generality of the proposed framework is examined on the convolutional AE and VGG-16 network.

The proposed approach has two significant characteristics: 1) DCOT-LS-SVMs is inspired by a stacked hierarchical architecture that combines several layer-by-layer LS-SVMs modules. The module that forms the higher layer has additional input features that consider the predictions from all previous modules and 2) cross-output knowledge transfer is used to leverage knowledge from the predictions of the previous module to improve the learning process in the current module. With this approach, the model’s parameters, such as a tradeoff parameter $C$ and a kernel width $\delta $ , can be randomly assigned to each module in order to greatly simplify the learning process. Moreover, DCOT-LS-SVMs is able to autonomously and quickly decide the extent of the cross-output knowledge transfer between adjacent modules through a fast leave-one-out cross-validation strategy. In addition, we present an imbalanced version of DCOT-LS-SVMs, called IDCOT-LS-SVMs, given that imbalanced datasets are common in real-world scenarios. The effectiveness of the proposed approaches is demonstrated through a comparison with five comparative methods on UCI datasets and with a case study on the diagnosis of prostate cancer.},

In particular, their inertial parameters are distinct and unavailable. For the sake of the accomplishment of the coordinated formation objective of multiple underactuated VTOL UAVs through local information exchange, an adaptive distributed control algorithm is developed under a cascaded structure. Specifically, by introducing an immersion and invariance (I&amp;I) adaption strategy for the exponential mass estimation, a distributed command force is first synthesized in the position loop. Next, an applied torque with adaption is synthesized for the attitude tracking to a command attitude. This command attitude, as well as the applied thrust, is extracted from the synthesized command force without singularity. It is shown in terms of the Lyapunov theory that driven by the proposed adaptive distributed control algorithm, the concerned coordinated formation control of multiple VTOL UAVs is achieved asymptotically. Finally, an illustrative example is simulated to validate the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm.},

The system has to correctly recognize a set of gestures related to official referee’s signals (ORSs) and another set of gestures used to intuitively interact with the system. These two gesture sets involve both large motion and subtle motion gestures, and the existing sensor-based methods using handcrafted features do not work well on recognizing all kinds of these gestures. In this work, deep belief networks (DBNs) are utilized to learn more representative features for hand gesture recognition, and selective handcrafted features are combined with the DBN features to achieve more robust recognition results. Moreover, a hierarchical recognition scheme is designed to first recognize the input gesture as a large or subtle motion gesture, and the corresponding classifiers for large motion gestures and subtle motion gestures are further used to obtain the final recognition result. Moreover, the Myo armband consists of eight-channel surface electromyography (sEMG) sensors and an inertial measurement unit (IMU), and these heterogeneous signals can be fused to achieve better recognition accuracy. We take basketball as an example to validate the proposed training system, and the experimental results show that the proposed hierarchical scheme considering DBN features of multimodality data outperforms other methods.},

First, a switched dynamic positioning system (DPS) model for a mass-switched marine vehicle is established. The switched DPS model takes into consideration changes in the marine vehicle’s mass and the resultant switching of the marine vehicle’s parameters. Second, for a mass-switched UMV controlled through a communication network, a novel weighted event-triggering communication scheme considering switching features is proposed. The weighted error data of multiple sampling instants are utilized to avoid a long-time nontriggering phenomenon. The consideration of switching features guarantees the current sampled data to be transmitted if a switch occurs between the last sampling instant and the current sampling instant. Then, under the event-triggering scheme, an asynchronously switched DPS model for the mass-switched UMV is established in network environments. Based on this model, a mode-dependent DPS controller and event generator co-design method are proposed to attenuate the disturbance induced by wind, waves, and ocean currents. The DPS performance analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

To address this problem, this article proposes a new crossover mechanism, called leaf crossover (LC), which generates legal offspring by just exchanging partial parent chromosomes, requiring neither the global network link information, encoding/decoding nor repair operations. Our simulation study indicates that GAs with LC outperform GAs with existing crossover mechanisms in terms of not only producing better solutions but also converging faster in networks of varying sizes.},

  abstract     = {Computational photo quality evaluation is a useful technique in many tasks of computer vision and graphics, for example, photo retaregeting, 3-D rendering, and fashion recommendation. The conventional photo quality models are designed by characterizing the pictures from all communities (e.g., “architecture” and “colorful”) indiscriminately, wherein community-specific features are not exploited explicitly. In this article, we develop a new community-aware photo quality evaluation framework. It uncovers the latent community-specific topics by a regularized latent topic model (LTM) and captures human visual quality perception by exploring multiple attributes. More specifically, given massive-scale online photographs from multiple communities, a novel ranking algorithm is proposed to measure the visual/semantic attractiveness of regions inside each photograph. Meanwhile, three attributes, namely: 1) photo quality scores; weak semantic tags; and inter-region correlations, are seamlessly and collaboratively incorporated during ranking. Subsequently, we construct the gaze shifting path (GSP) for each photograph by sequentially linking the top-ranking regions from each photograph, and an aggregation-based CNN calculates the deep representation for each GSP. Based on this, an LTM is proposed to model the GSP distribution from multiple communities in the latent space. To mitigate the overfitting problem caused by communities with very few photographs, a regularizer is incorporated into our LTM. Finally, given a test photograph, we obtain its deep GSP representation and its quality score is determined by the posterior probability of the regularized LTM. Comparative studies on four image sets have shown the competitiveness of our method. Besides, the eye-tracking experiments have demonstrated that our ranking-based GSPs are highly consistent with real human gaze movements.},

  abstract     = {Using multiple mobile robots in search missions offers a lot of benefits, but one needs a suitable and competent motion control algorithm that is able to consider sensor characteristics, the uncertainty of target detection, and complexity of needed maneuvers in order to make a multiagent search autonomous. This article provides a methodology for an autonomous 2-D search using multiple unmanned (aerial or possibly other) vehicles. The proposed methodology relies on an accurate calculation of target occurrence probability distribution based on the initial estimated target distribution and continuous action of spatial variant search agent sensors. The core of the autonomous search process is a high-level motion control for multiple search agents which utilizes the probabilistic model of target occurrence via a heat equation-driven area coverage (HEDAC) method. This centralized motion control algorithm is tailored for handling a group of search agents that are heterogeneous in both motion and sensing characteristics. The motion of agents is directed by the gradient of the potential field which provides a near-ergodic exploration of the search space. The proposed method is tested on three realistic search mission simulations and compared with three alternative methods, where HEDAC outperforms all alternatives in all tests. Conventional search strategies need about double the time to achieve the proportionate detection rate when compared to HEDAC controlled search. The scalability test showed that increasing the number of an HEDAC controlled search agents, although somewhat deteriorating the search efficiency, provides needed speed-up of the search. This study shows the flexibility and competence of the proposed method and gives a strong foundation for possible real-world applications.},

Although most existing learning methods take prior knowledge (e.g., pairwise constraints) into account, they pay little attention to local knowledge of data, which, however, can be utilized to optimize the distance. In this article, we propose a novel distance learning method, which learns from the Group -level information, for semisupervised fuzzing clustering. We first present a new format of constraint information, called Group -level constraints, by elevating the pairwise constraints (must-links and cannot-links) from point level to Group level. The Groups , generated around data points contained in the pairwise constraints, carry not only the local information of data (the relation between close data points) but also more background information under some given limited prior knowledge. Then, we propose a novel method to learn a distance by using the Group -level constraints, namely, Group -based distance learning, in order to optimize the performance of fuzzy clustering. The distance learning process aims to pull must-link Groups as close as possible while pushing cannot-link Groups as far as possible. We formulate the learning process with the weights of constraints by invoking some linear and nonlinear transformations. The linear Group -based distance learning method is realized by means of semidefinite programming, and the nonlinear learning method is realized by using the neural network, which can explicitly provide nonlinear mappings. Experimental results based on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that the proposed methods yield much better performance compared to other distance learning methods using pairwise constraints.},

  abstract     = {Artificial neural networks inspired from the learning mechanism of the brain have achieved great successes in machine learning, especially those with deep layers. The commonly used neural networks follow the hierarchical multilayer architecture with no connections between nodes in the same layer. In this article, we propose a new group architectures for neural-network learning. In the new architecture, the neurons are assigned irregularly in a group and a neuron may connect to any neurons in the group. The connections are assigned automatically by optimizing a novel connecting structure learning probabilistic model which is established based on the principle that more relevant input and output nodes deserve a denser connection between them. In order to efficiently evolve the connections, we propose to directly model the architecture without involving weights and biases which significantly reduce the computational complexity of the objective function. The model is optimized via an improved particle swarm optimization algorithm. After the architecture is optimized, the connecting weights and biases are then determined and we find the architecture is robust to corruptions. From experiments, the proposed architecture significantly outperforms existing popular architectures on noise-corrupted images when trained only by pure images.},

Unlike the existing results, here, each agent is allowed to have multiple unknown nonidentical control directions, and continuous communication between neighboring agents is not needed. For each agent, we design a group of novel Nussbaum functions and construct a monotonously increasing sequence in which the effects of our Nussbaum functions reinforce rather than counteract each other. With these efforts, the obstacle caused by the unknown control directions is successfully circumvented. Moreover, an event-triggering mechanism is introduced to determine the time instants for communication, which considerably reduces the communication burden. It is shown that all closed-loop signals are globally uniformly bounded and the tracking errors can converge to an arbitrarily small residual set. Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

  abstract     = {In this article, a deep probability model, called the discriminative mixture variational autoencoder (DMVAE), is developed for the feature extraction in semisupervised learning. The DMVAE consists of three parts: 1) the encoding; 2) decoding; and 3) classification modules. In the encoding module, the encoder projects the observation to the latent space, and then the latent representation is fed to the decoding part, which depicts the generative process from the hidden variable to data. In particular, the decoding module in our DMVAE partitions the observed dataset into some clusters via multiple decoders whose number is automatically determined via the Dirichlet process (DP) and learns a probability distribution for each cluster. Compared to the standard variational autoencoder (VAE) describing all data with a single probability function, the DMVAE has the capacity to give a more accurate description for observations, thus improving the characterization ability of the extracted features, especially for the data with complex distribution. Moreover, to obtain a discriminative latent space, the class labels of labeled data are introduced to restrict the feature learning via a softmax classifier, with which the minimum entropy of the predicted labels for the features from unlabeled data can also be guaranteed. Finally, the joint optimization of the marginal likelihood, label, and entropy constraints makes the DMVAE have higher classification confidence for unlabeled data while accurately classifying the labeled data, ultimately leading to better performance. Experiments on several benchmark datasets and the measured radar echo dataset show the advantages of our DMVAE-based semisupervised classification over other related methods.},

For a minimization problem, the proposed algorithm incorporates the regression technique based on a neighborhood structure to predict a descent direction. The descent direction is then adopted to generate new potential offspring around the best solution obtained so far. The proposed algorithm is compared with 12 popular algorithms on two benchmark suites with up to 30 decision variables. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm shows clear advantages when dealing with unimodal and smooth problems, and is better than or competitive with other peer algorithms in terms of the overall performance.

  abstract     = {Encouraging the agent to explore has always been an important and challenging topic in the field of reinforcement learning (RL). Distributional representation for network parameters or value functions is usually an effective way to improve the exploration ability of the RL agent. However, directly changing the representation form of network parameters from fixed values to function distributions may cause algorithm instability and low learning inefficiency. Therefore, to accelerate and stabilize parameter distribution learning, a novel inference-based posteriori parameter distribution optimization (IPPDO) algorithm is proposed. From the perspective of solving the evidence lower bound of probability, we, respectively, design the objective functions for continuous-action and discrete-action tasks of parameter distribution optimization based on inference. In order to alleviate the overestimation of the value function, we use multiple neural networks to estimate value functions with Retrace, and the smaller estimate participates in the network parameter update; thus, the network parameter distribution can be learned. After that, we design a method used for sampling weight from network parameter distribution by adding an activation function to the standard deviation of parameter distribution, which achieves the adaptive adjustment between fixed values and distribution. Furthermore, this IPPDO is a deep RL (DRL) algorithm based on off-policy, which means that it can effectively improve data efficiency by using off-policy techniques such as experience replay. We compare IPPDO with other prevailing DRL algorithms on the OpenAI Gym and MuJoCo platforms. Experiments on both continuous-action and discrete-action tasks indicate that IPPDO can explore more in the action space, get higher rewards faster, and ensure algorithm stability.},

The advantage of this granular neural system relies on its transparency and simplicity while being competitive to state-of-the-art classifiers. Despite their relative empirical success in terms of prediction rates, there are limited studies on FRCNs’ dynamic properties and how their building blocks contribute to the algorithm’s performance. In this article, we theoretically study these issues and conclude that boundary and negative neurons always converge to a unique fixed-point attractor. Moreover, we demonstrate that negative neurons have no impact on the algorithm’s performance and that the ranking of positive neurons is invariant. Moved by our theoretical findings, we propose two simpler fuzzy-rough classifiers that overcome the detected issues and maintain the competitive prediction rates of this classifier. Toward the end, we present a case study concerned with image classification, in which a convolutional neural network is coupled with one of the simpler models derived from the theoretical analysis of the FRCN model. The numerical simulations suggest that once the features have been extracted, our granular neural system performs as well as other RNNs.},

To address this issue, in this article, a novel unsupervised deep-learning-based FE method is proposed, which is trained in an end-to-end style. The proposed framework consists of an encoder subnetwork and a decoder subnetwork. The structure of the two subnetworks is symmetric for obtaining better downsampling and upsampling representation. Considering both spectral and spatial information, 3-D all convolution nets and deconvolution nets are used to structure the encoder subnetwork and decoder subnetwork, respectively. However, 3-D convolution and deconvolution kernels bring more parameters, which can deteriorate the quality of the obtained features. To alleviate this problem, a novel cost function with a sparse regular term is designed to obtain more robust feature representation. Experimental results on publicly available datasets indicate that the proposed method can obtain robust and effective features for subsequent classification tasks.},

When data are represented with multimodal and high-dimensional features and only limited supervision information is available, these approaches are inevitably confronted with a series of critical problems: 1) naive concatenation of feature vectors can cause the curse of dimensionality in learning metrics and 2) ignorance of utilizing massive unlabeled data may lead to overfitting. To mitigate this deficiency, we develop a semisupervised Laplace-regularized multimodal metric-learning method in this work, which explores a joint formulation of multiple metrics as well as weights for learning appropriate distances: 1) it learns a global optimal distance metric on each feature space and 2) it searches the optimal combination weights of multiple features.

  abstract     = {Feature selection is one of the most frequent tasks in data mining applications. Its ability to remove useless and redundant features improves the classification performance and gains knowledge about a given problem makes feature selection a common first step in data mining. In many feature selection applications, we need to combine the results of different feature selection processes. The two most common scenarios are the ensembles of feature selectors and the scaling up of feature selection methods using a data division approach. The standard procedure is to store the number of times every feature has been selected as a vote for the feature and then evaluate different selection thresholds with a certain criterion to obtain the final subset of selected features. However, this method is suboptimal as the relationships of the features are not considered in the voting process. Two redundant features may be selected a similar number of times due to the different sets of instances used each time. Thus, a voting scheme would tend to select both of them. In this article, we present a new approach: instead of using only the number of times a feature has been selected, the approach considers how many times the features have been selected together by a feature selection algorithm. The proposal is based on constructing an undirected graph where the vertices are the features, and the edges count the number of times every pair of instances has been selected together. This graph is used to select the best subset of features, avoiding the redundancy introduced by the voting scheme. The proposal improves the results of the standard voting scheme in both ensembles of feature selectors and data division methods for scaling up feature selection.},

As in the Bayesian probability theory, the DS theoretic (DST) conditional plays a pivotal role in DST strategies for evidence updating and fusion. However, a major limitation in employing the DST framework in practical implementations is the absence of an efficient and feasible computational framework to overcome the prohibitive computational burden DST operations entail. The work in this article addresses the pressing need for efficient DST conditional computation via the novel computational model DS-Conditional-All. It requires significantly less time and space complexity for computing the Dempster’s conditional and the Fagin–Halpern conditional, the two most widely utilized DST conditional strategies. It also provides deeper insight into the DST conditional itself, and thus acts as a valuable tool for visualizing and analyzing the conditional computation. We provide a thorough analysis and experimental validation of the utility, efficiency, and implementation of the proposed data structure and algorithms.

  abstract     = {Recent advances in high-throughput single-cell technologies provide new opportunities for computational modeling of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) with an unprecedented amount of gene expression data. Current studies on the Boolean network (BN) modeling of GRNs mostly depend on bulk time-series data and focus on the synchronous update scheme due to its computational simplicity and tractability. However, such synchrony is a strong and rarely biologically realistic assumption. In this study, we adopt the asynchronous update scheme instead and propose a novel framework called SgpNet to infer asynchronous BNs from single-cell data by formulating it into a multiobjective optimization problem. SgpNet aims to find BNs that can match the asynchronous state transition graph (STG) extracted from single-cell data and retain the sparsity of GRNs. To search the huge solution space efficiently, we encode each Boolean function as a tree in genetic programming and evolve all functions of a network simultaneously via cooperative coevolution. Besides, we develop a regulator preselection strategy in view of GRN sparsity to further enhance learning efficiency. An error threshold estimation heuristic is also proposed to ease tedious parameter tuning. SgpNet is compared with the state-of-the-art method on both synthetic data and experimental single-cell data. Results show that SgpNet achieves comparable inference accuracy, while it has far fewer parameters and eliminates artificial restrictions on the Boolean function structures. Furthermore, SgpNet can potentially scale to large networks via straightforward parallelization on multiple cores.},

An adaptive law is presented to reduce the adverse effect arising from input saturation based on a multiply operation solution, and the adaptive law is capable of converging to the specified ratio of the desired input to the saturation boundary while the closed-loop system stabilizes. The neural network is implemented to approximate the unmodeled dynamics. Moreover, the barrier Lyapunov function methodology is utilized to guarantee the assumption that the control system works to constrain the input and full-order states. It is proved that all states of the closed-loop system are uniformly ultimately bounded with the presented constraints under input saturation. Simulation results verify the stability analyses on input saturation and full-order state constraint, which are coincident with the preset boundaries.},

In the cases of fixed networks, the sufficient criteria are established for the presented distributed event-triggered mechanisms with and without using neighbors’ velocities, in order to achieve a better tradeoff between the communication load and system performance. Besides, in the situation of switched networks, the sufficient criterion is established by assuming that the union of the network has a spanning tree. A distributed sampled-data rule is constructed to decide when to update its own and neighbors’ estimated positions, and thus further reduces the unnecessary control cost.

When initiated by an adversary, DoS blocks the local and neighboring communication channels in the network. A distributed DET scheme is utilized to limit transmissions between the neighboring agents. A novel convex optimization approach is proposed that simultaneously co-designs all unknown control and DET parameters. The optimization is based on the weighted sum approach and increases the interevent interval for a predefined consensus convergence rate. In the presence of DoS, the proposed co-design framework is beneficial in two ways: 1) the desired level of resilience to DoS is included as a given (desired) input and 2) the upper bound for guaranteed resilience associated with the proposed co-design approach is less conservative (larger) compared to those obtained from other analytical solutions. A structured tradeoff between relevant features of the MAS, namely, the consensus convergence rate, frequency of event triggerings, and level of resilience to DoS attacks, is established. Simulations based on nonholonomic mobile robots quantify the effectiveness of the proposed implementation.},

Since the SCI consists of not only the pictorial area but also the textual area, the human visual system (HVS) is not equally sensitive to their different distortion types. First, the textual and pictorial regions can be obtained by dividing an input SCI via an SCI segmentation metric. Next, we extract quality-aware features from the textual region and pictorial region, respectively. Then, two different SAEs are trained via an unsupervised approach for quality-aware features that are extracted from these two regions. After the training procedure of the SAEs, the quality-aware features can evolve into more discriminative and meaningful features. Subsequently, the evolved features and their corresponding subjective scores are input into two regressors for training. Each regressor can obtain one output predictive score. Finally, the final perceptual quality score of a test SCI is computed by these two predicted scores via a weighted model. Experimental results on two public SCI-oriented databases have revealed that the proposed scheme can compare favorably with the existing blind image quality assessment metrics.},

Under the rubric of MCDP, the tumor foci to be detected are regarded as solutions of the objective function, the tissue region around the cancer areas represents the parameter space, and the nanorobots loaded with contrast medium molecules for cancer detection correspond to the optimization agents. The process that the nanorobots detect tumors by swimming in the high-risk tissue region can be regarded as the process that the agents search for the solutions of an objective function in the parameter space with some constraints. For multimodal optimization (MMO) aiming to locate multiple optimal solutions in a single simulation run, the niche technology has been widely used. Specifically, the niche genetic algorithm (NGA) has been shown to be particularly effective in solving MMO. It can be used to identify the global optima of multiple hump functions in a running, effectively keep the diversity of the population, and prematurely avoid the genetic algorithm. Learning from the optimization procedure of NGA, we propose the NGA-inspired MCDP in order to locate the tumor targets efficiently while taking into account realistic in vivo propagation and controlling of nanorobots, which is different from the use scenario of the standard NGA. To improve the performance of the MCDP, we also modify the crossover operator of the original NGA from crossing within a population to crossing between two populations. Finally, we present comprehensive numerical examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of the NGA-inspired MCDP when the biological objective function is associated with the blood flow velocity profile caused by tumor-induced angiogenesis.},

  abstract     = {Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) is a preliminary task for estimating phylogenies. It is used for homology inference among the sequences of a set of species. Generally, the MSA task is handled as a single-objective optimization process. The alignments computed under one criterion may be different from the alignments generated by other criteria, inferring discordant homologies and thus leading to different hypothesized evolutionary histories relating the sequences. The multiobjective (MO) formulation of MSA has recently been advocated by several researchers, to address this issue. An MO approach independently optimizes multiple (often conflicting) objective functions at the same time and outputs a set of competitive alignments. However, no conceptual or experimental rational from a real-world application perspective has been reported so far for any MO formulation of MSA. This article work investigates the impact of MO formulation in the context of an important scientific problem, namely, phylogeny estimation. Employing popular evolutionary MO algorithms, we show that: 1) trees inferred based on alignments produced by the existing MSA methods used in practice are substantially worse in quality than the trees inferred based on the alignment’s output by an MO algorithm and 2) even high-quality alignments (according to popular measures available in the literature) may fail to achieve acceptable accuracy in generating phylogenetic trees. Thus, we essentially ask the following natural question: “can a phylogeny-aware (i.e., application-aware) metric guide in selecting appropriate MO formulations to ensure better phylogeny estimation?” Here, we report a carefully designed extensive experimental study that positively answers this question.},

For the no-saturation case, the designed controller has a simple structure and low computation but requires the crude information of the system model. To overcome this weakness, for the saturation case, the controller is redesigned by introducing a novel anti-windup compensator and fuzzy-logic systems (FLSs), where the problem of reducing computational complexity is also considered. The controllers only need local neighbor information instead of global topology information and ensure the practical consensus of the leader-following systems in finite time. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.},

  abstract     = {Robotic grasping ability lags far behind human skills and poses a significant challenge in the robotics research area. According to the grasping part of an object, humans can select the appropriate grasping postures of their fingers. When humans grasp the same part of an object, different poses of the palm will cause them to select different grasping postures. Inspired by these human skills, in this article, we propose new grasping posture prediction networks (GPPNs) with multiple inputs, which acquire information from the object image and the palm pose of the dexterous hand to predict appropriate grasping postures. The GPPNs are further combined with grasping rectangle detection networks (GRDNs) to construct multilevel convolutional neural networks (ML-CNNs). In this study, a force-closure index was designed to analyze the grasping quality, and force-closure grasping postures were generated in the GraspIt! environment. Depth images of objects were captured in the Gazebo environment to construct the dataset for the GPPNs. Herein, we describe simulation experiments conducted in the GraspIt! environment, and present our study of the influences of the image input and the palm pose input on the GPPNs using a variable-controlling approach. In addition, the ML-CNNs were compared with the existing grasp detection methods. The simulation results verify that the ML-CNNs have a high grasping quality. The grasping experiments were implemented on the Shadow hand platform, and the results show that the ML-CNNs can accurately complete grasping of novel objects with good performance.},

For such systems, the scheduling of the data transmission as well as some particular design of the controller can be equally important. From this observation, we propose a dual channel-aware scheduling strategy under the packet-based model predictive control framework, which integrates a decentralized channel-aware access strategy for each sensor, a centralized access strategy for the controllers, and a packet-based predictive controller to stabilize each control system. First, the decentralized scheduling strategy for each sensor is set in a noncooperative game framework and is then designed with asymptotical convergence. Then, the central scheduler for the controllers takes advantage of a prioritized threshold strategy, which outperforms a random one neglecting the information of the channel gains. Finally, we prove the stability for each system by constructing a new Lyapunov function, and further reveal the dependence of the control system stability on the prediction horizon and successful access probabilities of each sensor and controller. These theoretical results are successfully verified by numerical simulation.},

Second, by combining the potential function technique, output regulation theory, and adaptive control technique, an event-triggered observer is applied to estimate both the leader’s system matrix and trajectory, which can work in parallel with the connectivity-preserving event-triggered controller.

Sufficient conditions for the existence of such a controller are established by applying novel techniques to its stochastic transfer matrix, and they are all presented with solvable forms. Particularly, both dwell times of the jump signal and distribution properties of stochastic scheduling are considered and proved to have played positive roles in obtaining better performance and applications. Two special situations about no jump systems with constant and varied dwell times are further studied, respectively.

  abstract     = {Most reference vector-based decomposition algorithms for solving multiobjective optimization problems may not be well suited for solving problems with irregular Pareto fronts (PFs) because the distribution of predefined reference vectors may not match well with the distribution of the Pareto-optimal solutions. Thus, the adaptation of the reference vectors is an intuitive way for decomposition-based algorithms to deal with irregular PFs. However, most existing methods frequently change the reference vectors based on the activeness of the reference vectors within specific generations, slowing down the convergence of the search process. To address this issue, we propose a new method to learn the distribution of the reference vectors using the growing neural gas (GNG) network to achieve automatic yet stable adaptation. To this end, an improved GNG is designed for learning the topology of the PFs with the solutions generated during a period of the search process as the training data. We use the individuals in the current population as well as those in previous generations to train the GNG to strike a balance between exploration and exploitation. Comparative studies conducted on popular benchmark problems and a real-world hybrid vehicle controller design problem with complex and irregular PFs show that the proposed method is very competitive.},

This article also advances the GCRC theory by exploring theoretical conditions on the general regularization matrix. A key drawback of CRC and SRC is that they fail to use the label information of training data and are essentially unsupervised in computing the representation vector. This largely compromises the discriminative ability of the learned representation vector and impedes the classification performance. Guided by the GCRC theory, we propose a novel RC method referred to as discriminative RC (DRC). The proposed DRC method has the following three desirable properties: 1) discriminability: DRC can leverage the label information of training data and is supervised in both representation and classification, thus improving the discriminative ability of the representation vector; 2) efficiency: it has a closed-form solution and is efficient in computing the representation vector and performing classification; and 3) theory: it also has theoretical guarantees for classification. Experimental results on benchmark databases demonstrate both the efficacy and efficiency of DRC for multiclass classification.},

It is worth noting that the state in noise work time is discretely observed rather than continuously. Meanwhile, some sufficient conditions are presented based on stochastic analytical techniques and the Lyapunov method. Besides, the upper bounds of noise rest rate and the time lag between two consecutive observations are estimated. Moreover, it is clear that CDNs are easier to achieve the almost surely exponential synchronization when noise control gain becomes larger. To demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of analytical results, two applications about single-link robot arm systems as well as second-order oscillator systems are given.

  abstract     = {Dynamic multiobjective optimization problem (DMOP) denotes the multiobjective optimization problem, which contains objectives that may vary over time. Due to the widespread applications of DMOP existed in reality, DMOP has attracted much research attention in the last decade. In this article, we propose to solve DMOPs via an autoencoding evolutionary search. In particular, for tracking the dynamic changes of a given DMOP, an autoencoder is derived to predict the moving of the Pareto-optimal solutions based on the nondominated solutions obtained before the dynamic occurs. This autoencoder can be easily integrated into the existing multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (EAs), for example, NSGA-II, MOEA/D, etc., for solving DMOP. In contrast to the existing approaches, the proposed prediction method holds a closed-form solution, which thus will not bring much computational burden in the iterative evolutionary search process. Furthermore, the proposed prediction of dynamic change is automatically learned from the nondominated solutions found along the dynamic optimization process, which could provide more accurate Pareto-optimal solution prediction. To investigate the performance of the proposed autoencoding evolutionary search for solving DMOP, comprehensive empirical studies have been conducted by comparing three state-of-the-art prediction-based dynamic multiobjective EAs. The results obtained on the commonly used DMOP benchmarks confirmed the efficacy of the proposed method.},

However, most existing methods do not simultaneously integrate them into a unified optimization objective for further improving the learning efficiency. In this article, we propose a novel cross-domain recognition algorithm framework by integrating both of them. Specifically, we reduce the discrepancies in both the conditional distribution and marginal distribution between different domains in order to learn a new feature representation which pulls the data from different domains closer on the whole. However, the data from different domains but the same class cannot interlace together enough and thus it is not reasonable to mix them for training a single classifier. To this end, we further propose to learn double classifiers on the respective domain and require that they dynamically approximate to each other during learning. This guarantees that we finally learn a suitable classifier from the double classifiers by using the strategy of classifier fusion. The experiments show that the proposed method outperforms over the state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {The output tracking control problem is investigated in this article. First, a new tradeoff performance index is presented for single-input–multioutput (SIMO) systems. Based on the frequency-domain method, the tracking performance limitations under time delay, packet loss, and channel noise effects are derived. We use a bivariate stochastic process to model the packet loss, and assume that channel noise is additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). Two explicit expressions of the best tradeoff performance are given with the single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) and two-degree-of-freedom (TDOF) control structures. It is shown that the tracking control performance has a close relation with the intrinsic characteristic of the plant, as well as the time delay, packet-dropouts rate, and power spectral density of AWGN. We also demonstrate that compared with the SDOF control structure, the TDOF control structure can improve the systems’ attainable performance. A simulation example is finally discussed to validate the conclusions.},

  abstract     = {For wireless cyber–physical systems (CPSs) suffering jamming attacks, an optimal resilient control method is proposed through a novel cross-layer dynamic game structure in this article. To confirm to practical conditions of the cyber-layer, incomplete communication information is taken into consideration, and a Bayesian Stackelberg game approach is utilized to model interactions between a smart jammer and a cyber-user. Then, an $H_{\infty }$ optimal resilient controller is studied for the closed-loop system with jam-induced packet losses and external disturbance in the sense of physical layer. With assumptions that the smart jammer has abilities of decoding system inputs and states, the changes of the jamming strategy are studied, and a coupled design between cyber and physical layers is presented with an algorithm to depict the dynamic variations of the CPSs. Moreover, the convergence of the proposed algorithm is also discussed. To validate the advantages of the proposed methods, a numerical simulation is performed in the end.},

By defining an optimal tracking control problem, using a discounted cost function and state-dependent Riccati equation (SDRE) approach, a new partitioning algorithm is proposed to capture the heterogeneity in robots dynamics. The considered partitioning cost, which is a state-dependent proximity metric, penalizes both the tracking error and the control input energy that occurs during the movement of a robot, on a straight line, to an arbitrary node of the graph in a predefined finite time. We show that the size of the subgraph associated with each robot depends on its resources and capabilities in comparison to its neighbors. Also, a distributed deployment strategy is proposed to optimally distribute robots aiming at persistently monitoring specified regions of interest. Finally, a series of simulations and experimental studies is carried out to demonstrate the viability and efficacy of the proposed methodology in deploying heterogeneous multiagent systems.},

The synchronously acquired multimodal motion signals from ten subjects are used as the inputs of the architecture independently. Six classification-based and two rule-based fusion algorithms are evaluated for performance comparisons. The recognition metrics under the determined architecture are further used to assess technical skills. The experimental results indicate that the proposed architecture can achieve the overall accuracy of 96.41\%, much higher than that of a single-layer recognition architecture (92.85\%). In addition, the multimodal fusion brings significant performance improvement in comparison with single-modal schemes. Furthermore, the $K$ -means-based skill assessment can obtain an accuracy of 95\% to cluster the attempts made by different skill-level groups.

  abstract     = {This article presents a data-driven method for computing reachable sets where active learning (AL) is used to reduce the computational burden. Set-based methods used to estimate reachable sets typically do not scale well with the state-space dimension, or rely heavily on the existence of a model. If such a model is not available, it is simple to generate state trajectory data by numerically simulating black-box oracles of systems (whose dynamics are unknown) from sampled initial conditions. Using these data samples, the estimation of reachable sets can be posed as a classification problem, wherein AL can intelligently select samples that are most informative and least similar to previously labeled samples. By exploiting submodularity, the actively learned samples can be selected efficiently, with bounded suboptimality. Our proposed framework is illustrated by estimating the domains of attractions of model predictive controllers (MPCs) and reinforcement learners. We also consider a scenario where there are two oracles that differ with respect to evaluation costs and labeling accuracy. We propose a framework to reduce the dependency of the expensive oracle in labeling samples using disagreement-based AL (DBAL). The potential of the DBAL algorithm is demonstrated on a solver selection problem for real-time MPC.},

We construct a bank of observers for FDI in some selected agents for the augmented MAS closed-loop system based on the idea of an unknown input observer (UIO), where the observers for FDI of the entire MAS are updated by the selected agents’ absolute states and relative states between themselves and their neighbors, which avoids utilizing all agents’ absolute states. We run observers for FDI in the selected agents to generate residuals to detect the faulty agent between themselves and their neighbors. Meanwhile, the existence proof of observers for FDI is also presented.

We propose a data-based optimal synchronization control strategy based on a hierarchical and distributed optimal control framework composed of a model reference adaptive control (MRAC) layer and a distributed control layer. In the MRAC layer, the similar-offline MRAC algorithm is developed to make subsystems of MASs track their reference models, respectively. Then, the distributed optimal control problem of nonlinear heterogeneous MASs is transformed into that of homogeneous MASs composed of the reference models and the leader. In the distributed control layer, the distributed reference policy iteration algorithm is proposed to derive the solutions of coupled composite nonlinear Bellman’s equations, which ensure that the homogeneous MASs reach synchronization with optimum. The suboptimal synchronization control is achieved via optimization further. Convergence analysis of both algorithms is rigorously provided.

To overcome this challenge, we propose a multiview spectral clustering method based on robust subspace segmentation in this article. Our proposed algorithm is composed of three modules, that is: 1) the construction of multiple feature matrices from all views; 2) the formulation of a shared low-rank latent matrix by a low rank and sparse decomposition; and 3) the use of the Markov-chain-based spectral clustering method for producing the final clusters. To solve the optimization problem for a low rank and sparse decomposition, we develop an optimization procedure based on the scheme of the augmented Lagrangian method of multipliers.

  abstract     = {Due to the great advances in mobility techniques, an increasing number of point-of-interest (POI)-related services have emerged, which could help users to navigate or predict POIs that may be interesting. Obviously, predicting POIs is a challenging task, mainly because of the complicated sequential transition regularities, and the heterogeneity and sparsity of the collected trajectory data. Most prior studies on successive POI recommendation mainly focused on modeling the correlation among POIs based on users’ check-in data. However, given a user’s check-in sequence, generally, the relationship between two consecutive POIs is usually both time and distance subtle. In this article, we propose a novel POI recommendation system to capture and learn the complicated sequential transitions by incorporating time and distance irregularity. In addition, we propose a feasible way to dynamically weight the decay values into the model learning process. The learned awareness weights offer an easy-to-interpret way to translate how much each context is emphasized in the prediction process. The performance evaluations are conducted on real mobility datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness and practicability of the POI recommendations.

For adapting to these differences, it is appropriate to design networks with proper representational capacities and construct neural layers with corresponding widths. Nevertheless, most of the state-of-the-art methods pay little attention to such situations, and actually fail to handle the disparities. To work with the dissimilitude of tasks’ network designs, this article presents a distributed knowledge-sharing framework called tensor ring multitask learning (TRMTL), in which the relationship between knowledge sharing and original weight matrices is cut up. The framework of TRMTL is flexible, which is not only capable of sharing knowledge across heterogenous networks but also able to jointly learn tasks with varied input sizes, significantly improving performances of data-insufficient tasks. Comprehensive experiments on challenging datasets are conducted to empirically validate the effectiveness, efficiency, and flexibility of TRMTL in dealing with the disparities in MTL.},

The original system is transformed into a Markov jump piecewise-affine system that varies with different operating regions. The fuzzy rules are dependent on the system mode, and accordingly, the partition of the state space is mode dependent. To analyze the stochastic stability of the estimation error system, a novel mode-dependent piecewise Lyapunov function is constructed, in which the region indices of both the plant state and the estimator state are mode dependent. Then, the existence for a simultaneously mode-dependent and region-dependent fuzzy affine estimator is investigated by virtue of the $\mathcal {S}$ -procedure and ellipsoidal outer approximation such that the estimation error system is stochastically stable with a prescribed $\mathcal { H}_{\infty }$ performance. In the end, an illustrative example of a tunnel diode circuit is adopted to showcase the effectiveness and practicability of the developed state estimation strategy.},

  abstract     = {Discriminative correlation filter (DCF) has contributed tremendously to address the problem of object tracking benefitting from its high computational efficiency. However, it has suffered from performance degradation in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) tracking. This article presents a novel semantic-aware real-time correlation tracking framework (SARCT) for UAV videos to enhance the performance of DCF trackers without incurring excessive computing cost. Specifically, SARCT first constructs an additional detection module to generate ROI proposals and to filter any response regarding the target irrelevant area. Then, a novel semantic segmentation module based on semantic template generation and semantic coefficient prediction is further introduced to capture semantic information, which can provide precise ROI mask, thereby effectively suppressing background interference in the ROI proposals. By sharing features and specific network layers for object detection and semantic segmentation, SARCT reduces parameter redundancy to attain sufficient speed for real-time applications. Systematic experiments are conducted on three typical aerial datasets in order to evaluate the performance of the proposed SARCT. The results demonstrate that SARCT is able to improve the accuracy of conventional DCF-based trackers significantly, outperforming state-of-the-art deep trackers.},

However, the balanced bagging is the lack of a unified learning framework. Moreover, it fails to concern the connection of all subsets and the global information of the entire data distribution. To this end, this article puts several balanced subsets into an effective learning framework with a criterion function. In the learning framework, one regularization term called $R_{S}$ establishes the connection and realizes the collaborative learning of all subsets by requiring the consistent outputs of the minority samples in different subsets. Besides, another regularization term called $R_{W}$ provides the global information to each basic classifier by reducing the difference between the direction of the solution vector in each subset and that in the entire dataset. The proposed learning framework is called globalized multiple balanced subsets with collaborative learning (GMBSCL). The experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed GMBSCL.},

The cross-layer attacks threatening the stability of power systems are considered and modeled as an independent Bernoulli process, including denial-of-service (DoS) attacks in the cyber layer and phasor measurement unit (PMU) attacks in the physical layer. By using the Lyapunov theory, an area-dependent Lyapunov function is proposed and the sufficient conditions guaranteeing the system’s asymptotically stability with the area control error (ACE) signals satisfying $\mathcal {H}_{\infty }$ performance are deduced. In simulations, we adopt a four-area power system to verify the resiliency enhancement of the presented distributed fuzzy control strategy against random cross-layer DoS attacks.

Simple models are more likely to generalize well and easy to interpret. However, too much emphasis on minimizing complexity can prevent the discovery of more complex yet more accurate solutions. Genetic programming (GP) has a trend of generating overcomplex models that are difficult to interpret while not being able to generalize well. This work proposes a novel complexity measure based on the Rademacher complexity for GP for symbolic regression. The complexity of an evolved model is measured by the maximum correlation between the model and the Rademacher variables on the selected training instances. Taking minimizing the training error and the Rademacher complexity of the models as the two objectives, the proposed GP method has shown to be much superior to the standard GP on generalization performance. Compared with GP equipped with two state-of-the-art complexity measures, the proposed method still has a notable advance on generating a better front consisting of individuals with lower generalization errors and being simpler in the behavioral complexity. Further analyses reveal that compared with the state-of-the-art methods, the proposed GP method evolves models that are much closer to the target models in the model structure, and have better interpretability.},

This article also proposes a score-level fusion of two distinct domain-specific features, i.e., multiple binarized statistical image feature (BSIF) and DenseNet-based features. However, instead of randomly scrutinizing such features, statistical tests are executed on six predominant iris features to identify the optimal feature set to combine. Particularly, this work emphasizes textured-lens-based presentation attacks and aims to identify the type of contact lenses within the iris samples. The experimental analysis depicts that the domain-specific features substantially outperform the generic features while discriminating live iris from the artifacts. Furthermore, the proposed fusion-based approach is assessed on three iris datasets and the outcomes are compared with various state of the arts using three validation protocols in terms of equal error rate (EER). The comparative analysis perceived that the proposed method obtains a significant performance gain over the existing approaches and offers an improved benchmark for both, iris liveness detection and contact lens identification.},

In view of this property, an adaptive distributed backstepping design procedure is presented that guarantees boundedness and regulation of the proposed variables. This design procedure ensures not only the desired asymptotic output consensus but also the uniform boundedness of all closed-loop variables.

A primary challenge of this problem is the prohibitively high computational cost when dealing with large-scale networks. We attempt to develop a more efficient approach from a novel graph-theoretical perspective. First, a weighted directed graph structure called the optimal state transition graph (OSTG) is established, whose edges encode the optimal action for each admissible state transition between states reachable from a given initial state subject to various constraints. Then, we reduce the IHOC problem into a minimum-mean cycle (MMC) problem in the OSTG. Finally, we develop an algorithm that can quickly find a particular MMC by resorting to Karp’s algorithm in the graph theory and construct an optimal switching control law based on state feedback. The time complexity analysis shows that our algorithm, albeit still running in exponential time, can outperform all the existing methods in terms of time efficiency. A 16-state-3-input signaling network in leukemia is used as a benchmark to test its effectiveness. Results show that the proposed graph-theoretical approach is much more computationally efficient and can reduce the running time dramatically: it runs hundreds or even thousands of times faster than the existing methods.

To internally enhance the representation capacity of feature maps with high spatial resolution, we delicately design the context-aware block (CAB). CAB exploits pyramidal dilated convolutions to incorporate multilevel contextual information without losing the original resolution of feature maps. Then, we assemble CAB to the end of the truncated backbone network (e.g., VGG16) with a relatively small downsampling factor (e.g., 8) and cast off all following layers. CAB Net can capture both basic visual patterns as well as semantical information of small objects, thus improving the performance of small object detection. Experiments conducted on the benchmark Tsinghua-Tencent 100K and the Airport dataset show that CAB Net outperforms other top-performing detectors by a large margin while keeping real-time speed, which demonstrates the effectiveness of CAB Net for small object detection.},

  abstract     = {The multidimensional knapsack problem (MKP) is a well-known combinatorial optimization problem with many real-life applications. In this article, a memetic algorithm based on probability learning (MA/PL) is proposed to solve MKP. The main highlights of this article are two-fold: 1) problem-dependent heuristics for MKP and 2) a novel framework of MA/PL. For the problem-dependent heuristics, we first propose two kinds of logarithmic utility functions (LUFs) based on the special structure of MKP, in which the profit value and weight vector of each item are considered simultaneously. Then, LUFs are applied to effectively guide the repair operator for infeasible solutions and the local search operator. For the framework of MA/PL, we propose two problem-dependent probability distributions to extract the special knowledge of MKP, that is, the marginal probability distribution (MPD) of each item and the joint probability distribution (JPD) of two conjoint items. Next, learning rules for MPD and JPD, which borrow ideas from competitive learning and binary Markov chain, are proposed. Thereafter, we generate MA/PL’s offspring by integrating MPD and JPD, such that the univariate probability information of each item as well as the dependency of conjoint items can be sufficiently used. Results of experiments on 179 benchmark instances and a real-life case study demonstrate the effectiveness and practical values of the proposed MKP.},

  abstract     = {In this article, the optimal control problem for robotic manipulators (RMs) with prescribed constraints is addressed. Considering the environmental conditions and requirements of practical applications, prescribed constraints are imposed on the system states to guarantee the control performance and normal operation of the robotic system. Accordingly, an error transformation function is adopted to cope with the prescribed constraints and generate an equivalent unconstrained error for the convenience of the intelligent control design. In order to improve the learning ability and optimize the control performance, critic learning (CL) is introduced to the control design of the constrained RM based on the transformed equivalent unconstrained system. In addition, the stability analysis is given to illustrate the feasibility of the proposed CL-based control. Finally, simulations are conducted on a two-degree-of-freedom (DOF)-constrained RM to further validate the effectiveness of the proposed controller.},

This problem is in bandit feedback, in the sense that at each time only the cost function value at the committed point is revealed to each node. Then, nodes update their decisions by exchanging information with their neighbors only. To deal with Lipschitz continuous and strongly convex cost functions, a distributed online convex optimization algorithm that achieves sublinear individual regret for every node is developed. The algorithm is built on the algorithm called the push-sum scheme that releases the request of doubly stochastic weight matrices, and the one-point gradient estimator that requires the function value at only one point at every iteration, instead of the gradient information of loss function. The expected regret of our proposed algorithm scales as $\mathcal {O} (T^{2/3} \ln ^{2/3}(T))$ , and $T$ is the number of iterations. To validate the performance of the algorithm developed in this article, we give a simulation of a common numerical example.},

To solve this problem, based on the challenges caused by the varied constraints, we establish a mathematical model and propose a fast adaptive differential evolution algorithm with an adaptive mutation strategy, a parameter adaptation strategy, a repaired strategy, and an enhanced strategy. In the proposed algorithm, we integrate the status information of each solution into the mutation strategy and parameter adaptation scheme to search for the best solution in the irregular feasible region of the operating variables. In addition, a repaired strategy is proposed to repair the infeasible operating variables with unknown bounds, and an enhanced strategy is presented to further improve the objective function value of the best solution.

  abstract     = {Most methods for facial action unit (AU) recognition typically require training images that are fully AU labeled. Manual AU annotation is time intensive. To alleviate this, we propose a novel dual learning framework and apply it to AU detection under two scenarios, that is, semisupervised AU detection with partially AU-labeled and fully expression-labeled samples, and weakly supervised AU detection with fully expression-labeled samples alone. We leverage two forms of auxiliary information. The first is the probabilistic duality between the AU detection task and its dual task, in this case, the face synthesis task given AU labels. We also take advantage of the dependencies among multiple AUs, the dependencies between expression and AUs, and the dependencies between facial features and AUs. Specifically, the proposed method consists of a classifier, an image generator, and a discriminator. The classifier and generator yield face–AU–expression tuples, which are forced to coverage of the ground-truth distribution. This joint distribution also includes three kinds of inherent dependencies: 1) the dependencies among multiple AUs; 2) the dependencies between expression and AUs; and 3) the dependencies between facial features and AUs. We reconstruct the inputted face and AU labels and introduce two reconstruction losses. In a semisupervised scenario, the supervised loss is also incorporated into the full objective for AU-labeled samples. In a weakly supervised scenario, we generate pseudo paired data according to the domain knowledge about expression and AUs. Semisupervised and weakly supervised experiments on three widely used datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method for AU detection and facial synthesis tasks over current works.},

In contrast to traditional collaborative clustering where local structures (information granules) are obtained by running algorithms on the local datasets and communicating findings across sites, we propose a way of characterizing granular data (formed) by forming a suite of higher type information granules to reveal an overall structure of a collection of locally available datasets. Information granules built at the lower level on a basis of local sources of data are weighted by the number of data they represent while the information granules formed at the higher level of hierarchy are more abstract and general, thus facilitating a formation of a hierarchical description of data realized at different levels of detail. The construction of information granules is completed by resorting to fuzzy clustering algorithms (more specifically, the well-known Fuzzy C-Means). In the formation of information granules, we follow the fundamental principle of granular computing, viz. , the principle of justifiable granularity.

This is a novel attempt to introduce the dynamic triggering into the adaptive learning process. The core of this algorithm is the policy iteration technique, which is implemented by two neural networks. A critic network is periodically tuned using the integral reinforcement signal, and an actor network adopts the event-based communication to update the control policy only at triggering instants. For overcoming the deficiency of static triggering, a dynamic triggering rule is proposed to determine the occurrence of events, in which an internal dynamic variable characterized by a first-order filter is defined. Theoretical results indicate that the impulsive system driven by events is asymptotically stable, the network weight is convergent, and the Zeno behavior is successfully avoided. Finally, three examples are provided to demonstrate that the proposed dynamic triggering algorithm can reduce samples and transmissions even more, with guaranteed learning performance.},

The benefit of the additional state information is visible in the performance of the algorithm making the environment dynamic and serving as a connector between the players. We propose a novel learning algorithm based on a global interpolation method that is applied to a laboratory scale modular bulk good system. The thorough analysis of the encouraging results yields to highly interesting insights into the learning dynamics and the process itself.

The echo state network (ESN), a type of efficient recurrent neural network, has been widely used in time-series prediction, but when using ESN, two crucial problems have to be confronted: 1) how to select the optimal subset of input features and 2) how to set the suitable parameters of the model. To solve this problem, the modified biogeography-based optimization ESN (MBBO-ESN) system is proposed for system modeling and multivariate time-series prediction, which can simultaneously achieve feature subset selection and model parameter optimization. The proposed MBBO algorithm is an improved evolutionary algorithm based on biogeography-based optimization (BBO), which utilizes an $S$ -type population migration rate model, a covariance matrix migration strategy, and a Lévy distribution mutation strategy to enhance the rotation invariance and exploration ability. Furthermore, the MBBO algorithm cannot only optimize the key parameters of the ESN model but also uses a hybrid-metric feature selection method to remove the redundancies and distinguish the importance of the input features. Compared with the traditional methods, the proposed MBBO-ESN system can discover the relationship between the input features and the model parameters automatically and make the prediction more accurate. The experimental results on the benchmark and real-world datasets demonstrate that MBBO outperforms the other traditional evolutionary algorithms, and the MBBO-ESN system is more competitive in multivariate time-series prediction than other classic machine-learning models.},

Then, a topology-based connectivity maintenance strategy using a new notion of the formation-guided minimum cost spanning tree is proposed and the corresponding barrier function-based constraints are derived.

  abstract     = {Although many graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs) have achieved superior performances in semisupervised node classification, they are designed from either the spatial or spectral perspective, yet without a general theoretical basis. Besides, most of the existing GCNNs methods tend to ignore the ubiquitous noises in the network topology and node content and are thus unable to model these uncertainties. These drawbacks certainly reduce their effectiveness in integrating network topology and node content. To provide a probabilistic perspective to the GCNNs, we model the semisupervised node classification problem as a topology-constrained probabilistic latent space model, probabilistic graph convolutional network (PGCN). By representing the nodes in a more efficient distribution form, the proposed framework can seamlessly integrate the node content and network topology. When specifying the distribution in PGCN to be a Gaussian distribution, the transductive node classification problems can be solved by the general framework and a specific method, called PGCN with the Gaussian distribution representation (PGCN-G), is proposed. To overcome the overfitting problem in covariance estimation and reduce the computational complexity, PGCN-G is further improved to PGCN-G+ by imposing the covariance matrices of all vertices to possess the identical singular vectors. The optimization algorithm based on expectation–maximization indicates that the proposed method can iteratively denoise the network topology and node content with respect to each other. Besides the effectiveness of this top-down framework demonstrated via extensive experiments, it can also be deduced to cover the existing methods, graph convolutional network, graph attention network, and Gaussian mixture model and elaborate their characteristics and relationships by specific derivations.},

  abstract     = {These days, the synchronization of multiplex networks is an emerging and important research topic. Grounded framework and theory about synchronization and control on multiplex networks are yet to come. This article studies the intralayer synchronization on a multiplex network (i.e., a set of networks connected through interlayer edges), via the pinning impulsive control method. The topologies of different layers are independent of each other, and the individual dynamics of nodes in different layers are different as well. Supra-Laplacian matrices are adopted to represent the topological structures of multiplex networks. Two cases are considered according to impulsive sequences of multiplex networks: 1) pinning controllers are applied to all the layers simultaneously at the instants of a common impulse sequence and 2) pinning controllers are applied to each layer at the instants of distinct impulse sequences. Using the Lyapunov stability theory and the impulsive control theory, several intralayer synchronization criteria for multiplex networks are obtained, in terms of the supra-Laplacian matrix of network topology, self-dynamics of nodes, impulsive intervals, and the pinning control effect. Furthermore, the algorithms for implementing pinning schemes at every impulsive instant are proposed to support the obtained criteria. Finally, numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and correctness of the proposed schemes.},

Through sharing knowledge across the tasks, EMT is able to enhance solving the optimization tasks. However, if knowledge transfer is not properly carried out, the performance of EMT might become unsatisfactory. To address this issue and improve the quality of knowledge transfer among the tasks, a novel multiobjective EMT algorithm based on subspace alignment and self-adaptive differential evolution (DE), namely, MOMFEA-SADE, is proposed in this article. Particularly, a mapping matrix obtained by subspace learning is used to transform the search space of the population and reduce the probability of negative knowledge transfer between tasks. In addition, DE characterized by a self-adaptive trial vector generation strategy is introduced to generate promising solutions based on previous experiences. The experimental results on multiobjective multi/many-tasking optimization test suites show that MOMFEA-SADE is superior or comparable to other state-of-the-art EMT algorithms. MOMFEA-SADE also won the Competition on Evolutionary Multitask Optimization (the multitask multiobjective optimization track) within IEEE 2019 Congress on Evolutionary Computation.},

It is commonly expected that by analyzing these data in an integrated way, one can improve the understanding of a complex biological system. Current methods, however, are prone to overfitting heavy noise such that their applications are limited. High noise is one of the major challenges for multiomics data integration. This may be the main cause of overfitting and poor performance in generalization. A sample reweighting strategy is typically used to cope with this problem. In this article, we propose a robust multimodal data integration method, called SMSPL, which can simultaneously predict subtypes of cancers and identify potentially significant multiomics signatures. Especially, the proposed method leverages the linkages between different types of data to interactively recommend high-confidence samples, adopts a new soft weighting scheme to assign weights to the training samples of each type, and then iterates between weights recalculating and classifiers updating. Simulation and five real experiments substantiate the capability of the proposed method for classification and identification of significant multiomics signatures with heavy noise. We expect SMSPL to take a small step in the multiomics data integration and help researchers comprehensively understand the biological process.},

In this article, we provide a new collaborative teaching KD (CTKD) strategy which employs two special teachers. Specifically, one teacher trained from scratch (i.e., scratch teacher) assists the student step by step using its temporary outputs. It forces the student to approach the optimal path toward the final logits with high accuracy. The other pretrained teacher (i.e., expert teacher) guides the student to focus on a critical region that is more useful for the task. The combination of the knowledge from two special teachers can significantly improve the performance of the student network in KD. The results of experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, Tiny ImageNet, and ImageNet datasets verify that the proposed KD method is efficient and achieves state-of-the-art performance.},

In this article, we address the KLD metric-learning task, which aims at learning the best KLD-type metric from the distributions of datasets. Concretely, first, we extend the conventional KLD by introducing a linear mapping and obtain the best KLD to well express the similarity of data distributions by optimizing such a linear mapping. It improves the expressivity of data distribution, which means it makes the distributions in the same class close and those in different classes far away. Then, the KLD metric learning is modeled by a minimization problem on the manifold of all positive-definite matrices. To deal with this optimization task, we develop an intrinsic steepest descent method, which preserves the manifold structure of the metric in the iteration. Finally, we apply the proposed method along with ten popular metric-learning approaches on the tasks of 3-D object classification and document classification.

  abstract     = {This article studies the secure tracking consensus problem of nonlinear multiagent systems (MASs) against denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. Two types of DoS attacks, i.e., connectivity-maintained attacks and connectivity-broken attacks, are considered. The resulting topologies caused by DoS attacks may destabilize the consensus performance of MASs. Especially under connectivity-broken attacks, the connectivity between agents is destroyed. To deal with these difficulties, a novel defense strategy consisting of distributed observation and decentralized control is proposed. First, a distributed fixed-time observer (DFTO) is prepared for the case of connectivity-maintained attacks, which can quickly and accurately estimate the leader’s information for each follower. Besides, the adverse impact of DoS attacks is completely eliminated. Furthermore, to cope with the problem arising from connectivity-broken attacks, by using an online algorithm of updating label information, an improved resilient DFTO (RDFTO) is further developed, which can preserve those followers having directed paths from the leader to quickly and accurately estimate the leader’s information, without being affected by DoS attacks. The developed DFTO and RDFTO have successfully eliminated or weakened the adverse effects caused by DoS attacks. Subsequently, based on the proposed DFTO/RDFTO with the power integrator technique, a fixed-time controller is finally constructed, which realizes the desired transient performance of consensus tracking in the finite-time interval. The effectiveness of the proposed defense strategy is verified by stability analysis and simulation examples.},

  abstract     = {This article addresses a fundamental question of multiagent knowledge distribution: what information should be sent to whom and when with the limited resources available to each agent? Communication requirements for multiagent systems can be rather high when an accurate picture of the environment and the state of other agents must be maintained. To reduce the impact of multiagent coordination on networked systems, for example, power and bandwidth, this article introduces two concepts for the partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs): 1) action-based constraints that yield constrained-action POMDPs (CA-POMDPs) and 2) soft probabilistic constraint satisfaction for the resulting infinite-horizon controllers. To enable constraint analysis over an infinite horizon, an unconstrained policy is first represented as a finite-state controller (FSC) and optimized with policy iteration. The FSC representation then allows for a combination of the Markov chain Monte Carlo and discrete optimization to improve the probabilistic constraint satisfaction of the controller while minimizing the impact on the value function. Within the CA-POMDP framework, we then propose intelligent knowledge distribution (IKD) which yields per-agent policies for distributing knowledge between agents subject to interaction constraints. Finally, the CA-POMDP and IKD concepts are validated using an asset tracking problem where multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with heterogeneous sensors collaborate to localize a ground asset to assist in avoiding unseen obstacles in a disaster area. The IKD model was able to maintain asset tracking through multiagent communications while only violating soft power and bandwidth constraints 3\% of the time, while greedy and naive approaches violated constraints more than 60\% of the time.},

As it is practically challenging to capture local and subtle disease-associated abnormalities directly from the whole-brain sMRI, most of those deep-learning approaches empirically preselect disease-associated sMRI brain regions for model construction. Considering that such isolated selection of potentially informative brain locations might be suboptimal, very few methods have been proposed to perform disease-associated discriminative region localization and disease diagnosis in a unified deep-learning framework. However, those methods based on task-oriented discriminative localization still suffer from two common limitations, that is: 1) identified brain locations are strictly consistent across all subjects, which ignores the unique anatomical characteristics of each brain and 2) only limited local regions/patches are used for model training, which does not fully utilize the global structural information provided by the whole-brain sMRI. In this article, we propose an attention-guided deep-learning framework to extract multilevel discriminative sMRI features for dementia diagnosis. Specifically, we first design a backbone fully convolutional network to automatically localize the discriminative brain regions in a weakly supervised manner. Using the identified disease-related regions as spatial attention guidance, we further develop a hybrid network to jointly learn and fuse multilevel sMRI features for CAD model construction. Our proposed method was evaluated on three public datasets (i.e., ADNI-1, ADNI-2, and AIBL), showing superior performance compared with several state-of-the-art methods in both tasks of AD diagnosis and MCI conversion prediction.},

  abstract     = {High-dimensional problems are ubiquitous in many fields, yet still remain challenging to be solved. To tackle such problems with high effectiveness and efficiency, this article proposes a simple yet efficient stochastic dominant learning swarm optimizer. Particularly, this optimizer not only compromises swarm diversity and convergence speed properly, but also consumes as little computing time and space as possible to locate the optima. In this optimizer, a particle is updated only when its two exemplars randomly selected from the current swarm are its dominators. In this way, each particle has an implicit probability to directly enter the next generation, making it possible to maintain high swarm diversity. Since each updated particle only learns from its dominators, good convergence is likely to be achieved. To alleviate the sensitivity of this optimizer to newly introduced parameters, an adaptive parameter adjustment strategy is further designed based on the evolutionary information of particles at the individual level. Finally, extensive experiments on two high dimensional benchmark sets substantiate that the devised optimizer achieves competitive or even better performance in terms of solution quality, convergence speed, scalability, and computational cost, compared to several state-of-the-art methods. In particular, experimental results show that the proposed optimizer performs excellently on partially separable problems, especially partially separable multimodal problems, which are very common in real-world applications. In addition, the application to feature selection problems further demonstrates the effectiveness of this optimizer in tackling real-world problems.},

  abstract     = {As artificial systems are starting to be widely deployed in real-world settings, it becomes critical to provide them with the ability to discriminate between different informants and to learn from reliable sources. Moreover, equipping an artificial agent to infer beliefs may improve the collaboration between humans and machines in several ways. In this article, we propose a hybrid cognitive architecture, called Thrive, with the purpose of unifying in a computational model recent discoveries regarding the underlying mechanism involved in trust. The model is based on biological observations that confirmed the role of the midbrain in trial-and-error learning, and on developmental studies that indicate how essential is a theory of mind in order to build empathetic trust. Thrive is build on top of an actor–critic framework that is used to stabilize the weights of two self-organizing maps. A Bayesian network embeds prior knowledge into an intrinsic environment, providing a measure of cost that is used to boostrap learning without an external reward signal. Following a developmental robotics approach, we embodied the model in the iCub humanoid robot and we replicated two psychological experiments. The results are in line with real data, and shed some light on the mechanisms involved in trust-based learning in children and robots.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we introduce a novel approximate optimal decentralized control scheme for uncertain input-affine nonlinear-interconnected systems. In the proposed scheme, we design a controller and an event-triggering mechanism (ETM) at each subsystem to optimize a local performance index and reduce redundant control updates, respectively. To this end, we formulate a noncooperative dynamic game at every subsystem in which we collectively model the interconnection inputs and the event-triggering error as adversarial players that deteriorate the subsystem performance and model the control policy as the performance optimizer, competing against these adversarial players. To obtain a solution to this game, one has to solve the associated Hamilton–Jacobi–Isaac (HJI) equation, which does not have a closed-form solution even when the subsystem dynamics are accurately known. In this context, we introduce an event-driven off-policy integral reinforcement learning (OIRL) approach to learn an approximate solution to this HJI equation using artificial neural networks (NNs). We then use this NN approximated solution to design the control policy and event-triggering threshold at each subsystem. In the learning framework, we guarantee the Zeno-free behavior of the ETMs at each subsystem using the exploration policies. Finally, we derive sufficient conditions to guarantee uniform ultimate bounded regulation of the controlled system states and demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework with numerical examples.},

The multigroup systems consist of cooperative heterogeneous leaders and followers, as well as adversarial attackers. Potential attacks on the multigroup systems consist of unknown unbounded signals generated from the attackers and injected distributedly into the actuator, the local state feedback, and communication channels of each agent to destabilize the synchronization dynamics. In contrast to the existing literature dealing with bounded disturbances, noises, and faults, which are caused unintentionally, this article studies the unknown unbounded attacks that are intentionally designed to jeopardize the system. The control objective is to make each follower’s output trajectory reach the uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) convergence to the time-varying formation reference, that is, the centroid of the multiple leaders’ output trajectories while keeping a predefined time-varying offset with respect to it. Fully distributed attack-resilient control protocols are proposed, without requiring any global information. Lyapunov techniques are used to analyze the stability and UUB synchronization result of the overall closed-loop system. Comparative simulation examples are given to validate the proposed results.},

Due to the fact that the upper bounds of disturbances and the number of actuator faults are unknown, an intermediate control law is designed based on a backstepping strategy, where a compensation term is introduced to eliminate external disturbances and actuator faults. Meanwhile, a novel smooth function is incorporated into the real distributed controller to reduce the effect of quantization on the virtual controller. The proposed distributed controller not only realizes the bipartite tracking control but also ensures that all signals are bounded in the closed-loop systems and the outputs of all followers converge to a neighborhood of the leader output.

First, the proposed method can jointly learn two distinct deep neural networks, which are trained for individual modalities to learn two deep nonlinear transformations for visual feature extraction from the co-embedding feature space. Second, we propose the global loss function for the DCJN, consisting of a discriminative loss and a correlation loss. The discriminative loss aims to minimize the intraclass distance of the extracted features and maximize the interclass distance of such features to a large margin within each modality, while the correlation loss focuses on mitigating the distribution discrepancy across different modalities. Consequently, the proposed method can realize cross-modality feature extraction guided by the defined global loss function to benefit the similarity measure between 2-D images and 3-D models. For a comparison experiment, we contribute the current largest 2-D image-based 3-D model retrieval dataset. Moreover, the proposed method was further evaluated on three popular benchmarks, including the 3-D Shape Retrieval Contest 2014, 2016, and 2018 benchmarks. The extensive comparison experimental results demonstrate the superiority of this method over the state-of-the-art methods.},

Moreover, some new triggering functions are designed for different types of agents, which cannot only ensure that the Zeno behavior can be excluded but also make the upper bound of impulsive interval in the total time sequence satisfy a newly proposed constraint condition. When the expected value of the triggering function of the $i$ th agent is non-negative within an event time interval, the impulsive control will be triggered. If the system achieves the consensus, the triggering events of all agents will not occur after some time. The original system is transformed into the delay system by using the input delay approach. Based on the Lyapunov stability theory, several sufficient delay-independent criteria for mean-square consensus are derived by a class of Halanay impulsive differential inequalities.

  abstract     = {This article introduces a new class of memristor neural networks (NNs) for solving, in real-time, quadratic programming (QP) and linear programming (LP) problems. The networks, which are called memristor programming NNs (MPNNs), use a set of filamentary-type memristors with sharp memristance transitions for constraint satisfaction and an additional set of memristors with smooth memristance transitions for memorizing the result of a computation. The nonlinear dynamics and global optimization capabilities of MPNNs for QP and LP problems are thoroughly investigated via a recently introduced technique called the flux–charge analysis method. One main feature of MPNNs is that the processing is performed in the flux–charge domain rather than in the conventional voltage–current domain. This enables exploiting the unconventional features of memristors to obtain advantages over the traditional NNs for QP and LP problems operating in the voltage–current domain. One advantage is that operating in the flux–charge domain allows for reduced power consumption, since in an MPNN, voltages, currents, and, hence, power vanish when the quick analog transient is over. Moreover, an MPNN works in accordance with the fundamental principle of in-memory computing, that is, the nonlinearity of the memristor is used in the dynamic computation, but the same memristor is also used to memorize in a nonvolatile way the result of a computation.},

Second, the synchronization problem for polynomial networks is characterized as the sum-of-squares (SOS) optimization one. In this way, polynomial Lyapunov functions can be obtained efficiently with SOS programming tools.

  abstract     = {Typical image aesthetics assessment (IAA) is modeled for the generic aesthetics perceived by an “average” user. However, such generic aesthetics models neglect the fact that users’ aesthetic preferences vary significantly depending on their unique preferences. Therefore, it is essential to tackle the issue for personalized IAA (PIAA). Since PIAA is a typical small sample learning (SSL) problem, existing PIAA models are usually built by fine-tuning the well-established generic IAA (GIAA) models, which are regarded as prior knowledge. Nevertheless, this kind of prior knowledge based on “average aesthetics” fails to incarnate the aesthetic diversity of different people. In order to learn the shared prior knowledge when different people judge aesthetics, that is, learn how people judge image aesthetics, we propose a PIAA method based on meta-learning with bilevel gradient optimization (BLG-PIAA), which is trained using individual aesthetic data directly and generalizes to unknown users quickly. The proposed approach consists of two phases: 1) meta-training and 2) meta-testing. In meta-training, the aesthetics assessment of each user is regarded as a task, and the training set of each task is divided into two sets: 1) support set and 2) query set. Unlike traditional methods that train a GIAA model based on average aesthetics, we train an aesthetic meta-learner model by bilevel gradient updating from the support set to the query set using many users’ PIAA tasks. In meta-testing, the aesthetic meta-learner model is fine-tuned using a small amount of aesthetic data of a target user to obtain the PIAA model. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art PIAA metrics, and the learned prior model of BLG-PIAA can be quickly adapted to unseen PIAA tasks.},

  abstract     = {Link weight prediction is an important subject in network science and machine learning. Its applications to social network analysis, network modeling, and bioinformatics are ubiquitous. Although this subject has attracted considerable attention recently, the performance and interpretability of existing prediction models have not been well balanced. This article focuses on an unsupervised mixed strategy for link weight prediction. Here, the target attribute is the link weight, which represents the correlation or strength of the interaction between a pair of nodes. The input of the model is the weighted adjacency matrix without any preprocessing, as widely adopted in the existing models. Extensive observations on a large number of networks show that the new scheme is competitive to the state-of-the-art algorithms concerning both root-mean-square error and Pearson correlation coefficient metrics. Analytic and simulation results suggest that combining the weight consistency of the network and the link weight-associated latent factors of the nodes is a very effective way to solve the link weight prediction problem.},

Conventional unsupervised multiview dimension reduction (UMDR) methods are usually conducted in an offline manner and may fail in many real-world applications, where data arrive sequentially and the data distribution changes periodically. Moreover, satisfying the requirements of high memory consumption and expensive retraining of the time cost in large-scale scenarios are difficult. To remedy these drawbacks, we propose an online UMDR (OUMDR) framework. OUMDR aims to seek a low-dimensional and informative consensus representation for streaming multiview data. View-specific weights are also learned in this article to reflect the contributions of different views to the final consensus presentation. A specific model called OUMDR-E is developed by introducing the exclusive group LASSO (EG-LASSO) to explore the intraview and interview correlations. Then, we develop an efficient iterative algorithm with limited memory and time cost requirements for optimization, where the convergence of each update is theoretically guaranteed. We evaluate the proposed approach in video-based expression recognition applications. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our approach in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency.},

Although existing results are sufficient for the extremely tiny errors in high-precision machines, they need to be improved for low-precision cases. This article presents an understanding of the learning algorithm in computers with floats. The performances of three gradient descents with the floating domain are investigated when the objective function is smooth. When the function is assumed to have the PŁ condition, the convergence speed can be improved. We proved that for floating gradient descent to obtain an error with $\epsilon $ , the iteration is $O(1/\epsilon)$ for the general smooth case, and $O(\ln (1/\epsilon))$ for the PŁ case. But $\epsilon $ should be larger than the $s$ -bit machine epsilon $\delta (s)$ in the deterministic case, that is, $\epsilon \geq \Omega (\delta (s))$ , while $\epsilon \geq \Omega (\sqrt {\delta (s)})$ for the stochastic case. Floating stochastic and sign gradient descents can both output an $\epsilon $ noised result in $O(1/\epsilon ^{2})$ iterations.},

This framework can measure different types of uncertainties from the model and data for grasping target recognition in realistic and challenging scenarios. A probability calibration network was developed to fuse the uncertainty measures into one calibrated probability for online decision making. We formulated the problem as the prediction of grasping target while arm reaching.

  abstract     = {Face verification can be regarded as a two-class fine-grained visual-recognition problem. Enhancing the feature’s discriminative power is one of the key problems to improve its performance. Metric-learning technology is often applied to address this need while achieving a good tradeoff between underfitting, and overfitting plays a vital role in metric learning. Hence, we propose a novel ensemble cascade metric-learning (ECML) mechanism. In particular, hierarchical metric learning is executed in a cascade way to alleviate underfitting. Meanwhile, at each learning level, the features are split into nonoverlapping groups. Then, metric learning is executed among the feature groups in the ensemble manner to resist overfitting. Considering the feature distribution characteristics of faces, a robust Mahalanobis metric-learning method (RMML) with a closed-form solution is additionally proposed. It can avoid the computation failure issue on an inverse matrix faced by some well-known metric-learning approaches (e.g., KISSME). Embedding RMML into the proposed ECML mechanism, our metric-learning paradigm (EC-RMML) can run in the one-pass learning manner. The experimental results demonstrate that EC-RMML is superior to state-of-the-art metric-learning methods for face verification. The proposed ECML mechanism is also applicable to other metric-learning approaches.},

This article starts with a theoretical analysis of the iterative proportional updating (IPU) algorithm, a representative method in this field, and then gives an extension to consider more social organization types. The IPU method, for the first time, proves to be unable to converge to an optimal population distribution that simultaneously satisfies the constraints from individual and household levels. It is further improved to a bilevel optimization, which can solve such a problem and include more than one type of social organization. Numerical simulations, as well as population synthesis using actual Chinese nationwide census data, support our theoretical conclusions and indicate that our proposed bilevel optimization can both synthesize more social organization types and get more accurate results.},

To further reduce the data transmission, both the measured information of system outputs and switching signal of the SNNs are only allowed to be accessible for the constructed estimator at the certain triggering time instants. Under this consideration, the simultaneous presence of the switching and triggering actions also leads to the asynchronism between the indices of the SNNs and the designed estimator. Unlike the existing event-triggered strategies for the general switched linear systems, the proposed event-triggered mechanism not only allows the occurrence of multiple switches in one triggering interval but also removes the minimum dwell-time constraint on the switched signal. In light of the piecewise Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional theory, sufficient conditions are developed for the estimation error system to be stochastically finite-time bounded with a finite-time specified $H_{\infty }$ performance. Finally, the effectiveness and applicability of the theoretical results are verified by a switched Hopfield neural network.},

Inspired by the dual heuristic programming (DHP) technique, ESN is designed to approximate the costate function, then to derive the optimal controller. As the ESN is characterized by the echo state property (ESP), it is proved that the ESN can successfully approximate the solution to the HJB equation. Besides, to eliminate the requirement for the initial admissible control, a new weight tuning law is designed by adding an alternative condition. The stability of the closed-loop optimal control system and the convergence of the out weights of the ESN are guaranteed by using the Lyapunov theorem in the sense of uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB).

However, in this article, we first find the lower bound on the real part of Laplacian matrices’ nonzero eigenvalues of directed network topologies. Then, we define a test control input and propose a $Q$ -function to derive a QL Bellman equation, which plays an essential part of the QL algorithm. Subsequently, different from the previous works, the output-feedback gain (OFG) matrix of this article can be obtained by limited iterations of the QL algorithm without requiring the information of agent dynamics and network topologies of the saturated DTMASs. Furthermore, the saturated DTMASs can achieve global consensus rather than the semiglobal consensus of the previous results.

  abstract     = {In this article, based on polynomial differential inclusions, we propose a heuristic iterative approach for estimating the domains of attraction for nonpolynomial systems. First, we use the fuzzy model to construct a polynomial differential inclusion for the nonpolynomial system, which can be equivalently written as a time-invariant uncertain polynomial system. Then, beginning with an initial inner estimation, we present an iterative approach to enlarge this initial inner estimation by calculating common Lyapunov-like functions. Furthermore, the domains of attraction are estimated by combining this iterative approach with heuristic construction of differential inclusions. In the end, our heuristic iterative approach is implemented with linear semidefinite programming and then tested on some nonpolynomial examples with comparisons to the existing methods in the literature.},

  abstract     = {Probabilistic linear discriminant analysis (PLDA) is a very effective feature extraction approach and has obtained extensive and successful applications in supervised learning tasks. It employs the squared $L_{2}$ -norm to measure the model errors, which assumes a Gaussian noise distribution implicitly. However, the noise in real-life applications may not follow a Gaussian distribution. Particularly, the squared $L_{2}$ -norm could extremely exaggerate data outliers. To address this issue, this article proposes a robust PLDA model under the assumption of a Laplacian noise distribution, called L1-PLDA. The learning process employs the approach by expressing the Laplacian density function as a superposition of an infinite number of Gaussian distributions via introducing a new latent variable and then adopts the variational expectation–maximization (EM) algorithm to learn parameters. The most significant advantage of the new model is that the introduced latent variable can be used to detect data outliers. The experiments on several public databases show the superiority of the proposed L1-PLDA model in terms of classification and outlier detection.},

Many dynamic multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (DMOEAs) have been put forward to solve DMOPs mainly by incorporating diversity introduction or prediction approaches with conventional multiobjective evolutionary algorithms. Maintaining a good balance of population diversity and convergence is critical to the performance of DMOEAs. To address the above issue, a DMOEA based on decision variable classification (DMOEA-DVC) is proposed in this article. DMOEA-DVC divides the decision variables into two and three different groups in static optimization and changes response stages, respectively. In static optimization, two different crossover operators are used for the two decision variable groups to accelerate the convergence while maintaining good diversity. In change response, DMOEA-DVC reinitializes the three decision variable groups by maintenance, prediction, and diversity introduction strategies, respectively. DMOEA-DVC is compared with the other six state-of-the-art DMOEAs on 33 benchmark DMOPs. The experimental results demonstrate that the overall performance of the DMOEA-DVC is superior or comparable to that of the compared algorithms.},

  abstract     = {In many computer vision applications, an object can be represented by multiple different views. Due to the heterogeneous gap triggered by the different views’ inconsistent distributions, it is challenging to exploit these multiview data for cross-view retrieval and classification. Motivated by the fact that both labeled and unlabeled data can enhance the relations among different views, this article proposes a deep cross-view learning framework called deep semisupervised classes- and correlation-collapsed cross-view learning (DSC 3 L) for cross-view retrieval and classification. Different from the existing methods which focus on the two-view problems, the proposed method learns $U$ (generally $U\geq 2$ ) view-specific deep transformations to gradually project $U$ different views into a shared space in which the projection embraces the supervised learning and the unsupervised learning. We propose collapsing the instances of the same class from all views into the same point, with the instances of different classes into distinct points simultaneously. Second, to exploit the abundant unlabeled $U$ -wise multiview data, we propose to collapse-correlated data into the same point, with the uncorrelated data into distinct points. Specifically, these two processes are formulated to minimize the two Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergences between the conditional distribution and a desirable one, for each instance. Finally, the two KL divergences are integrated into a joint optimization to learn a discriminative shared space. The experimental results on five widely used public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Based on the stability analysis of switched systems, it is proven that the supervisory observer asymptotically converges to a neighborhood of the true system state in the presence of the sensor attacks and bounded disturbances.

Moreover, it is allowed to be disconnected at any time but holds a quite mild joint connectivity property. The system matrix is marginally stable and the input matrix is not of full-row rank. By directly examining the subspace determined by the network, we first establish convergence by resorting to an observability condition. Then, according to joint connectivity, we are able to extend this convergence uniformly to the entire orthogonal complement of the consensus manifold. In this way, we work out the necessary and sufficient condition for exponential consensus. It turns out that, with a suitably designed feedback matrix, exponential consensus can be realized globally and uniformly if and only if a jointly $(\delta,T)$ -connected condition and an observability condition relying only on the system and input matrices are satisfied. We also characterize the lower bound of the convergence rate. Simple yet effective examples are presented to illustrate the findings.},

  abstract     = {The critical step of learning the robust regression model from high-dimensional visual data is how to characterize the error term. The existing methods mainly employ the nuclear norm to describe the error term, which are robust against structure noises (e.g., illumination changes and occlusions). Although the nuclear norm can describe the structure property of the error term, global distribution information is ignored in most of these methods. It is known that optimal transport (OT) is a robust distribution metric scheme due to that it can handle correspondences between different elements in the two distributions. Leveraging this property, this article presents a novel robust regression scheme by integrating OT with convex regularization. The OT-based regression with $L_{2} $ norm regularization (OTR) is first proposed to perform image classification. The alternating direction method of multipliers is developed to handle the model. To further address the occlusion problem in image classification, the extended OTR (EOTR) model is then presented by integrating the nuclear norm error term with an OTR model. In addition, we apply the alternating direction method of multipliers with Gaussian back substitution to solve EOTR and also provide the complexity and convergence analysis of our algorithms. Experiments were conducted on five benchmark datasets, including illumination changes and various occlusions. The experimental results demonstrate the performance of our robust regression model on biometric image classification against several state-of-the-art regression-based classification methods.},

  abstract     = {In the information age of big data, and increasingly large and complex networks, there is a growing challenge of understanding how best to restrain the spread of harmful information, for example, a computer virus. Establishing models of propagation and node immunity are important parts of this problem. In this article, a dynamic node immune model, based on the community structure and threshold (NICT), is proposed. First, a network model is established, which regards nodes carrying harmful information as new nodes in the network. The method of establishing the edge between the new node and the original node can be changed according to the needs of different networks. The propagation probability between nodes is determined by using community structure information and a similarity function between nodes. Second, an improved immune gain, based on the propagation probability of the community structure and node similarity, is proposed. The improved immune gain value is calculated for neighbors of the infected node at each time step, and the node is immunized according to the hand-coded parameter: immune threshold. This can effectively prevent invalid or insufficient immunization at each time step. Finally, an evaluation index, considering both the number of immune nodes and the number of infected nodes at each time step, is proposed. The immune effect of nodes can be evaluated more effectively. The results of network immunization experiments, on eight real networks, suggest that the proposed method can deliver better network immunization than several other well-known methods from the literature.},

The unmodeled and disturbance terms are regarded as extended states for which observers are designed to estimate them. Compensating the players’ dynamics with the observed values, the control laws are designed to achieve the robust seeking of the Nash equilibrium for networked games. First, we consider the case in which the players’ dynamics are subject to time-varying disturbances only. In this case, the seeking strategy is developed by employing a smooth observer based on the proportional–integral (PI) control. By utilizing the designed strategy, we show that the players’ actions would converge to a small neighborhood of the Nash equilibrium. Moreover, the ultimate bound can be adjusted to be arbitrarily small by tuning the control gains. Then, we further consider the case in which both an unmodeled term and a disturbance term coexist in the players’ dynamics. In this case, we adapt the idea from the robust integral of the sign of the error (RISE) method in the strategy design to achieve the asymptotic seeking of the Nash equilibrium. Both strategies are analytically investigated via the Lyapunov stability analysis. The applications of the proposed methods for a network of velocity-actuated vehicles are discussed. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed methods is verified via conducting numerical simulations.},

To solve this problem, recent breakthrough methods, the hindsight experience replay (HER) and aggressive rewards to counter bias in HER (ARCHER), use unsuccessful experiences and consider them as successful experiences achieving different goals, for example, hindsight experiences. According to these methods, hindsight experience is used at a fixed sampling rate during training. However, this usage of hindsight experience introduces bias, due to a distinct optimal policy, and does not allow the hindsight experience to take variable importance at different stages of training. In this article, we investigate the impact of a variable sampling rate, representing the variable rate of hindsight experience, on training performance and propose a sampling rate decay strategy that decreases the number of hindsight experiences as training proceeds. The proposed method is validated with three robotic control tasks included in the OpenAI Gym suite. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves improved training performance and increased convergence speed over the HER and ARCHER with two of the three tasks and comparable training performance and convergence speed with the other one.},

To ensure that the generated dynamic salient map is more concentrated, we design a lightweight discriminator with a local consistency loss LC to identify subtle differences between predicted maps and ground truths. As a result, the proposed network can be further stimulated to produce more realistic saliency maps with smoother boundaries and simpler layer transitions. The added LC loss forces the network to pay more attention to the local consistency between continuous saliency maps.

Based on the augmented nonlinear system, a nonlinear disturbance observer (NDO) is designed to enhance the disturbance rejection ability. Subsequently, the NDO-based ANC scheme is presented by combining the second-order filters with backstepping. The proposed scheme confines all states within the predefined bounds, eliminates the condition on both the known sign and bounds of control gains, improves the robustness of the closed-loop system, and alleviates the computational burden.

Third, to derive a less conservative sufficient condition for the controller design, a new augmented Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional with event-triggered information and triple integral terms is constructed. Meanwhile, by applying a Bessel–Legendre inequality and extended reciprocally convex matrix inequality together, a new control algorithm is derived with less conservatism. Finally, simulations on a cart–damper–spring system are implemented to evaluate and verify the performance and advantages of the proposed algorithm.},

First, a group of local set-membership estimators is deployed to obtain the local ellipsoidal estimate of the true system state. Each estimator is capable of communicating with its neighbors within its communication range. Second, a global estimation approach is proposed which generates a trace-maximal ellipsoid within the intersection of all the local estimation sets with an aim to improve the difference of the local estimate at each time instant. Sufficient conditions for providing a global estimate under both complete and incomplete measurement transmissions are derived. Third, as an application, a modified distributed photovoltaic grid-connected generation system is provided to verify the effectiveness of the developed set-membership global estimation approach. Furthermore, an islanding fault detection scheme is derived based on the calculated global ellipsoidal estimate. Finally, simulation verification of the obtained theoretical results on the distributed generation system is presented.},

Furthermore, new results are extended to fractional-order switched and interconnected systems: for the former, an FE/FA method is proposed which fully reveals the tradeoff between the value of the fractional order, each mode’s dynamics, and switching law; for the latter, a cyclic-small-gain theorem of the fractional-order system is given under which both decentralized and distributed FE/FA methods are proposed.},

  abstract     = {Driving pattern recognition based on features, such as GPS, gear, and speed information, is essential to develop intelligent transportation systems. However, it is usually expensive and labor intensive to collect a large amount of labeled driving data from real-world driving scenes. The lack of a labeled data problem in a driving scene substantially hinders the driving pattern recognition accuracy. To handle the scarcity of labeled data, we have developed a novel discriminative transfer learning method for driving pattern recognition to leverage knowledge from related scenes with labeled data to improve recognition performance in unlabeled scenes. Note that data from different scenes may have different distributions, which is a major bottleneck limiting the performance of transfer learning. To address this issue, the proposed method adopts a discriminative distribution matching scheme with the aid of pseudolabels in unlabeled scenes. It is able to reduce the intraclass distribution disagreement for the same driving pattern among labeled and unlabeled scenes while increasing the interclass distance among different patterns. Pseudolabels in unlabeled scenes are updated iteratively via an ensemble strategy that preserves the data structure while enhancing the model robustness. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we conducted comprehensive experiments on real-world parking lot datasets. The results show that the proposed method can substantially outperform state-of-the-art methods in driving pattern recognition.},

However, the packet delay and clock drift pose a challenge to accuracy, as they entail serious by-hop error accumulation problems in the WSNs. To overcome this, a rapid-flooding multibroadcast time synchronization with real-time delay compensation (RDC-RMTS) is proposed in this article. By using a rapid-flooding protocol, flooding latency of the referenced time information is significantly reduced in the RDC-RMTS. In addition, a new joint clock skew-offset maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE) is developed to obtain the accurate clock parameter estimations and the real-time packet delay estimation. Moreover, an innovative implementation of the RDC-RMTS is designed with an adaptive clock offset estimation. The experimental results indicate that the RDC-RMTS can easily reduce the variable delay and significantly slow the growth of by-hop error accumulation. Thus, the proposed RDC-RMTS can achieve accurate time synchronization in large-scale complex WSNs.},

When the faster evader is allowed to move freely without any constraint, the main issues are how to form an encirclement to trap the evader into the capture domain, how to balance between forming an encirclement and approaching the faster evader, and what conditions make the capture possible. In this article, a distributed pursuit algorithm is proposed to enable pursuers to form an encirclement and approach the faster evader. An algorithm that balances between forming an encirclement and approaching the faster evader is proposed. Moreover, sufficient capture conditions are derived based on the initial spatial distribution and the speed ratios of the pursuers and the evader.

The decision boundaries in the traditional floating centroids neural-network (FCM) classifier are “hard.” These hard boundaries force a point, such as noisy or boundary point, to be assigned to a class exclusively, thereby frequently resulting in misclassification and influencing the performance of optimization methods to train the neural network. A fuzzy strategy combined with floating centroids is introduced to produce “soft” boundaries to handle noisy and boundary points, which increases the chance of discovering the optimal neural network during optimization. In addition, the FFCM adopts a weighted target function to correct the preference to majority classes for imbalanced data. The performance of FFCM is compared with ten classification methods on 32 benchmark datasets by using indicators: average $F$ -measure (Avg.FM) and generalization accuracy. Also, the proposed FFCM is applied to nondestructively estimate the strength grade of cement specimens based on microstructural images. In the experimental results, FFCM achieves the optimal generalization accuracy and Avg.FM on 17 datasets and 21 datasets, respectively; FFCM balances precision and recall better than its competitors for the estimation of cement strength grade.},

  abstract     = {Spikes are the currency in central nervous systems for information transmission and processing. They are also believed to play an essential role in low-power consumption of the biological systems, whose efficiency attracts increasing attentions to the field of neuromorphic computing. However, efficient processing and learning of discrete spikes still remain a challenging problem. In this article, we make our contributions toward this direction. A simplified spiking neuron model is first introduced with the effects of both synaptic input and firing output on the membrane potential being modeled with an impulse function. An event-driven scheme is then presented to further improve the processing efficiency. Based on the neuron model, we propose two new multispike learning rules which demonstrate better performance over other baselines on various tasks, including association, classification, and feature detection. In addition to efficiency, our learning rules demonstrate high robustness against the strong noise of different types. They can also be generalized to different spike coding schemes for the classification task, and notably, the single neuron is capable of solving multicategory classifications with our learning rules. In the feature detection task, we re-examine the ability of unsupervised spike-timing-dependent plasticity with its limitations being presented, and find a new phenomenon of losing selectivity. In contrast, our proposed learning rules can reliably solve the task over a wide range of conditions without specific constraints being applied. Moreover, our rules cannot only detect features but also discriminate them. The improved performance of our methods would contribute to neuromorphic computing as a preferable choice.},

Compared with conventional convolution operations, the time and space complexity of our sparse strided operations are proportional to the number of occupied voxels ${N}$ rather than the input spatial size ${r} ^{3}$ (often N $\ll $ r 3 for LiDAR data). This enables our method to process point clouds at high resolutions (e.g., 2048 3 ) with a high speed (130 ms for classifying a single frame from Velodyne HDL-64). The main structure includes a CNN model built upon our sparse strided operations and a conditional random field (CRF) model to impose spatial consistency on the final predictions. A highly parallel implementation of our system is presented for both CPU-GPU and CPU-only environments. The efficiency and effectiveness of our approach are demonstrated on two public datasets (Semantic3D.net and KITTI).

  abstract     = {Dubins tours represent a solution of the Dubins traveling salesman problem (DTSP) that is a variant of the optimization routing problem to determine a curvature-constrained shortest path to visit a set of locations such that the path is feasible for Dubins vehicle, which moves only forward and has a limited turning radius. The DTSP combines the NP-hard combinatorial optimization to determine the optimal sequence of visits to the locations, as in the regular TSP, with the continuous optimization of the heading angles at the locations, where the optimal heading values depend on the sequence of visits and vice versa. We address the computationally challenging DTSP by fast evaluation of the sequence of visits by the proposed windowing surrogate model (WiSM), which estimates the length of the optimal Dubins path connecting a sequence of locations in a Dubins tour. The estimation is sped up by a regression model trained using close to optimum solutions of small Dubins tours that are generalized for large-scale instances of the addressed DTSP utilizing the sliding-window technique and a cache for already computed results. The reported results support that the proposed WiSM enables fast convergence of a relatively simple evolutionary algorithm to high-quality solutions of the DTSP. We show that with an increasing number of locations, our algorithm scales significantly better than other state-of-the-art DTSP solvers.},

Different from the existing related works, the input delay of each agent is described as an unknown time-varying function and is different from each other in this article. To deal with this problem, for each follower, we first construct a novel distributed observer based on the relative output information to asymptotically estimate the state information of the leader, then we introduce a classical observer to asymptotically estimate the state information of the follower based on its output information. By means of two observers, the leader-following consensus problem is transformed into the stability problem of the nonlinear system with unknown input delays. Subsequently, the distributed controller independent of delays is proposed for each follower by the use of the truncated prediction method under some conditions. Based on the Lyapunov stability theory, it is strictly proved that the distributed controller can render all agents achieving consensus. Finally, the effectiveness of the theoretical results is illustrated on the basis of numerical simulations on a group of single-link manipulators.},

In this article, the hashing-based undersampling ensemble (HUE) is proposed to deal with this problem by constructing diversified training subspaces for undersampling. Samples in the majority class are divided into many subspaces by a hashing method. Each subspace corresponds to a training subset which consists of most of the samples from this subspace and a few samples from surrounding subspaces. These training subsets are used to train an ensemble of classification and regression tree classifiers with all minority class samples. The proposed method is tested on 25 UCI datasets against state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results show that the HUE outperforms other methods and yields good results on highly imbalanced datasets.},

Second, in the proposed weak disambiguation strategy, each candidate label is assigned with a confidence value indicating how likely it is the true label, which aims to reduce the negative effects of wrong ground-truth label assignment in the learning process. Then, two large margins are formulated to combine two types of constraints which are the disambiguation between candidates and noncandidates, and the weak disambiguation for candidates. In the framework of alternating optimization, a new $2n$ -slack variables cutting plane algorithm is developed to accelerate each iteration of optimization.

  abstract     = {Automatic image captioning is to conduct the cross-modal conversion from image visual content to natural language text. Involving computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP), it has become one of the most sophisticated research issues in the artificial-intelligence area. Based on the deep neural network, the neural image caption (NIC) model has achieved remarkable performance in image captioning, yet there still remain some essential challenges, such as the deviation between descriptive sentences generated by the model and the intrinsic content expressed by the image, the low accuracy of the image scene description, and the monotony of generated sentences. In addition, most of the current datasets and methods for image captioning are in English. However, considering the distinction between Chinese and English in syntax and semantics, it is necessary to develop specialized Chinese image caption generation methods to accommodate the difference. To solve the aforementioned problems, we design the NICVATP2L model via visual attention and topic modeling, in which the visual attention mechanism reduces the deviation and the topic model improves the accuracy and diversity of generated sentences. Specifically, in the encoding phase, convolutional neural network (CNN) and topic model are used to extract visual and topic features of the input images, respectively. In the decoding phase, an attention mechanism is applied to processing image visual features for obtaining image visual region features. Finally, the topic features and the visual region features are combined to guide the two-layer long short-term memory (LSTM) network for generating Chinese image captions. To justify our model, we have conducted experiments over the Chinese AIC-ICC image dataset. The experimental results show that our model can automatically generate more informative and descriptive captions in Chinese in a more natural way, and it outperforms the existing image captioning NIC model.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning methods are becoming the de-facto standard for generic visual recognition in the literature. However, their adaptations to industrial scenarios, such as visual recognition for machines, product streamlines, etc., which consist of countless components, have not been investigated well yet. Compared with the generic object detection, there is some strong structural knowledge in these scenarios (e.g., fixed relative positions of components, component relationships, etc.). A case worth exploring could be automated visual inspection for trains, where there are various correlated components. However, the dominant object detection paradigm is limited by treating the visual features of each object region separately without considering common sense knowledge among objects. In this article, we propose a novel automated visual inspection framework for trains exploring structural knowledge for train component detection, which is called SKTCD. SKTCD is an end-to-end trainable framework, in which the visual features of train components and structural knowledge (including hierarchical scene contexts and spatial-aware component relationships) are jointly exploited for train component detection. We propose novel residual multiple gated recurrent units (Res-MGRUs) that can optimally fuse the visual features of train components and messages from the structural knowledge in a weighted-recurrent way. In order to verify the feasibility of SKTCD, a dataset that contains high-resolution images captured from moving trains has been collected, in which 18 590 critical train components are manually annotated. Extensive experiments on this dataset and on the PASCAL VOC dataset have demonstrated that SKTCD outperforms the existing challenging baselines significantly. The dataset as well as the source code can be downloaded online ( https://github.com/smartprobe/SKCD ).},

  abstract     = {In this article, a new intelligent hybrid controller is proposed. The controller is based on the combination of the orthogonal endocrine neural network (OENN) and orthogonal endocrine ANFIS (OEANFIS). The orthogonal part of the controller consists of Chebyshev orthogonal functions, which are used because of their recursive property, computational simplicity, and accuracy in nonlinear approximations. Artificial endocrine influence on the controller is achieved by introducing excitatory and inhibitory glands to the OENN part of the structure, in the form of postsynaptic potentials. These potentials provide a network with the capability of additional self-regulation in the presence of external disturbances. The intelligent structure is trained using a developed learning algorithm, which consists of both offline and online learning procedures: online learning for fitting OENN substructure and offline learning for adjusting OEANFIS parameters. The learning process is expanded by introducing the learning rate adaptation algorithm, which bases its calculations on the sign of the error difference. Finally, the proposed intelligent controller was experimentally tested for control of a nonlinear multiple-input–multiple-output two rotor aerodynamical system. During the test phase, an additional four related intelligent control logics and default PID-based controllers were used, and tracking performance comparisons were performed. The proposed controller showed notably better online results in comparison to other control algorithms. The major deficiencies of the structure are complexity and noticeably large training computation time, but these drawbacks can be neglected if tracking performances of a dynamical system are of the highest importance.},

  abstract     = {Convolutional neural networks (CNNs)-based video quality enhancement generally employs optical flow for pixelwise motion estimation and compensation, followed by utilizing motion-compensated frames and jointly exploring the spatiotemporal correlation across frames to facilitate the enhancement. This method, called the optical-flow-based method (OPT), usually achieves high accuracy at the expense of high computational complexity. In this article, we develop a new framework, referred to as biprediction-based multiframe video enhancement (PMVE), to achieve a one-pass enhancement procedure. PMVE designs two networks, that is, the prediction network (Pred-net) and the frame-fusion network (FF-net), to implement the two steps of synthesization and fusion, respectively. Specifically, the Pred-net leverages frame pairs to synthesize the so-called virtual frames (VFs) for those low-quality frames (LFs) through biprediction. Afterward, the slowly fused FF-net takes the VFs as the input to extract the correlation across the VFs and the related LFs, to obtain an enhanced version of those LFs. Such a framework allows PMVE to leverage the cross-correlation between successive frames for enhancement, hence capable of achieving high accuracy performance. Meanwhile, PMVE effectively avoids the explicit operations of motion estimation and compensation, hence greatly reducing the complexity compared to OPT. The experimental results demonstrate that the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) performance of PMVE is fully on par with that of OPT while its computational complexity is only 1\% of OPT. Compared with other state-of-the-art methods in the literature, PMVE is also confirmed to achieve superior performance in both objective quality and visual quality at a reasonable complexity level. For instance, PMVE can surpass its best counterpart method by up to 0.42 dB in PSNR.},

  abstract     = {Unsupervised domain adaptation (DA) aims to perform classification tasks on the target domain by leveraging rich labeled data in the existing source domain. The key insight of DA is to reduce domain divergence by learning domain-invariant features or transferable instances. Despite its rapid development, there still exist several challenges to explore. At the feature level, aligning both domains only in a single way (i.e., geometrical or statistical) has limited ability to reduce the domain divergence. At the instance level, interfering instances often obstruct learning a discriminant subspace when performing the geometrical alignment. At the classifier level, only minimizing the empirical risk on the source domain may result in a negative transfer. To tackle these challenges, this article proposes a novel DA method, called discriminant geometrical and statistical alignment (DGSA). DGSA first aligns the geometrical structure of both domains by projecting original space into a Grassmann manifold, then matches the statistical distributions of both domains by minimizing their maximum mean discrepancy on the manifold. In the former step, DGSA only selects the density peaks to learn the Grassmann manifold and so to reduce the influences of interfering instances. In addition, DGSA exploits the high-confidence soft labels of target landmarks to learn a more discriminant manifold. In the latter step, a structural risk minimization (SRM) classifier is learned to match the distributions (both marginal and conditional) and predict the target labels at the same time. Extensive experiments on objection recognition and human activity recognition tasks demonstrate that DGSA can achieve better performance than the comparison methods.},

  abstract     = {Both siamese network and correlation filter (CF)-based trackers have exhibited superior performance by formulating tracking as a similarity measure problem, where a similarity map is learned by the correlation between a target template and a region of interest (ROI) with a cosine window. Nevertheless, this window function is usually fixed for various targets and not changed, undergoing significant noise variations during tracking, which easily makes model drift. In this article, we focus on the study of a noise-aware (NA) framework for robust visual tracking. To this end, the impact of various window functions is first investigated in visual tracking. We identify that the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of windowed ROIs makes the above trackers degenerate. At the prediction phase, a novel NA window customized for visual tracking is introduced to improve the SNR of windowed ROIs by adaptively suppressing the variable noise according to the observation of similarity maps. In addition, to further optimize the SNR of windowed pyramid ROIs for scale estimation, we propose to use the particle filter to dynamically sample several windowed ROIs with more favorable signals in temporal domains instead of this pyramid ROIs extracted in spatial domains. Extensive experiments on the popular OTB-2013, OTB-50, OTB-2015, VOT2017, TC128, UAV123, UAV123@10fps, UAV20L, and LaSOT datasets show that our NA framework can be extended to many siamese and CF trackers and our variants obtain superior performance than baseline trackers with a modest impact on efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Generally, decomposition-based evolutionary algorithms in many-objective optimization (MaOEA/Ds) have widely used reference vectors (RVs) to provide search directions and maintain diversity. However, their performance is highly affected by the matching degree on the shapes of the RVs and the Pareto front (PF). To address this problem, this article proposes a self-guided RV (SRV) strategy for MaOEA/Ds, aiming to extract RVs from the population using a modified ${k}$ -means clustering method. To give a promising clustering result, an angle-based density measurement strategy is used to initialize the centroids, which are then adjusted to obtain the final clusters, aiming to properly reflect the population’s distribution. Afterward, these centroids are extracted to obtain adaptive RVs for self-guiding the search process. To verify the effectiveness of this SRV strategy, it is embedded into three well-known MaOEA/Ds that originally use the fixed RVs. Moreover, a new strategy of embedding SRV into MaOEA/Ds is discussed when the RVs are adjusted at each generation. The simulation results validate the superiority of our SRV strategy, when tackling numerous many-objective optimization problems with regular and irregular PFs.},

  abstract     = {The reachable set estimation problem for a class of Markovian jump neutral-type neural networks (MJNTNNs) with bounded disturbances and time-varying delays is tackled in this article. With the aid of the delay partitioning method, a novel stochastic Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional containing triple integral terms is constructed in mode-dependent augmented form. To begin with, transition probabilities of the concerned Markovian jump neural networks (NNs) are considered to be completely known. By employing the integral inequality approach and reciprocally convex combination method, it is proved that all state trajectories which start from the origin by bounded inputs can be constrained by an ellipsoid-like set if a group of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) is feasible. Then, the free-connection weighting matrix technique is utilized to handle the case of partially known transition probabilities. As byproducts, some sufficient conditions are also obtained to guarantee the stochastic stability of the concerned NNs. The validity of the theoretical analysis is confirmed by numerical simulations.},

By using three kinds of FLSs: the uncertain system, the uncertain dead zone, and the uncertain input transfer inverse matrix are approximated using the system function FLS, dead-zone FLS, and input transfer inverse matrix FLS, respectively. After defining the barrier Lyapunov function, the fuzzy-based adaptive tracking controllers are designed, and the fuzzy weights are updated through the proposed adaptive laws. Then, based on the extended finite-time convergence theorem, with the design parameters chosen properly, the target uncertain nonlinear system is guaranteed to be semiglobal practical finite-time stable (SGPFS); and the full-state constraints are not violated while avoiding the effects of the dead zones. Furthermore, a simulation is presented to verify the validity of the proposed algorithm.},

Since time delays are unavoidable in reality, it is basic and crucial for all applications based on NNs to guarantee system stability under the influence of mixed time delays. To better exploit the variation information of time delay, we introduce the switching idea and approaches into mixed time-delay NNs to solve the stability problem. First, the considered mixed time-delay NNs are modeled as the switched NNs by dividing the two classes of time delays, discrete and distributed time delays, into some variable intervals and combining these intervals as new switching modes. With the help of mode-dependent average dwell-time switching, Lyapunov theory, and mathematical techniques, several exponential stability criteria on the modeled switched systems containing different modes are obtained. Moreover, via introducing the mathematical condition of the unstable subsystem in the switching system, a less conservativeness condition on the exponential stability of the modeled NNs is proposed. We perform three examples for testifying the validity of the proposed methods over existing ones.},

The industrial power load forecasting is deeply studied by fusing some machine-learning methods for industrial enterprise power consumers. As a result, a novel power load forecasting method is proposed by taking into account the variation of load characteristics in different regions, industries, and production patterns. First, through the improved $K$ -means clustering analysis, the historical load data are classified as the production patterns to which they belong. Then, the prediction algorithm combining reinforcement learning with particle swarm optimization and the least-squares support vector machine is proposed. Finally, the improved algorithm in this article is used for short-term load forecasting separately by the load data in different patterns after the above processing. The forecasting method in this article is based on data driven with real datasets. The results of the simulation experiment show that the improved prediction algorithm can distinguish the changes in different production patterns and identify the load characteristics of different regions and industries with high prediction accuracy, which has practical application value.},

  abstract     = {This article focuses on tackling the task of the cross-modal image–text retrieval which has been an interdisciplinary topic in both computer vision and natural language processing communities. Existing global representation alignment-based methods fail to pinpoint the semantically meaningful portion of images and texts, while the local representation alignment schemes suffer from the huge computational burden for aggregating the similarity of visual fragments and textual words exhaustively. In this article, we propose a stacked multimodal attention network (SMAN) that makes use of the stacked multimodal attention mechanism to exploit the fine-grained interdependencies between image and text, thereby mapping the aggregation of attentive fragments into a common space for measuring cross-modal similarity. Specifically, we sequentially employ intramodal information and multimodal information as guidance to perform multiple-step attention reasoning so that the fine-grained correlation between image and text can be modeled. As a consequence, we are capable of discovering the semantically meaningful visual regions or words in a sentence which contributes to measuring the cross-modal similarity in a more precise manner. Moreover, we present a novel bidirectional ranking loss that enforces the distance among pairwise multimodal instances to be closer. Doing so allows us to make full use of pairwise supervised information to preserve the manifold structure of heterogeneous pairwise data. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our SMAN consistently yields competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.},

We propose a novel analysis framework from the viewpoint of a state transition matrix. Specifically, according to the inherent linearity, we successfully establish a connection between state transition matrices of the above multileader system and a virtual leader-following system obtained by combining those leaders. This enlightening result relates the containment problem to a consensus one. Then, by analyzing the property of the state transition matrix, we uncover that each component of any follower’s state converges to the convex hull spanned by the corresponding components of the leaders’, provided some mild conditions are satisfied. These conditions are derived in terms of the concept of a positive linear system. A special case of the second-order linear system is further discussed to illustrate these conditions. Moreover, two different design methods of the feedback gain matrix are provided, which additionally require that the network topology contains a united spanning tree all the time.},

In both layers, attitudes and positions are required by the formation geometry. A formation state estimation algorithm is designed to achieve the desired formation states from local neighborhoods. In FWVs, attitude angles are usually achieved from angular velocities, whose measurement error accumulates during integration and leads to divergence of the system. In order to solve this problem, we explore the coupling property between the translational motion and the rotational motion of FWVs, and design a coupling-based estimation method for attitude angles. To compensate for the model uncertainty, the measurement error, and the estimation error, adaptive neural networks are developed together with the control algorithm. The stability of both the control algorithm and the estimation algorithm is guaranteed based on the Lyapunov stability theory.

However, the models of filtering and propagation were based on diverse mathematical formulations, which have not been fully understood. This article aims to explore the properties of both filtering and propagation models from a partial differential equation (PDE) learning perspective. We propose a unified PDE learning framework based on nonlinear reaction–diffusion with a guided map, graph Laplacian, and reaction weight. It reveals that: 1) the guided map and reaction weight determines whether the PDE produces filtering or propagation diffusion and 2) the kernel of graph Laplacian controls the diffusion pattern. Based on the proposed PDE framework, we derive the mathematical relations between different models, including learning to diffusion (LTD) model, label propagation, edit propagation, and edge-aware filter. In practical verification, we apply the PDE framework to design diffusion operations with the adaptive kernel to tackle the ill-posed problem of facial intrinsic image analysis (FIIA). A flexible task-aware FIIA system is built to achieve various facial rendering effects, such as face image relighting and delighting, artistic illumination transfer, illumination-aware face swapping, or transfiguring. Qualitative and quantitative experiments show the effectiveness and flexibility of task-aware FIIA and provide new insights on PDE learning for visual analysis and rendering.},

We first investigate a gradient-feedback scenario, where each agent can access both values and gradients of cost functions and constraint functions owned by itself at the chosen action. Then, we design a distributed primal–dual online learning algorithm and show that the proposed algorithm can achieve the sublinear bounds for both the regret and constraint violations. Furthermore, we extend the gradient-feedback algorithm to a gradient-free setup, where an individual agent has only attained the values of local cost functions and constraint functions at two queried points near the selected action. We develop a bandit version of the previous method and give the explicitly sublinear bounds on the expected regret and expected constraint violations. The results indicate that the bandit algorithm can achieve almost the same performance as the gradient-feedback algorithm under wild conditions.

For this purpose, the general error variance regarding the underlying target plant is first provided to facilitate the subsequent filter design, and then a certain UB on the error variance is constructed by exploiting the stochastic analysis and the induction approach. Furthermore, in view of the inherent sparsity of the sensor network, the gain parameters of the desired distributed filters are determined, and the proposed recursive filtering algorithm is shown to be scalable.

  abstract     = {In this article, the problem of distributed hierarchical fault-tolerant containment control for heterogeneous linear multiagent systems (MASs) is investigated. In most of the existing distributed methods for MASs with system failures, each agent broadcasts its state, or output, or the estimation of state to neighbors. Once an agent is subjected system failures, faults affect the dynamics of other agents over the network, that is, the influence of faults on the agent will propagate with the network. In order to overcome this drawback, a fault-tolerant hierarchical containment control protocol is developed, which includes two layers: 1) the upper layer and 2) the lower layer. The upper layer consists of a virtual system and a cooperative controller to achieve a virtual containment objective. The lower layer consists of an actual system and a fault-tolerant controller to track the upper layer virtual system. Compared with the existing results, the phenomenon of fault propagation can be avoided by introducing the hierarchical design approach, that is, the fault of agent $i$ only affects the dynamics of itself, and does not affect the dynamics of other agents through the network. It is shown that each follower converges asymptotically to a convex hull spanned by leaders with external input. Finally, the developed method is demonstrated by simulation results.},

In this article, we focus on the transfer learning problem for regression under the situations of conditional shift where the source and target domains share the same marginal distribution while having different conditional probability distributions. We propose a new framework called transfer learning based on fuzzy residual (ResTL) which learns the target model by preserving the distribution properties of the source data in a model-agnostic way. First, we formulate the target model by adding fuzzy residual to a model-agnostic source model and reuse the antecedent parameters of the source fuzzy system. Then two methods for bias computation are provided for different considerations, which refer to two ResTL methods called ResTL LS and ResTL RD . Finally, we conduct a series of experiments both on a toy example and several real-world datasets to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {One of the major problems in cancer subtype discovery from multimodal omic data is that all the available modalities may not encode relevant and homogeneous information about the subtypes. Moreover, the high-dimensional nature of the modalities makes sample clustering computationally expensive. In this regard, a novel algorithm is proposed to extract a low-rank joint subspace of the integrated data matrix. The proposed algorithm first evaluates the quality of subtype information provided by each of the modalities, and then judiciously selects only relevant ones to construct the joint subspace. The problem of incrementally updating the singular value decomposition of a data matrix is formulated for the multimodal data framework. The analytical formulation enables efficient construction of the joint subspace of integrated data from low-rank subspaces of the individual modalities. The construction of joint subspace by the proposed method is shown to be computationally more efficient compared to performing the principal component analysis (PCA) on the integrated data matrix. Some new quantitative indices are introduced to measure theoretically the accuracy of subspace construction by the proposed approach with respect to the principal subspace extracted by the PCA. The efficacy of clustering on the joint subspace constructed by the proposed algorithm is established over existing integrative clustering approaches on several real-life multimodal cancer data sets.},

Moreover, updating formulas of the GD algorithm are derived, and a Gaussian updating operator with weighted hierarchical hunting, a chaotic oscillation equation, and a nonlinear modulation coefficient are introduced to improve the hierarchical hunting and the control parameter adjustment of the modified STGWO.

  abstract     = {Recent interests in graph neural networks (GNNs) have received increasing concerns due to their superior ability in the network embedding field. The GNNs typically follow a message passing scheme and represent nodes by aggregating features from neighbors. However, the current aggregation methods assume that the network structure is static and define the local receptive fields under visible connections, which consequently fails to consider latent or high-order structures. Besides, the aggregation methods are known to have a depth dilemma due to the over-smoothness issues. To solve the above shortcomings, we present in this article a compact graph convolutional network framework which defines the graph receptive fields based on diffusion paths and explicitly compresses the neural networks with sparsity regularization. The proposed model seeks to learn from invisible connections and recover the latent proximity. First, we infer the high-order proximity and construct diffusion paths by diffusion samplings. Compared with random walk samplings, the diffusion samplings are based on regions instead of paths. The network inference then obtains accurate weights that can be leveraged to build small but informative receptive fields with salient neighbors. Second, to utilize the deep information while avoiding overfitting, we propose learning a lightweight model by introducing a nonconvex regularizer. Numerical comparisons with the existing network embedding methods under unsupervised feature learning and supervised classification show the effectiveness of our model.},

Nonetheless, existing algorithms usually treat all labels and instances equally, and the complexities of both labels and instances are not taken into consideration during the learning stage. Inspired by the successful application of a self-paced learning strategy in the machine-learning field, we integrate the self-paced regime into the PLL framework and propose a novel self-paced PLL (SP-PLL) algorithm, which could control the learning process to alleviate the problem by ranking the priorities of the training examples together with their candidate labels during each learning iteration.

Specifically, the FH gains are defined as follows: 1) the damping gains of all agents are heterogeneous; 2) the stiffness gains of all agents are heterogeneous; and 3) the set of the damping gains and the set of the stiffness gains are distinct without dependence. Otherwise, the control gains are said partially heterogeneous (PH). The FV or partially variable (PV) aspect of control gains is defined similarly. The FH-FV gains setting is novel and generalizes the specially PH settings of constant gains in previous papers. We also consider the general FH-PV gains and the PH-PV gains. Then, we provide the series of conditions that ensure exponential convergence to consensus, for the agents with the FH-FV gains, the general FH-PV gains, and the PH-PV gains, respectively. The series of the conditions for each type of control gains has particular meaning for characterizing heterogeneity of the gains, especially, when the digraph of the agents is far-from-balanced.},

It is a unified framework with two branches, namely, positive attention module (PAM) and negative attention module (NAM), for the foreground and background detection, respectively. More specifically, the PAM exploits a position self-attention mechanism to enhance the discriminant ability of feature representation, which can detect most of the salient object regions. Meanwhile, the NAM is designed to detect the background regions, aiming to pop out the missing object parts and details in the prediction map produced by the PAM. By fusing these two attention modules together, NAM can provide complementary cues to assist PAM for precise object detection. Furthermore, in order to capture more multiscale contextual information, we introduce a bidirectional structure with multisupervision to the proposed complementarity-aware attention module for performance improvement.

To tackle this problem, we first reveal a novel but a simple property of the camera translation matrix consisting of all the pairwise camera translations among an arbitrary set of cameras that the rank of this translation matrix is always smaller or equal to 4. Then, by explicitly enforcing this rank property, a novel translation estimation method for computing global camera locations is proposed, called TERE. Moreover, to further improve the performances of the explored TERE in the two aspects of accuracy and speed, an iterative batch-based translation estimation method is proposed, called B-TERE, where a small-scale batch of cameras is selected without replacement from the given set of cameras according to a simple camera selection strategy at each iterative step, and the locations of the selected cameras are estimated by the proposed TERE accordingly.

  abstract     = {Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is a typical statistical model used to analyze the correlation components between different view representations of the same objects. When the label information is available with the data representations, CCA can be extended to its discriminative counterparts by incorporating supervision in the analysis. Although most discriminative variants of CCA have achieved improved results, nearly all of their objective functions are nonconvex, implying that optimal solutions are difficult to obtain. More important, that cross-view representations from the same sample should be consistent, that is, the cross-view semantic consistency has however not been modeled. To overcome these drawbacks, in this article, we propose a discriminant semantic correlation analysis (DSCA) model by modeling the cross-view semantic consistency for each object in the sample space rather than in the commonly used feature space. To boost the nonlinear discriminating capability of DSCA, we extend it from the Euclidean to the geodesic space by transforming the metric and incorporating both the cross-view semantic and representation correlation information and consequently obtain our final model with convex objective, namely, convex DSCA (C-DSCA). Finally, with extensive experiments and comparisons, we validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.},

In order to solve this problem, a novel resilient cooperative control scheme is proposed by using the sampling control approach. Sufficient conditions are first derived in the absence of DoS attacks according to a multidimensional small-gain scheme. Then, in the presence of DoS attacks, the proposed resilient scheme works in a switching manner. Inspired by multidimensional small-gain techniques, the Lyapunov approach is used to analyze the closed-loop system, which enables us to establish sufficient stability conditions for the control gains in terms of the duration and frequency of the DoS attacks.},

  abstract     = {Multilabel classification (MLC) has received much attention recently. The existing MLC algorithms usually learn multiple classifiers simultaneously by exploiting the correlations among different labels. However, it is difficult and/or expensive to collect a large amount of multilabeled data in practice. The lack of labeled data significantly deteriorates the performance of classification. Moreover, the existing algorithms belong to centralized learning, that is, all the data with their labels must be transmitted to a fusion center for processing. But in many real applications, data may be dispersedly collected/stored in distributed nodes of networks. Due to the concerns of communication cost, processing ability, and data privacy, it is impossible to transmit and/or process the data centrally at one node. Considering this, the problem of distributed MLC over networks is studied, and two distributed information-theoretic semisupervised multilabel learning (dITS 2 ML 2 ) algorithms are proposed, which are, respectively, used for solving linear and nonlinear MLC problems. In the proposed algorithms, a cost-sensitive objective function is designed, in which a new label correlation term defined on some anchor data is suggested. Besides, to decentralize the global objective function, a distributed matrix completion algorithm is developed to distributively complete the label matrix of the anchor data. Then, by exchanging and combining a few intermediate quantities instead of the original data for both linear and nonlinear cases, the model parameters can be adaptively estimated. The convergence of the proposed dITS 2 ML 2 algorithms is analyzed, and their effectiveness in MLC is verified by simulations on various real datasets.},

  abstract     = {This article studies the coordinated control problem of networked multiagent systems via distributed cloud computing. A distributed cloud predictive control scheme is proposed to achieve desired coordination control performance and compensate actively for communication delays between the cloud computing nodes and between the agents. This scheme includes the design of a multistep state predictor and optimization of control coordination. The multistep state predictor provides a novel way of predicting future immeasurable states of agents in a large horizontal length. The optimization of control coordination minimizes the distributed cost functions which are presented to measure the coordination between the agents so that the optimal design of the coordination controllers is simple with little computational increase for large-scale-networked multiagent systems. Further analysis derives the conditions of simultaneous stability and consensus of the closed-loop-networked multiagent systems using the distributed cloud predictive control scheme. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is illustrated by an example.},

  abstract     = {Since automatic algorithm configuration methods have been very effective, recently there is increasing research interest in utilizing them for automatic solver construction, resulting in several notable approaches. For these approaches, a basic assumption is that the given training set could sufficiently represent the target use cases such that the constructed solvers can generalize well. However, such an assumption does not always hold in practice since in some cases, we might only have scarce and biased training data. This article studies effective construction approaches for the parallel algorithm portfolios that are less affected in these cases. Unlike previous approaches, the proposed approach simultaneously considers instance generation and portfolio construction in an adversarial process, in which the aim of the former is to generate instances that are challenging for the current portfolio, while the aim of the latter is to find a new component solver for the portfolio to better solve the newly generated instances. Applied to two widely studied problem domains, that is, the Boolean satisfiability problems (SAT) and the traveling salesman problems (TSPs), the proposed approach identified parallel portfolios with much better generalization than the ones generated by the existing approaches when the training data were scarce and biased. Moreover, it was further demonstrated that the generated portfolios could even rival the state-of-the-art manually designed parallel solvers.},

  abstract     = {Ordinal attribute has all the common characteristics of a nominal one but it differs from the nominal one by having naturally ordered possible values (also called categories interchangeably). In clustering analysis tasks, categorical data composed of both ordinal and nominal attributes (also called mixed-categorical data interchangeably) are common. Under this circumstance, existing distance and similarity measures suffer from at least one of the following two drawbacks: 1) directly treat ordinal attributes as nominal ones, and thus ignore the order information from them and 2) suppose all the attributes are independent of each other, measure the distance between two categories from a target attribute without considering the valuable information provided by the other attributes that correlate with the target one. These two drawbacks may twist the natural distances of attributes and further lead to unsatisfactory clustering results. This article, therefore, presents an entropy-based distance metric that quantifies the distance between categories by exploiting the information provided by different attributes that correlate with the target one. It also preserves the order relationship among ordinal categories during the distance measurement. Since attributes are usually correlated in different degrees, we also define the interdependence between different types of attributes to weight their contributions in forming distances. The proposed metric overcomes the two above-mentioned drawbacks for mixed-categorical data clustering. More important, it conceptually unifies the distances of ordinal and nominal attributes to avoid information loss during clustering. Moreover, it is parameter free, and will not bring extra computational cost compared to the existing state-of-the-art counterparts. Extensive experiments show the superiority of the proposed distance metric.},

The underlying interaction and the corresponding weight matrix are required to be undirected connected and doubly stochastic, respectively. To resolve this optimization problem collaboratively, we propose a decentralized event-triggering algorithm (DETA) that is based on the consensus theory and inexact gradient tracking technique. DETA involves each agent interacting with its neighboring agents only at some independent event-triggering sampling time instants. Under the assumptions that the global convex cost function is coercive and has Lipschitz continuous gradient, we prove that DETA steers all agents’ states to an optimal solution even with nonuniform constant step sizes. Moreover, our analysis also shows that DETA converges at a rate of $O(1/{\sqrt {t}})$ if the step sizes are uniform and do not exceed some upper bounds. We illustrate the effectiveness of DETA on a canonical simple decentralized parameter estimation problem.},

However, existing metric-learning-based methods are a lack of generalization. In this article, the poor generalization of the metric model is argued as the biased estimation problem that the independent identical distribution hypothesis is not valid. The verification experimental result shows that there is a sharp difference between the training and test samples in the metric subspace. A semisupervised consistent projection metric-learning method is proposed to ease the biased estimation problem by learning a consistent constrained metric subspace in which the identified pairs are forced to follow the distribution of the positive training pairs. First, a semisupervised method is proposed to generate potential matching pairs from the ${k}$ -nearest neighbors of test samples. The potential matching pairs are used to estimate the distances’ distribution center of the positive test pairs. Second, the metric subspace is improved by forcing this estimation to be close to the center of the positive training pairs. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted on five datasets and the results demonstrate that the proposed method reaches the best performance, especially on the rank-1 identification rate.},

This article addresses the problem of indoor localization by implementing distributed set-membership filtering based on a received signal strength indicator (RSSI) under unknown-but-bounded process and measurement noises. First, the transmit power and the path-loss exponent are estimated by a novel least-squares curve fitting (LSCF) method in RSSI-based localization. Since the localization process of trilateration is susceptible to inaccuracy caused by the noise-affected distance measurements, a convex optimization method is then developed to obtain the state ellipsoid estimation under the unknown-but-bounded noises. Third, a recursive algorithm is established to compute the global ellipsoid that guarantees to locate the true target at every time step. Finally, experimental validation is presented to demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed set-membership filtering method for indoor localization.},

The barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) and the error transformation technique are used to handle the output constraint under a completely unknown initial tracking condition. It is shown that with the proposed control scheme, all the solutions of the closed-loop system are semiglobally bounded, and the tracking error converges to a small set near zero, while the output constraint is satisfied within a predetermined finite time, even when the constraint condition is violated initially. Moreover, with the proposed event-triggering mechanism (ETM), the Zeno behavior can be strictly ruled out.

The framework consists of two main parts. The first part considers the stabilizing control by the state-feedback approach under ideal bandwidth capacity. While the second part characterizes the average stabilizing data rate in terms of the eigenvalues of system matrix and DoS constraint functions to explicitly reveal the relationship between the attacks and the network bandwidth capacity. The stabilizing result is novel in the sense that the DoS-attack intensity, which is characterized by its frequency and duration, can vary for different time intervals.

However, direct computation of biharmonic distances is computationally infeasible for huge networks with millions of vertices. In this article, leveraging the implicit fact that both vertex and network coherence can be expressed in terms of the diagonal entries of pseudoinverse $\boldsymbol {{L}}^{2\dagger }$ of the square of graph Laplacian, we develop a nearly linear-time algorithm to approximate all diagonal entries of $\boldsymbol {{L}}^{2\dagger }$ , which has a theoretically guaranteed error for each diagonal entry. The key ingredient of our approximation algorithm is an integration of the Johnson–Lindenstrauss lemma and Laplacian solvers. Extensive numerical experiments on real-life and model networks are presented, which indicate that our approximation algorithm is both efficient and accurate and is scalable to large-scale networks with millions of vertices.},

  abstract     = {As one of the most essential sources of energy, byproduct gas plays a pivotal role in the steel industry, for which the flow tendency is generally regarded as the guidance for planning and scheduling in real production. In order to obtain the numeric estimation along with its reliability, the construction of prediction intervals (PIs) is highly demanded by any practical applications as well as being long term for providing more information on future trends. Bearing this in mind, in this article, a hierarchical granular computing (HGrC)-based model is established for constructing long-term PIs, in which probabilistic modeling gives rise to a long horizon of numeric prediction, and the deployment of information granularities hierarchically extends the result to be interval-valued format. Considering that the structure of this model has a direct impact on its performance, Monte-Carlo search with a policy gradient technique is then applied for reinforcement structure learning. Compared with the existing methods, the size (length) of the granules in the proposed approach is unequal so that it becomes effective for not only periodic but also nonperiodic data. Furthermore, with the use of parallel strategy, the efficiency can be also guaranteed for real-world applications. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is superior to other commonly encountered techniques, and the stability of the structure learning process behaves better when compared with other reinforcement learning approaches.},

This algorithm enables autonomous agents to generate individual trajectories independently with only the relative position information of neighboring agents. Each agent applies a force-based control that contains two main terms: 1) collision avoidance and 2) navigational feedback. The first term keeps two agents separate with a certain distance, while the second term attracts each agent toward its goal location. Compared with existing collision-avoidance algorithms, the proposed force-based motion planning (FMP) algorithm can find collision-free motions with lower transition time, free from velocity state information of neighboring agents. It leads to less computational overhead. The performance of proposed FMP is examined over several dense and complex 2-D and 3-D benchmark simulation scenarios, with results outperforming existing methods.},

As robots become integrated into our daily lives and take on increasingly social roles, their ability to persuade will be critical to their success during human–robot interaction (HRI). In this article, we present a novel HRI study that investigates how a robot’s persuasive behavior influences people’s decision making. The study consisted of two small social robots trying to influence a person’s answer during a jelly bean guessing game. One robot used either an emotional or logical persuasive strategy during the game, while the other robot displayed a neutral control behavior. The results showed that the Emotion strategy had significantly higher persuasive influence compared to both the Logic and Control conditions. With respect to participant demographics, no significant differences in influence were observed between age or gender groups; however, significant differences were observed when considering participant occupation/field of study (FOS). Namely, participants in business, engineering, and physical sciences fields were more influenced by the robots and aligned their answers closer to the robot’s suggestion than did those in the life sciences and humanities professions. The discussions provide insight into the potential use of robot persuasion in social HRI task scenarios; in particular, considering the influence that a robot displaying emotional behaviors has when persuading people.},

First, based on the relative outputs, a full-order unknown input observer (UIO) is designed for each agent to track the full states’ error among neighboring agents. With the aid of such an observer, a discontinuous feedback protocol is subtly designed. And it is proven that consensus tracking can be achieved in the closed-loop networked system if the average dwell time (ADT) for switching among different interaction graph candidates is larger than a given positive threshold. By using the boundary layer technique, a continuous feedback protocol is skillfully designed and employed. It is shown that the consensus error converges into a bounded set under the designed continuous protocol. Second, as part of the full states’ error can be constructed via the agents’ outputs, a reduced-order UIO is thus designed based on which discontinuous and continuous feedback protocols are, respectively, proposed. By using the stability theory of the switched systems, it is proven that the consensus error converges asymptotically to 0 under the designed discontinuous protocol, and converges into a bounded set under the designed continuous protocol. Finally, the obtained theoretical results are validated through simulations.},

Hence, the convergence time can be arbitrarily chosen by users, and the derivative of the control input is continuous. Furthermore, sufficient conditions are given to guarantee almost global convergence and interagent collision avoidance. Then, a leader–follower control structure is proposed to achieve global convergence. By exploring the properties of the bearing Laplacian matrix, the collision avoidance and smooth control input are preserved.

Thus, the Zeno behavior is excluded for communication among agents and controller updates. Next, to further reduce the frequencies of communication among agents and updates of controllers, a distributed dynamic event-triggered mechanism is introduced. By applying the static and dynamic mechanisms, the problem can be addressed with the reduced use of system resources compared with that in most existing control algorithms.

To enhance the representation ability of NTD by multiple intrinsic cues, that is, manifold structure and supervisory information, in this article, we propose a generalized graph regularized NTD (GNTD) framework for tensor data representation. We first develop the unsupervised GNTD (UGNTD) method by constructing the nearest neighbor graph to maintain the intrinsic manifold structure of tensor data. Then, when limited must-link and cannot-link constraints are given, unlike most existing semisupervised learning methods that only use the pregiven supervisory information, we propagate the constraints through the entire dataset and then build a semisupervised graph weight matrix by which we can formulate the semisupervised GNTD (SGNTD). Moreover, we develop a fast and efficient alternating proximal gradient-based algorithm to solve the optimization problem and show its convergence and correctness. The experimental results on unsupervised and semisupervised clustering tasks using four image datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and high efficiency of the proposed methods.},

Therefore, in this article, we present a novel concept learning method, called the fuzzy-based concept learning model (FCLM), to address these two issues by exploiting concept hierarchical relations in concept lattices. More specifically, we first show some new related notions for FCLM based on a regular fuzzy formal decision context; among these notions, the object-oriented and attribute-oriented fuzzy concept similarities are used to achieve the concept similarity measure in concept lattices. Moreover, a novel fuzzy concept learning framework is designed, and its corresponding learning algorithms are developed. Finally, we conduct some experiments on various real-world datasets to demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve the state-of-the-art classification performance among similarity-based learning methods.

Despite the promising results achieved, existing caption-based generation methods confront a dilemma. On the one hand, the image generator should be provided with sufficient details for realistic hallucination, meaning that longer sentences with rich content are preferred, but on the other hand, the generator is meanwhile fragile to long sentences due to their complex semantics and syntax like long-range dependencies and the combinatorial explosion of object visual features. Toward alleviating this dilemma, a novel approach is proposed in this article to hallucinate images from attribute pairs, which can be extracted from natural language processing (NLP) toolsets in the presence of complex semantics and syntax. Attribute pairs, therefore, enable our image generator to tackle long sentences handily and alleviate the combinatorial explosion, and at the same time, allow us to enlarge the training dataset and to produce hallucinations from randomly combined attribute pairs at ease. Experiments on widely used datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach yields results superior to the state of the art.},

Subsequently, an SLDR-based adaptive iterative learning control (SLDR-AILC) is presented with rigorous analysis for iteration-variant formation control targets. Not only the 3-D dynamic behavior of the multiagent network but also the control protocols of the communicated agents are incorporated in the learning mechanism and thus strong learnability of the proposed SLDR-AILC is achieved to improve control performance.

  abstract     = {How to transform a mixed flow of sensory and motor information into memory state of self-location and to build map representations of the environment are central questions in the navigation research. Studies in neuroscience have shown that place cells in the hippocampus of the rodent brains form dynamic cognitive representations of locations in the environment. We propose a neural-network model called sensory–motor integration network model (SeMINet) to learn cognitive map representations by integrating sensory and motor information while an agent is exploring a virtual environment. This biologically inspired model consists of a deep neural network representing visual features of the environment, a recurrent network of place units encoding spatial information by sensorimotor integration, and a secondary network to decode the locations of the agent from spatial representations. The recurrent connections between the place units sustain an activity bump in the network without the need of sensory inputs, and the asymmetry in the connections propagates the activity bump in the network, forming a dynamic memory state which matches the motion of the agent. A competitive learning process establishes the association between the sensory representations and the memory state of the place units, and is able to correct the cumulative path-integration errors. The simulation results demonstrate that the network forms neural codes that convey location information of the agent independent of its head direction. The decoding network reliably predicts the location even when the movement is subject to noise. The proposed SeMINet thus provides a brain-inspired neural-network model for cognitive map updated by both self-motion cues and visual cues.},

  abstract     = {This article proposes a novel landscape smoothing method for the symmetric traveling salesman problem (TSP). We first define the homotopic convex (HC) transformation of a TSP as a convex combination of a well-constructed simple TSP and the original TSP. The simple TSP, called the convex-hull TSP, is constructed by transforming a known local or global optimum. We observe that controlled by the coefficient of the convex combination, with local or global optimum: 1) the landscape of the HC transformed TSP is smoothed in terms that its number of local optima is reduced compared to the original TSP and 2) the fitness distance correlation of the HC transformed TSP is increased. Furthermore, we observe that the smoothing effect of the HC transformation depends highly on the quality of the used optimum. A high-quality optimum leads to a better smoothing effect than a low-quality optimum. We then propose an iterative algorithmic framework in which the proposed HC transformation is combined within a heuristic TSP solver. It works as an escaping scheme from local optima aiming to improve the global searchability of the combined heuristic. Case studies using the 3-Opt and the Lin–Kernighan local search as the heuristic solver show that the resultant algorithms significantly outperform their counterparts and two other smoothing-based TSP heuristic solvers on most of the test instances with up to 20 000 cities.},

  abstract     = {With the increased model size of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), overfitting has become the main bottleneck to further improve the performance of networks. Currently, the weighting regularization methods have been proposed to address the overfitting problem and they perform satisfactorily. Since these regularization methods cannot be used in all the networks and they are usually not flexible enough in different phases of the training and test processes, this article proposes a multiscale conditional (MSC) regularization method. MSC divides the intermediate features into different scales and then generates new data for each scale features, respectively. In addition, the new data are generated by employing the information from two conditions: 1) each sample feature and 2) each layer pattern. Finally, a self-identity structure is proposed to supplement the features with the generated data. Therefore, MSC can adaptively and efficiently generate much finer and individualized data to make the entire regularization more flexible. Furthermore, MSC is more general and can be applied to all kinds of networks through the proposed self-identity structure. The experimental results on all the benchmark datasets showed that the proposed MSC regularization method achieves the best performances in all the networks.},

  abstract     = {Data representation learning is one of the most important problems in machine learning. Unsupervised representation learning becomes meritorious as it has no necessity of label information with observed data. Due to the highly time-consuming learning of deep-learning models, there are many machine-learning models directly adapting well-trained deep models that are obtained in a supervised and end-to-end manner as feature abstractors to distinct problems. However, it is obvious that different machine-learning tasks require disparate representation of original input data. Taking human action recognition as an example, it is well known that human actions in a video sequence are 3-D signals containing both visual appearance and motion dynamics of humans and objects. Therefore, the data representation approaches with the capabilities to capture both spatial and temporal correlations in videos are meaningful. Most of the existing human motion recognition models build classifiers based on deep-learning structures such as deep convolutional networks. These models require a large quantity of training videos with annotations. Meanwhile, these supervised models cannot recognize samples from the distinct dataset without retraining. In this article, we propose a new 3-D deconvolutional network (3DDN) for representation learning of high-dimensional video data, in which the high-level features are obtained through the optimization approach. The proposed 3DDN decomposes the video frames into spatiotemporal features under a sparse constraint in an unsupervised way. In addition, it also can be regarded as a building block to develop deep architectures by stacking. The high-level representation of input sequential data can be used in multiple downstream machine-learning tasks, we evaluate the proposed 3DDN and its deep models in human action recognition. The experimental results from three datasets: 1) KTH data; 2) HMDB-51; and 3) UCF-101, demonstrate that the proposed 3DDN is an alternative approach to feedforward convolutional neural networks (CNNs), that attains comparable results.},

However, it is difficult to compactly characterize a user with his/her installed app list. In this article, a user representation framework is proposed, where we model the underlying relations between apps and users with Boolean matrix factorization (BMF). It builds a compact user subspace by discovering basic components from installed app lists. Each basic component encapsulates a semantic interpretation of a series of special-purpose apps, which is a reflection of user needs and interests. Each user is represented by a linear combination of the semantic basic components. With this user representation framework, we use supervised and unsupervised learning methods to understand users, including mining user attributes, discovering user groups, and labeling semantic tags to users. Extensive experiments were conducted on three data subsets from a large-scale real-world dataset for evaluation, each consisting of installed app lists from over 10 000 users.

With its specific features, unlabeled EEG is not well addressed by conventional unsupervised time-series learning methods. In this article, we handle the problem of unlabeled EEG time-series clustering and propose a novel EEG clustering algorithm, that we call mwcEEGc. The idea is to map the EEG clustering to the maximum-weight clique (MWC) searching in an improved Fréchet similarity-weighted EEG graph. The mwcEEGc considers the weights of both vertices and edges in the constructed EEG graph and clusters EEG based on their similarity weights instead of calculating the cluster centroids. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first attempt to cluster unlabeled EEG trials using MWC searching. The mwcEEGc achieves high-quality clusters with respect to intracluster compactness as well as intercluster scatter. We demonstrate the superiority of mwcEEGc over ten state-of-the-art unsupervised learning/clustering approaches by conducting detailed experimentations with the standard clustering validity criteria on 14 real-world brain EEG datasets. We also present that mwcEEGc satisfies the theoretical properties of clustering, such as richness, consistency, and order independence.},

Two neural network-based control schemes are proposed using anti-saturation adaptive strategies. To satisfy the input constraint, we design two controllers in a saturation function structure. Taking into account the modeling uncertainties, external disturbances, and adverse effects from actuator faults and failures, the first anti-saturation adaptive controller is implemented based on radial basis function neural networks (RBFNNs) with a fixed-time terminal sliding mode (FTTSM) containing a tunable parameter. Then, we upgrade the proposed controller to a fully adaptive-gain anti-saturation version, in order to strengthen the robustness and adaptivity with respect to actuator faults and failures, unknown mass properties, and external disturbances. In the two schemes, all of the designed adaptive parameters are scalars, thus they only require light computational load and can avoid the redesign process of the controller during spacecraft operation. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed methods is illustrated via two numerical examples.},

  abstract     = {Sampled-data state feedback control with stochastic sampling periods for Boolean control networks (BCNs) is investigated in this article. First, based on the algebraic form of BCNs, stochastic sampled-data state feedback control is applied to stabilize the considered system to a fixed point or a given set. Two kinds of distributions of stochastic sampling periods are considered. First, the distribution of sampling periods is assumed to be independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) in the range of any positive integers and the second distribution of sampling periods is assumed to follow an infinite Markov process. A BCN with infinite stochastic sampling periods proves to be equivalent to a finite stochastic switched system, based on which, necessary and sufficient conditions are given to guarantee the stabilization and set stabilization of the BCN with stochastic sampling periods. For the first one, two algorithms are given to guarantee the stabilization and set stabilization of the considered system. For the second one, necessary and sufficient conditions are all presented in the linear programming form. Examples are listed to show the effectiveness of our results.},

  abstract     = {In this article, a new self-organizing fuzzy neural network (FNN) model is presented which is able to simultaneously and accurately learn and reproduce different sequences. Multiple sequence learning is important in performing habitual and skillful tasks, such as writing, signing signatures, and playing piano. Generally, it is indispensable for pattern generation applications. Since multiple sequences have similar parts, local information such as some previous samples is not sufficient to efficiently reproduce them. Instead, it is necessary to consider global and discriminative information, maybe in the very initial samples of each sequence, to first recognize them, and then predict their next sample based on the current local information. Therefore, the structure of the proposed network consists of two parts: 1) sequence identifier, which computes a novel sequence identity value based on initial samples of a sequence, and detects the sequence identity based on proper fuzzy rules and 2) sequence locator , which locates the input sample in the sequence. Therefore, by integrating outputs of these two parts in fuzzy rules, the network is able to produce the proper output based on the current state of each sequence. To learn the proposed structure, a gradual learning procedure is proposed. First, learning is performed by adding new fuzzy rules, based on coverage measure, using available correct data. Next, the initialized parameters are fine-tuned, by the gradient descent algorithm, based on fed back approximated network output as the next input. The proposed method has a dynamic structure able to learn new sequences online. Finally, to investigate the effectiveness of the presented approach, it is used to simultaneously learn and reproduce multiple sequences in different applications, including sequences with similar parts, different patterns, and writing different letters. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated and compared with other existing methods, including the adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system, GDFNN, CFNN, and long short-term memory (LSTM). According to these experiments, the proposed method outperforms traditional FNNs and LSTM in learning multiple sequences.},

To address this problem, this paper targets at presenting a self-appraisal mechanism in the protocol of each agent, for which a notion of diagonal dominance degree is proposed to represent the dominant role of agent’s self-appraisal over external impacts from all other agents. Selection conditions on diagonal dominance degrees are explored such that signed networks in the presence of directed time-varying topologies can be ensured to achieve the uniform asymptotic stability despite any sign patterns. Further, the established stability results can be applied to achieve bipartite consensus tracking of time-varying signed networks and realize state-feedback stabilization of time-varying systems. Simulations are implemented to verify our uniform asymptotic stability results for directed time-varying signed networks.},

  abstract     = {In multi-instance learning (MIL), labels are associated with bags rather than the instances in the bag. Most of the previous MIL methods assume that each bag has the actual label in the training set. However, from the process of labeling work, the label of a bag is always evaluated by the calculation of the labels obtained from a number of labelers. In the calculation, the weight of each labeler is always unknown and people always assign the weight for each labeler by random or equally, and this may result in the ambiguous labels for the bags, which is called weak labels here. In addition, we always meet the problem of knowledge transfer from the source task to the target task, and this leads to the study of multiple instance transfer learning. In this article, we propose a new framework called transfer learning-based multiple instance learning (TMIL) framework to address the problem of multiple instance transfer learning in which both the source task and the target task contain the weak labels. We first construct a TMIL model with weak labels, which can transfer knowledge from the source task to the target task where both source and target tasks contain weak labels. We then put forward an iterative framework to solve the transfer learning model with weak labels so that we can update the label of the bag to improve the performance of multiple instance learning. We then present the convergence analysis of the proposed method. The experiments show that the proposed method outperforms the existing multiple instance learning methods and can correct the initial labels to obtain the actual labels for the bags.},

For color images, the previous methods only handle the luminance component or each color channel individually, without considering the abundant correlations among different channels as well as the inherent geometrical structure of data manifold. In this article, we propose a learning-based model in quaternion space with graph representation for color face hallucination. Instead of the spatial domain, the color image is represented in the quaternion domain to preserve correlations among different color channels. Moreover, a quaternion graph is learned to smooth the quaternion feature space, which helps to not only stabilize the linear system but also enclose the inherent topology structure of quaternion patch manifold. Besides, considering that single low-resolution (LR) image patch can just provide limited informative information in representation, we propose to simultaneously encode the query smaller LR patch as well as a larger patch containing the surrounding pixels seated at the same position in the objective. The larger patch with rich patterns is used to compensate the lost information in the query LR patch, which further enhances the manifold consistency assumption between the LR and HR patch spaces. The experimental results demonstrated the efficiency of the proposed method in hallucinating color face images.},

In this article, we propose an attentive relational encoder (ARE), which is a novel scalable feedforward neural module, to attentionally aggregate an arbitrary-sized neighboring feature set for state representation in the decentralized MARL. The ARE actively selects the relevant information from the neighboring agents and is permutation invariant, computationally efficient, and flexible to interactive multiagent systems. Our method consistently outperforms the latest competing decentralized MARL methods in several multiagent tasks. In particular, it shows strong cooperative performance in challenging StarCraft micromanagement tasks and achieves over a 96\% winning rate against the most difficult noncheating built-in artificial intelligence bots.},

  abstract     = {Numerous multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have been designed for constrained optimization over the past two decades. The idea behind these algorithms is to transform constrained optimization problems (COPs) into multiobjective optimization problems without any constraint, and then solve them. In this article, we propose a new multiobjective method for constrained optimization, which works by converting a COP into a problem with helper and equivalent objectives. An equivalent objective means that its optimal solution set is the same as that of the constrained problem but a helper objective does not. Then, this multiobjective optimization problem is decomposed into a group of subproblems using the weighted sum approach. Weights are dynamically adjusted so that each subproblem eventually tends to a problem with an equivalent objective. We theoretically analyze the computational time of the helper and equivalent objective method on a hard problem called “wide gap.” In a wide gap problem, an algorithm needs exponential time to cross between two fitness levels (a wide gap). We prove that using helper and equivalent objectives can shorten the time of crossing the wide gap. We conduct a case study for validating our method. An algorithm with helper and equivalent objectives is implemented. The experimental results show that its overall performance is ranked first when compared with other eight state-of-the-art EAs on IEEE CEC2017 benchmarks in constrained optimization.},

The lack of proper understanding of the HSI data structure has resulted in the inconsistency in the outcome of UBS. Besides, most of the UBS methods are either relying on complicated measurements or rather noise sensitive, which hinder the efficiency of the determined band subset. In this article, an adaptive distance-based band hierarchy (ADBH) clustering framework is proposed for UBS in HSI, which can help to avoid the noisy bands while reflecting the hierarchical data structure of HSI. With a tree hierarchy-based framework, we can acquire any number of band subset. By introducing a novel adaptive distance into the hierarchy, the similarity between bands and band groups can be computed straightforward while reducing the effect of noisy bands. Experiments on four datasets acquired from two HSI systems have fully validated the superiority of the proposed framework.},

The Shapley value is one of the well-known solutions in the cooperative game, which can fairly assess the power of each player in a game. In the construction of RSFs, RSFs use the Shapley value to evaluate the importance of each feature at each tree node by computing the dependency among the possible feature coalitions. In particular, inspired by the existing consistency theory, we have proved the consistency of the proposed RFs algorithm. Moreover, to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, experiments on eight UCI benchmark datasets and four real-world datasets have been conducted. The results show that RSFs perform better than or at least comparable with the existing consistent RFs, the original RFs, and a classic classifier, support vector machines.},

However, this structural representation has rarely displayed its technical capability in data mining and information processing due to the lack of suitable constructive methods and semantic interpretation for IF information with regard to real data. To pursue better performance of the IF-based technique in real-world data mining, in this article, we examine information granularity, information entropy of IF granular structures, and their applications to data reduction of IF information systems. First, several types of partial-order relations at different hierarchical levels are defined to reveal the granularity of IF granular structures. Second, the granularity invariance between different IF granular structures is characterized by using relational mappings. Third, Shannon’s entropies are generalized to IF entropies and their relationships with the partial-order relations are addressed. Based on the theoretical analysis above, the significance of intuitionistic attributes using the information measures is then introduced and the information-preserving algorithm for data reduction of IF information systems is constructed. Finally, by inducing substantial IF relations from public datasets that take both the similarity/diversity between the samples from the same/different classes into account, a collection of numerical experiments is conducted to confirm the performance of the proposed technique.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates a spatial- $\mathcal {L}^{\infty }$ -norm-based reliable bounded control problem for a class of nonlinear partial differential equation systems in a finite-time interval. The main novelties are reflected in the following aspects: 1) inspired by the sector-nonlinearity approach, the considered nonlinear system is reconstructed by a Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy model, which provides an effective method for control design. Besides, several actuator failures, such as stuck faulty, outage faulty, and bias faulty, are taken into account and modeled by a novel Markov process; 2) partial areas’ states are sampled and transmitted based on a new distributed event-triggered communication strategy, which reduces the cost of the system design and saves the limited network resources to some extent; and 3) on the basis of the first two works, a new piecewise fuzzy controller, which requires fewer actuators compared with the distributed control method, is constructed. Then, some sufficient conditions to guarantee the finite-time boundedness (in the sense of spatial $\mathcal {L}^{\infty }$ norm) and mixed $\mathcal {L}_{2}-\mathcal {L}_{\infty }/\mathcal {H}_{\infty }$ disturbance attenuation performance are established, and a new linear matrix inequality relax technique is introduced to deal with the strict constraint that is caused by the asynchronous phenomenon between plant and controller. Finally, two simulation studies are given to illustrate the effectiveness and advantages of the developed controller.},

  abstract     = {Semisupervised learning (SSL) has been widely used in numerous practical applications where the labeled training examples are inadequate while the unlabeled examples are abundant. Due to the scarcity of labeled examples, the performances of the existing SSL methods are often affected by the outliers in the labeled data, leading to the imperfect trained classifier. To enhance the robustness of SSL methods to the outliers, this article proposes a novel SSL algorithm called Laplacian Welsch regularization (LapWR). Specifically, apart from the conventional Laplacian regularizer, we also introduce a bounded, smooth, and nonconvex Welsch loss which can suppress the adverse effect brought by the labeled outliers. To handle the model nonconvexity caused by the Welsch loss, an iterative half-quadratic (HQ) optimization algorithm is adopted in which each subproblem has an ideal closed-form solution. To handle the large datasets, we further propose an accelerated model by utilizing the Nyström method to reduce the computational complexity of LapWR. Theoretically, the generalization bound of LapWR is derived based on analyzing its Rademacher complexity, which suggests that our proposed algorithm is guaranteed to obtain satisfactory performance. By comparing LapWR with the existing representative SSL algorithms on various benchmark and real-world datasets, we experimentally found that LapWR performs robustly to outliers and is able to consistently achieve the top-level results.},

Our framework includes two main parts. The first part is to calculate the distance between two images from a reference image sequence and a query image sequence. In this part, we remove the deep features of nonoverlap contents in these two images and utilize the remaining deep features to calculate the distance. As the deep features of nonoverlap contents are caused by viewpoint variations, removing these deep features can improve the robustness to viewpoint variations. Based on the first part, in the second part, we first calculate the distances of all pairs of images from a reference image sequence and a query image sequence, and obtain a distance matrix. Afterward, we design two convolutional operators to retrieve the distance submatrix with the minimum diagonal distribution. The minimum diagonal distribution contains more environmental information, which is insensitive to environmental condition variations. The experimental results suggest that our framework exhibits better performance than several state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the analysis of runtime shows that our framework has the potential to satisfy real-time demands.},

Then, the globally asymptotical consensus is investigated for multiagent networks with time-varying characteristics by virtue of the Lyapunov function method. It should be noted that when the Lyapunov function method is utilized to investigate the stability problem of control systems, it is always assumed that the derivative of the constructed Lyapunov function is not more than zero. This assumption is removed here and as a replacement, the average value of the derivative of the Lyapunov function in a period to be negative is needed.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates the asymptotic consensus problem for multiple discrete-time agents with general dynamics under event-triggered sampling. In such multiagent systems (MASs), the information exchanged between neighboring agents is quantized and transmitted through a digital communication network. Due to the limited bandwidth, it is impossible for agents to capture the precise states of neighbors and only their quantized version can be received, which may degrade or even break the consensus of these MASs. In order to ensure the desired consensus and save the occupied network bandwidth, a model-based event-triggering strategy is well co-designed with a dynamic quantization method. Under the proposed strategy, the error between the real state and its estimated version at neighbors is always bounded by an event-triggering function, which is also taken to compute an upper bound on the control inputs of all agents. We derive a sufficient bit-rate condition required for the desired asymptotic consensus. That condition is mainly determined by the dynamics and communication network topology of agents. Since our event-triggering strategy takes advantage of the extra information extracted from the event-triggering time instants of all feedback packets, the derived bit rate can be lower than that of the conventional periodic sampling strategies, while still ensuring the consensus of the concerned MAS. Simulations are done to illustrate the advantages of the derived bit-rate condition.},

The predictive function learning procedure can be regarded as a feature selection procedure and as a classifier construction procedure. For feature selection, we extract features for each label based on the learned positive and negative feature–label correlations. The positive and negative relationships can illustrate which labels can and cannot be well presented by the corresponding features, respectively, due to the semantic gap. For classifier construction, we perform sample-specific and label-specific classifications. The interlabel and interinstance correlations are combined in these two kinds of classifications. These two correlations are learned from both input features and output labels when the output labels are too sparse to reveal the informative correlation. However, there exists the semantic gap when combining input and output spaces to mine the labelwise relationship. The semantic gap can be bridged by the learned feature–label correlation. Finally, extensive experimental results on several benchmarks under four domains are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed framework.},

However, the high autonomy and openness of the OSNs also allow for the rapid spread of negative information, such as unsubstantiated rumors and other forms of misinformation that often elicit widespread public cognitive misleads and huge economic losses. Therefore, how to effectively control the negative information spread accompanied by positive information has emerged as a challenging issue. Unfortunately, this issue still remains largely unexplored to date. To fill this gap, we propose an efficient feedback control mechanism for the simultaneous spread of the positive and negative information in OSNs. Specifically, a novel computational model is first proposed to present the temporal dynamics of the positive and negative information spread. Furthermore, the proposed mechanism restrains the negative information spread with minimal system expenses by devising and performing three synergetic intervention strategies. Technically, this mechanism intensively evaluates the number of seed users performing three intervention strategies. Besides, each seed user performs the received control task independently, and then the control plan for the next time step is adjusted dynamically according to the previous feedback results. Finally, we evaluate the efficiency of the proposed mechanism based on the extensive experimental results obtained from two real-world networks.},

By utilizing a fuzzy-logic system to approximate the heterogeneous and unmodeled nonlinear dynamics, an observer-based adaptive parameter control protocol is designed to solve the problem of finite-time consensus tracking of incommensurate fractional-order nonlinear MASs on directed switching topology with a restricted dwell time. Then, the derived result is further extended to the case of directed switching topology without a restricted dwell time by designing an observer-based adaptive gain control protocol. By artfully choosing a piecewise Lyapunov function, it is shown that the consensus tracking error converges to a small adjustable residual set in finite time for both the cases with and without a restricted dwell time. It should be noted that the proposed adaptive gain consensus tracking protocol is completely distributed in the sense that there is no need for any global information.

Based on the tree, a probabilistic niching strategy is defined to reinforce exploration and exploitation by making full use of the structural historical information. The proposed framework is universal for incorporating various baseline niching algorithms.

  abstract     = {Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated impressive performance on many visual tasks. Recently, they became useful models for the visual system in neuroscience. However, it is still not clear what is learned by CNNs in terms of neuronal circuits. When a deep CNN with many layers is used for the visual system, it is not easy to compare the structure components of CNNs with possible neuroscience underpinnings due to highly complex circuits from the retina to the higher visual cortex. Here, we address this issue by focusing on single retinal ganglion cells with biophysical models and recording data from animals. By training CNNs with white noise images to predict neuronal responses, we found that fine structures of the retinal receptive field can be revealed. Specifically, convolutional filters learned are resembling biological components of the retinal circuit. This suggests that a CNN learning from one single retinal cell reveals a minimal neural network carried out in this cell. Furthermore, when CNNs learned from different cells are transferred between cells, there is a diversity of transfer learning performance, which indicates that CNNs are cell specific. Moreover, when CNNs are transferred between different types of input images, here white noise versus natural images, transfer learning shows a good performance, which implies that CNNs indeed capture the full computational ability of a single retinal cell for different inputs. Taken together, these results suggest that CNNs could be used to reveal structure components of neuronal circuits, and provide a powerful model for neural system identification.},

  abstract     = {Transfer learning has attracted more attention in the machine-learning community recently. It aims to improve the learning performance on the domain of interest with the help of the knowledge acquired from a similar domain(s). However, there is only a limited number of research on tackling transfer learning in genetic programming for symbolic regression. This article attempts to fill this gap by proposing a new instance weighting framework for transfer learning in genetic programming-based symbolic regression. In the new framework, differential evolution is employed to search for optimal weights for source-domain instances, which helps genetic programming to identify more useful source-domain instances and learn from them. Meanwhile, a density estimation method is used to provide good starting points to help the search for the optimal weights while discarding some irrelevant or less important source-domain instances before learning regression models. The experimental results show that compared with genetic programming and support vector regression that learn only from the target instances, and learning from a mixture of instances from the source and target domains without any transfer learning component, the proposed method can evolve regression models which not only achieve notably better cross-domain generalization performance in stability but also reduce the trend of overfitting effectively. Meanwhile, these models are generally much simpler than those generated by the other GP methods.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we consider an emergent problem in the sensor fusion area in which unreliable sensors need to be identified in the absence of the ground truth. We devise a novel solution to the problem using the theory of replicator dynamics that require mild conditions compared to the available state-of-the-art approaches. The solution has a low computational complexity that is linear in terms of the number of involved sensors. We provide some sound theoretical results that catalog the convergence of our approach to a solution where we can clearly unveil the sensor type. Furthermore, we present some experimental results that demonstrate the convergence of our approach in concordance with our theoretical findings.},

  abstract     = {This article addresses the cooperative output tracking problem of a class of linear minimum-phase multiagent systems, where the agent dynamics are unknown and heterogeneous. A distributed event-triggered model reference adaptive control strategy is developed. It is shown that under the proposed event-triggered control strategy, the outputs of all the agents synchronize to the output of the leader asymptotically. It is also shown that Zeno behavior can be excluded with the proposed novel event triggering mechanism. In addition, the proposed adaptive control strategy is fully distributed in the sense that no prior knowledge of some global information, such as the eigenvalues of the associated Laplacian matrix and the number of the agents is required. Finally, an example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.},
