  abstract     = {Learning the intrinsic low-dimensional subspace from high-dimensional data is a key step for many social systems of artificial intelligence. In practical scenarios, the observed data are usually corrupted by many types of noise, which brings a great challenge for social systems to analyze data. As a commonly utilized subspace learning technique, robust low-rank matrix factorization (LRMF) focuses on recovering the underlying subspaces in a noisy environment. However, most of the existing approaches simply assume that the noise contaminating the data is independent identically distributed (i.i.d.), such as Gaussian and Laplacian noises. This assumption, though greatly simplifies the underlying learning problem, may not hold for more complex non-i.i.d. noise widely existed in social systems. In this work, we suggest a robust LRMF approach to deal with various types of noise in a unified manner. Different from traditional algorithms, noise in our framework is modeled using an independent and piecewise identically distributed (i.p.i.d.) source, which employs a collection of distributions, instead of a single one to characterize the statistical behavior of the underlying noise. Assisted by the generic noise model, we then design a robust LRMF algorithm under the information-theoretic learning (ITL) framework through a new minimization criterion. By adopting the half-quadratic optimization paradigm, we further deliver an optimization strategy for our proposed method. Experimental results on both synthetic and real data are provided to demonstrate the superiority of our proposed scheme.},

  abstract     = {Analyzing unlabeled data is of prime importance in machine learning. Creating groups and identifying an underlying clustering principle is essential to many fields, such as biomedical analysis and market research. Novel unsupervised machine learning algorithms, also called clustering algorithms, are developed and utilized for this task. Inspired by twin support vector machine (TWSVM) principles, a recently introduced plane-based clustering algorithm, the twin bounded support vector clustering (TBSVC), is used in widespread clustering problems. However, TBSVC is sensitive to noise and suffers from low resampling stability due to usage of hinge loss. Pinball loss is another type of loss function that is less sensitive toward noise in the datasets and is more stable for resampling of datasets. However, the use of pinball loss negatively affects the sparsity of the solution of the problem. In this article, we present a novel plane-based clustering method, the sparse TBSVC using pinball loss (pinSTBSVC). The proposed pinSTBSVC is the sparse version of our recently proposed TBSVC using pinball loss (pinTBSVC). Sparse solutions help create better-generalized solutions to clustering problems; hence, we attempt to use the &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\epsilon $ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -insensitive pinball loss function to propose pinSTBSVC. The loss function used to propose pinSTBSVC provides sparsity to the solution of the problem and improves the aforementioned plane-based clustering algorithms. Experimental results performed on benchmark University of California, Irvine (UCI) datasets indicate that the proposed method outperforms other existing plane-based clustering algorithms. Additionally, we also give the application of our method in biomedical image clustering and marketing science. We show that the proposed method is more accurate on real-world datasets too. The code for the proposed algorithm is also provided on the author’s Github page: https://github.com/mtanveer1 .},

  abstract     = {Since the outbreak of COVID-19, an alternative way to keep students on the track, meanwhile, prevent them from being at the risk of infection is in highly demand. Many education providers had made a move in trial of delivering knowledge and learning materials remotely. Along with this trend, learning management systems, open educational resources (OERs) and OER platforms, mini applications in social media and video-conference software were combined in a rush to create a multi-channel delivery mode to make learning resources openly available round-the-clock. Learning activities in this fast migration to online were regularly found to be carried out in gradual and fragmented time spans. Due to the little-known learner information along with the continuously released new OERs, the cold start problem still hinders the innovative mode of delivery and adaptive micro learning. To overcome the data sparsity, an online computation is proposed to benefit OER providers and instructors. A lightweight learner-micro-OER profile and two algorithmic solutions are provided to tackle the new user and new item cold start problem, respectively. Learning paths are generated and optimized in terms of heuristic rules to form the initial recommendation list. By adopting the same set of rules, newly released micro OERs are inserted into established learning paths to increase their discoverability.},

  abstract     = {Online travel platforms (OTPs), for example, booking.com, Ctrip.com, and Fliggy, deliver travel experiences to online users by providing travel-related products. Hotel recommendation is significantly important for OTPs since hotel bookings account for almost half of the travel expenses and hotel products generate more than half of OTP’s revenues. More than 58% Fliggy users may choose to use query-less hotel searches to find candidate hotels, where no additional keywords are given except the expected check-in date and travel destination city. Thus, how to recommend hotels to traveler users is important and challenging. In this article, we explore the unique characteristics of query-less hotel users and propose a novel multiscenario query-less search network (MSQS). According to their searching date, expected check-in date, current city, and expected hotel city, MSQS groups users’ behaviors (e.g., click, purchase, search) into four scenario groups, namely today-local, today-nonlocal, future-local, and future-nonlocal. The key components of MSQS are the global expert, the scenario expert, and the feedback expert. The global expert learns common features among different scenarios and extracts the feature interactions between context, users, and hotels. The scenario expert utilizes multilayer perception to learn the differentiating features between scenarios. The feedback expert learns users’ preferences for hotels in different scenarios through their historical behaviors, and a scenario interest extractor is carefully designed to enhance attention across scenarios and behaviors. An offline experiment on the Fliggy production dataset with over 8 million users and 0.49 million travel items and an online A/B test both show that MSQS effectively predicts users’ hotel booking intentions.},

  abstract     = {Advances in technology and high Internet penetration are leading to a large number of businesses going online. As a result, there is a substantial increase in the number of customers making online purchases and the number of items available online. However, with so many options available to choose from, users have to face the information overload problem. Several techniques have been developed to handle this, but the performance of the recommendation system (RS) has been recorded unprecedentedly. The collaborative filtering (CF) of RS is the most prevalent technique, which suggests personalized items to users based on their past preferences. The efficacy of this technique mainly depends on the similarity calculation, which the traditional or cognitive approach can ascertain. In the traditional approach, a similarity measure utilizes the user’s ratings on an item to compute the similarity. Most similarity measures in this approach suffer from either data sparsity and/or cold-start problems. To address both of them, a new similarity measure based on the Jaccard and Gower coefficients, the efficient Gowers–Jaccard–Sigmoid Measure (EGJSM), is proposed in this article. It also includes a nonlinear sigmoid function to penalize the bad ratings. The performance of EGJSM is evaluated by conducting experiments on benchmark datasets, and the results depict that the proposed technique outperforms several existing methods. Along with this, a cognitive similarity (CgS) measure has been proposed, which considers cognitive features such as genre and year of release along with rating information, to calculate similarity. The CgS method also outperforms the proposed EGJSM method and produces almost 4% and 1% lower mean absolute error (MAE) and root-mean-squared error (RMSE) values than that.},

Customer reviews and ratings also help companies improve performance and figure out new methodologies to provide better services. This research concentrates on customer reviews and ratings to investigate which product a customer evaluates and its association with its recommendations. This work predicts the user recommendations in two modules. The first module performs sentiment analysis of customer reviews using the long short-term memory (LSTM) model, which estimates the probability of the customer’s sentiment about the airline’s services. The second module experimented over only various service aspect ratings on different airline services provided by customers. These two modules ensemble together to determine the predictive recommendations of the airlines. The obtained results reinforce the essential theoretical contribution to the literature on service appraisal, online review, and recommendations. In addition, our proposed ensemble approach will be helpful to those practitioners who wish to use any proposal that will provide a quick and essential vision by bringing together customer-generated reviews and ratings, thereby helping them in strategy designing, service improvement, and post-purchases planning. Also, forthcoming travelers may benefit from this proposed approach by assimilating an aggregating view of service quality.},

Autonomous transportation systems (ATSs) are resultantly emerging. A strongly related system architecture can effectively support the planning, construction, and operation of ATS. The current research on the relationship between architectures focuses on the definition of elements and the description of interfaces; however, insufficient research has examined the mapping relationship of the architectural elements. Therefore, to construct a set of architecture systems with explicit mapping relationships, we proposed an information flow (IF) extraction method based on data flow (DF) text to realize automated mapping between logical DF and physical IF. First, to better describe the ATS, we deconstructed the system with service as the basic unit, introduced the structure and constituent elements of the logical and physical architecture, and summarized the mapping principles of the architectural elements. Next, we extracted the DF set based on flow attributes and implemented the vectorization of the DF text. Then, we obtained the similarity of the DFs through text semantic analysis and completed the identification of similar DFs. Finally, to realize the independent construction of IF, we designed a graph-based DF aggregation method to complete the automated mapping of architectural elements. Experimental results showed that the construction method of IF proposed in this article met the requirements of ATS architecture and could effectively support the design and construction of the ATS architecture system.},

The news collected from newspapers, social handles, and e-mails are web-scrapped, prepossessed, and sent to a proposed Q-global vector for word representations (Q-GloVe) model that captures the fine-grained linguistic semantics in the data. Based on the Q-GloVe output, the data are trained through a proposed bi-directional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) model, and the news is classified as real-or-fake news. This reduces the vanishing gradient problem, which optimizes the weights of the model and reduces bias. Once the news is classified, it is stored as a transaction, and the news stakeholders can execute smart contracts (SCs) and trace the news origin. However, only verified trusted news sources are added to the BC network, ensuring credibility in the system. For security evaluation, we propose the associated cost of the Bi-LSTM classifier and propose vulnerability analysis through the smart check tool for potential vulnerabilities. The scheme is compared against discourse-structure analysis, linguistic natural language framework, and entity-based recognition for different performance metrics. The scheme achieves an accuracy of 99.55% compared to 93.62% against discourse structure analysis. Also, it shows an average improvement of 18.76% against other approaches, which indicates its viability against fake-classifier-based models.},

The learned urban profiles can be used to represent and identify regions in supporting downstream tasks, e.g., region traffic status estimation. While some efforts have been made to model urban regions, representation learning with awareness of graph-structured data can improve the existing methods. To do this, we first construct an attribute spatio-temporal graph, in which a node represents a region, an edge represents mobility across regions, and a node attribute represents a region’s point of interest (PoI) distribution. The problem of region profiling is reformulated as a representation learning problem based on attribute spatio-temporal graphs. To solve this problem, we developed URGENT, a spatio-temporal graph learning framework. URGENT is made up of two modules. The graph convolutional neural network is used in the first module to learn spatial dependencies. The second module is an encoding–decoding temporal learning structure with self-attention mechanism. Furthermore, we use the learned representations of regions to estimate region traffic status. Experimental results demonstrate that URGENT outperforms major baselines in estimation accuracy under various settings and produces more meaningful results.},

  abstract     = {With the development of the social Internet of Things (IoT) and multimedia communications, our daily lives in computational social systems have become more convenient; for example, we can share shopping experiences and ask questions of people in an ad hoc network. Relation extraction focuses on supervised learning with adequate training data, and it helps to understand the knowledge behind the observed information. However, if only some social data in an unknown area can be used, how to obtain the related knowledge and information is a key topic for supporting social intelligence. This article proposes the joint method of triple attention and novel loss function for entity relation extraction by few-shot learning in computational social systems. We consider using a prototypical network as the base model to acquire support set prototypes and to compare queries with the prototypes for classification. First, triple attention is employed to make the query instances and support set share interactive information in a global and instancewise manner, highlighting the important features. Second, we combine a weighted Euclidean distance function with a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to perform class matching, which maps the generated features to their proper classifications, emphasizing the prominent dimensions in the feature space and relieving data sparsity. Third, triplet loss and uniformity regularization are used to solve the inconsistency problem faced by the support set, where the features of the support set in the same class are often far apart in different characteristic dimensions. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate the improved performance of our model on the FewRel dataset.},

  abstract     = {Centrality is an effective method to identify important nodes in complex networks, but it is still a challenge to find influential nodes by making full use of multiple relationships and global network topological features in complex networks. To address these problems, this article proposes an importance identification method for multilayer heterogeneous network node by incorporating multirelational information (MLC). This method studies the relational characteristics of heterogeneous nodes in detail and divides the heterogeneous nodes into different layers according to the node types, which can be further divided into core and auxiliary layers. The importance of the auxiliary layer is quantified by designing the interlayer influence and determining the interlayer influence weights of different connectivity influences; the centrality score of heterogeneous nodes under multiconnectivity relationships is fused using the transmission characteristics of internode relationships in the auxiliary layer, which in turn measures the importance of nodes in the core layer. To evaluate the proposed algorithm, we conduct experiments on five real multilayer heterogeneous networks of different sizes. The results show that MLC can make full use of different types of internode association relationship information, effectively fuse network structure information such as the neighbor weights of core and auxiliary layer nodes, and outperform the existing techniques in identifying important nodes.},

Hence, there is an urgent need to develop models that can minimize the spread of rumors. In this article, we propose a novel framework to improve the cost and efficiency of rumor propagation control. First, to reduce the impact of rumor controlling mechanism on users’ normal activities, we introduce a soft dynamic quarantine strategy into rumor propagation control and develop a new propagation model named susceptible-infected-removed-quarantined ignorants-quarantined spreaders (SIRQU) to model and block the rumor propagation in the network. Second, to further improve the control efficiency, we propose an influential node selection algorithm based on discrete particle swarm optimization with an evolutionary search strategy, and the controlling mechanism is only applied on the most influential nodes. Finally, we conduct a series of simulations and experiments on several public datasets and the dataset collected from Sina Weibo to validate the proposed method, and the results show that the proposed method outperfoms the related baseline algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Thanks to the great advancement of cognitive computing, artificial intelligence, big data, and the Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, the fusion of the physical and virtual worlds is changing people’s lifestyles. Although the research and deployment of cyber-physical systems (CPSs) are notably promoted by cognitive computing, the reliability and large-scale application of CPSs are still significantly challenged by some security issues. Therefore, it is meaningful to clarify and address the weaknesses of current intrusion detection methods for CPSs and enhance the ability to identify, analyze, and predict to improve the performance of intrusion detection. In this article, we first propose a novel self-learning spatial distribution algorithm, named Euclidean distance-based between-class learning (EBC learning), which improves between-class learning by calculating the Euclidean distance (ED) among &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$k$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -nearest neighbors of different classes. In addition, a cognitive computing-based intrusion detection method named border-line SMOTE and EBC learning based on random forest (BSBC-RF) is also proposed based on the EBC learning for industrial CPSs. The experimental results over a real industrial traffic dataset show that the proposed EBC learning has strong spatial constraint capability and can improve the prediction and recognition performance. Compared with the eight state-of-the-art methods, the proposed method has an ACC exceeding 99.5%, false alarm rate (FAR) less than 0.06%, and &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$F1$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; close to 0.99, which is still superior to other ones.},

  abstract     = {Big data and cognitive computing have a wide range of applications in smart homes, smart cities, artificial intelligence, and computational social systems. Visible light positioning systems have attracted more and more attention as one of the application scenarios of computational social systems. In visible light positioning systems, the light-emitting diodes (LEDs) ceiling layout makes the smartphone usually obtain less than three LEDs in captured images. Due to the lack of necessary positioning information, most scholars combine the inertial measurement unit (IMU) with the modified filter algorithms to achieve positioning under the sparse light source. However, these systems have the following problems: 1) the azimuth angle obtained by the IMU is always not accurate, which decreases the positioning accuracy and 2) during the dynamic positioning process, the system’s initial position is difficult to automatically determine. In this article, we propose indoor high-precision visible light positioning under the sparse light source. First, we propose the geometric correction mechanism, which uses ellipse fitting to calibrate the azimuth angle, so as to increase the positioning accuracy for the static system. Then, we build a motion model for the entire positioning process through the unscented particle filter (UPF), which does not need to manually set initial state parameters, due to random generated particles. It can increase the positioning accuracy for the dynamic system. We evaluate our designed system, and the experimental results show that the average azimuth angle error is 2.04° and average positioning error is 8.8 cm, under the sparse light source.},

  abstract     = {Different from the social network which only focuses on the interaction between people, the integration of social networks and the internet of things (IoT) leads to multi-directional interactions of human to human, human to thing, and thing to thing. The social IoT is composed of a large number of heterogeneous devices, which can improve the scalability of resource and service. Meanwhile, the heterogeneous devices have uneven computing power and different location information measurement types (e.g., the distance, angle, and hop count). Therefore, a localization approach with easy-to-obtain measurement data and low requirements on the computing power is needed. In this article, we propose a localization approach for the social IoT by combining the fuzzy rough set theory and the ridge regression extreme learning machine (RRELM). First of all, a location fingerprint database is constructed. Different from the traditional location fingerprint database, the location fingerprint database here stores the minimum hop counts between the reference node (RN) and the anchor node (AN) instead of the received signal strength (RSS). Second, the fuzzy rough set theory is used to compute the significant degree of each AN, and the ANs that contribute little to the positioning result are removed. This approach not only relieves the storage pressure of the location fingerprint database but also reduces the computational complexity of user position estimation. Third, the RRELM is trained by using the samples in the location fingerprint database. Finally, by inputting the newly collected minimum hop counts from the user to each AN into the trained RRELM, the user’s position is estimated. From the extensive experimental results, the proposed approach has high positioning accuracy and low computational complexity, which is suitable for the social IoT.},

Electronic health (E-health) is a critical branch of CSS. Artificial intelligence-based cognitive computing is especially appropriate for solving E-health problems in social science. The development of the Internet of Things (IoT) and sensor technologies is triggering data explosion in E-health CSS. The IoT-based edge computing has been applied in the field of E-health to reduce the latency of data transmission. However, small edge devices have limited resources (e.g., computational and storage resources). There is an urgent need to develop lightweight and efficient classification models to classify E-health sensor data in edge computing. Automatic health sensor data classification can help medical workers make correct clinical decisions. Also, patient-specific modeling in E-health is important. Using personalized classification model can achieve higher diagnose accuracy than the generic models trained based on historical datasets. To address the above problems, we propose a lightweight personalized sensor data classification model, called LPClass. It embeds the shallow recurrent neural network as a kernel, which makes it lightweight enough to be deployed on edge devices. In addition, a transfer learning algorithm is proposed to build personalized models for individuals. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate LPClass from different aspects. Compared with the generic models, the personalized models in LPClass can achieve a fast convergence rate while maintaining high classification accuracy.},

The literature search and selection process included 21 eligible articles. The content analysis was then conducted from three aspects of investigated cognitive statuses, experiment design, and data analysis. The investigated cognitive statuses include vigilance, mental fatigue, mental stress, attention, mental workload, and emotional state. The experiment design is reviewed from the perspective of participant selection, device selection and electrode deployment, task design, and label selection. The data analysis involves EEG signal preprocessing, feature extraction, and cognitive status computation. Five major limitations of the existing studies have been identified, and five future research directions are proposed to address these limitations. This review provides guidance for researchers to use EEG for measuring and computing various cognitive statuses of construction workers.

To avoid the influence of noise on EEG analysis results, it is necessary to use filtering and defalsification methods to process EEG. Four methods, including Butterworth filter, finite impulse response (FIR) filter, elliptic filter, and wavelet decomposition, are summarized. Based on the Riemann manifold theory, a feature extraction algorithm under transfer learning based on tangent space selection (TL-TSS) is proposed. In the process of decoding EEG, an EEG decoding method combining entropy measure and singular spectrum analysis (SSA) is proposed. An algorithm performance is tested on the motor imagery dataset of the two International BCI Competitions. It is found that when the training sample size accounts for 5%, the TL-TSS algorithm proposed in this work is superior to other algorithms in classification accuracy. In particular, compared with common spatial pattern (CSP) algorithm, it has great advantages. The classification accuracy of A2, A4, A8, and A9 users is the best, and especially for A8 users, the classification accuracy reaches 97.88%. In summary, in the EEG interface technology of DT cognitive computing platform, the combination of cognitive computing and deep learning can improve the recognition and analysis effect of EEG, which is of great value for further optimization of DT cognitive computing system.},

Accurate extraction of the key regions of interest (ROIs) in X-ray images is required to accurately assess bone age. However, existing ROI extraction methods can only extract a few targets and have poor extraction accuracy. Thus, the strict demands for imaging in the medical field via these methods are difficult. In this article, we propose a multitarget interested region extraction method for wrist X-ray images based on optimized AlexNet and two-class combined model, named OATC, which can simultaneously extract multiple ROIs with high accuracy. Specifically, the square-wave scanning algorithm was implemented to obtain the bounding box size of each bone ROI according to the shape information of the wrist. Then, the optimized AlexNet was used to obtain the key point coordinates of each bone ROI. Bone ROIs could be extracted by combining key point coordinates with the bone bounding box size. Finally, the two-classification model was combined to improve the accuracy of ROI extraction. Experiments conducted on our wrist X-ray image dataset showed that OTAC has a fast convergence speed and small deviation. The average accuracy of extracting 14 ROIs reached 95.57%, which are 7.76% and 4.68% higher than that of VGG16 and AlexNet, respectively.},

Human emotion is the basic component of human cognitive activities. Electroencephalogram (EEG) computer signals obtained from a brain computer interface are difficult to conceal, and using machine learning methods to analyze EEG emotion is a hot topic in artificial intelligence. However, the EEG signal is non-stationary, making it difficult to select sufficient data from the same person to train a classifier for a subject. To promote the performance of emotion recognition methods, a multi-source domain transfer discriminative dictionary learning modeling (MDTDDL) is proposed in this study. The method integrates transfer learning and dictionary learning in a learning model, including the concepts of subspace learning, manifold smoothness, margin-based discriminant embedding, and large margin. The domain-specific transformation matrix projects EEG signals from various domains into the transfer subspace. The domain-invariant dictionary can find potential connections between multiple source domains and target domain. The manifold smoothness and margin-based discriminant embedding term further improve the model’s learning ability. The alternating optimization technique is used in model solving to efficiently compute model parameters. Experiments on the SEED and DEAP datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MDTDDL.},

The present article develops medical image fusion-based watermarking scheme in dual tree complex wavelet transform (DTCWT)-singular value decomposition (SVD) domain. Here, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images are partitioned into a sequence of high frequencies and low frequency by non-subsampled shearlet transform (NSST) to obtain a fused image as a carrier. To enhance the authenticity, spatial and transform domain-based embedding is conducted to conceal multi-marks into carrier image. Finally, improved encryption scheme is employed to obtain a secure marked carrier image. Objective and subjective evaluations indicate a strong robustness effect (43.64%) of the proposed algorithm compared to other methods with remarkable invisibility, payload, and security. To the best of our knowledge, studies of image fusion-based dual watermarking and encryption have not yet been developed in combination with spatial and transform domain schemes for copy protection and ownership of health records, since it is also suitable for applications in the cloud.},

  abstract     = {Computational social systems (CSSs) focus on topics such as modeling, simulation, analysis, and understanding of social systems from the quantitative and/or computational perspective. “Systems” can be man–man, man–machine, and machine–machine organizations and adversarial situations as well as social media structures and their dynamics [1] , [2] . With the advance of the Internet of Things and communication technologies, various kinds of data from diverse areas can be acquired nowadays. As a result, CSSs are becoming ever more complex. Data-driven CSSs aim to conduct pre-competitive research on architectures and design, modeling, and analysis techniques for cyber-physical systems, with emphasis on making full use of big data and artificial intelligence. These applications include transportation systems, automation, security, smart buildings, smart cities, medical systems, energy generation and distribution, water distribution, agriculture, military systems, process control, asset management, and robotics [3] , [4] , [5] . However, due to the progressive transformation from host-centric networking to information-centric networking, CSSs pose fundamental challenges in multiple aspects, such as heterogeneous data generation, efficient data sensing and collection, real-time data processing, and greater request arrival rates. Thus, there is a great need for a powerful way that can deal with emerging issues in data-driven CSSs more efficiently and effectively in the age of big data.},

With the rapid increase of high-speed railway (HSR) operating mileage and development of information technology, the disposal flow and methods in emergency response are still based on dispatchers and drivers’ experience within the “layered” architecture of current system. There is a certain gap between current processing methods and effective resolution, which may even cause the spread of delay along with the railway networks. Therefore, we propose an integration system of operation control and online rescheduling to improve the recovery ability of HSR carrying capacity. We first describe the framework, information flow, and disposal process of the current system and analyze the shortcomings in handling emergencies. Then, the basic concept, system structure, and framework of the integration system are introduced. Finally, taking temporary speed restriction caused by strong wind as an example, we also analyze the principle of why and how the integration system can promote the recovery ability of HSR carrying capacity.},

It changes the basic structure and legacy norms of current scientific systems via reshaping the cooperation mode, value system, and incentive mechanism. As such, it can provide a viable path for solving bottleneck problems in the development of science, such as oligarchy, silos, and so on, and make science more fair, free, responsible, and sensitive. However, DeSci itself still faces many challenges, including scaling, balancing the quality of participants, system suboptimal loops, lack of accountability mechanism, and so on. Taking these into consideration, this article presents a systematic introduction of DeSci, proposes a novel reference model with a six-layer architecture, addresses the potential applications, and also outlines the key research directions in this emerging field.

This class of problems, widely formulated as forming a team of experts in social networks (i.e., team formation problem), is very challenging due to its NP-hardness and has attracted much research attention. Although various effective and elegant algorithms have been proposed to address this important problem, the methods are usually manually designed and handcrafted, which require considerable human efforts. In this article, we make our first attempt to automate the algorithm design with a machine learning-based approach, named reinforcement learning-based expert team identification (RELEXT). Moreover, we also propose two novel graph embedding methods to consider two important dimensions of the team formation problem, i.e., the skill and social dimensions. We evaluate the proposed approaches on multiple large-scale real datasets. The experimental results show that our proposed approaches outperform the other baselines in terms of solution quality and efficiency.},

Then, five index sets are described by interval type-2 fuzzy sets, and the corresponding membership functions and membership function figures are provided. The feasibility of interval type-2 fuzzy comprehensive evaluation in risk evaluation of NPJ is demonstrated through example, and the fuzzy rule bases of prevention and treatment for NPJ are constructed according to the results of risk evaluation. Finally, this article demonstrates that the proposed risk evaluation and treatment process of NPJ is actually a dynamic closed-loop control process, which is consistent with the clinical treatment process.

On addressing the zero-shot SER task, auditory affective descriptors (AADs) are typically employed to transfer affective knowledge from seen- to unseen-emotional states. However, it remains unknown which types of AADs can well describe emotional states in speech during the transfer. In this regard, we define and research on three types of AADs, namely, per-emotion semantic-embedding, per-emotion manually annotated, and per-sample manually annotated AADs, through zero-shot emotion recognition in speech. This leads to a systematic design including prototype- and annotation-based zero-shot SER modules, relying on the input from per-emotion and per-sample AADs, respectively. We then perform extensive experimental comparisons between human and machines’ AADs on the French emotional speech corpus CINEMO for positive-negative (PN) and within-negative (WN) tasks. The experimental results indicate that semantic-embedding prototypes from pretrained models can outperform manually annotated emotional dimensions in zero-shot SER. The results further demonstrate that it is possible for machines to understand and describe affective information in speech better than human beings, with the help of sufficient pretrained models.},

  abstract     = {Cultural heritage sites are precious and fragile resources that hold significant historical, esthetic, and social values in our society. However, the increasing frequency and severity of natural and man-made disasters constantly strike the cultural heritage sites with significant damages. In this article, we focus on a cultural heritage damage assessment (CHDA) problem where the goal is to accurately locate the damaged area of a cultural heritage site using the imagery data posted on social media during a disaster event by exploring the collective strengths of both AI and human intelligence from crowdsourcing systems. Unlike other infrastructure-based solutions, social media platforms provide a more pervasive and scalable solution to acquire timely cultural heritage damage information during disaster events. Our work is motivated by the limitation of current AI solutions that fail to accurately model the complex cultural heritage damage due to the lack of essential human cultural knowledge to differentiate various damage types and identify the actual causes of the damage. Two critical technical challenges exist in solving our problem: 1) it is challenging to effectively detect the problematic cultural heritage damage estimation of AI in the absence of ground truth labels and 2) it is nontrivial to acquire accurate cultural background knowledge from the potentially unreliable crowd workers to effectively address the failure cases of AI. To address the above-mentioned challenges, we develop CollabLearn, an uncertainty-aware crowd-AI collaborative assessment system that explicitly explores the human intelligence from crowdsourcing systems to identify and fix AI failure cases and boost the damage assessment accuracy in CHDA applications. The evaluation results on real-world datasets show that CollabLearn consistently outperforms both the state-of-the-art AI-only and crowd-AI hybrid baselines in accurately assessing the damage of several world-renowned cultural heritage sites in recent disaster events.},

Current studies mainly focus on competitive influence maximization and opinion maximization. However, COM in signed social networks has not been studied in depth. In this article, we study the COM in signed social networks and propose a novel reinforcement-learning-based opinion maximization framework (RLOM) to solve the COM problem. The proposed RLOM is composed of two phases: the activated dynamic opinion model and the reinforcement-learning-based seeding process. We theoretically prove the COM problem to be NP-hard. To model the opinion propagation process, we propose the activated dynamic opinion model based on a stateless Q-learning approach. Moreover, we propose the reinforcement-learning-based seeding scheme, which is leveraged in an unknown opponent strategy. Experiment results verify the effectiveness of our method in terms of effective opinions on three signed datasets.},

Device heterogeneity is addressed using the proposed multiplicative convergence-based heterogeneity mitigation (MCHM) method. The proposed warehouse LSTM, in addition to support vector machine (SVM), is leveraged in this work for healthcare data classification. The warehouse LSTM keeps a track of the data that are considered as insignificant in the initial epoch. We mitigate heterogeneity in medical devices and reduce the root-mean-squared error to the order of 10−6–10−5. Using the warehouse, the LSTM-SVM attains the classification accuracies of 98.34% and 96.27% during training on the MIT-BIH and PTB datasets, respectively.

However, the imposed character limit (280 characters) by Twitter and infrequent online activities of a section of users poses a serious setback in using computational methods for mental health analysis or emotion research. Twitter provides rich metadata information about its users (such as user’s description, geolocation, and profile image URL), which can provide valuable information regarding the mental state of the users. We hypothesize that Twitter’s rich metadata information about their users can provide some valuable depression cues, which may help in an early low-profile evaluation. In this article, we investigate this hypothesis by developing an end-to-end multimodal multitask (MT) system for depression detection (primary task) and emotion recognition (auxiliary task), where the variation of emotion information based on different user descriptions assists the learning of the primary task. The proposed system attains 70% accuracy on the depression detection task outperforming several single-task (ST) baselines built on the various combination of input features. Our findings indicate that Twitters’s rich metadata information can be leveraged to detect depression among users with significant confidence.},

  abstract     = {Self-service spatiotemporal crowdsourcing (SSC), a booming variant of spatiotemporal crowdsourcing (SC), emerges because of the vigorous development of the mobile Internet. Unlike the conventional SCs, the particularity of self-service in SSC may lead to unfinished tasks at the end of the entire assignment process, making a one-time assignment scheme ineffective. SSC is essentially an adaptive collaboration (AC) problem that requires a dynamic assignment strategy for a higher task completion rate. This article tackles this issue by establishing a quasi group role assignment (QGRA) based on a typical SSC scenario, that is, the photographing to make money problem (PMMP). First, it sheds light on a novel role awareness method, which can effectively divide tasks to accelerate the solution while, to some extent, raising the task completion rate. Second, it specifies an agent satisfaction evaluation (ASE) method to quantify the relationship between task completion rate and workers’ satisfaction. This method aims at considerably ameliorating task completion rate. Last, it extends QGRA with a new AC algorithm, which can achieve AC of the workers while accomplishing the crowdsourcing task. Moreover, utilizing the ASE method can help decision-makers balance the task completion rate and the workers’ satisfaction. Large-scale simulation experiments based on the real crowdsourced datasets exemplify the robustness and practicability of the proposed solutions. This article contributes a new version of the group role assignment (GRA) model, that is, quasi GRA (QGRA), a creative formalization to solve the AC problem.},

The fast evolution of our economy, lack of driver training, and the grown affordability of our society are reasons for this mismatch in developing economies. We think that the inconsistency will increase and unfavorably affect our traffic structure unless intelligent algorithm-based solutions are developed and deployed. This article presents a system for providing safe, accurate, comfortable, reliable, fuel-efficient, and economical driving behavior using Machine Learning techniques like the hidden Markov model (HMM). Our proposed system recommends subsequent trips using a multi-objective optimization (MOO) technique for the driver. It provides suggestions concerning speed limits and alerts based on the driver’s behavior score and fuel efficiency. We used a publicly available UAH-DriveSet dataset captured by the driving monitoring app DriveSafe for all of our experiments. The results reveal that the proposed model predicts behavior with 95% accuracy and calculates fuel efficiency to improve driving quality and experience. This system recommends safer, more comfortable, more reliable, more efficient, and economical rides, beneficial for everyone in our society.},

  abstract     = {Collaborative teamwork is key to major scientific discoveries. However, the prevalence of collaboration among researchers makes team recognition increasingly challenging. Previous studies have demonstrated that people are more likely to collaborate with individuals they are familiar with. In this work, we employ the definition of familiarity and then propose faMiliarity-based cOllaborative Team recOgnition (MOTO) algorithm to recognize collaborative teams. MOTO calculates the shortest distance matrix within the global collaboration network and the local density of each node. Central team members are initially recognized based on local density. Then, MOTO recognizes the remaining team members by using the familiarity metric and shortest distance matrix. Extensive experiments have been conducted upon a large-scale dataset. The experimental results show that compared with baseline methods, MOTO can recognize the largest number of teams. The teams recognized by the MOTO possess more cohesive team structures and lower team communication costs compared with other methods. MOTO utilizes familiarity in team recognition to identify cohesive academic teams. The recognized teams are in line with real-world collaborative teamwork patterns. Based on team recognition using MOTO, the research team structure and performance are further analyzed for given time periods. The number of teams that consist of members from different institutions increases gradually. Such teams are found to perform better in comparison with those whose members are from the same institution.},

The existing works focus on improving the accuracy of geolocalization algorithms and reducing the prediction error. However, little work has been done on improving the computing efficiency of geolocalization algorithms. When dealing with large-scale data, the existing algorithm efficiency is greatly reduced. To solve this problem, we summarize three modes of user access to point of interests (PoIs), further propose a variety of location recall methods, and then introduce these geolocation recall methods into the existing algorithm. Geolocation recall generates a candidate location set for each user according to the user’s historical behavior records to reduce the search space of the geolocalization algorithm and improve its efficiency. We carried out experiments on the ground-truth datasets, compared the performance of various location recall methods, and verified the excellent location recall performance of three geolocalization algorithms. The experimental results show that location recall shortens the calculation time of the three algorithms by approximately 70% and further improves the accuracy of these algorithms.},

In this article, we propose a 2-D behavior-marker-based data-forwarding incentive scheme to motivate vehicle nodes to participate in data forwarding in fog-computing-based SIoVs. First, we design a 2-D behavior marker mechanism, which can be used to completely evaluate vehicle nodes. Second, we construct a currency credit-based data-forwarding incentive strategy based on the 2-D marker and the social attributes of vehicle nodes, which is used to deal with vehicular normal behavior, vehicular selfish behavior, and vehicular malicious behavior. Compared with other related schemes, our proposed scheme can completely evaluate the behaviors of vehicle nodes and can further promote the cooperation of data-forwarding between selfish nodes.

Clustering-based CF methods can effectively deal with data sparsity and scalability problems. However, most of them are applied to a single representation space, which might not characterize complex user–item interactions well. We argue that the user–item interactions should be observed from multiple views and characterized in an adaptive way. To address this issue, we leveraged the global and local properties to construct multiple representation spaces by learning various training datasets and loss functions. An attention network was built to generate a blended representation according to the relative importance of the representation spaces for each user–item pair, providing a flexible way to characterize diverse user–item interactions. Substantial experiments were evaluated on four popular benchmark datasets. The results show that the proposed method is superior to several CF methods where only one representation space is considered.},

A variety of techniques, including content-based, collaborative, and knowledge-based techniques, have been proposed for performing recommendations. Recommendation systems are employed to suggest content, such as books, music, and videos; furthermore, they are often used in e-commerce. In particular, the South Korean film industry recommends movies using a collaborative filtering method based on genres, which is commonly used in film recommendation systems. However, this method can be ineffective when users initially encounter film recommendation services or have specific preferences with respect to movies, such as preferences regarding actors or directors. This motivated us to propose an actor-based recommendation system using the content-based filtering that considers actors’ filmography information and the genres of 509 South Korean movies. The effectiveness and performance of the suggested system are evaluated in comparison with those of a traditional genre-oriented recommendation system.},

  abstract     = {Center loss is widely used as a supervision tool in deep learning method. However, the center loss also has some shortcomings, the most important of which is that it must be combined with softmax loss to run well. In this article, we sum up five shortcomings of center loss and solve all of them by proposing a dual distance center loss (DDCL). Compared with center loss, DDCL can run without the combination of softmax to supervise training the model. In addition, we verify the inconsistency between the proposed DDCL and softmax loss in the feature space. To be specifically, we add the Pearson distance on the basis of the Euclidean distance to the same center, which makes all features of the same class be confined to the intersection of a hypersphere and a hypercone in the feature space, strengthens the intraclass compactness of the center loss, and enhances the generalization ability of center loss. Moreover, by designing a Euclidean distance threshold between all center pairs, we not only strengthen the interclass separability of center loss, but also make the center loss (or DDCL) works well without the combination of softmax loss. We verify the effectiveness of DDCL in four datasets, two of which are widely used in the field of vehicle re-identification named VeRi-776 dataset and VehicleID dataset, and two other datasets are widely used in the field of person re-identification named Market1501 dataset and MSMT17 dataset. The experimental results of the proposed DDCL exceed that of the softmax loss in all the four datasets, indicating that our proposed method not only can run without the combination of softmax, but also has a high accuracy.},

A lot of tweets are posted along with multimedia content during the occurrence of any natural disaster event.

Moreover, because of the limited size of the tweets, in many cases, tweets are associated with images. The current work is the first of its kind where both the image and the tweet text are utilized simultaneously to generate a summary from microblog data generated during a disaster event. Different aspects, such as syntactic similarity, the maximum length of the tweets, retweet score, and antiredundancy, are considered as objective functions and those are simultaneously optimized using a metaheuristic population-based evolutionary strategy to select a good set of tweets to form a good quality summary. In order to extract information from images, a dense captioning model is utilized and the dense captions are further utilized for calculating the antiredundancy measure. We employed word mover distance to capture the semantic similarity between two tweets. Due to the unavailability of the dataset for multimodal microblog summarization tasks in a disaster-event scenario, datasets are created and made openly available to the community. The obtained summarization results are evaluated using the well-known ROUGE measure.},

In the case of autoencoder-based normality model trained using segments of normal events only, there may be chances of anomalous events to be reconstructed well, leading to anomalous events detected as normal events. In this work, we propose deep discriminative embedding (DDE)-based framework using residual spatiotemporal auotencoders (R-STAEs) that learn V2AnomalyVec embeddings. In place of R-STAEs, any promising deep architectures to extract deep features from video segments of normal and abnormal events can also be used to form V2AnomalyVec. Results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that the V2AnomalyVec-based approach performs significantly better than the normality model-based approaches and other state-of-the-art approaches. Studies with a reduced number of abnormal video segments to train the model prove that the proposed approach is also appropriate for detecting anomalous events even with less amount of abnormal training data.},

The environments-classes, agents, roles, groups, and objects (E-CARGO) model and the role-based collaboration (RBC) methodology assist the formalization of group role assignment (GRA) problem, which models and solves the optimization problem for a group of agents to play a set of roles from the team’s perspective.

  abstract     = {In the present study, a two-stage data envelopment analysis (DEA) model and spatial econometric method were employed to evaluate and analyze the utilization efficiency of urban water resources and spatial–temporal differences in cities of China. The traditional DEA model was enhanced by adopting the Shannon entropy in the first stage. After selecting variables based on the previous step and the Bayes information criterion (BIC), redundant variables were removed. In the meanwhile, a comprehensive efficiency score (CES) was generated to rank the efficiency. Finally, spatial econometric analysis was applied to explore the spatial–temporal differences of urban water resource utilization efficiency. Results demonstrate that: 1) according to the calculations and analysis, communities should concentrate on increasing investment in equipment and technology that can help enhance water consumption efficiency, while overlooking some minor aspects, such as per capita gross domestic product (PCGDP); 2) most cities have poor water resource utilization efficiency (low CES). However, both input and output have much room for the improvement; 3) Lhasa, Beijing, Haikou, and Shanghai have high CES, indicating that the utilization efficiency of water resources is not entirely dependent on economic development; and 4) through performing the Lagrange multiplier (LM) test, the spatial error model (SEM) test is passed at the significant level of 5%. Moreover, the water resource utilization efficiency of a city may be enhanced with the economic development in neighboring cities.},

  abstract     = {Fusing the single modality medical images to obtain a distinct multimodality image is needed to ensure a better clinical experience. However, the distribution of these fused images brings the issues of ownership and authentication and has attracted many researchers. Presently, large volumes of medical data are stored on cloud platforms. However, outsourcing medical data to this popular platform may introduce security issues. Following this, we introduce a secure data hiding in fused medical image for smart healthcare, since it is also suitable for applications in the cloud. To achieve this, we first create a fused medical image as a cover by nonsubsampled contourlet transform (NSCT). The method, which is based on NSCT, QR, and Schur decomposition, allows concealing the image and electronic patient records (EPR) mark into the fused image. Importantly, EPR watermark includes a hash value of cover is created first and then embedded into the cover via magic cube-based procedure. Finally, the marked image is encrypted using deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), chaotic maps, and a hash function-based encryption scheme. The introduced watermarking scheme has been evaluated using 25 pairs of medical images and several embedding/extracting parameters. Apart from being satisfactorily imperceptible, the proposed work is also robust and secure against well-known signal processing attacks and promising results are obtained when compared with similar techniques. It indicates a considerable improvement in robustness of 66.7% and 99.7% over existing discrete wavelet transform (DWT)–singular value decomposition (SVD)-based watermarking schemes.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we mimic interactions among agents on social networks and examine their impact on the evolution of agents’ opinions. Each agent is entitled to an opinion represented by unit vectors of varying orientation. Agents are also characterized based on their inclination to alter their opinion and their susceptibility to the influence of peers with contrasting opinions. The agents constitute the nodes of a directed and time-varying influence network whose edges form their respective familiarity neighborhoods and govern their interactions. We also devise an interpersonal influence score to quantify the strength of the influence and the probability of acquisition, retention, or loss of a tie. This characterization of agents’ behavior and their interpersonal relationships differs from traditional bounded-confidence models based on the agreement in opinions alone. The agents with different traits form groups—liberal and conservative—distinguished by the distribution in opinions of their constituents. We analyze their interactions with different initial opinions, group compositions, network structures, and network evolution rates through simulations. The results reveal that flexible agents facilitate consensus among group members, while stubborn agents are instrumental in forming opinion clusters. This is substantiated by observing the average connectedness of the influence network and the average number of opinion clusters; groups with mostly flexible agents have better connectedness and fewer clusters than groups with stubborn agents in a majority. The simulations with stubborn agents reveal that new ties among agent pairs do not facilitate group consensus.},

  abstract     = {With the tremendous growth in online information, capturing dynamic users’ preferences based on their historical interactions and providing a few desirable items to users have become an urgent service for all businesses. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and item-based collaborative filtering (CF) models are commonly used in industries due to their simplicity and efficiency. However, they fail to different contexts that could differently influence current users’ decision-making. Also, they are not sufficient to capture multiple users’ interests based on features of the interacting items. Besides, they have a limited modeling capability for the evolution of diversity and dynamic user preferences. In this article, we exploit long- and short-term preferences for deep context-aware recommendations (LSCAR) to enhance the next item recommendation’s performance by introducing three novel components as follows: 1) the user–contextual interaction module is proposed to capture and differentiate the interaction between contexts and users; 2) the encoded multi-interest module is introduced to capture various types of user interests; and 3) the integrator fusion gate module is used to effectively fuse the related long-term interests to the current short-term part, and the module returns the final user interest representation. Extensive experiments and results for two public datasets demonstrate that the proposed LSCAR outperforms the state-of-the-art models in almost all metrics and could provide interpretable recommendation results.},

However, the flexibility of computational experiments leads to arbitrary modeling processes and unconvincing results, which greatly hinder the large-scale application of this method. In this context, the verification of computational models has become an urgent problem in this field. Currently, model evaluation is still in its infancy and the existing evaluation methods are not mature enough. Thus, we took epidemic models as the research object and proposed a capability maturity evaluation framework for computational models of artificial society. The framework differs from previous assessment methods that focus on the validity of results, but instead provides a comprehensive evaluation from two perspectives: 1) evaluation of the model itself—by comparing the expectation with the final implementation, we can obtain whether the model meets the expectation and 2) comparison between different models—by evaluating the implementation process of each model and comparing the results, we can identify more mature models. The implementation of the model is evaluated from input, process, and output. Further, specific analyses and evaluations are conducted for several representative COVID-19 models to verify the validity of this evaluation framework. The results of the case study show that the proposed evaluation framework can help decision-makers identify more mature and referential models, and point out the directions where modelers can improve their models.},

The proposed algorithm, called the density-peak-based overlapping community detection (DPOCD) algorithm, defines point link strength and edge link strength to construct distance matrix. Unlike the density peaks clustering algorithm, by which cluster centers are selected manually, the DPOCD algorithm uses the linear fitting method to select community centers. To evaluate the feasibility of the presented algorithm, we compared it with other advanced methods on artificial synthetic network and real complex network datasets.

The approach divulges the contextual similarity between two words in the corpus via lexical-, dictionary-, and topic-based features, thus revealing the emotion labels of domain-specific words. As unfolding the recursive structure of language is an irreducible component of how humans understand a sentence, in this study, a propagation mechanism is designed that takes advantage of a shallow parser to derive the emotions associated with the words and their parent phrases. This mechanism pushes beyond the limits of most word co-occurrence approaches and facilitates the multilabel emotion tagging of a sentence in a manner reflecting human cognition. Evaluations on two benchmark corpora support the validity of the propagation mechanism. Further evaluation of a financial corpus indicates that our system outperforms the traditional bag-of-words approach. Our approach provides better modeling of compositional emotions by considering the emotion-bearing words, shifters, intensifiers, and overall sentence structure.},

  abstract     = {Sea-level rise (SLR) problem, which is a major outcome of climate change, has been well documented and studied. Although it is globally observed due to climate change, local projections are needed to plan SLR adaptation strategies accurately. Since SLR is a community-wide multistakeholder problem at the local level, adaptation strategies can be more successful if the main stakeholders, e.g., government, residents, and businesses, collaborate in shaping them. Simulating the local socioeconomic system around SLR, including the interactions between essential stakeholders and nature, can be an effective way of evaluating different adaptation strategies and planning the best strategy for the local community. This work presents how such an SLR socioeconomic system can be modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP) and simulated using multiagent reinforcement learning (RL). The proposed multiagent RL framework serves two purposes. It provides a general scenario planning tool to investigate the cost–benefit analysis of natural events (e.g., flooding and hurricane) and agents’ investments (e.g., infrastructure improvement). It also shows how much the total cost due to SLR can be reduced over time by optimizing the adaptation strategies. We demonstrate the proposed scenario planning tool using available economic data and sea-level projections for Pinellas County, Florida, in a case study.},

Therefore, the purpose of this article is to establish a data-driven robust cost consensus model induced by uncertain weights to deal with the adverse effects of uncertainty in the aggregating process. First, the probability density function of the uncertain weight in the aggregation operator is obtained by the kernel density estimation method, and the confidence level is used to control the perturbation range of the uncertainty. Second, a new uncertainty set based on the data-driven robust optimization method is established, which is called the flexible uncertainty set, and two classes of data-driven robust consensus models under uncertain environments are proposed. In the application of power emergency management, by using the data-driven method to traverse the historical data of weights, the new model can effectively deal with the uncertainty caused by the deviation and improve the quality of the aggregation operator, which proves the applicability of the proposed model.},

Relevant studies were selected from subscription-based digital libraries, free-to-access bibliographies, and self-curated repositories and then screened for relevance with key information extracted and structured against the following facets: natural language processing (NLP) methods, data characteristics, classification methods, and evaluation results. A total of 25 studies published between 2014 and 2018 covering 15 types of classification algorithms were included in this review. Support vector machines (SVMs), Bayesian classifiers, and decision trees were the most commonly employed algorithms with recent emergence of neural network approaches. Domain-specific, application programming interface (API)-driven collection is the most prevalent origin of datasets. The reuse of previously published datasets as a means of benchmarking algorithms against other studies is also prevalent.

In the situation where computational resources for real-time processing are limited, it is especially hard to select high-value data items from a big data stream. This article studies on selection policies based on the multiarmed bandit. We cache the online arriving data items in different buffers according to the characteristics of data items. These buffers are regarded as the arms of a multiarmed bandit. We pay attention to several key factors in selecting data items including the data item value, processing time, resource consumption, and loss value caused by some discarded items. Thus, a comprehensive reward mechanism for each data item is given as the foundation for the selection of data items, that is, gambling decision-making. We design three selection policies: the improved &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$\varepsilon $ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -greedy, the improved upper confidence bound (UCB), and a data item selection policy named dynamic high-reward incentive (DHRI) with active, dynamic, and incentive reward. They are all trying to balance “exploitation and exploration” in a multiarmed bandit. Experimental results show that our proposed approach is effective and outperforms the traditional methods.},

  abstract     = {Much work has already been studied on the interrelation between the epidemic spreading and awareness spreading to prevent infections in a social network. By selecting seed users to spread awareness, we can control epidemic spreading. However, selecting seed users with the maximum influential users may not be the best solution in location-based social networks. Therefore, it is challenging to determine users to spread the information (the awareness of prevention) in these networks. The minimized epidemic infection ( MEI ) problem aims to find a seed set with &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$k$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; seed users such that the infection users can be minimized. In this article, we propose a piecewise function to measure the probability of each user being infected, which considers the distance and time. Then, we propose an algorithm called location-infected-greedy (LIG) to solve the MEI problem by finding the seed nodes that consider the probability of infection, time of check-in, location information, and influence of users. In the meantime, LIG can obtain an upper bound of the data-dependent approximate ratio, and it runs in &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$O(kn^{2})$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; , where &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$n$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; is the total number of nodes and &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$k$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; is the number of seed nodes. Finally, extensive contrast experiments on real-world location-based social networks show that our algorithm is efficient and effective.},

  abstract     = {According to the World Health Organization and the CDC, social distancing is currently one of the most effective ways to slow the transmission of COVID-19. However, most existing epidemic models do not consider the impact of social distancing on the COVID-19 pandemic. In this article, we propose a new method to deterministic modeling of the effects of social distancing on the COVID-19 pandemic in a low transmission setting. Our model dynamic is expressed by a single predictive variable that satisfies an integro-differential equation. Once the dynamic variable is calculated, the process of agents from the normal state, infection state to rehabilitation state, or death state can be explored. Besides, an important parameter is added to the model to measure the impact of social distancing on epidemic transmission. We performed qualitative and quantitative experiments on various scenarios, and the results showed that 2 m is a safe social distancing on the COVID-19 pandemic in a low transmission setting.},

This work devises: 1) the KM-gossip algorithm for bolstering fog discovery and 2) a bargaining mechanism for pricing fog resources. The KM-gossip algorithm is a generalization of the gossip algorithm . It uses &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$K$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; broker agents ( BAs ) to cooperatively “gossip” requests among themselves, and in parallel , each BA relays the requests to &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$M$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; fog nodes. While computational complexity analysis validates that the KM-gossip algorithm has logarithmic time complexity (i.e., it is computationally efficient ), empirical results show that it significantly outperforms the existing gossip and flooding algorithms . Supplementing and complementing previous empirical results, game-theoretic analysis in this work validates that the bargaining mechanism generates Pareto optimal ( economically efficient ) solutions. The solutions also satisfy the famous Nash’s axioms that prescribe highly desirable properties of bargaining solutions.},

During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, social media sites play a crucial role in people communicating, sharing, and expressing their perceptions on various topics. Analyzing such textual data can improve the response time of governments and organizations to act on alarming issues. This study aims to perform sentiment analysis on the subject of COVID-19 vaccination, perform temporal and spatial analyses of the textual data, and find the most frequently discussed topics that may help organizations bring awareness to those topics. In this work, the sentiment analysis of tweets was performed using 14 different machine learning classifiers and natural language processing (NLP). Lexicon-based TextBlob and Vader are used for annotating the data. A natural language toolkit is used for preprocessing of textual data. Our analysis observed that unigram models outperform bigram and trigram models for all four datasets. Models using term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) have higher accuracy than models using count vectorizer. In the count vectorizer class, logistic regression has the best average accuracy with 91.925%. In the TF-IDF class, logistic regression has the best average accuracy of 92%; logistic regression has the highest average recall, F1-score, and ten cross-validation scores, and a ridge classifier has the highest average precision. The unigram models show a standard deviation (SD) of less than 1 for all classifiers except for the Gaussian Naïve Bayes showing 1.18. The experimental results reveal the dates and times in which most positive, negative, and neutral tweets are posted.},

Cyber insurance provides a valuable approach to transfer the cyber risks to insurance companies and further improve the security status of the insured. The designation of effective cyber-insurance contracts requires considerations from both the insurance market and the dynamic properties of the cyber risks. To capture the interactions between the users and the insurers, we present a dynamic moral-hazard type of principal–agent model incorporated with Markov decision processes, which are used to capture the dynamics and correlations of the cyber risks as well as the user’s decisions on the protections. We study and fully analyze a case with a two-state two-action user under linear coverage insurance and further show the risk compensation, Peltzman effect, linear insurance contract principle, and zero-operating profit principle in this case. Numerical experiments are provided to verify our conclusions and further extend to cases of a four-state three-action user under linear coverage insurance and threshold coverage insurance.},

Skyline query processing, a multicriteria decision-making optimized technique, is recently embedded into cohesive subgraphs mining in graphs/social networks. However, the existing studies cannot capture the fuzzy property of connections between users in social networks. To fill this gap, in this article, we formulate a novel model of the skyline &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$(\lambda,k)$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -cliques over a fuzzy attributed social network and develop a formal concept analysis (FCA)-based skyline &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$(\lambda,k)$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; -cliques identification algorithm.

It is even more important and difficult to adopt a novel change management method to bring multiple organizations across the business value chain into the change implementation. This research does not focused on change management within a single organization but rather emphasizes a change management method, including an appropriate change framework, well-defined critical success factors (CSFs), and related tools for implementing change in multiple organizations. This article introduces one kind of change management method to support a process change through global value chain (GVC) in multiple organizations, and the method is used in a case study to achieve a successful change. In order to succeed in optimizing GVC performance, this research applies the proposed change management method to the case GVC, to support technical change by obtaining the staff’s full commitment and engagement. The achieved results from the case study prove that successful change comes not only through technical solutions implemented in the problem process throughout the GVC but also through strong support and engagement from all organizations and involved staff. The proposed change management method not only helped the case GVC to implement change successfully but also can help the relevant multiple organizations to improve the GVC performance and add value by optimizing their problem process.},

Still, all contributors may find it difficult to assimilate into the OSS community even they are enthusiastic to make contributions. We thus suggest that partner recommendation across different roles may benefit both the users and developers, i.e., once we are able to make successful recommendation for those in need, it may dramatically contribute to the productivity of developers and the enthusiasm of users, thus further boosting OSS projects’ development. Motivated by this potential, we model the partner recommendation as link prediction task from email data via network embedding methods. In this article, we introduce time-series snapshot network (TSSN) that is a mixture network to model the interactions among users and developers. Based on the established TSSN, we perform temporal biased walk (TBW) to automatically capture both temporal and structural information of the email network, i.e., the behavioral similarity between individuals in the OSS email network. Experiments on ten Apache data sets demonstrate that the proposed TBW significantly outperforms a number of advanced random walk-based embedding methods, leading to the state-of-the-art recommendation performance.},

REM is a conventional approach to tackle such a problem, whereas the application of IRL is a largely unbeaten path. We begin by examining the mathematical components of both REM and IRL and find straightforward analogies between the two methods and the unique characteristics of the IRL approach. We demonstrate the special utility of IRL in characterizing group social interactions with two empirical experiments. In the first experiment, we use IRL to infer personal behavioral preferences based on a sequence of directed communication events from a multiple-team system, specifically a group of virtual-reality game players interacting and cooperating to accomplish a shared goal. In the second experiment, we draw evidence from a machine-coded international event database called the Kansas Event Data System (KEDS) and use IRL to infer the national behavioral inclinations of four major regional and global powers (Iran, Iraq, Russia, and the USA) underlying their interactions with one another during the 1990s Gulf area struggles. Our comparison and experiments introduce fresh perspectives for social behavior analytics and help inspire new research opportunities at the nexus of social network analysis and machine learning.},

The development of deep neural network (DNN) technology makes it possible for computers to automatically generate couplets. Especially, Transformer is a DNN-based “Encoder–Decoder” framework, and widely used in natural language processing (NLP). However, the existed Transformer mechanism cannot fully exploit the essential linguistic knowledge in Chinese, including the special format and requirements of Chinese couplets. Therefore, this article adapts the Transformer mechanism to generate meaningful Chinese couplets. Specifically, the contributions of our work are threefold. First, considering the fact that the words in the corresponding positions of the antecedent clause and the subsequent clause in a Chinese couplet always have same part-of-speech (pos, i.e., word class), pos information is intentionally added into the Transformer to improve the accuracy of the conceived couplet. Second, to deal with the large number of unregistered and low-frequency words in Chinese couplet, a specific unregistered/low-frequency word processing mechanism (UWP) is designed and combined with the Transformer model. Third, to further improve the coherence of couplets, we incorporate the polish mechanisms (PMs) into Transformer model. In terms of three evaluation criteria including bilingual evaluation understudy (BLEU), perplexity, and human evaluation, the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our designed Chinese couplet generation system.},

  abstract     = {Influence maximization, which aims to find a small number of influencers in a social network to maximize the influence spread under a certain propagation model, has attracted substantial attention due to its widespread applications, such as viral marketing and social advertising. However, most of the former studies focus primarily on maximizing the influence spread of a single product, which is not very common in actual marketing campaigns. In this article, we study a novel compatible influence maximization problem for two considered products, which involves more complex product adoption decisions of users in many realistic settings. The problem is NP-hard, and the objective function no longer exhibits monotonicity and submodularity. We propose an adapted greedy algorithm to solve the problem effectively. Due to its poor computational efficiency in the seed selection, we further propose a fast greedy algorithm that integrates several effective optimization strategies without compromising the accuracy and devise an efficient heuristic algorithm to approximate the influence spread calculation. Extensive experiments over real-world social networks of different sizes demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed methods.},

  abstract     = {Many link prediction algorithms regarding single-layer social networks have been proposed, and however, how to predict interlayer links in multiplex social networks is still in the initial stage. In fact, the prediction of interlayer links in multiplex networks is of great significance, which is closely related to network security, product recommendation, social network mining, and so forth. Given that many social networks are sparse and the number of the first-order common matched neighbors (CMNs) is very few, it is not sufficient to implement link prediction only based on the first-order CMNs. Moreover, many social networks have scale-free property, leading to the roles of CMNs in link prediction which are significantly different. In doing so, we propose a second-order iterative degree penalty (SOIDP) algorithm to predict interlayer links in multiplex networks, in which the information of the first- and second-order CMNs is integrally considered, as well as a degree penalty mechanism is introduced to give larger weight to the CMNs with fewer connections. In particular, to solve the problem of cumulative error in the iterative process, we demonstrate that the interlayer links can be predicted by directly calculating the matching degree matrix without iteration. Experiments on real-world networks show that the performance of SOIDP algorithm in predicting interlayer links is always better than the baseline algorithms, and the accuracy is increased 10% at least. For synthetic networks, the improvement is also very surprising when networks are rather sparse.},

Therefore, it is worth of studying the opinion dynamics of the RUW in the cyberspace. This article will start this direction with an analysis of the evolutionary dynamics of the public opinion fighting, only using Chinese Weibo texts as a case study due to the time constraint. It first clusters the Weibo texts into four categories with unsupervised learning method using Latent Dirichlet Allocation and then collects opinions by extracting keywords. Meanwhile, an opinion adversarial evolution algorithm is proposed to dynamically model the dominance degree of an opinion in the evolutionary processes. We release a dataset of Chinese Weibo associated with RUW. The proposed approach of modeling and analyzing data-driven public opinion dynamics provides a new way for accessing opinion warfare in CPSS.},

  abstract     = {To address the continuous occurrence of safety accidents in large public buildings, emergency evacuation has been an essential means of emergency disposal. However, risks also exist in the evacuation processes. Evaluating the risk of evacuation processes can be used for improving the safety of the evacuation processes and providing additional support for evacuation decision-making, which has important practical significance. At present, because of the complexity of evacuation processes and the lack of data, the research on evacuation risk assessment is still limited. Traditional risk assessment methods have more subjective and are difficult to fulfill the requirements of timeliness in emergency evacuations. With the development of artificial intelligence, it has provided a possibility to use deep learning methods to excavate the internal relationship of complex evacuation systems and achieve rapid risk assessments. This article innovatively applies deep learning methods to the field of risk assessment of evacuation. An approach based on the convolutional neural network is proposed in this article to establish an evacuation assessment model. Two network structures, Lenet and Resnet, are selected to train the model, respectively. A real case of the large stadium is used to illustrate the assessment way, and a large number of experiments were carried out to obtain the data required for training. The result shows that the deep learning method can realize an efficient and fast risk assessment.},

The proposed model integrates random walk with multiview learning, and recursively learns a globally stable probability distribution matrix from multiple views, on the basis of which the label indicator is obtained in the scene of clustering or semisupervised classification. Furthermore, an adaptive weight vector is learned to incorporate the diversity and complementarity of multiview data. Besides, the relationships between the proposed scheme and spectral clustering, neighborhood embedding and manifold embedding are analyzed theoretically. Finally, comprehensive comparative experiments are conducted with several state-of-the-art multiview clustering and semisupervised classification methods on eight real-world datasets.

These interactions enable positive collective outcomes such as enhancing collaboration in science. Conversely, undesirable effects have emerged: the self-segregation of online users within “bubbles” of biased content, the spread of misinformation, and the growing diffusion of aggressive speech with radical emotional valence. Affective polarization is the extent to which two opposing groups dislike one another, and it could be measured as the degree to which the two groups are willing to discriminate one against the other. Such social mechanism could occur in online social networks as a result of a controversial event in the offline world. To counter affective polarization, influential actors often make interventions using counter narratives in online social networks. However, a quantitative measure of the effectiveness of such counter narratives is typically not provided. In this study, we propose an approach to evaluate the affective polarization in online discussions generated by an offline controversial event and a measure of the effectiveness of counter narratives made by influential actors to attenuate the rise of affective polarization. The proposed approach was applied to five cases of controversial events that occurred in European soccer leagues using data collected from Twitter. Such an approach could be generalized to any other scenario involving an offline event that sparks divergent emotional reactions in online discussions and an official social media account that intervenes with a counter narrative to impact affective polarization.},

However, the publishing of social network data raises more and more privacy concerns. To protect user privacy, social networking data are usually anonymized before being released. Nevertheless, existing anonymization techniques do not have sufficient protection effects. A large number of deanonymization attacks have arisen, and they mainly make use of either network topology or node attribute information to successfully reidentify anonymized users. In this article, we model a social network as a structure-attribute network (SAN) integrating the structural characteristics and the attribute information associated with social network users. A novel similarity measurement of social network nodes is proposed by considering the structural similarity and attribute similarity. A two-phase scheme is then designed to perform deanonymization by first dividing a social network (graph) into smaller subgraphs based on spectral graph partitioning and then applying the proposed deanonymization algorithm on each matched subgraph pair. We simulate the deanonymization attack with extensive experiments on three real-world datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that our approach can improve the accuracy and time complexity of deanonymization compared with the state of the art.},

Specifically, we present a novel community-based graph model that represents the emergence of segregated echo chambers as a Markov bridge (MB) process. An MB is a 1-D Markov random field that facilitates modeling the formation and disassociation of communities at deterministic times, which is important in social networks with known timed events. We justify the proposed model with real-world examples and examine its performance on a recent Twitter dataset. We provide a model parameter estimation algorithm based on maximum likelihood and a Bayesian filtering algorithm for recursively estimating the level of segregation using noisy samples obtained from the network. Numerical results indicate that the proposed filtering algorithm outperforms the conventional hidden Markov modeling in terms of the mean-squared error. The proposed filtering method is useful in computational social science where data-driven estimation of the level of segregation from noisy data is required.},

  abstract     = {In the era of social networks, the rapid growth of data mining in information retrieval and natural language processing makes automatic text summarization necessary. Currently, pretrained word embedding and sequence to sequence models can be effectively adapted in social network summarization to extract significant information with strong encoding capability. However, how to tackle the long text dependence and utilize the latent topic mapping has become an increasingly crucial challenge for these models. In this article, we propose a topic-aware extractive and abstractive summarization model named T-BERTSum, based on Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERTs). This is an improvement over previous models, in which the proposed approach can simultaneously infer topics and generate summarization from social texts. First, the encoded latent topic representation, through the neural topic model (NTM), is matched with the embedded representation of BERT, to guide the generation with the topic. Second, the long-term dependencies are learned through the transformer network to jointly explore topic inference and text summarization in an end-to-end manner. Third, the long short-term memory (LSTM) network layers are stacked on the extractive model to capture sequence timing information, and the effective information is further filtered on the abstractive model through a gated network. In addition, a two-stage extractive–abstractive model is constructed to share the information. Compared with the previous work, the proposed model T-BERTSum focuses on pretrained external knowledge and topic mining to capture more accurate contextual representations. Experimental results on the CNN/Daily mail and XSum datasets demonstrate that our proposed model achieves new state-of-the-art results while generating consistent topics compared with the most advanced method.},

  abstract     = {Social networks have proven to be effective for high-quality item recommendation. Most social recommenders, however, are insufficient to capture the user preferences over items, as they largely neglect the multi-facet social relations latent in the social network, such as classmates, colleagues, and families. We, therefore, propose a novel disentangled social recommendation (DSR) framework to exploit the multifacet social relations for enhanced item recommendation. Specifically, DSR explicitly disentangles the social relations into multiple facets, and encodes the social influence under each facet into disentangled user embeddings in the social network. The multiple user embeddings are then aggregated via a facet-level attention mechanism, which distinguishes the effective facets for better inferring user interests over items. Extensive experiments show the superiority of DSR against the state-of-the-art methods and its potential in alleviating the data sparsity issue.},

Whereas it remains mysterious what the transaction pattern of Ethereum is and how it evolves over time. In this article, we study the evolutionary behavior of Ethereum transactions from a temporal graph point of view. We first develop a data analytic platform to collect external transactions associated with users as well as internal transactions initiated by smart contracts. Three types of temporal graphs, user-to-user, contract-to-contract, and user-contract graphs, are constructed according to trading relationships and are segmented with an appropriate time window. We observe a strong correlation between the size of the user-to-user transaction graph and the average Ether price in a time window, while no evidence of such linkage is shown at the average degree, average edge weights, and average triplet closure duration. The macroscopic and microscopic burstiness of Ethereum transactions are validated. We analyze the Gini indexes of the transaction graphs and the user wealth in which Ethereum is found to be very unfair since the very beginning, in a sense, “the rich is already very rich.”},

  abstract     = {Misinformation on social media has become a critical problem, particularly during a public health pandemic. Most social platforms today rely on users’ voluntary reports to determine which news stories to fact-check first. Despite the importance, no prior work has explored the potential biases in such a reporting process. This work proposes a novel methodology to assess how users perceive truth or misinformation in online news stories. By conducting a large-scale survey ( &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$N =15$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; 000), we identify the possible biases in news perceptions and explore how partisan leanings influence the news selection algorithm for fact checking. Our survey reveals several perception biases or inaccuracies in estimating the truth level of stories. The first kind, called the total perception bias (TPB), is the aggregate difference in the ground truth and perceived truth level. The next two are the false-positive bias (FPB) and false-negative bias (FNB), which measures users’ gullibility and cynicality of a given claim. We also propose ideological mean perception bias (IMPB), which quantifies a news story’s ideological disputability. Collectively, these biases indicate that user perceptions are not correlated with the ground truth of new stories; users believe some stories to be more false and vice versa. This calls for the need to fact-check news stories that exhibit the most considerable perception biases first, which the current voluntary reporting does not offer. Based on these observations, we propose a new framework that can best leverage users’ truth perceptions to remove false stories, correct misperceptions of users, or decrease ideological disagreements. We discuss how this new prioritizing scheme can aid platforms to significantly reduce the impact of fake news on user beliefs.},

The minimum positive influence dominating set (MPIDS) problem aims to find a set of at least half neighbors of every individual with minimum cardinality and has lots of applications in the social network. Even though numerous algorithms have been proposed for this hard combinatorial problem, challenges such as poor quality and scalability have motivated the researchers for better solutions. In this article, we focus on designing a simple and effective method and propose an iterated carousel greedy (ICG) algorithm for the MPIDS problem. The destruction, carousel, and reconstruction (DCR) procedures are well-designed based on the problem-specific knowledge to improve the algorithm performance, while maintaining the simplicity of the ICG algorithm. The ICG algorithm uses a fast greedy algorithm to generate an initial solution with a certain quality. It then obtains a sequence of better solutions by iterating over DCR phases. A carefully designed experiment is carried out to determine the best parameter configuration. The experimental results on real-world networks indicate that the proposed ICG algorithm significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art algorithms.},

Specifically, the generation of one emotional reply relies on the output of the encoder, the generated tokens, and the interactive information from the other language decoder. The interactive approach includes 1) internal interaction to capture the change in implicit contextual information and 2) external interaction to balance grammaticality and the expression of emotion. Qualitative and quantitative experiments with NLPCC2017 show that our model performs better in terms of the content and emotion of replies than several state-of-the-art approaches.},

However, most of these methods require sufficient data to learn individual features, which is not always satisfied in real situations, especially for online data. The digital data on human behavior typically follows a power-law distribution, indicating that only a few people have rich activities recorded while most people’s behavioral data are limited. In order to overcome this hurdle, our work constructs the user behavior proximity network (UBPN) and proposes a new walking strategy based on this network that extracts the hidden information from the social contacts to substitute the unobserved behavioral information of an individual. Specifically, our proposed walking strategy has two walking paths, accounting for the temporal and social information on the ego users’ and their alters’ mobility activities. This walking strategy is model-agnostic and can be integrated with many existing walk-based deep learning methods. Our work applies the methods on two real-world datasets with rich spatiotemporal information and shows that the performances of the existing prediction methods improve significantly by integrating the proposed walking strategy.},

The discovery of overlapping communities in dynamic networks plays an important role in community detection research. In recent years, methods based on incremental clustering have become increasingly popular owing to their high efficiency. However, few of them can deal with communities that are both overlapping and dynamic. In this article, we propose an incremental clustering algorithm for discovering overlapping communities in dynamic networks. In the initial snapshot of a dynamic network, a degree-based seed selection strategy with concise and effective rules is employed to obtain stable and high-quality overlapping communities, in which the degree of nodes is the number of their neighboring nodes in the subgraph composed of free nodes. In the subsequent snapshots, a four-staged framework based on cascade information diffusion is proposed to update the communities incrementally. In this framework, a cascade information diffusion model is used to simulate the evolution of communities and then the fitness of nodes to the communities they belong to is updated based on node similarity. Experiments conducted on both real-world and artificial datasets show that the proposed algorithm can discover overlapping communities in dynamic networks effectively and outperform to the state-of-art baseline algorithms.},

Task assignment is a fundamental problem in MCS systems and applications. Previous studies only focused on the assignment of individual tasks, neglecting planning the task processing from a higher level, e.g., making assignments between task locations and workers, which impacts the crowdsensing performance adversely. Furthermore, task characteristics, e.g., route distance, task similarity, and task priority, have a great impact on the rationality of a visiting order and the quality of crowdsensing services. In this article, we tackle the problem of rational task assignment and path planning for MCS, which aims to assign a set of task locations to a set of workers and generate location visiting sequences. We measure the assignment rationality by taking into account geographical information and task characteristics, i.e., route distance, task similarity, and task priority. We prove that the problem of computing the rationality maximization task assignment is NP-hard. For the single-worker scenario, we reduce the problem to a simpler problem with respect to only route distance and task priority criteria since the similarity measurement has a fixed value. We propose an effective greedy algorithm. For the multiple-worker scenario, we first extend the greedy idea by considering all three criteria and then propose an effective approach by reducing the computational complexity of similarity measurement. Extensive experiments show that our proposed approaches achieve promising results.},

To improve the quality of global and local features, a group-wise enhancement mechanism is introduced, which can effectively enhance the important features while weakening the unimportant features. For the information-loss problem of traditional pooling operation, we designed a global–local pooling mechanism, which can filter out local features that are more relevant to the whole information of the text. Seven benchmark datasets of text classification were selected to test the performance of the model, and GLEN obtained the best results on most datasets. The ablation experiment on GLEN shows that both the group-wise enhancement mechanism and the global–local pooling mechanism can effectively improve the performance of the model.},

In this article, we focus on improving the lower partitioning quality caused by the dynamics of the graph structure. We propose an edge repartitioning algorithm via structure-aware group migration (SAGM-ER). We define a special structure edge group (EG) consisting of multiple edges, which can reduce vertex replicas by migrating to other partitions. In repartitioning, we search for EGs in parallel by a method based on a structure-aware priority and then migrate EGs to reduce vertex replicas. Compared to the state of the art, SAGM-ER can reduce more vertex replicas. We implement SAGM-ER on Powergraph, which reduces the redundant replicas by 63.33%, thus reducing executing time and communication costs in graph computation by 33.72% and 37.51%, respectively.},

This feedback is based on the concept of a review network where customers are nodes and their interaction in terms of reviewing the same product creates the edges.

  abstract     = {Social networks now connect billions of people around the world, where individuals occupying different positions often represent different social roles and show different characteristics in their behaviors. The structural hole (SH) theory demonstrates that users occupying the bridging positions between different communities have advantages since they control the key information diffusion paths. Users of this type, known as SH spanners, are important when it comes to assimilating social network structures and user behaviors. In this article, we review the use of SHs theory in social network analysis, where SH spanners take advantage of both information and control benefits. We investigate the existing algorithms of SH spanner detection and classify them into information flow-based algorithms and network centrality-based algorithms. For practitioners, we further illustrate the applications of SH theory in various practical scenarios, including enterprise settings, information diffusion in social networks, software development, mobile applications, and machine learning (ML)-based social prediction. Our review provides a comprehensive discussion on the foundation, detection, and practical applications of SHs. The insights can facilitate researchers and service providers to better apply the theory and derive value-added tools with advanced ML techniques. To inspire follow-up research, we identify potential research trends in this area, especially on the dynamics of networks.},

  abstract     = {This article studies the core maintenance problem in dynamic graphs. The core number is a fundamental index reflecting the cohesiveness of a graph, which is widely used in large-scale graph analytics. The core maintenance problem requires updating the core numbers of vertices after a set of edges and vertices are inserted into or deleted from the graph. Previous works focus on the scenario of single-edge updates and process the edges one by one when multiple edges are inserted/deleted. We initiate the studies of processing multiple edges concurrently to improve the efficiency of core maintenance. Specifically, we discover a structure of inserted/deleted edges, superior edge set , which can be processed together to greatly reduce unnecessarily repeated visits of vertices in the procedure of sequential edge processing. Based on the structure of the superior edge set, efficient algorithms are then devised for incremental and decremental core maintenance, respectively. Compared with single-edge processing algorithms, our algorithms show a significant speedup in the processing time. Furthermore, our algorithms admit parallel implementations, which can further improve the update efficiency. We also conduct extensive experiments on different types of real-world, temporal, and synthetic data sets, and the results illustrate that the proposed algorithms exhibit good efficiency, stability, and scalability.},

  abstract     = {Objective: Diagnosis of the severity of heroin addiction with electroencephalography (EEG) signals is a challenging problem. It has been shown that brain microstates are associated with brain status and healthy condition. However, there is no study on how heroin addiction affects brain microstates. Approach: We propose a hybrid classifier based on the microstate features, extracting from resting state EEGs, to objectively and effectively identify abstinent heroin-addicted individuals (AHAIs) and healthy controls (HCs). In addition to the commonly used features such as duration, occurrence, and transition, we calculated three new features. Main Results: The results showed that the support vector machine (SVM), which allows classification of the AHAIs and HCs with a 73% accuracy rate, was an optimal classifier. Moreover, the weight setting-based genetic algorithm (GA) further improved the accuracy rate to 81%. The hybrid classification not only provides direct evidence showing the differences in EEG microstate features between AHAIs and HCs, but also offers a method to distinguish the heroin brain states of people addicted to heroin and healthy individuals and demonstrates that microstate features could serve as potential bio-markers for identifying AHAIs. Significance: our methods and the selected features may provide electrophysiological insights for the assessment of the heroin withdrawal treatment effects.},

  abstract     = {Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), due to its extremely high infectivity, has been spreading rapidly around the world and bringing huge influence to socioeconomic development and people’s daily life. Taking for example the virus transmission that may occur after college students return to school, we analyze the quantitative influence of the key factors on the virus spread, including crowd density and self-protection. One Campus Virus Infection and Control Simulation (CVICS) model of the novel coronavirus is proposed in this article, fully considering the characteristics of repeated contact and strong mobility of crowd in the closed environment. Specifically, we build an agent-based infection model, introduce the mean field theory to calculate the probability of virus transmission, and microsimulate the daily prevalence of infection among individuals. The experimental results show that the proposed model in this article efficiently simulates how the virus spreads in the dense crowd in frequent contact under a closed environment. Furthermore, preventive and control measures, such as self-protection, crowd decentralization, and isolation during the epidemic, can effectively delay the arrival of infection peak, reduce the prevalence, and, finally, lower the risk of COVID-19 transmission after the students return to school.},

This article presents a cognitive-feature-augmented driver emotion detection method that is based on emotional cognitive process theory and deep networks. Different from the traditional methods, both the driver’s facial expression and cognitive process characteristics (age, gender, and driving age) were used as the inputs of the proposed model. Convolutional techniques were adopted to construct the model for driver’s emotion detection simultaneously considering the driver’s facial expression and cognitive process characteristics. A driver’s emotion data collection was carried out to validate the performance of the proposed method. The collected dataset consists of 40 drivers’ frontal facial videos, their cognitive process characteristics, and self-reported assessments of driver emotions. Another two deep networks were also used to compare recognition performance. The results prove that the proposed method can achieve well detection results for different databases on the discrete emotion model and dimensional emotion model, respectively.},

This study examines the potency of emerging natural language processing (NLP) methods in analyzing social network activity. A linguostylistic personality traits assessment (LPTA) system is developed to estimate Twitter users’ personality traits based on their tweets using the Myers-Briggs-type indicator (MBTI) and big-five personality scales. A novel input representation mechanism is proposed to process tweets by converting them into real-valued vectors using frequency, co-occurrence, and context (FCC) measures. Other prevalent text representation schemes, such as one-hot encoding, count-based vectorization, and pretrained language model representations are used as comparators. A genetic algorithm (GA) approach is proposed to reduce the feature set and increase the efficacy of the features extracted. The developed system outperforms the state-of-the-art research by reliably estimating the user’s latent personality traits while using 50 or fewer tweets per user.},

Therefore, we innovatively extract the bytecode feature and combine it with user transaction and opcode frequencies to get more comprehensive features. With these features, we propose a smart contract Ponzi scheme identification method based on the improved LightGBM algorithm.

These changes may enable us to infer mechanisms of the network that control how interactions lead to opinion change. Inferring such mechanisms from opinion data could enable analysis of social influence in data-sparse scenarios. However, limited work has focused on this problem, despite its clear value. To address this gap, we create opinion data using agent-based simulation and experimental design. By viewing opinion changes as an information-generating process, opinion dynamics can be studied using entropy. This work explores the relationships between aggregated entropy and five simulation design factors. Three entropy measures are calculated on continuous-valued opinions and are analyzed using a main effects model and cluster analysis. Overall, the choices of influence model and error distribution are most important to the entropy measures, activation regime is important to some measures, and population size is unimportant. Also, design variation can be detected using time-series cluster analysis. These findings may support work in inferring properties about real-world social influence networks using opinion data collected from their members.},

  abstract     = {Widespread digitalization has led to almost all utilities and services thrive on an online medium. A real-time, personalized, and trend grasping recommendation system is necessary to enhance user experience and boost business on E-commerce platforms. We propose the Multimodel Contextual Reinforcement Learning (MMCR) constituting three novel features for real-time and customized recommendations. The first feature is user-item interactive state embedding which uses not only item information but also assigns weightage to this information according to its usage history. It gives higher importance to the newly clicked items by the users than the older ones. Second, we devised Contextual Cluster Exploration (CCE) strategy. This strategy enhances the item-choice recommendations by consistently reducing the randomness during exploration. The third novelty is an item-based multi-agent framework that can tackle the case of sparsely chosen items. Generally, such items are disregarded in a single agent model as the more popular items take supremacy. Our technique ensures that the user-item history per item is learned separately; thus, no item is neglected. MMCR has shown an average of 5% increase in CTR rate. Moreover, CCE exploration gives a considerably higher score than state-of-the-art exploration strategies. Thorough experimentation demonstrates that our proposed strategy has shown significantly improved results over various state-of-the-art strategies.},

  abstract     = {This study proposes a mechanism and an instructional design in order to foster well-organized peer learning based on game theory (PD_PL). The proposed mechanism uses prisoner’s dilemma (PD), the most widely known example of game theory in a dynamically blended and collaborative learning environment. PD_PL maps the strategy and payoff concepts found in PD onto a peer learning (PL) atmosphere. As is the case in PD, any greater effort made by both participants in PD_PL results in increased learning improvement. PD_PL was run in several sessions consisting of four separate university courses with 142 computer engineering students. We gave a pretest and a posttest before and after the PD_PL sessions, respectively. Then, we used paired Hotelling’s T-Square function to analyze the pretests and posttests and investigate the impacts of PD_PL and the proposed instructional design on students’ learning improvement. We had some missing data because some students were absent from some of the PD_PL sessions. As a requirement of paired Hotelling’s T-Square function, we applied the mean value, median value, k-nearest neighbor (KNN), and fuzzy k-mean clustering (FKM) methods in order to deal with the problem of imputing missing data. The results of paired Hotelling’s T-Square indicate that PD_PL is a successful mechanism for encouraging the active participation of students in the PL process. Further analysis shows that PD_PL had sometimes even enhanced learning by up to 127.69%. We also observed that the senior students used PD_PL more successfully than the first-year students. The results of our subjective evaluation showed that the majority of the respondents found PD_PL to be an attractive and efficient tool for learning enhancement. Anyone interested in instructional designing for PL environments will find this study interesting. The mechanism could also be run in a learning management system (LMS) to prepare an effective situation of collaborative learning situation.},

Next, we explore the graph structure properties and the driving factors of newly generated transaction relationships. Experimental results show that the local and microscopic structure of Ethereum networks is star-shaped, and the transaction frequency of addresses has a great impact on the evolution of Ethereum transaction relationships. First-layer nodes of microstructures dominate the network evolution. Moreover, the degree of addresses is an effective basis for predicting the direction of new transactions. Potential further studies on Ethereum transaction link prediction are discussed, for example, the label effect of center addresses.},

  abstract     = {We present a method for calculating and analyzing stakeholder utilities of processes that arise in, but are not limited to, social sciences. These areas include business process analysis, healthcare workflow analysis, and policy process analysis. This method is quite general and applicable to any situation in which declarative-type constraints of a modal and/or temporal nature play a part. A declarative process is a process in which activities may freely happen while respecting a set of constraints. For such a process, anything may happen so long as it is not explicitly forbidden. Declarative processes have been used and studied as models of business and healthcare workflows by several authors. In considering a declarative process as a model of some system, it is natural to consider how the process behaves with respect to stakeholders. We derive a measure for stakeholder utility that can be applied in a very general setting. This derivation is achieved by listing a collection of properties that we argue such a stakeholder utility function ought to satisfy and then using these to show that a very specific form must hold for such a utility. The utility measure depends on the set of unique traces of the declarative process, and calculating this set requires a combinatorial analysis of the declarative graph that represents the process. This builds on previous work of Dukes and Casey (2021) in which the combinatorial diversity metrics for declarative processes were derived for use in policy process analysis. The collection of stakeholder utilities can themselves then be used to form a metric with which we can compare different declarative processes to one another. These are illustrated using several examples of declarative processes that already exist in the literature.},

  abstract     = {Online social networks (OSNs) are a major component of societal digitalization. OSNs alter how people communicate, make decisions, and form or change their beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors. Thus, they can now impact social groups, financial systems, and political communication at scale. As one type of OSN, social media platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, serve as outlets for users to convey information to an audience as broad or targeted as the user desires. Over the years, these social media platforms have been infected with automated accounts, or bots, that are capable of hijacking conversations, influencing other users, and manipulating content dissemination. Although benign bots exist to facilitate legitimate activities, we focus on bots designed to perform malicious acts through social media platforms. Bots that mimic the social behaviors of humans are referred to as social bots. Social bots help automate sociotechnical behaviors, such as “liking” tweets, tweeting/retweeting a message, following users, and coordinating with or even competing against other bots. Some advanced social bots exhibit highly sophisticated traits of coordination and communication with complex organizational structures. This article presents a detailed survey of social bots, their types and behaviors, and how they impact social media, identification algorithms, and their coordination strategies in OSNs. The survey also discusses coordination in areas such as biological systems, interorganizational networks, and coordination games. Existing research extensively studied bot detection, but bot coordination is still emerging and requires more in-depth analysis. The survey covers existing techniques and open research issues on the analysis of social bots, their behaviors, and how social network theories can be leveraged to assess coordination during online campaigns.},

Many traditional studies of cascading failures have been conducted from the perspective of either an attacker or a defender. In reality, however, malicious attacks on networks are rarely a one-sided process. Instead, both the attacker and defender are actively involved. We use game theory to study the strategies of both sides in terms of an attacker–defender game on complex networks. Based on the concept of the Stackelberg competition, we propose a multiround attacker–defender game model on complex networks, allowing high flexibility in the available actions for both sides in the game. The model we propose allows the two sides to specify certain parameters of the network to attack/defend and further allocate a certain amount of resources for the attack/defense. Such flexibility allows the model to capture the actions of the attackers and defenders more precisely and simulate the attack process in a more realistic manner. We propose an iterative search algorithm to search for desirable strategies with systematic experiments on various types of networks and associated parameters and in terms of different relative resource owned by the attacker and defender.},

This holds true for discussion in any for a, including social media platforms such as Twitter. However, the tweeter’s emotional state has a huge impact on its pragmatic content because communication is fundamentally characterized and mediated by direct emotions. Sentiment as a human behavior often has a strong relation to emotion, and one helps to understand the other better. We hypothesize that the association between emotion and sentiment will provide a clearer understanding of the tweeter’s state of mind, aiding the identification of tweet acts (speech acts in Twitter, TAs). As the first step, we create a new multimodal, emotion-TA, EmoTA dataset collected from the open-source Twitter dataset. To incorporate these multiple aspects, we propose a multitask ensemble adversarial learning framework for multimodal TA classification (TAC). In addition, we also incorporate a joint embedding network, with bidirectional constraints to capture and efficiently integrate the shared semantic relationships across modalities and learn generalized features across multiple tasks. Experimental results indicate that the proposed framework boosts the performance of the primary task, TAC, by benefiting from the two secondary tasks, i.e., sentiment and emotion analyses compared to its unimodal and single-task TAC variants.},

We first propose methods for analyzing historical data to quantify the infection probability of a node with a given set of properties in a given time and assess the potential of a given seeding strategy to infect nodes. Then, we examine the potential of a scheduled seeding strategy by analyzing a real-world large-scale dataset containing both the network topology as well as the nodes’ infection times. Specifically, we use the proposed methods to demonstrate the existence of two important effects in our dataset: a complex contagion effect and a diminishing social influence effect. As shown in a recent study, the scheduled seeding approach is expected to benefit greatly from the existence of these two effects. Finally, we compare a number of benchmark seeding strategies to a scheduled seeding strategy that ranks nodes based on a combination of the number of infectious friends (NIF) they have, as well as the time that has passed since they became infectious. Results of our analyses show that for a seeding budget of 1%, the scheduled seeding strategy yields a convergence rate that is 14% better than a seeding strategy based solely on their degrees, and 215% better than a random seeding strategy, which is often used in practice.},

Behavioral relations are a prominent technique/method to analyze the consistency degree of two workflow systems. There are four kinds of behavioral relations, i.e., strict order relation, exclusiveness relation, interleaving order relation, and inverse order relation. An activity in a module may be in different behavioral relations with activities in another module. We call the latter module a special module in this article. However, the existing measuring methods for behavioral consistency do not consider special modules at all. Thus, if we conduct a consistency analysis of different systems by these methods, we may get an inaccurate consistency degree, or obtain no results. In order to solve this problem, we use workflow nets (WF-nets) to model workflow systems and re-explore their behavioral relations. Then, their behavioral relation matrices (BRMs) are constructed. Based on BRMs, some new measurement methods are proposed to calculate the behavioral consistency degree of two WF-net systems.

Signal detection theory is exploited to answer why promoting heterogeneity could improve the performance of collaborative human decision-making. We consider the following two scenarios: 1) the local decision makers are independent and the level of heterogeneity is measured in terms of the variability of human expertise and 2) humans make correlated local decisions due to their perceptual and behavioral similarities and heterogeneity is measured by the amount of correlation. In both cases, we show that the detection performance of the FC can be improved with the increase of heterogeneity. In particular, in the second scenario, we develop a portfolio theory-based framework to select participants from correlated human agents so that heterogeneity is enhanced resulting in improved decision-making performance. Simulations are provided for illustration and performance comparison.},

  abstract     = {Embeddings of textual data containing location names (e.g., social media posts) have essential applications in various contexts such as marketing and disaster management. In these downstream implementations, social biases behind location names are highly prone to introduce unfair results through their embeddings; for example, emergent text messages with swapped location names might result in varied rescue responses. Hence, it is critical to address social biases encoded in location names and to seek its mitigation. Prevalent works addressing biases in embeddings mainly focus on individual attributes like gender or ethnicity. Yet, a large number of social attributes behind location names (e.g., income level and population density) makes it challenging to originate the source of biases. Existing mitigation methods based on finding attribute subspaces cannot be simply applied to address social biases. Moreover, bias mitigation tends to simultaneously remove necessary semantics from embeddings, making it difficult to achieve a balance between mitigation performance and semantics retention. In this article, we first employ the concept of counterfactual fairness to investigate the social biases encoded in training data. Then, we quantify the biases in the contextual embeddings (BERT and ELMo). We report a high correlation between biases in the training data and embeddings. Next, we introduce a novel bias mitigation algorithm that customizes bias representations for any location names. The method yields debiased location name vectors for various social attributes simultaneously. The proposed algorithm achieves a better mitigation performance on overall attributes compared with a prevalent postprocessing method, while maintaining correctness by retaining semantic information.},

To facilitate research on NMF-based community detection, in this article, we make a comprehensive review on NMF-based methods for community detection, especially the state-of-the-art methods presented in high prestige journals or conferences. First, we introduce the basic principles of NMF and explain why NMF can detect communities and design a general framework of NMF-based community detection. Second, according to the applicable network types, we propose a taxonomy to divide the existing NMF-based methods for community detection into six categories, namely, topology networks, signed networks, attributed networks, multilayer networks, dynamic networks, and large-scale networks. We deeply analyze representative methods in every category. Finally, we summarize the common problems faced by all methods and potential solutions and propose four promising research directions. We believe that this survey can fully demonstrate the versatility of NMF-based community detection and serve as a useful guideline for researchers in related fields.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we aim at building a bridge from coarse behavioral data to an effective, quick-response, and robust behavioral model for online identity theft detection. We concentrate on this issue in online social networks (OSNs) where users usually have composite behavioral records, consisting of multidimensional low-quality data, e.g., offline check-ins and online user-generated content (UGC). As an insightful result, we validate that there is a complementary effect among different dimensions of records for modeling users’ behavioral patterns. To deeply exploit such a complementary effect, we propose a joint (instead of fused ) model to capture both online and offline features of a user’s composite behavior. We evaluate the proposed joint model by comparing it with typical models and their fused model on two real-world datasets: Foursquare and Yelp. The experimental results show that our model outperforms the existing ones, with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values 0.956 in Foursquare and 0.947 in Yelp, respectively. Particularly, the recall (true positive rate) can reach up to 65.3% in Foursquare and 72.2% in Yelp with the corresponding disturbance rate (false-positive rate) below 1%. It is worth mentioning that these performances can be achieved by examining only one composite behavior, which guarantees the low response latency of our method. This study would give the cybersecurity community new insights into whether and how real-time online identity authentication can be improved via modeling users’ composite behavioral patterns.},

  abstract     = {Artificial intelligence (AI) technology has become an important trend to support the analysis and control of complex and time-varying power systems. Although deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been utilized in the power system field, most of these DRL models are regarded as black boxes, which are difficult to explain and cannot be used on occasions when human operators need to participate. Using the explainable AI (XAI) technology to explain why power system models make certain decisions is as important as the accuracy of the decisions themselves because it ensures trust and transparency in the model decision-making process. The interpretability issue in DRL models in power system emergency control is discussed in this article. The proposed interpretable method is a backpropagation deep explainer based on Shapley additive explanations (SHAPs), which is named the Deep-SHAP method. The Deep-SHAP method is adopted to provide a reasonable interpretable model for a DRL-based emergency control application. For the DRL model, the importance of input features has been quantified to obtain contributions for the outcome of the model. Further, feature classification of the inputs and probabilistic analysis of the outputs in the XAI model is added to interpretability results for better clarity.},

  abstract     = {Recent developments on identifying the community structures in real-world networks have established that the community structure may be either disjoint community set (DCS) or overlapping community set (OCS), showing high resemblance with each other. Still, given a network, researchers mostly followed distinct approaches to achieve optimal solutions, either for DCS or for OCS. Moreover, prior knowledge of community structure is needed to select the appropriate class of algorithms, since one cannot produce the optimal solution for the other. In this article, a comprehensive two-phase approach based on genetic algorithm (GA) is proposed that can be applied to any small-world network to generate the DCS and the OCS very fast without any prior knowledge of the community structure. In the first phase, an upper bound on the mean path length of a community is applied, relative to the equivalent Erdős–Rényi (E–R) random graph that expedites the convergence significantly. In the second phase, the search space is reduced considerably, by selecting a smaller subset of boundary nodes of the DCS generated in the first phase, to be manipulated probabilistically. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to consider the mean path length of the community as a key parameter for finding the good quality communities at the earliest. Experimental study on six synthetic networks and five real-world networks shows that the proposed approach not only outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of quality and scalability, but its parallel implementation also improves the speedup significantly.},

Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak is a great example of a sudden change. The outbreak influenced means of work, study, socialization, and communication in unprecedented ways. In our study, we investigate the topic dynamics of Twitter content sharing for the Republic of Turkey. We have analyzed 1.3 million tweets containing the keyword “korona” shared between February 24, 2020 and May 2, 2020. Our study has three key outcomes. The first one is, after the official announcement of first COVID-19 case in Turkey, rate of COVID-19-related content sharing decreases and hygiene-, lifestyle-, and anxiety-related tweets increase. Second, we see that a number of friends and followers influence content sharing dynamics where accounts sharing COVID-19 News-related content have more followers compared to accounts that share the remaining contents. Finally, motivated by the World Bank’s Poverty Monitoring Technical Note, we inquired the effect of income on content sharing and found that GDP per capita of the author’s city is more influential on COVID-19 News-related content sharing compared to the population and COVID-19 cases per 1 00 000 people. The lower the GDP per capita, the higher the COVID-19 News-related content sharing is. Also, our model indicates that lower income and population along with high rates of COVID-19 cases per 1 00 000 people are associated with increased COVID-19 News-related content sharing.},

Through agent-based modeling, we introduce a framework to explore the sensitivity of behavior on social network structure, in response to vicarious dissonance. The model allows us to understand how and why vicarious dissonance may contribute to polarization, both in terms of network structure and the convictions held by individuals. Alternative response behaviors are each found to be highly effective in reducing the cognitive dissonance felt across a population but with wide-ranging outcomes for the population as a whole. The results highlight the important role of neutrality and tolerance in retaining social cohesion while showing how easily this can be disrupted.

  abstract     = {Under the condition of network operation of high-speed railways (HSRs), the influence of disruptions on the train control and dispatching at the current line and related lines is more and more significant. This article focuses on the timetable cooperative rescheduling problem with multidispatching sections of HSRs from a macroscopic perspective in the case of large disruptions. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) model on the objectives of minimizing the weighted sum of the arrival delay time of trains, the delay time of depart trains at the handover station, and the number of delays of trains at all stations. The strategies of retiming and reordering are adopted to generate the rescheduling scheme and reduce delay propagation by making full use of three kinds of buffer time reserved in the timetable, i.e., buffer times of train operation in the station, train running in the section, and electric multiple unit (EMU) connection. A case study of the timetable rescheduling at the two adjacent dispatching sections of the Beijing–Shanghai HSRs line is conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed integrated rescheduling approach. The relationship between computing time and the quality of rescheduling schemes is also investigated. The computational results show that the proposed approach can generate a conflict-free timetable with the minimum arrival delay time and the number of delays of all trains at all stations compared to the nonintegrated rescheduling approach and the benchmark solution of the first-come-first-serve (FCFS) approach. The propagation of delay between dispatching sections is also greatly suppressed. The results can provide support for dispatchers to making reasonable rescheduling decisions in the case of large disruptions.},

  abstract     = {The phenomenon of brain drain, which is the emigration of highly skilled people, has many undesirable effects, particularly for developing countries. In this study, an agent-based model is developed to understand the dynamics of such emigration. We hypothesize that skilled people’s emigration decisions are based on several factors including the overall economic and social difference between the home and host countries, people’s ability and capacity to obtain good jobs and start a life abroad, and the barriers of moving abroad. Furthermore, the social network of individuals also plays a significant role. The model is validated using qualitative and quantitative pattern matching with real-world observations. Sensitivity and uncertainty analyses are performed in addition to several scenario analyses. Linear and random forest response surface models are created to provide quick predictions on the number of emigrants and to understand the effect sizes of individual parameters. Overall, this study provides an abstract model where brain drain dynamics can be explored. Findings from the simulation outputs show that the future socioeconomic state of the country is more important than the current state, lack of barriers results in a large number of emigrants, and network effects ensure compounding effects on emigration. Upon further development and customization, future versions can assist in the decision-making of social policymakers regarding brain drain.},

Then, food taste is used as health guidance for people who want to lose weight or follow doctors’ advice. First, the local attention mechanism is introduced to identify key areas of the dish image. Second, ingredient and handcrafted color features are extracted to learn deep features. Subsequently, we combine local and global attention mechanisms to return the dish taste as the recognition result.

First, we propose the enhanced collaborative LEDs’ positioning algorithm, which uses the indoor hidden location information to obtain the rotation angle and tilt angle of the receiver, to achieve the robust system positioning. Then, we use the edge computing solution to balance between bandwidth resources and computing resources and propose a flexible functional segmentation scheme for different smartphone application scenarios. Finally, we conduct experimental tests to evaluate the positioning system performance by landmark decoding rate, positioning accuracy, and segmentation analysis. Test results show that the designed positioning system can achieve centimeter-level positioning. Meanwhile, the smartphone can exchange the least bandwidth resources for the most computing resources under Scheme-3.},

  abstract     = {The social Internet of Things (IoT) (SIoT) helps to enable an autonomous interaction between the two architectures that have already been established: social networks and the IoT. SIoT also integrates the concepts of social networking and IoT into collaborative edge computing (CEC), the so-called CEC-based SIoT architecture. In closer proximity, IoT devices self-organize into a CEC-based SIoT computing cluster and provide social device-to-device (S-D2D) services, such as computation offloading, service discovery, and content delivery. In the CEC-based SIoT, however, cooperation based on social connections leads to a problem called social and spatial physical trade-off . This problem is also referred to as the mismatch problem, which arises because the spatial neighbors in the social layer cannot always be related. The spatial distance thus calls for additional multi-hop transmissions. This work presents a novel solution called 3-D-social identifier structure (3-D-SIS) model. The 3-D-SIS model is based on 3-D social space (3-D-SS) and considers social ties and physical connections (i.e., intra-neighbor) of the SIoT devices and utilizes a 3-D structure to evaluate that relationship. Moreover, it minimizes the end-to-end delay and communication cost to address the mismatch problem. To validate the performance of the (3-D-SIS) model, we use the real traces of social networks (INFOCOM06) . The results show that the 3-D-SIS selects the best neighbor in S-D2D communication and improves performance in terms of end-to-end delay and throughput.},

  abstract     = {For smart cities, ubiquitous user connectivity and collaborative computation offloading are significant for the ever-increasing information requirements to promote the quality of citizens’ life. In this article, we design an information prefetching architecture, which investigates a hierarchical data storage and selection strategy, including local to edge and edge to cloud. Building on collected data in the social media system or sensor networks, we specifically focus on analyzing mobile terminals’ behaviors to assure the precision of our prefetching strategy in different kinds of information streaming. To assemble edge agents (EAs) prefetching, we also consider the characteristics of wireless backhaul. This scheme is carried out to optimize the EAs prefetching framework by the independent and joint action modules that are based on the theory of deep reinforcement learning (DRL). It paves a better way of collaborative edge computing (CEC) that can be built by using an independent/joint edge-learning model to help and promote the algorithm efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Furthermore, for hiding the information of data transmission between the cloud and the edge servers during data prefetching, this hierarchical scheme is designed as an implicit index maintained by edge servers. Our results show rationales on the obtainable performance of EAs architectures and their reciprocity with the dynamic change of mobile terminals’ requirements.},

  abstract     = {With the massive growth of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, how to provide users with recommendation services in the IoT environment has become a research hotspot. Group discovery, as a prerequisite step of group recommendation that can be used to assist groups of users to select services in IoT-enriched environments, has an important impact on recommendation performance. However, existing group recommendation solutions assume that a user belongs to a specific group and ignore the possible correlation between the user’s preferences and other groups’ preferences. In addition, existing solutions treat group members as equal individuals and assign them equal weights, which makes it hard to meet the user’s accurate recommendation requirements. Furthermore, these methods focus on group members’ explicit preference information while ignoring implicit preferences. To address these problems, we propose a group discovery method based on collaborative filtering and knowledge graph (GD-CFKG). This method first uses the attention mechanism to learn the embedding of service entities from knowledge graphs and interaction between users and services to achieve users’ own preferences embedding. Considering that the preferences of similar users will help to attain accurate target user’s preferences, we then train users’ final preferences embedding by collaborative filtering and word2vec method. We conduct experiments to evaluate our approach using the MovieLens and Douban data sets. Experimental results show that our proposed method has better group recommendation performance than those baseline methods.},

However, traditional CNNs usually have nontrivial computational time and high energy consumption, making them inappropriate to be deployed in the large-scale time-sensitive FT system. To address this challenge, we design an artificial intelligence and Internet of Things (AIoT) empowered edge-cloud collaborative computing (ECCC) system based on the energy-efficient field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based CNN accelerators for the purpose of realizing a low-latency and low-power FT. First, we present the AIoT-empowered ECCC system architecture, which consists of an intelligent computing subsystem, an Internet-of-Things (IoT) subsystem, an edge-cloud collaborative subsystem, and an application subsystem. In what follows, we investigate the enabling technologies for these subsystems. Thereafter, we develop an FPGA-based hardware accelerator dedicated to the compact MobileNet CNN by using the hardware design techniques, such as systolic array, matrix tiling, fixed-point precision, and parallelism. Furthermore, we integrate the FPGA accelerators with CPUs and GPUs to build a context-aware CPU/GPU/FPGA heterogeneous computing system. Finally, we implement a delay-aware energy-efficient scheduling algorithm dedicated to this heterogeneous system. With the above hardware and software codesign mechanism, the energy cost and execution time of CNNs can be decreased significantly. The real-world experiments on the CPU/GPU/FPGA-based ECCC system proved the effectiveness of the proposed schemes in reducing the latency and improving the power efficiency of the FT system.},

Although vehicular edge caching can facilitate delay-bounded content transmission, constrained storage capacity and limited serving range of an individual cache server as well as highly dynamic topology of vehicular networks may degrade the efficiency of content delivery. To address the problem, in this article, we propose a social-aware vehicular edge caching mechanism that dynamically orchestrates the cache capability of roadside units (RSUs) and smart vehicles according to user preference similarity and service availability. Furthermore, catering to the complexity and variability of vehicular social characteristics, we leverage the digital twin technology to map the edge caching system into virtual space, which facilitates constructing the social relation model. Based on the social model, a new concept of vehicular cache cloud is developed to incorporate the correlation of content storing between multiple cache-enabled vehicles in diverse traffic environments. Then, we propose deep learning empowered optimal caching schemes, jointly considering the social model construction, cache cloud formation, and cache resource allocation. We evaluate the proposed schemes based on real traffic data. Numerical results demonstrate that our edge caching schemes have great advantages in optimizing caching utility.},

Efficiently utilizing caching resources can reduce the link load caused by delivering and forwarding contents, further improving the users’ quality of experience (QoE). However, the collaboration among independent decision nodes is insufficient, which consumes substantial energy redundantly. To solve the mentioned issue, we propose a genetic-algorithm-based collaborative caching scheme integrating on-path strategy and off-path strategy, named cost-oriented caching scheme (CCS), to minimize the energy consumption of requesting contents. First, based on the analysis of content popularity, users’ historical requests, and transmission delay, an optimization problem is formulated to minimize the communication delay of obtaining content. Then, we formulate a submodular function optimization problem to optimize energy consumption, and an improved genetic algorithm is proposed to solve the mentioned problem.

Caching diverse contents based on the social features among users at energy-harvesting-powered (EH-powered) small base stations can further save on-grid energy, but it may lead to a longer delay to mobile users (MUs). In this article, we focus on an energy–delay tradeoff (EDT) problem in CEC-assisted and EH-powered ultradense networks and propose an EDT-oriented adaptive cooperative caching (EDT-ACC) scheme. We regard delay and energy as two types of cost and introduce a weighted cost function to transform the EDT problem into a cost minimization problem. An alternating optimization based on an improved quantum genetic algorithm (AO-IQGA) is proposed to solve the cost minimization problem. In AO-IQGA, the alternating optimization is utilized to divide the cost minimization problem into two subproblems (adaptive tuning weight subproblem and caching decision subproblem). We improve the quantum genetic algorithm in terms of repairing unfeasible solutions and adaptively updating quantum genes. Numerical results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed AO-IQGA and illustrate the fundamental tradeoff between delay and energy consumption under different parameters, such as content popularity, storage size, and battery capacity.},

How to maintain stable and high-quality network connections for vehicles is a crucial issue. With traditional received signal strength (RSS)-based handover schemes, vehicles may encounter severe ping-pong effects and even direct handover failures leading to data packet loss. In this article, to overcome the frequent handover problem caused by vehicles’ high-speed motion and the ever-changing network environment, we propose a trajectory prediction-based handover scheme. In this scheme, the sojourn time of a vehicle staying in each candidate network’s coverage can be obtained through a social long short-term memory (social-LSTM)-based prediction model. Together with the signal strength, available bandwidth, and cost, the sojourn time is also taken as a handover decision attribute parameter.

  abstract     = {Intelligent vehicle applications, such as autonomous driving and collision avoidance, put forward a higher demand for precise positioning of vehicles. The current widely used global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) cannot meet the precision requirements of the submeter level. Due to the development of sensing techniques and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications, some vehicles can interact with surrounding landmarks to achieve precise positioning. Existing work aims to realize the positioning correction of common vehicles by sharing the positioning data of sensor-rich vehicles. However, the privacy of trajectory data makes it difficult to collect and train data centrally. Moreover, uploading vehicle location data wastes network resources. To fill these gaps, this article proposes a vehicle cooperative positioning (CP) system based on federated learning (FedVCP), which makes full use of the potential of social Internet of Things (IoT) and collaborative edge computing (CEC) to provide high-precision positioning correction while ensuring user privacy. To the best of our knowledge, this article is the first attempt to solve the privacy of CP from a perspective of federated learning. In addition, we take the advantages of local cooperation through vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications in data augmentation. For individual differences in vehicle positioning, we utilize transfer learning to eliminate the impact of such differences. Extensive experiments on real data demonstrate that our proposed model is superior to the baseline method in terms of effectiveness and convergence speed.},

In this article, we propose a secure sharing method of MIoT data under an edge computing framework based on federated learning and blockchain technology. Combining its special distributed architecture with the MIoT edge computing architecture, federated learning ensures the privacy of nodes. The blockchain serves as a decentralized way, which stores federated learning workers to achieve nontampering and security. We propose a concept of quality and reputation as the metrics of selection for federated learning workers. Meanwhile, we design a quality proof mechanism [proof of quality (PoQ)] and apply it to the blockchain, making the edge nodes recorded in the blockchain more high-quality. In addition, a marine environment model is built in this article, and the analysis based on this model makes the method proposed in this article more applicable to the marine environment. The numerical results obtained from the simulation experiments clearly show that the proposed scheme can significantly improve the learning accuracy under the premise of ensuring the safety and reliability of the marine environment.},

  abstract     = {With the ever-increasing requirements of delay-sensitive and mission-critical applications, it becomes a popular research trend to incorporate edge computing in the Internet of Things (IoT) to mitigate the pressure of traditional cloud-based IoT architecture. Edge computing delivers real-time computations and communications for IoT devices by leveraging edge servers deployed close to users, which creates a collaborative edge computing (CEC) paradigm. The capacity of edge servers is beneficial but risky, as vulnerable servers can be exploited to conduct surveillance or perform other nefarious activities. Besides, fake IoT devices would bring security threats and compromise the IoT system. This highlights the necessity of designing a secure and efficient mutual authentication scheme for CEC. In this direction, related works have proposed various authentication mechanisms, but most of them are found unfit due to the absence of decentralization, anonymity, and mobility. Motivated by this fact, we propose a blockchain-based mutual authentication scheme that bridges these gaps. Specifically, blockchain, certificateless cryptography, elliptic curve cryptography, and pseudonym-based cryptography are integrated into our scheme to provide mutual authentication between edge servers and IoT devices. Except for static conditions, both intraedge and interedge authentication are considered. Besides, we elaborate on the key generation procedures and design a session key negotiation mechanism. Extensive experiments and security analyses have been conducted to show the feasibility of the proposed scheme.},

  abstract     = {The Social Internet of Things (SIoT) now penetrates our daily lives. As a strategy to alleviate the escalation of resource congestion, collaborative edge computing (CEC) has become a new paradigm for solving the needs of the Internet of Things (IoT). CEC can provide computing, storage, and network connection resources for remote devices. Because the edge network is closer to the connected devices, it involves a large amount of users’ privacy. This also makes edge networks face more and more security issues, such as Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, unauthorized access, packet sniffing, and man-in-the-middle attacks. To combat these issues and enhance the security of edge networks, we propose a deep learning-based intrusion detection algorithm. Based on the generative adversarial network (GAN), we designed a powerful intrusion detection method. Our intrusion detection method includes three phases. First, we use the feature selection module to process the collaborative edge network traffic. Second, a deep learning architecture based on GAN is designed for intrusion detection aiming at a single attack. Finally, we propose a new intrusion detection model by combining several intrusion detection models that aim at a single attack. Intrusion detection aiming at multiple attacks is realized through the designed GAN-based deep learning architecture. Besides, we provide a comprehensive evaluation to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Mobile crowdsensing (MCS) has heated up and has become a new paradigm of data collection. In the process of the task allocation of MCS, users are often required to provide their own location information with the server to conveniently dispatch some suitable tasks to them. However, it is possible for malicious servers to infer some sensitive information based on the user’s location such as the user’s home address or the user’s trajectory and so on which will cause serious privacy issues. Recently, differential privacy (DP) has become a promising privacy protection scheme. However, the existing DP schemes in location privacy protection for MCS do not pay attention to the accuracy of task allocation as equally as the effects of privacy protection, which often results in the task allocation to be inaccurate and inefficient. In order to overcome the shortcoming, we propose a novel MCS task allocation scheme integrating the mapping accuracy of task-worker with the privacy-preserving effect on the user’s location. Besides edge devices, its implementation system consists of a task allocation server and a third party, both of which are semitrusted, that is, both of them only know about the user’s rough location information but cannot obtain the user’s exact location. At first, to improve the response speed of MCS task requests and the location privacy protection of MCS users, our scheme can exploit more than one edge-computing node nearby a user to cooperatively participate in MCS task allocation by aggregating him/her and the near users into groups. Then, our scheme can further enhance the location privacy protection effect based on the Johnson–Lindenstrauss (JL) transformation, which can achieve accurate task allocation and hold the merits of DP. Finally, we verify the feasibility by some experiments based on two data sets. The performance is compared with that of &lt;inline-formula xmlns:mml=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt; &lt;tex-math notation=&quot;LaTeX&quot;&gt;$t$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; he typical DP.

  abstract     = {In the Internet of Vehicles (IoVs), task offloading is necessary to ensure the low-response delay due to the limitation of vehicular computational capacity. Task offloading involving social behavior can improve the utilization of computational resources in IoVs. To offload tasks effectively, the connected vehicles (CVs) need to upload context information, such as speed and location to road side unit (RSU) and base station (BS), which brings dramatic threat and risk for CVs’ privacy security. To solve the above-mentioned issue, we propose a privacy-preserving vehicular edge computing (PP-VEC) system architecture in this article. In the PP-VEC, the vehicular tasks can be offloaded to RSUs and adjacent CVs with adequate computing resources. Privacy mechanism disturbs the context information of CVs based on differential privacy technology before uploading it to the BS for offloading decisions to protect the CVs’ privacy. This article adopts the local differential privacy algorithm based on histogram algorithm and proposes a K-neighbor joint optimization of task offloading and resource allocation algorithm (K-NJTA) to optimize the global delay of task execution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods by simulation experiments. The results demonstrate K-NJTA on task execution delay and our local differential privacy algorithm can protect CVs’ privacy while has less effect on the task offloading algorithm due to the context information distribution.},

  abstract     = {The Internet of things (IoT) has certainly become one of the hottest technology frameworks of the year. It is deep in many industries, affecting people’s lives in all directions. The rapid development of the IoT technology accelerates the process of the era of “Internet of everything” but also changes the role of terminal equipment at the edge of the network. It has changed from a single data user to a dual role of both producing and using data. And collaborative edge computing (CEC) has been born in time. CEC itself can not only solve the problem of computing and storage but also combines with the deep learning (DL) model to make full use of edge computing ability. However, as the core of DL, the robustness of neural network is often not high. In addition, edge devices of CEC are facing a highly dynamic environment, which can easily cause the edge network to be attacked by malicious devices. Therefore, user privacy protection and security issues for CEC deserve more attention. To avoid privacy leakage and security crisis of CEC in social IoT systems, a data protection method based on data disturbance method and adversarial training viewpoint is introduced in this article. Besides, a new adversarial sample generation method based on the firefly algorithm (FA) is proposed. This method reduces the time complexity of traditional by an order for magnitude compared with traditional generative adversarial network (GAN) generation. Since sentences, information on CEC in the IoT system is characterized by a large amount of data, strict confidentiality, and high-security requirements, and they are usually high-risk information on privacy leakage. The proposed method is conducted to the sentence similarity analysis model based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) in the CEC scene to test the feasibility of the method. Compared with the original CNN, the accuracy of the model using the confrontation training method is improved by 4.8%. At the same time, the security value of our model is 2.1% higher than that of the simple CNN model, and it has the best security performance among the four comparison models. Further experiments have demonstrated that the model performs better in its capacity of resisting disturbance and can effectively help multiple organizations to implement data usage and sentence information on the requirements of user privacy protection, data security, and government regulations.},

The real-time requirement of these mobile data has been accommodated well by fog computing in the past few years, mainly through offloading tasks to fog nodes in the vicinity. On the other hand, the user-privacy hidden in the Internet-of-Things (IoT) data has not been sufficiently considered in the presence of insecure fog nodes. It is risky to offload an entire mission-critical task to just one fog node or several fog nodes owned by the same service provider (SP), especially when the SP is marked with low-security credit and tends to collect data information of users for malicious use. To address this issue, we classify IoT user tasks based on their security requirements, divide them into different numbers of smaller fragments, and, finally, offload the segments of a task to multiple fog nodes owned by the same or various SPs according to their security requirements. The selected fog nodes will collaboratively serve the divided fragments to avoid the possible damage caused by the leak of sensitive data due to compromised fog nodes of malicious SPs. For this, we propose an integer linear programming (ILP) model and a dynamic programming algorithm to maximize the number of successfully served IoT data tasks with satisfactory security requirements while minimizing the end-to-end transmission delay. The numerical results show that the proposed ILP model and algorithm can significantly increase the successful provisioning ratio for tasks with high-security requirements.},

Deep learning applications are generally driven by a huge amount of training samples collected from the users’ participation, e.g., smartphones and watches. However, the users’ data privacy and security issues have been one of the main restrictions for a broader distribution of these applications. In order to preserve privacy while utilizing deep learning applications, federated learning becomes one of the most promising solutions, which gains growing attention from both academia and industry. It can provide high-quality model training by distributing the training tasks to individual users, relying on on-device local data. To this end, we model the users’ participation in social model training as a training service market. The market consists of model owners (MOs) as consumers (e.g., social applications) who purchase the training service and a large number of mobile device groups (MDGs) as service providers who contribute local data in federated learning. A two-layer hierarchical dynamic game is formulated to analyze the dynamics of this market. The service selection processes of MOs are modeled as a lower level evolutionary game, while the pricing strategies of MDGs are modeled as a higher level differential game. The uniqueness and stability of the equilibrium are analyzed theoretically and verified via extensive numerical evaluations.},

During the event, a large number of users participated in the discussion about GameStop and coordinated trading behavior on r/WSB to push the stock price higher. In this article, we investigate the characteristics of the collective behaviors and social dynamics from the evolutions of topological structure, discussed topics, and user sentiment polarity (SP) by constructing dynamic interaction networks, modeling the topic, and analyzing the user sentiment. We find that the topological structure of the interaction network evolves toward a more efficient direction, the discussed topics change more centralized, and the user sentiment tends to be more positive and divergent. And we reveal that part of GameStop’s stock price is explained by the social media activity, popularity of the dominant topic, topic cohesiveness, SP of users, and sentiment divergence between interacted users on r/WSB. Our work quantitatively characterizes the interaction networks and user behavior during the GameStop short squeeze and provides an example to analyze the event which synchronously evolves in the physical space and cyberspace. It not only contributes to the analysis of social system behavior and structure but also provides valuable insights into the financial practice and policy decision-making.},

The social relationship considers trust, reciprocity, incentives, and selfishness mechanisms.

  abstract     = {In the last two decades, object tracking has been one of the prevalent fields in social media. Object tracking uses a dynamic model to track the same target, aiming to analyze the same social object and its behavior in a set of consecutive video frames. In this article, we provide a comprehensive survey on some representative and latest correlation-filter-based object tracking methods and compare their respective strengths and weaknesses under the theoretical and experimental analyses. First of all, we divide these correlation-filter-based object tracking methods into four categories according to their characteristics, including categorized features, space weight factors, scale factors, and expert strategies. Second, extensive experiments on benchmark datasets with 11 tracking challenges are performed and discussed. Finally, this article also attempts to provide some insights for the readers to comprehend and improve the involved tracking algorithms. It is expected that the overview would present a detailed framework and some enlightenments of object tracking to readers who are new in this area.},

  abstract     = {Effective attribution of ransomware attacks requires a way to characterize different variants and estimates their similarity to one another. Unlike other malware, ransomware deliberately discloses itself and interacts explicitly with the victim. This characteristic invites the application of insights from social systems. The resulting behavioral trace offers a richer characterization than the simple code signatures used to detect other forms of malware, but is also more complex and harder to characterize. Exploiting this trace forensically requires a distance measure between pairs of attacks. In the Ransomware Analysis as Dialogue for Attribution and Reconnaissance (RADAR) project, we developed such a measure based on representation of the attack behavior in a context-free grammar. We motivate this approach by insights from behavioral linguistics, summarize the grammar we have developed, present a series of increasingly refined grammatical distance measures, and illustrate their performance on actual attacks. Then we suggest applications of our distance measure to other problems of social modeling.},
